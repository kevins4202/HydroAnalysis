10625,modeling crop water use as a useful decision tool for agricultural policy decision makers to improve water use efficiency has been increasing this study aimed to estimate forecast and model the green and blue water footprints wfg and wfb respectively of maize by using an artificial neural network ann three egyptian nile delta governorates were selected as major maize producing sites ad daqahliyah al gharbiyah and ash sharqiyah the monthly data of minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax precipitation p solar radiation sr soil moisture sm wind speed ws and vapor pressure deficit vpd data were obtained from open access data over the period from 2006 to 2016 the analyzed data were divided into two parts from 2006 to 2012 and from 2013 to 2016 for model training and testing respectively to predict wfb in the three governorates the results show that the models with sr humidity h and vpd tmean crop coefficient kc and h and sm ws vpd and kc were the best anns with different hidden layers 5 3 2 6 and 7 3 respectively furthermore the findings showed that the optimal ann for forecasting wfg included tmean ws and p p ws vpd and sr ws tmax and vpd with hidden neuron layers 7 3 7 5 and 8 5 respectively for the three locations the calculated wf values achieved a high statistical significant versus those simulated in the three sites with the lowest distributional variations and the accuracy and coefficients of determination were close to 1 moreover for model testing the findings indicated that the deviations between the actual and predicted wfs ranged from 2 6 to 6 63 and from 2 4 to 3 16 for the blue and green wfs respectively thus the developed models generated relatively better results and can help promote the decision making process for both water managers and development planners keywords ann models blue water footprint green water footprint limited meteorological data hidden layers 1 introduction accurate assessment of water use is a critical issue in a globally changing climate and environment where water is becoming a scarce but vital resource one of natural resources is agricultural activities that exploit and consume approximately 85 of all freshwater fao 2013 especially in arid and semiarid regions such as egypt proper estimation of crop water requirements is an urgent and important for water management challenges farg et al 2012 an indicator that relates production to the total consumption of water resources is the water footprint wf which was proposed by hoekstra 2008 green and blue wfs represent rainfall and agricultural water use respectively in general the wf makes it possible to determine the basic and secondary consumption of freshwater resources required for the production of a given product hoekstra 2008 a survey of the literature shows that various researchers have previously focused on assessing wfs at the national scale casella et al 2018 chukalla et al 2018 2015 zhuo et al 2016 naresh et al 2017 while few studies have focused on estimating wf at the field scale using crop simulation models such as crop water use model cwumodel hydrus 2d 3d saltmed decision support system for agrotechnology

model el gafy 2014 stirpat model jin et al 2016 furthermore other approaches were applied for assessing the components of wf such as path analysis and temporal spatial pattern li et al 2020

measurements xinchun et al 2018 found that the changes in precipitation did not affect the total wf but changed its composition huang et al 2015 demonstrated that reducing water volume by 33 3 compared to current practice did not cause a significant maize yield decline but water footprint were decreased by 23 9 qin et al 2016 found that the footprint of the moisture deficit was 40 7 of the green water footprint wang et al 2019 indicated that wf under sprinkler irrigation was 21 higher than that under micro irrigation system besides remote sensing technology was utilized according to madugundu et al 2018 who determined that due to the restricted number of satellite images on rainy days the landsat 8 based estimates were limited to only the blue wf color whereas tampouratzi et al 2015 found good result to assess green wf using modis 16 satellite comparing with empirical methodologies although these works produced more realistic results they consume much time cost and effort to estimate the values of the wf in view of the advantages of wfs research on the wf of crop yield has become an attractive area of research therefore we focused on how to model and estimate the accurate value of the maize wf with simple climate data few repetitions little effort and no cost in this work we used an artificial intelligence method ann as a rapid decision tool for modeling green and blue wfs with limited metrological data and evaluating their performance with reference data artificial intelligence algorithms are depicted by the beginning function which uses interconnected information processing units to convert the input into output by detecting relationships and patterns in data artificial neural networks anns are considered the best procedures for extracting information from imprecise and nonlinear data adisa et al 2019 the basic benefit of this type of network is that it does not require any arithmetical model since anns are trained from examples and recognize patterns in a series of independent and dependent data without any previous hypothesis about their natural distribution and interrelations moghaddam et al 2010 anns do not have the restrictions of the conventional approaches by obtaining the required information using the recorded data using the ann method in the system requires enough input and output data instead of a geometric equation akcayol and cinar 2005 this network is a superior alternative to the usual empirical paradigm that depends on linear and polynomial regression kose 2008 this method has been applied for many purposes e g

has a wealth of value because it can be used as a source of fructose corn oil and starch egypt imported an average of 4 821 200 tons per year of maize over the period from 2000 to 2013 which represents approximately 28 1 of the total value of imported plant products yassin et al 2015 this work aims to create an ann model as a rapid decision tool for modeling green and blue wfs under

and y is the crop yield 2 5 data analysis the datasets were analyzed using an artificial intelligence approach the ann is created from 3 types of layers as shown in fig 2 1 the input layer is the initial data for the neural network 2 the hidden layers are intermediate layers between the independent input and dependent output layers where all the computations are done and 3 the output layer produces the result for the given inputs the five circles are input layers are denoted by vector i the three circles are the hidden neuron layers these circles represent the activation nodes and are usually called the weights ws the final circle represents the output layer that shows the predicted value of the monthly crop coefficient the ann uses the multi layer perceptrons mlps as a supervised learning which uses a flexible function to train multiple layers to a particular data set kisi and demir 2016 a multilayer machine learning model has been executed by considering many hidden layers and rectifying the linear activation function the rectified linear activation function is a piecewise function that directly outputs the input directly if it is positive otherwise the value of the output equals zero it has become the default activation function and important for many types of neural networks because a model that uses it is easier to train and often achieves a better performance than models trained without it the input variables in this study are tmax tmin tmean p sr sm ws vpd kc and h the mathematical model is represented in the following equation where y is the value of the output i1 i2 i3 in represent the input variables w1 w2 wn represent the weights of the combination that generates the output θ is the unit step function w is the weight related to the ith input and μ is the mean 7 y θ j 1 n w i μ the generalized weight w is the contribution of the ith covariate to the log odds and is defined by the following equation 8 w log o x 1 o x x the analysis was performed using the neural net package in r both the dependent variable wf and independent variables were divided into training and testing datasets the training data used were from 2006 to 2012 64 of the datasets and the testing data were from 2013 to 2016 36 of the datasets the training data are the set of data from which the system learns and the testing data are used to validate the model s performance by comparing the predicted green and blue wf values with the actual values derived from fao cropwat and the agriculture directorates of production data for governorates to increase the accuracy of the neural network the different combinations of the input variables with several hidden neurons in each layer were applied with an automated loop to change the architecture for each governorate hence the best combination of variables for predicting the green and blue wfs and architecture for each governorate were selected according to the statistical analysis indicators these combinations for each location were compared with the testing data that were left out from the machine learning process the main steps of computer code of anns were defined as step 1 view location and

factors for modeling the blue water footprint there are two methods for selecting the best climate variables in anns for prediction of kc dimensionality reduction algorithm such as a principle component analysis pca that identify patterns in data based on the correlation between features select the best features of variables as inputs to anns the second approach depends on training and testing various variable combinations in the anns as followed in the study to arrive at the optimal combination with high accuracy performance and less error in this study we combined the various meteorological data as inputs into the ann through the top five layers to model the blue wf of maize first we combined the required parameters for modeling the reference evapotranspiration and the results showed that t h ws and sr data achieved good results compared to other combinations these results are in agreement with those from granata 2019 who used four machine learning algorithms with different climatic data including t h ws and sr data their findings declared the superior outcomes were provided by the following input variables sr sensible heat flux sm content ws h and tmean compared to the other models second we combined the parameters for predicting the maize crop production and demonstrate that the data fusion of t h and sr generated good outputs these results coincide with the observations of adisa et al 2019 who input the monthly data fusion of climatic factors into machine learning algorithms their results confirmed that differing data inputs for predicting the yield depend on regional conditions but data on the tmax tmin and sm were common variables in all the regions then we combined these parameters by adding the vpd and kc data to model the blue wf in each region the numbers of hidden layers were different due to the variations in the climate data among the three governorates the results showed that integration of sr h and vpd was the favorable ann for estimating the blue wf in the ad daqahliyah governorate this model had hidden neuron layers 5 3 and the determination coefficient between the actual and predicted values reached 0 995 with a high accuracy of 99 94 as shown in table 1 compared to the other integrations additionally this model achieved the lowest rmse of 1 063 m3 ton and nrmse of 6 902 in the al gharbiyah governorate the finding affirmed that data fusion of tmean kc and h at hidden layers 2 6 produced good output in estimating blue wf compared to other this model achieved the lowest rmse of 2 23 m3 ton nrmse of 10 592 the highest accuracy of 99 70 and coefficient of determination r2 0 99 compared to other architectures for the same region moreover from the data integration in ash sharqiyah the results illustrated that the optimal model for predicting the blue wf included the sm ws vpd and kc this model had hidden neuron layers 7 3 achieved a high accuracy of 99 75 an rmse of 2 417 m3 ton an nrmse of 10 875 and a correlation coefficient of 0 99 these findings were extremely an acceptable and agree with those suggested by xinchun et al 2018 who obtained a high linear relationship between rainfall and the blue wf r2 0 93 in addition the model outputs are highly satisfactory compared with the findings from madugundu et al 2018 who estimated the blue component of wf based on a remote sensing approach their results indicated a linear relationship between the actual and predicted values with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 82 additionally their observations revealed that the variations rmse ranged from 14 to 17 3 2 data fusion of the climatic factors for modeling the green water footprint various climatic datasets were combined as inputs into the ann through the four plans for modeling the green wf of maize the findings of the fusion demonstrated that the data incorporation of tmean ws and p was the most favorable ann for determining the green wf in ad daqahliyah governorate this developed model had hidden neuron layers 7 3 and the correlation coefficient between the actual and forecasted values reached 1 with a high accuracy of 100 as shown in table 2 compared to the other variable combinations additionally this model achieved the lowest values of the rmse of 0 0001 m3 ton and nrmse of 0 in the al gharbiyah governorate the research findings proved that the top synthetic model included p ws vpd and sr at hidden layers 7 5 as illustrated in table 2 this model achieved the lowest rmse of 0 003 m3 ton an nrmse of 0 001 an accuracy of 99 8 and r2 of 0 99 compared to the other structural designs for the same area additionally from the data incorporations in ash sharqiyah the results showed that the integration of ws tmax and vpd data are good for predicting the green wf compared to other this developed model had hidden neuron layers 8 5 with a high accuracy and correlation coefficient of 100 and 0 99 respectively as demonstrated in table 2 this model achieved the lowest rmse nrmse and high accuracy compared to the other structural designs these built models achieved an acceptable result than xinchun et al 2018 who determined the proportions of green wfs based on only precipitation data only with a determination coefficient of 0 79 3 3 structural network design of the superior models the results of training data from 2006 to 2012 are presented in fig 3 this figure shows the most favorable structure of the trained neural network for blue and green wfs for each governorate each network topology conveys basic information such as the trained synaptic weights several hidden neuron layers convergence steps and the overall errors for the studied area the threshold for the partial derivatives of the error function was set to 0 01 all the governorates had different combinations of inputs with a variable number of hidden neuron layers to estimate the blue wf in ad daqahliyah governorate the combinations of sr h and vpd using hidden neuron layers 5 3 with a 91965 step training process produced less error of 0 882 fig 3 a in addition to al gharbiyah tmean kc and h ranked first within this group at hidden neuron layers 2 6 and the training process required 99467 steps with an overall error of approximately 2 423 fig 3 b in case of ash sharqiyah governorate for the combinations of sm ws vpd and kc the training process required 75 122 steps at hidden layers 7 3 until all the absolute partial derivatives of the error function were smaller than the default threshold of 0 01 with the process having an overall error of approximately 2 675 see fig 3 c for the green wf the structural design of the ann at the combination of tmean ws and p at hidden layers 7 3 with training process 68 526 steps and an overall error of approximately 0 0004 was selected as the model for ad daqahliyah additionally in the al gharbiyah governorate the training process of the model with p ws vpd and sr fig 3 b required 7569 steps at hidden layers 7 5 and the model had an overall error of approximately 0 0007 furthermore for the ash sharqiyah governorate the training process needed 31 776 steps for the model with ws tmax and vpd at hidden layers 8 5 until all the absolute partial derivatives of the error function were smaller than the default threshold of 0 01 and the process had an overall error of approximately 0 3 4 predicting and validating blue and green water footprints after training the neural networks with the seven years from 2006 to 2012 of both the meteorological dataset and dependent variable wf and selecting the best model with hidden neuron layers the prediction of wf for each governorate was performed for the same time onto the testing data 2013 2016 the predicted values of the wfs were then compared with the reserved data the tested years that were not executed for machine learning model the results for each governorate are presented in table 3 the correlation coefficient varies for each location the selected models for predicting the monthly wfb achieved a high coefficient of determination close to 1 for all governorates from the data analysis for ad daqahliyah the results showed the highest predicted wfb was 0 023 2 3 in 2013 and the lowest difference in the expected wfb was 0 026 2 6 in 2014 additionally the lowest and highest differences in al gharbiyah were 0 0124 1 24 in 2015 and 0 0037 0 37 in 2016 respectively moreover in ash sharqiyah the lowest and highest variations were 0 0040 0 4 in 2015 and 0 0663 6 63 in 2013 respectively the developed blue wf models gave good results with 2 6 and 6 63 as the lowest and highest deviations respectively between actual forecasted values these models generated more favorable outcomes compared with outcomes of kersebaum et al 2016 who found that the deviations of forecasted wf between the seven crop models ranged from 15 to 49 additionally these results were compared with garofalo et al 2019 who used four crop models for modeling the wf in two regions their results found that the deviations in wf values varied from 5 to 23 lower on average than the actual data on the other hand the selected developed models for predicting the wfg attained a

highest deviation in the predicted wfg was in 2013 of 0 0066 0 66 additionally the lowest and highest deviations for al gharbiyah were 0 0204 2 04 in 2016 and 0 0316 3 16 in 2013 respectively moreover in ash sharqiyah the lowest and highest variations were 0 0001 0 01 in 2016 and 0 0001 0 01 in 2013 respectively from the aforementioned analysis of the green wf this study declared that the lowest and highest deviations between actual and predicted values for the selected developed models ranged from 2 4 3 16 moreover this model finding was similar to those revealed by karandish and šimůnek 2019 who clarified that the outcome differences in the hydrus model for observed simulated maize wf values were 0 3 3 2 lower than those obtained by the saltmed model these newly created large scale models can be applied in similar climate governorates such as kafr el sheikh dumyat al minufiyah al iskandariyah al buhayrah bur said al ismailiyah and qalibiyah which are surrounding regions in the same country our recommendations for this simple technique can also be applied at the global agricultural field scale and for other economic crops as a rapid decision tool to simulate crop water use and achieve water saving strategies 4 conclusions this research assesses the value of artificial intelligence method for estimating and modeling the maize wf for both colors green and blue based on limited climatic data in three major maize producing governorates in egypt the meteorological data were obtained from remote sensing images over 2006 2016 and were divided into two segments with seven years for training models and four for validation training climatic data were combined as independent variables to a synthetic network ann for estimating the dependent variable wf the study observations showed that the change in climate parameters affected the wf values from may to october for instance the optimal ann at ad dakahliyah site included sr h and vpd to simulate the blue wf at hidden layers 5 3 moreover tmean ws and p were ranked first for modeling the green wf at hidden layers 7 3 in contrast in al gharbiyah the integration of tmean kc and h gave satisfactory result for predicting blue wf at hidden layers 2 6 compared to other likewise for green wf the good output was incorporation of p ws vpd and sr at hidden layers 7 5 furthermore for estimating the blue wf in ash sharqiyah the optimal intelligence model was the combination of sm ws vpd and kc while for the green wf was ws tmax and vpd the hidden layers were 7 3 and 8 5 respectively these developed models generated good result in estimating wf through the training and testing years with high coefficients of determination and less deviation in the three locations in conclusion the present study revealed that the performance of the developed ann models was highly acceptable therefore this study is essential as an important step in supporting agricultural water management strategies for crop water yield modeling our recommendations can be used in similar areas as a rapid technique for the simulation of wfs using limited metrological data in the future the proposed model can be applied to other economic crops such as rice and wheat for modeling different water resource uses to achieve sustainable agricultural water management conflict of interest and authorship confirmation form all authors

deficit vpd data were obtained from open access data over the period from 2006 to 2016 the analyzed data were divided into two parts from 2006 to 2012 and from 2013 to 2016 for model training and testing respectively to predict wfb in the three governorates the results show that the models with sr humidity h and vpd tmean crop coefficient kc and h and sm ws vpd and kc were the best anns with

measurements xinchun et al 2018 found that the changes in precipitation did not affect the total wf but changed its composition huang et al 2015 demonstrated that reducing water volume by 33 3 compared to current practice did not cause a significant maize yield decline but water footprint were decreased by 23 9 qin et al 2016 found that the footprint of the moisture deficit was 40 7 of the green water footprint wang et al 2019 indicated that wf under sprinkler irrigation was 21 higher than that under micro irrigation system besides remote sensing technology was utilized according to madugundu et al 2018 who determined that due to the restricted number of satellite images on rainy days the landsat 8 based estimates were limited to only the blue wf color whereas tampouratzi et al 2015 found good result to assess green wf using modis 16 satellite comparing with empirical methodologies although these works produced more realistic results they consume much time cost and effort to estimate the values of the wf in view of the advantages of wfs research on the wf of crop yield has become an attractive area of research therefore we focused on how to model and estimate the accurate value of the maize wf with simple climate data few repetitions little effort and no cost in this work we used an artificial intelligence method ann as a rapid decision tool for modeling green and blue wfs with limited metrological data and evaluating their performance with reference data artificial intelligence algorithms are depicted by the beginning function which uses interconnected information processing units to convert the input into output by detecting relationships and patterns in data artificial neural networks anns are considered the best procedures for extracting information from imprecise and nonlinear data adisa et al 2019 the basic benefit of this type of network is that it does not require any arithmetical model since anns are trained from examples and recognize patterns in a series of independent and dependent data without any previous hypothesis about their natural distribution and interrelations moghaddam et al 2010 anns do not have the restrictions of the conventional approaches by obtaining the required information using the recorded data using the ann method in the system requires enough input and output data instead of a geometric equation akcayol

has a wealth of value because it can be used as a source of fructose corn oil and starch egypt imported an average of 4 821 200 tons per year of maize over the period from 2000 to 2013 which represents approximately 28 1 of the total value of imported plant products yassin et al 2015 this work aims to create an ann model as a rapid decision tool for modeling green and blue wfs under

and y is the crop yield 2 5 data analysis the datasets were analyzed using an artificial intelligence approach the ann is created from 3 types of layers as shown in fig 2 1 the input layer is the initial data for the neural network 2 the hidden layers are intermediate layers between the independent input and dependent output layers where all the computations are done and 3 the output layer produces the result for the given inputs the five circles are input layers are denoted by vector i the three circles are the hidden neuron layers these circles represent the activation nodes and are usually called the weights ws the final circle represents the output layer that shows the predicted value of the monthly crop coefficient the ann uses the multi layer perceptrons mlps as a supervised learning which uses a flexible function to train multiple layers to a particular data set kisi and demir 2016 a multilayer machine learning model has been executed by considering many hidden layers and rectifying the linear activation function the rectified linear activation function is a piecewise function that directly outputs the input directly if it is positive otherwise the value of the output equals zero it has become the default activation function and important for many types of neural networks because a model that uses it is easier to train and often achieves a better performance than models trained without it the input variables in this study are tmax tmin tmean p sr sm ws vpd kc and h the mathematical model is represented in the following equation where y is the value of the output i1 i2 i3 in represent the input variables w1 w2 wn represent the weights of the combination that generates the output θ is the unit step function w is the weight related to the ith input and μ is the mean 7 y θ j 1 n w i μ the generalized weight w is the contribution of the ith covariate to the log odds and is defined by the following equation 8 w log o x 1 o x x the analysis was performed using the neural net package in r both the dependent variable wf and independent variables were divided into training and testing datasets the training data used were from 2006 to 2012 64 of the datasets and the testing data were from 2013 to 2016 36 of the datasets the training data are the set of data from which the system learns and the testing data are used to validate the model s performance by comparing the predicted green and blue wf values with the actual values derived from fao cropwat and the agriculture directorates of production data for governorates to increase the accuracy of the neural network the different combinations of the input variables with several hidden neurons in each layer were applied with an automated loop to change the architecture for each governorate hence the best combination of variables for predicting the green and blue wfs and architecture for each governorate were selected according to the statistical analysis indicators these combinations for each location were compared with the testing data that were left out from the machine learning process the main steps of computer code of anns were defined as step 1 view location and

factors for modeling the blue water footprint there are two methods for selecting the best climate variables in anns for prediction of kc dimensionality reduction algorithm such as a principle component analysis pca that identify patterns in data based on the correlation between features select the best features of variables as inputs to anns the second approach depends on training and testing various variable combinations in the anns as followed in the study to arrive at the optimal combination with high accuracy performance and less error in this study we combined the various meteorological data as inputs into the ann through the top five layers to model the blue wf of maize first we combined the required parameters for modeling the reference evapotranspiration and the results showed that t h ws and sr data achieved good results compared to other combinations these results are in agreement with those from granata 2019 who used four machine learning algorithms with different climatic data including t h ws and sr data their findings declared the superior outcomes were provided by the following input variables sr sensible heat flux sm content ws h and tmean compared to the other models second we combined the parameters for predicting the maize crop production and demonstrate that the data fusion of t h and sr generated good outputs these results coincide with the observations of adisa et al 2019 who input the monthly data fusion of climatic factors into machine learning algorithms their results confirmed that differing data inputs for predicting the yield depend on regional conditions but data on the tmax tmin and sm were common variables in all the regions then we combined these parameters by adding the vpd and kc data to model the blue wf in each region the numbers of hidden layers were different due to the variations in the climate data among the three governorates the results showed that integration of sr h and vpd was the favorable ann for estimating the blue wf in the ad daqahliyah governorate this model had hidden neuron layers 5 3 and the determination coefficient between the actual and predicted values reached 0 995 with a high accuracy of 99 94 as shown in table 1 compared to the other integrations additionally this model achieved the lowest rmse of 1 063 m3 ton and nrmse of 6 902 in the al gharbiyah governorate the finding affirmed that data fusion of tmean kc and h at hidden layers 2 6 produced good output in estimating blue wf compared to other this model achieved the lowest rmse of 2 23 m3 ton nrmse of 10 592 the highest accuracy of 99 70 and coefficient of determination r2 0 99 compared to other architectures for the same region moreover from the data integration in ash sharqiyah the results illustrated that the optimal model for predicting the blue wf included the sm ws vpd and kc this model had hidden neuron layers 7 3 achieved a high accuracy of 99 75 an rmse of 2 417 m3 ton an nrmse of 10 875 and a correlation coefficient of 0 99 these findings were extremely an acceptable and agree with those suggested by xinchun et al 2018 who obtained a high linear relationship between rainfall and the blue wf r2 0 93 in addition the model outputs are highly satisfactory compared with the findings from madugundu et al 2018 who estimated the blue component of wf based on a remote sensing approach their results indicated a linear relationship between the actual and predicted values with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 82 additionally their observations revealed that the variations rmse ranged from 14 to 17 3 2 data fusion of the climatic factors for modeling the green water footprint various climatic datasets were combined as inputs into the ann through the four plans for modeling the green wf of maize the findings of the fusion demonstrated that the data incorporation of tmean ws and p was the most favorable ann for determining the green wf in ad daqahliyah governorate this developed model had hidden neuron layers 7 3 and the correlation coefficient between the actual and forecasted values reached 1 with a high accuracy of 100 as shown in table 2 compared to the other variable combinations additionally this model achieved the lowest values of the rmse of 0 0001 m3 ton and nrmse of 0 in the al gharbiyah governorate the research findings proved that the top synthetic model included p ws vpd and sr at hidden layers 7 5 as illustrated in table 2 this model achieved the lowest rmse of 0 003 m3 ton an nrmse of 0 001 an accuracy of 99 8 and r2 of 0 99 compared to the other structural designs for the same area additionally from the data incorporations in ash sharqiyah the results showed that the integration of ws tmax and vpd data are good for predicting the green wf compared to other this developed model had hidden neuron layers 8 5 with a high accuracy and correlation coefficient of 100 and 0 99 respectively as demonstrated in table 2 this model achieved the lowest rmse nrmse and high accuracy compared to the other structural designs these built models achieved an acceptable result than xinchun et al 2018 who determined the proportions of green wfs based on only precipitation data only with a determination coefficient of 0 79 3 3 structural network design of the superior models the results of training data from 2006 to 2012 are presented in fig 3 this figure shows the most favorable structure of the trained neural network for blue and green wfs for each governorate each network topology conveys basic information such as the trained synaptic weights several hidden neuron layers convergence steps and the overall errors for the studied area the threshold for the partial derivatives of the error function was set to 0 01 all the governorates had different combinations of inputs with a variable number of hidden neuron layers to estimate the blue wf in ad daqahliyah governorate the combinations of sr h and vpd using hidden neuron layers 5 3 with a 91965 step training process produced less error of 0 882 fig 3 a in addition to al gharbiyah tmean kc and h ranked first within this group at hidden neuron layers 2 6 and the training process required 99467 steps with an overall error of approximately 2 423 fig 3 b in case of ash sharqiyah governorate for the combinations of sm ws vpd and kc the training process required 75 122 steps at hidden layers 7 3 until all the absolute partial derivatives of the error function were smaller than the default threshold of 0 01 with the process having an overall error of approximately 2 675 see fig 3 c for the green wf the structural design of the ann at the combination of tmean ws and p at hidden layers 7 3 with training process 68 526 steps and an overall error of approximately 0 0004 was selected as the model for ad daqahliyah additionally in the al gharbiyah governorate the training process of the model with p ws vpd and sr fig 3 b required 7569 steps at hidden layers 7 5 and the model had an overall error of approximately 0 0007 furthermore for the ash sharqiyah governorate the training process needed 31 776 steps for the model with ws tmax and vpd at hidden layers 8 5 until all the absolute partial derivatives of the error function were smaller than the default threshold of 0 01 and the process had an overall error of approximately 0 3 4 predicting and validating blue and green water footprints after training the neural networks with the seven years from 2006 to 2012 of both the meteorological dataset and dependent variable wf and selecting the best model with hidden neuron layers the prediction of wf for each governorate was performed for the same time onto the testing data 2013 2016 the predicted values of the wfs were then compared with the reserved data the tested years that were not executed for machine learning model the results for each governorate are presented in table 3 the correlation coefficient varies for each location the selected models for predicting the monthly wfb achieved a high coefficient of determination close to 1 for all governorates from the data analysis for ad daqahliyah the results showed the highest predicted wfb was 0 023 2 3 in 2013 and the lowest difference in the expected wfb was 0 026 2 6 in 2014 additionally the lowest and highest differences in al gharbiyah were 0 0124 1 24 in 2015 and 0 0037 0 37 in 2016 respectively moreover in ash sharqiyah the lowest and highest variations were 0 0040 0 4 in 2015 and 0 0663 6 63 in 2013 respectively the developed blue wf models gave good results with 2 6 and 6 63 as the lowest and highest deviations respectively between actual forecasted values these models generated more favorable outcomes compared with outcomes of kersebaum et al 2016 who found that the deviations of forecasted wf between the seven crop models ranged from 15 to 49 additionally these results were compared with garofalo et al 2019 who used four crop models for modeling the wf in two regions their results found that the deviations in wf values varied from 5 to 23 lower on average than the actual data on the other hand the selected developed models for predicting the wfg attained a high coefficient of determination close to 1 for all the governorates table 4 for the data analysis for ad daqahliyah the results from 2016 showed the lowest predicted wfg of 0 0061 0 61 and the highest deviation in the predicted wfg was in 2013 of 0 0066 0 66 additionally the lowest and highest deviations for al gharbiyah were 0 0204 2 04 in 2016 and 0 0316 3 16 in 2013 respectively moreover in ash sharqiyah the lowest and highest variations were 0 0001 0 01 in 2016 and 0 0001 0 01 in 2013 respectively from the aforementioned analysis of the green wf this study declared that the lowest and highest deviations between actual and predicted values for the selected developed models ranged from 2 4 3 16 moreover this model finding was similar to those revealed by karandish and šimůnek 2019 who clarified that the outcome differences in the hydrus model for observed simulated maize wf values were 0 3 3 2 lower than those obtained by the saltmed model these newly created large scale models can be applied in similar climate governorates such as kafr el sheikh dumyat al minufiyah al iskandariyah al buhayrah bur said al ismailiyah and qalibiyah which are surrounding regions in the same country our recommendations for this simple technique can also be applied at the global agricultural field scale and for other economic crops as a rapid decision tool to simulate crop water use and achieve water saving strategies 4 conclusions this research assesses the value of artificial intelligence method for estimating and modeling the maize wf for both colors green and blue based on limited climatic data in three major maize producing governorates in egypt the meteorological data were obtained from remote sensing images over 2006 2016 and were divided into two segments with seven years for training models and four for validation training climatic data were combined as independent variables to a synthetic network ann for estimating the dependent variable wf the study observations showed that the change in climate parameters affected the wf values from may to october for instance the optimal ann at ad dakahliyah site included sr h and vpd to simulate the blue wf at hidden layers 5 3 moreover tmean ws and p were ranked first for modeling the green wf at hidden layers 7 3 in contrast in al gharbiyah the integration of tmean kc and h gave satisfactory result for predicting blue wf at hidden layers 2 6 compared to other likewise for green wf the good output was incorporation of p ws vpd and sr at hidden layers 7 5 furthermore for estimating the blue wf in ash sharqiyah the optimal intelligence model was the combination of sm ws vpd and kc while for the green wf was ws tmax and vpd the hidden layers were 7 3 and 8 5 respectively these developed models generated good result in estimating wf through the training and testing years with high coefficients of determination and less deviation in the three locations in conclusion the present study revealed that the performance of the developed ann models was highly acceptable therefore this study is essential as an important step in supporting agricultural water management strategies for crop water yield modeling our recommendations can be used in similar areas as a rapid technique for the simulation of wfs using limited metrological data in the future the proposed model can be applied to other economic crops such as rice and wheat for modeling different water resource uses to achieve sustainable agricultural water management conflict of interest and authorship confirmation form all authors

10626,information of crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient kc is essential for improving water use and optimizing irrigation scheduling here a three year 2015 2016 and 2019 experiment was conducted for tomato grown in a solar greenhouse under full and deficit drip irrigation to investigate the variation of etc measured by sap flow system plus micro lysimeter in 2015 and by weighing lysimeter in 2016 and 2019 the controlling meteorological factors on etc in two irrigation treatments were analyzed by using path analysis method a single crop coefficient model considering leaf senescence soil water stress and fraction of canopy cover was proposed under two irrigation levels the results showed that total seasonal etc over the whole growth stage under full irrigation was 310 350 mm which was 16 23 higher than that under deficit irrigation the maximum hourly etc rate in each month during the three years experiment varied from 0 15 to 0 89 and from 0 15 to 1 88 mm h 1 respectively under deficit and full irrigation path analysis showed that the net radiation was the dominant meteorological factor aﬀ ecting etc through the direct eﬀ ect followed by the vapor pressure deficit mainly through an indirect action on etc the kc values at different growth stages estimated by the proposed single crop coefficient model under full and deficit irrigation agreed well with the measured ones and the water stress coefficient ks under deficit irrigation varied from 0 5 to 1 0 the proposed single crop coefficient model also estimate daily etc of drip irrigated tomato reasonably

crop coefficient soil water stress coefficient 1 introduction solar greenhouse also known as warm shed is an energy saving structure without extra heating system composed of gables on both sides back wall support framework and covering materials it is a unique structure type and widely used in northern china according to the statistical results of chinese society for horticultural science cshs the total area of greenhouses in 2018 was 1 89 million ha of which solar greenhouses accounted for 31 http cshs scimall org cn in the solar greenhouse counter season vegetable production is mostly adopted by farmers due to suitable growth condition provided conserving the scarce water resources and high economic benefits therefore seeking the highest yield and quality as well as improving water use are the main objectives of greenhouse production chen et al 2013 2015 tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill a nutrient rich vegetable crop is widely planted in the yellow river basin of north china due to favorable soil texture and sunlight conditions in this area spring tomato accounted for more than 90 of the total planting area in the greenhouse the irrigation scheduling was generally based on the experience of farmers and irrigation amount varied greatly among different farmers unreasonable irrigation scheduling not only reduces water use efficiency but also causes soil secondary salinization xia et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore how to optimize irrigation water management strategies is an effective way to maintain long term greenhouse development crop evapotranspiration etc is a key variable for optimization of irrigation water productivity and designing irrigation scheduling in agriculture water management kool et al 2014 especially in a greenhouse where water supply is mainly through irrigation in this case the variations of etc are highly influenced by irrigation water supply especially under different irrigation levels yamane et al 2011 hooshmand et al 2019 many studies indicated that the tomato etc was reduced due to a reduction in irrigation water amount in greenhouse kirda et al 2004 topcu et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 tomato etc under full irrigation at each growth stage was always higher than that under deficit irrigation in a solar greenhouse with drip irrigation chen et al 2013 in addition the variation of microclimatic conditions e g solar radiation rs air temperature ta relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd and wind speed u 2 can also affect the etc due to a semi closed environment in greenhouses chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 gong et al 2019 generally a higher rs will lead to a larger water consumption the variation of rs can not only induce leaf stomata opening and closing but also influence the variation of ta and rh around the crop hence rs is the main meteorological factor affecting etc alberto et al 2014 the vpd reflects the difficulty of leaf water entering the atmosphere to a certain extent which is also a major meteorological factor aﬀ ecting etc wang et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 2016 alberto et al 2014 gong et al 2017a qiu et al 2019 however the influence of u 2 on crop etc was small due to the lower u 2 inside the solar greenhouse with natural ventilation gong et al 2017a chen et al 2013 also reported that the higher rs and ta will increase the tomato etc in greenhouse when the plants are flourishing the path analysis method was often used to assess which meteorological factors is the dominant controlling factor affecting etc zhang et al 2016 gong et al 2017a qiu et al 2019 this method clarifies the direct and indirect effects from independent to dependent variables and can decompose the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect interaction coefficients on the basis of correlation and regression analysis to reveal the relative importance of various factors to the dependent variable seker and serin 2004 ssango et al 2004 for instance zhang et al 2016 indicated that the influence of net radiation rn on summer maize etc was the largest followed by vpd and the indirect effect of ta through vpd and rn was high similar results were also reported by qiu et al 2019 in the rice wheat rotation system however the influence of meteorological factors on etc under different irrigation water conditions may be different and former studies mainly focused on a single irrigation level to our best of knowledge little literature focuses on the direct and indirect influence of meteorological factors on the etc by using the path analysis method for tomato grown in a solar greenhouse with different drip irrigation treatments generally the etc can be obtained by instrument based etc measurement or model based etc estimation soil water balance method liu et al 2013 qiu et al 2011 chen et al 2013 2015 micro lysimeter plus sap flow system zhang et al 2014 gong et al 2017b 2019 and weighing lysimeter fernández et al 2010 liu and luo 2010 gong et al 2019 were often used in the greenhouse to measure the variation of etc however measuring etc directly is difficult and costly comparing with model based etc estimation in the greenhouse the single source penman monteith pm equation qiu et al 2011 2013 gong et al 2017b yan et al 2019 dual source shuttle wallance model gong et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and crop coefficient method razmi and ghaemi 2011 qiu et al 2015 gong et al 2019 were widely used for estimation of etc among them the crop coefficient method especially single crop coefficient method is the simplest structure and the etc can be determined by the product of reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 the eto represents the evaporating power of clipped grass or alfalfa with optimal water management of a reference surface and it can be computed from meteorological data fernández et al 2010 2011 demonstrated that the eto can be calculated using the fao56 pm model with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 due to low u 2 in greenhouse which was widely adopted in many studies e g qiu et al 2013 gong et al 2017b 2019 the kc is basically the ratio of etc to eto and reflects the comprehensive influence of crop physiology between reference surface and actual crop at different growth stages allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 ding et al 2014 the kc is affected not only by crop characteristics e g leaf area index crop height and leaf physiological properties but also by field management strategies e g irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 2005 the kc will reduce when the effective soil water in the root zone drops below a threshold value razmi and ghaemi 2011 yamane et al 2011 pico n toro et al 2012 which is reflected by the water stress coefficient ks in the model allen et al 1998 however fewer studies were attempted to investigate the kc under different drip irrigation amount in a solar greenhouse moreover the accuracy of the single crop coefficient method in estimating etc needs to be assessed under different irrigation treatments in greenhouse condition here the tomato etc under full and deficit drip irrigation in a solar greenhouse in the yellow river basin of northern china was measured by using the sap flow system combined with micro lysimeter and weighing lysimeter for three years a single crop coefficient model considering the effects of leaf senescence soil water stress and fraction of canopy cover on the kc was proposed the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the variation of etc under full and deficit irrigation and its main controlling meteorological factors in a solar greenhouse 2 to determine the kc and ks of greenhouse grown tomato 3 to assess the performance of the proposed single crop coefficient model on estimation of etc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site and measurements the experiment was conducted for three years i e 2015 2016 and 2019 in a solar greenhouse at

initial stage of tomato the interior ta and rh during daytime were manually controlled by a ventilation system a leading local variety of tomato c v jinding was used in this study the planting pattern for tomato seedlings was wide narrow row with the width of 0 65 and 0 45 m respectively two rows of tomato seedlings were transplanted along the edge of each wide row on march 10 2015 march 9 2016 and march 10 2019 respectively with a planting density of 5 7 plants m 2 a drip irrigation system was employed to supply water and fertilizer for tomato plants just after transplanting 20 mm water was supplied to keep tomato seedlings alive after that period the irrigation scheduling was referred to the cumulative evaporation epan measured by an evaporation pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m in depth which was placed 20 cm above the plant canopy the evaporation was measured at 7 00am every day after measurement the evaporation pan was cleaned and refilled with fresh water to 20 mm every day irrigation was performed when the epan reached 20 2 mm the irrigation amount was 0 5 epan and 0 9 epan respectively for deficit and full irrigation treatments three replications were implemented for each treatment with a randomized complete block design our former study indicated that the plants did not suffer from water stress when the irrigation amount of 0 9 epan was adopted for each

all the data were collected by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa and 30 min averages were computed and stored the vpd was calculated referring to fao56 using the measurements of ta and rh allen et al 1998 the etc of deficit and full irrigation were measured simultaneously during the study period in 2015 the etc was determined by the soil water balance method qiu et al 2011 during transplanting and may 14 and by a system consisting of micro lysimeters plus sap flow after that period as described elsewhere gong et al 2019 in 2016 and 2019 the etc was measured by three weighing

using em50 data loggers decagon devices inc usa the measurements were calibrated by the oven drying method 105 c 8 h three replications were performed for each irrigation treatment six to ten tomato plants were selected for each replication to measure leaf length and maximum width at an interval of 7 10 days then leaf area was derived by summing rectangular area of each leaf leaf length maximum

plants per unit area the daily lai was obtained by interpolation using the matlab software mathworks inc ma usa the plant height was measured with a ruler every 7 10 days at the same time as measurement of leaf area the depth of roots was measured using a root auger and was collected every 10 cm in the soil profile until no roots were found two repetitions were conducted for each treatment 2 2 reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient as a result of low u 2 in greenhouse daily reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 was determined by fao56 penman monteith equation with

complex and there may be correlations between any two variables calculating a simple correlation coefficient between two variables often fails to explain the relationship between them path analysis method can decompose the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect interaction coefficients on the basis of correlation and regression analysis to reveal the relative importance of various factors to the dependent variable the calculated process supposes there are p independent variables x1 x2 xp and one dependent variable y we define the correlation coefficient between each independent variable as rij i 1 2 p j 1 2 p then a standardized normal equation for solving the path coefficients is constructed using a simple correlation between rij and y 14 r 11 ρ 1 r 12 ρ 2 r 1 p ρ p r 1 y r

during study periods in the 2015 2016 and 2019 seasons are presented in fig 2 generally there were similar microclimate conditions in greenhouse for three years daily ta changed from 10 5 to 41 1 5 8 to 40 1 and 8 2 to 39 5 c with mean values of 23 0 23 5 and 23 8 c respectively during study period in three years fig 2a1 a3 due to semi closed environment in greenhouse the rh was high while vpd was low the average values of rh during growth period were 74 9 77 1 and 74 0 while vpd were 0 76 0 64 and 0 75 kpa respectively for three years fig 2 a1 a3 and b1 b3 daily average u 2 was usually low inside the greenhouse varying from 0 05 to 0 50 m s 1 and the maximum instantaneous u 2 did not exceed 1 2 m s 1 fig 2 b1 b3 daily rn ranged from 1 4 14 9 0 3 15 1 and 0 2 12 0 mj m 2 d 1 respectively for the 2015 2016 and 2019 seasons based on the measured microclimate in greenhouse the calculated eto from eq 1 varied from 0 6 to 5 8 0 4 to 6 2 and 0 2 to 4 8 mm d 1 respectively during study periods in three years fig 2 c1 c3 3 2 variation of etc and its controlling meteorological factors 3 2 1 variation of etc under full and deficit irrigation the etc of greenhouse grown tomato under different irrigation treatments for three seasons are summarized in table 1 the total etc over the whole growth season was 265 and 337 mm respectively for deficit and full irrigation the mean daily etc at different growth stages ranged from 1 14 to 2 88 mm d 1 under deficit irrigation and varied from 1 15 to 4 21 mm d 1 under full irrigation clearly the total and mean daily etc under full irrigation was larger than that under deficit irrigation which may be attributed to the difference in irrigation amount and lai table 1 the total irrigation amount and mean lai under deficit irrigation were reduced by 41 4 and 22 4 respectively compared to full irrigation many studies also indicated that lai affect plant water requirement especially when canopy was not fully covered suleiman et al 2007 ding et al 2014 qiu et al 2017 hooshmand et al 2019 wang et al 2019 fig 3 shows the diurnal variation of etc under full and deficit irrigation in diﬀ erent months in the 2016 and 2019 seasons for both treatments the etc started to increase after sunrise and reached maximum value around noon 12 00 13 00 then decreased until sunset before april the differences of hourly etc rate between full and deficit irrigation were small then gradually increased and reached to maximum in june when the evaporation demand was high fig 2 the maximum hourly etc rate in each month changed from 0 15 to 0 89 mm h 1 for deficit irrigation and varied from 0 15 to 1 18 mm h 1 for full irrigation mainly depending on rn and vpd in these months qiu et al 2019 the lower hourly etc rate of deficit irrigation with respect to full irrigation was mainly due to available soil water in root zone not meet the requirement of plant transpiration yamane et al 2011 hooshmand et al 2019 3 2 2 main controlling meteorological factors of etc for two water treatments fig 4 shows the direct correlation coefficients between hourly etc of deficit and full irrigation and meteorological factors i e rn ta vpd and u2 and correlation coefficients among rn ta vpd and u 2 during study period the value of correlation coefficient between ta and vpd was highest with b0 of 0 91 followed by rn and ta rn and vpd with b0 of 0 76 and 0 73 respectively which were close to the results by qiu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2016 the correlation coefficient between etc and rn was highest under full irrigation while the correlation between etc and u 2 was the lowest with b0 only of 0 06 path analysis results between hourly etc and each meteorological factor under full and deficit irrigation are displayed in table 2 the order of correlation coefficients were rn vpd ta u2 for both treatments due to direct and indirect effects of each meteorological factor on etc the direct path coefficient of rn on etc was the largest followed by vpd and the influence of u 2 was the minimum the direct path coefficient of ta was negative and the effect of ta on etc was mainly through the indirect path of rn and vpd on etc total indirect path coefficients of ta vpd and u2 were higher than direct path coefficient therefore for both irrigation treatments the fluctuation of rn affects etc directly while the influence of ta vpd and u 2 on etc through indirect way these results were consistent with alberto et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and qiu et al 2019 the order of the decision coefficients indicate that the rn was a major decision factor determining etc while ta was a limiting factor for etc table 2 comparing the path analysis results of two irrigation treatments the direct path correlation of rn on etc under deficit irrigation was slightly higher than that under full irrigation indicating that rn has a greater direct effect on etc under deficit irrigation the rn and vpd may have a greater effect on etc under full irrigation than under deficit irrigation as indicated by the higher values of the decision coefficient for rn and vpd under full irrigation except for these meteorological factors the soil water stress in the root zone was also another important limiting factor affecting etc zhang et al 2014 3 3 performance of the proposed single crop coefficient model 3 3 1 prediction of crop coefficients fig 5 shows the variation of daily kc and ks in 2015 2016 and 2019 the fluctuation of kc was relatively stable during initial stage and started to increase at the beginning of development stage in the middle stage kc reached to a maximum value when plant coverage was near maximum in the late stage the kc began to decrease until it reached a low value at the end of the growing period the ks is mainly affected by the soil water storage in the root zone allen et al 1998 the plants under full irrigation did not experience the water stress while for deficit irrigation only one irrigation event was performed after transplanting hence the ks experienced a steep decrease with prolonged ks value lower than 0 6 at initial stage from development to middle stage the ks varied periodically increased just after irrigation and then decreased during the late stage the ks dropped to the lowest level with ks value of 0 5 which was attributed to the lower soil water storage in root zone the seasonal daily ks under deficit irrigation varied from 0 5 to 1 0 bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 showed that the reduction of ks may be attributed to the increase in water depletion in the root zone through the removal of water by etc after irrigation or rainfall the water in the root layer increased in turn alleviating water stress shi et al 2015 also indicated that the ks of greenhouse tomato decreased with the duration of deficit irrigation but it would increase after rehydration hanson and may 2006 pointed out that no deficit irrigation occurs for tomato with drip irrigation when the kc was above 1 08 at the mid season growth stage the adjusted kc values from fao56 table kc adj locally developed kc loc and estimated kc est at initial middle and late stages for two irrigation levels are presented in table 3 the kc adj was always lower than the kc recommend by fao56 kc fao in the three years especially in the middle stage which may be attributed to the higher rh and lower u 2 inside the solar greenhouse similar results were also reported by hanson and may 2006 qiu et al 2013 and gong et al 2019 the values of kc loc under deficit irrigation were also lower than the kc fao in middle and late stages in three years the average kc loc under deficit irrigation at middle and late stages were 0 84 and 0 63 respectively which were 27 0 and 21 3 lower than the kc fao 1 15 and 0 8 for full irrigation the average values of kc loc at three stages were consistently close to the kc fao especially in the middle stage the proposed single crop coefficient model was used to predict kc under two irrigation levels and a good agreement was found between kc est and kc loc in three growth stages both for deficit and full irrigation the kc est values at the middle stage under full irrigation were 1 07 1 02 and 1 09 respectively in 2015 2016 and 2019 a slightly low kc at middle stage comparing to kc adj may be attributed to the reduction of etc by setting the walkways qiu et al 2013 that the canopy did not fully cover the soil surface large discrepancy for kc at middle stage was also reported in literature for instance amayreh and al abed 2005 pointed out that tomato kc was 31 lower than the kc fao at middle stage in jordan the average kc of tomato at mid season under drip irrigation for three years varied from 0 99 to 1 08 hanson and may 2006 razmi and ghaemi 2011 reported that tomato kc was 1 0 at mid stage in a greenhouse for tomato with different planting densities under furrow irrigation in a solar greenhouse the kc at middle stage ranged from 0 77 to 0 97 qiu et al 2013 3 3 2 estimation of etc comparison of daily etc measured and estimated by the proposed single crop coefficient model under full and deficit irrigation in three year experiment is shown in fig 6 the goodness of fit statistical indicators between measurement and estimation of the proposed model is presented in table 4 results showed a good agreement between the measured and estimated daily etc under full and deficit irrigation in three year experiment the b0 were higher than 0 9 for both irrigation treatments the r 2 ranged from 0 78 to 0 90 for deficit irrigation and varied from 0 92 to 0 95 for full irrigation indicating that most of the total variance of the measured values can be explained by the proposed model in addition some residual estimation error indicators further illustrate the goodness of the proposed model mae can represent the magnitude of estimation errors which varied from 0 29 0 43 mm d 1 for deficit irrigation and ranged from 0 25 to 0 33 mm d 1 for full irrigation rsme expresses the variance of the errors it varied from 0 37 to 0 52 and from 0 35 to 0 46 mm d 1 under deficit and full irrigation respectively both the modeling efficiency ef and index of agreement dl were close to 1 all of these indicators show that the performance of the proposed single crop coefficient model is acceptable under different irrigation levels generally the variability of etc can be well described by the proposed single crop coefficient model both for full and deficit irrigation fig 6 a1 c1 however some measurement points deviated from the estimated line which may be attributed to some uncertainty of etc measured by weighing lysimeter the drift of the measured etc may often happen after irrigation e g doy 137 and 168 172 in 2016 many studies also indicated that the measurement error of lysimeter was mainly due to the isolation of lateral soil water movement rana and katerji 2000 ding et al 2013 marek et al 2014 anapalli et al 2016 in addition there was a slight discrepancy between measured and estimated etc at the initial stage fig 6 b1 b3 c1 c3 which may be attributed to the underestimation of the eto in this study the pm equation with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 was used our previous study reported that the aerodynamic resistance in a solar greenhouse in north china may be higher than 295 s m 1 which in turn overestimated the eto gong et al 2017b 4 conclusions in this study a three year experiment was conducted to quantify etc and to investigate the main controlling meteorological factors on etc under full and deficit irrigation a proposed single crop coefficient model was employed to estimate etc of tomato grown in a solar greenhouse in northern china the results indicated that seasonal etc was 260 270 mm and 310 350 mm in deficit and full irrigation respectively path analysis results showed that rn was the major meteorological factor aﬀ ecting tomato etc through the direct eﬀ ect followed by vpd mainly through an indirect eﬀ ect the influence of rn and vpd on etc was greater under full irrigation than under deficit irrigation water stress is another limiting factor of etc under deficit irrigation the kc loc and kc est under full irrigation were consistently close to the kc fao for deficit irrigation the kc loc and kc est values were lower than kc fao with the difference of 27 and 28 in the middle stage 21 and 23 in the late stage respectively the proposed single crop coefficient model could estimate etc reasonably both for deficit and full irrigation

conducted for tomato grown in a solar greenhouse under full and deficit drip irrigation to investigate the variation of etc measured by sap flow system plus micro lysimeter in 2015 and by weighing lysimeter in 2016 and 2019 the controlling meteorological factors on etc in two irrigation treatments were analyzed by using path analysis method a single crop coefficient model considering leaf senescence soil water stress and fraction of canopy cover was proposed under two irrigation levels the results showed that total seasonal etc over the whole growth stage under full irrigation was 310 350 mm which was 16 23 higher than that under deficit irrigation the maximum hourly etc rate in each month during the three years experiment varied from 0 15 to 0 89 and from 0 15 to 1 88 mm h 1 respectively under deficit and full irrigation path analysis showed that the net radiation was the dominant meteorological factor aﬀ ecting etc through the direct eﬀ ect followed by the vapor pressure deficit mainly through an indirect action on etc the kc values at different growth stages estimated by the proposed single crop coefficient model under full and deficit irrigation agreed well with the measured ones and the water stress coefficient ks under deficit irrigation varied from 0 5 to 1 0 the proposed single crop coefficient model also estimate daily etc of drip irrigated tomato reasonably

wall support framework and covering materials it is a unique structure type and widely used in northern china according to the statistical results of chinese society for horticultural science cshs the total area of greenhouses in 2018 was 1 89 million ha of which solar greenhouses accounted for 31 http cshs scimall org cn in the solar greenhouse counter season vegetable production is mostly adopted by farmers due to suitable growth condition provided conserving the scarce water resources and high economic benefits therefore seeking the highest yield and quality as well as improving water use are the main objectives of greenhouse production chen et al 2013 2015 tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill a nutrient rich vegetable crop is widely planted in the yellow river basin of north china due to favorable soil texture and sunlight conditions in this area spring tomato accounted for more than 90 of the total planting area in the greenhouse the irrigation scheduling was generally based on the experience of farmers and irrigation amount varied greatly among different farmers unreasonable irrigation scheduling not only reduces water use efficiency but also causes soil secondary salinization

variable for optimization of irrigation water productivity and designing irrigation scheduling in agriculture water management kool et al 2014 especially in a greenhouse where water supply is mainly through irrigation in this case the variations of etc are highly influenced by irrigation water supply especially under different irrigation levels yamane et al 2011 hooshmand et al 2019 many studies

greenhouses chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 gong et al 2019 generally a higher rs will lead to a larger water consumption the variation of rs can not only induce leaf stomata opening and closing but also influence the variation of ta and rh around the crop hence rs is the main meteorological factor affecting etc alberto et al 2014 the vpd reflects the difficulty of leaf water entering the atmosphere to a certain extent which is also a major meteorological factor aﬀ ecting etc wang et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 2016 alberto et al 2014 gong et al 2017a qiu et al 2019 however the influence of u 2 on crop etc was small due to the lower u 2 inside the solar greenhouse with natural ventilation gong et al 2017a chen et al 2013 also reported that the higher rs and ta will increase the tomato etc in greenhouse when the plants are flourishing the path analysis method was often used to assess which meteorological factors is the dominant controlling factor affecting etc zhang et al 2016 gong et al 2017a qiu et al 2019 this method clarifies the direct and indirect effects from independent to dependent variables and can decompose the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect interaction coefficients on the basis of correlation and regression analysis to reveal the relative importance of various factors to the dependent variable seker and serin 2004 ssango et al 2004 for instance zhang et al 2016 indicated that the influence of net radiation rn on summer maize etc was the largest followed by vpd and the indirect effect of ta through vpd and rn was high similar results were also reported by qiu et al 2019 in the rice wheat rotation system however the influence of meteorological factors on etc under different irrigation water conditions may be different and former studies mainly focused on a single irrigation level to our best of knowledge little literature focuses on the direct and indirect influence of meteorological factors on the etc by using the path analysis method for tomato grown in a solar greenhouse with different drip irrigation treatments generally the etc can be obtained by instrument based etc measurement or model based etc estimation soil water balance method liu et al 2013 qiu et al 2011 chen et al 2013 2015 micro lysimeter plus sap flow system zhang et al 2014 gong et al 2017b 2019 and weighing lysimeter fernández et al 2010 liu and luo 2010 gong et al 2019 were often used in the greenhouse to measure the variation of etc however measuring etc directly is difficult and costly comparing with model based etc estimation in the greenhouse the single source penman monteith pm equation qiu et al 2011 2013 gong et al 2017b yan et al 2019 dual source shuttle wallance model gong et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and crop coefficient method razmi and ghaemi 2011 qiu et al 2015 gong et al 2019 were widely used for estimation of etc among them the crop coefficient method especially single crop coefficient method is the simplest structure and the etc can be determined by the product of reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 the eto represents the evaporating power of clipped grass or alfalfa with optimal water management of a reference surface and it can be computed from meteorological data fernández et al 2010 2011 demonstrated that the eto can be calculated using the fao56 pm model with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 due to low u 2 in greenhouse which was widely adopted in many studies e g qiu et al 2013 gong et al 2017b 2019 the kc is basically the ratio of etc to eto and reflects the comprehensive influence of crop physiology between reference surface and actual crop at different growth stages allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 ding et al 2014 the kc is affected not only by crop characteristics e g leaf area index crop height and leaf physiological properties but also by field management strategies e g irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 2005 the kc will reduce when the effective soil water in the root zone drops below a threshold value razmi and ghaemi 2011 yamane et al 2011 pico n toro et al 2012 which is reflected by the water stress coefficient ks in the model allen et al 1998 however fewer studies were attempted to investigate the kc under different drip irrigation amount in a solar greenhouse moreover the accuracy of the single crop coefficient method in estimating etc needs to be assessed under different irrigation treatments in greenhouse condition here the tomato etc under full and deficit drip irrigation in a solar greenhouse in the yellow river basin of northern china was measured by using the sap flow system combined with micro lysimeter and weighing lysimeter for three years a single crop coefficient model considering the effects of leaf senescence soil water stress and fraction of canopy cover on the kc was proposed the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the variation of etc under full and deficit irrigation and its main controlling meteorological factors in a solar greenhouse 2 to determine the kc and ks of greenhouse grown tomato 3 to assess the performance of the proposed single crop coefficient model on estimation of etc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site and measurements the experiment was conducted for three years i e 2015 2016 and 2019 in a solar greenhouse at

initial stage of tomato the interior ta and rh during daytime were manually controlled by a ventilation system a leading local variety of tomato c v jinding was used in this study the planting pattern for tomato seedlings was wide narrow row with the width of 0 65 and 0 45 m respectively two rows of tomato seedlings were transplanted along the edge of each wide row on march 10 2015 march 9 2016 and march 10 2019 respectively with a planting density of 5 7 plants m 2 a drip irrigation system was employed to supply water and fertilizer for tomato plants just after transplanting 20 mm water was supplied to keep tomato seedlings alive after that period the irrigation scheduling was referred to the cumulative evaporation epan measured by an evaporation pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m in depth which was placed 20 cm above the plant canopy the evaporation was measured at 7 00am every day after measurement the evaporation pan was cleaned and refilled with fresh water to 20 mm every day irrigation was performed when the epan reached 20 2 mm the irrigation amount was 0 5 epan and 0 9 epan respectively for deficit and full irrigation treatments three replications were implemented for each treatment with a randomized complete block design our former study indicated that the plants did not suffer from water stress when the irrigation amount of 0 9 epan was adopted for each irrigation event liu et al 2013 the detailed irrigation amounts for two treatments in the three years are summarized in table 1 during the experiment other management practices e g pollination fertilization and pest control for all treatments were kept the same the microclimate condition was continuously monitored using an automatic weather station located in the center of the solar greenhouse the rn was measured by a radiometer nr lite2 kipp zonen delft netherlands at 2 m height above the ground the ta and rh were measured by an integrated temperature humidity sensor cs215 campbell scientific inc usa at 2 m height above the ground and the u 2 was also continuously monitored by high precision air velocity meter accuracy of 0 02 m s 1 wind sonic gill uk at the same height all the data were collected by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa and 30 min averages were computed and stored the vpd was calculated referring to fao56 using the measurements of ta and rh allen et al 1998 the etc of deficit and full irrigation were measured simultaneously during the study period in 2015 the etc was determined by the soil water balance method qiu et al 2011 during transplanting and may 14 and by a system consisting of micro lysimeters plus sap flow after that period as described elsewhere gong et al 2019 in 2016 and 2019 the etc was measured by three weighing lysimeters located in the solar greenhouse with the specification of 1 2 m3 1 0 m in length 1 0 m in width 1 2 m in depth the soil texture of weighing lysimeters at the depth of 1 2 m was the same as the surrounding field six tomato seedlings were transplanted in each lysimeter with the same planting pattern as outside these plants were supported by bamboo poles to avoid lodging the data of etc at 30 min interval was collected and stored by a microcomputer to assess the consistency of etc measured by different methods i e micro lysimeter plus sap flow system etsm soil water balance etwb and weighing lysimeter etwl the measured values of etc by these methods were compared as shown in fig 1 the regression function between etsm and etwl was etsm 1 07 etwl r2 0 93 n 80 with mean absolute

results indicate etc measured by soil water balance and micro lysimeter plus sap flow system are acceptable volumetric soil water contents at 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm soil depth were continuously monitored using ech2o sensors 5te decagon devices inc usa these sensors were distributed along the line 15 cm from the drippers impron et al 2008 and collected soil water content data every 30 min using em50 data loggers decagon devices inc usa the measurements were calibrated by the oven drying method 105 c 8 h three replications were performed for each irrigation treatment six to ten tomato plants were selected for each replication to measure leaf length and maximum width at an interval of 7 10 days then leaf area was derived by summing rectangular area of each leaf leaf length maximum width multiplied by a reduction coefficient 0 64 which was obtained by fitting the measured values to that drawn using cad software leaf area index lai is defined as the green leaf area of tomato plants per unit area the daily lai was obtained by interpolation using the matlab software mathworks inc ma usa the plant height was measured with a ruler every 7 10 days at the same time as measurement of leaf area the depth of roots was measured using a root auger and was collected every 10 cm in the soil profile until no roots were found two repetitions were conducted for each treatment 2 2 reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient as a result of low u 2 in greenhouse daily reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 was determined by fao56 penman monteith equation with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 as described elsewhere fernández et al 2010 2011 qiu et al 2013 gong et al 2017b 2019 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 628 v p d t a 273 δ 1 24 γ where g is the soil

crop coefficient kc loc is defined as the ratio of measured etc to eto for each stage 2 k c l o c e t c e t o in fao56 the etc can be estimated by multiplying the eto by the crop coefficient kc the kc for a given crop will vary over the growing period due to difference in etc at different growth stages based on ground coverage the growth stage can be divided into four distinct growth stages i e initial development middle and late stages however kc should vary with environmental condition and requires adjustment at middle and late stages the adjustment equation is as follows 3 k c a d j k c t

complex and there may be correlations between any two variables calculating a simple correlation coefficient between two variables often fails to explain the relationship between them path analysis method can decompose the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect interaction coefficients on the basis of correlation and regression analysis to reveal the relative importance of various factors to the dependent variable the calculated process supposes there are p independent variables x1 x2 xp and one dependent variable y we define the correlation coefficient between each independent variable as rij i 1 2 p j 1 2 p then a standardized normal equation for solving the path coefficients is constructed using a simple correlation between rij and y 14 r 11 ρ 1 r 12 ρ 2 r 1 p ρ p r 1 y r

1 rosa et al 2012 fandino et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions in the solar greenhouse daily variations of meteorological factors in the solar greenhouse during study periods in the 2015 2016 and 2019 seasons are presented in fig 2 generally there were similar microclimate conditions in greenhouse for three years daily ta changed from 10 5 to 41 1 5 8 to 40 1 and 8 2 to 39 5 c with mean values of 23 0 23 5 and 23 8 c respectively during study period in three years fig 2a1 a3 due to semi closed environment in greenhouse the rh was high while vpd was low the average values of rh during growth period were 74 9 77 1 and 74 0 while vpd were 0 76 0 64 and 0 75 kpa respectively for three years fig 2 a1 a3 and b1 b3 daily average u 2 was usually low inside the greenhouse varying from 0 05 to 0 50 m s 1 and the maximum instantaneous u 2 did not exceed 1 2 m s 1 fig 2 b1 b3 daily rn ranged from 1 4 14 9 0 3 15 1 and 0 2 12 0 mj m 2 d 1 respectively for the 2015 2016 and 2019 seasons based on the measured microclimate in greenhouse the calculated eto from eq 1 varied from 0 6 to 5 8 0 4 to 6 2 and 0 2 to 4 8 mm d 1 respectively during study periods in three years fig 2 c1 c3 3 2 variation of etc and its controlling meteorological factors 3 2 1 variation of etc under full and deficit irrigation the etc of greenhouse grown tomato under different irrigation treatments for three seasons are summarized in table 1 the total etc over the whole growth season was 265 and 337 mm respectively for deficit and full irrigation the mean daily etc at different growth stages ranged from 1 14 to 2 88 mm d 1 under deficit irrigation and varied from 1 15 to 4 21 mm d 1 under full irrigation clearly the total and mean daily etc under full irrigation was larger than that under deficit irrigation which may be attributed to the difference in irrigation amount and lai table 1 the total irrigation amount and mean lai under deficit irrigation were reduced by 41 4 and 22 4 respectively compared to full irrigation many studies also indicated that lai affect plant water requirement especially when canopy was not fully covered suleiman et al 2007 ding et al 2014 qiu et al 2017 hooshmand et al 2019 wang et al 2019 fig 3 shows the diurnal variation of etc under full and deficit irrigation in diﬀ erent months in the 2016 and 2019 seasons for both treatments the etc started to increase after sunrise and reached maximum value around noon 12 00 13 00 then decreased until sunset before april the differences of hourly etc rate between full and deficit irrigation were small then gradually increased and reached to maximum in june when the evaporation demand was high fig 2 the maximum hourly etc rate in each month changed from 0 15 to 0 89 mm h 1 for deficit irrigation and varied from 0 15 to 1 18 mm h 1 for full irrigation mainly depending on rn and vpd in these months qiu et al 2019 the lower hourly etc rate of deficit irrigation with respect to full irrigation was mainly due to available soil water in root zone not meet the requirement of plant transpiration yamane et al 2011 hooshmand et al 2019 3 2 2 main controlling meteorological factors of etc for two water treatments fig 4 shows the direct correlation coefficients between hourly etc of deficit and full irrigation and meteorological factors i e rn ta vpd and u2 and correlation coefficients among rn ta vpd and u 2 during study period the value of correlation coefficient between ta and vpd was highest with b0 of 0 91 followed by rn and ta rn and vpd with b0 of 0 76 and 0 73 respectively which were close to the results by qiu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2016 the correlation coefficient between etc and rn was highest under full irrigation while the correlation between etc and u 2 was the lowest with b0 only of 0 06 path analysis results between hourly etc and each meteorological factor under full and deficit irrigation are displayed in table 2 the order of correlation coefficients were rn vpd ta u2 for both treatments due to direct and indirect effects of each meteorological factor on etc the direct path coefficient of rn on etc was the largest followed by vpd and the influence of u 2 was the minimum the direct path coefficient of ta was negative and the effect of ta on etc was mainly through the indirect path of rn and vpd on etc total indirect path coefficients of ta vpd and u2 were higher than direct path coefficient therefore for both irrigation treatments the fluctuation of rn affects etc directly while the influence of ta vpd and u 2 on etc through indirect way these results were consistent with alberto et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and qiu et al 2019 the order of the decision coefficients indicate that the rn was a major decision factor determining etc while ta was a limiting factor for etc table 2 comparing the path analysis results of two irrigation treatments the direct path correlation of rn on etc under deficit irrigation was slightly higher than that under full irrigation indicating that rn has a greater direct effect on etc under deficit irrigation the rn and vpd may have a greater effect on etc under full irrigation than under deficit irrigation as indicated by the higher values of the decision coefficient for rn and vpd under full irrigation except for these meteorological factors the soil water stress in the root zone was also another important limiting factor affecting etc zhang et al 2014 3 3 performance of the proposed single crop coefficient model 3 3 1 prediction of crop coefficients fig 5 shows the variation of daily kc and ks in 2015 2016 and 2019 the fluctuation of kc was relatively stable during initial stage and started to increase at the beginning of development stage in the middle stage kc reached to a maximum value when plant coverage was near maximum in the late stage the kc began to decrease until it reached a low value at the end of the growing period the ks is mainly affected by the soil water storage in the root zone allen et al 1998 the plants under full irrigation did not experience the water stress while for deficit irrigation only one irrigation event was performed after transplanting hence the ks experienced a steep decrease with prolonged ks value lower than 0 6 at initial stage from development to middle stage the ks varied periodically increased just after irrigation and then decreased during the late stage the ks dropped to the lowest level with ks value of 0 5 which was attributed to the lower soil water storage in root zone the seasonal daily ks under deficit irrigation varied from 0 5 to 1 0 bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 showed that the reduction of ks may be attributed to the increase in water depletion in the root zone through the removal of water by etc after irrigation or rainfall the water in the root layer increased in turn alleviating water stress shi et al 2015 also indicated that the ks of greenhouse tomato decreased with the duration of deficit irrigation but it would increase after rehydration hanson and may 2006 pointed out that no deficit irrigation occurs for tomato with drip irrigation when the kc was above 1 08 at the mid season growth stage the adjusted kc values from fao56 table kc adj locally developed kc loc and estimated kc est at initial middle and late stages for two irrigation levels are presented in table 3 the kc adj was always lower than the kc recommend by fao56 kc fao in the three years especially in the middle stage which may be attributed to the higher rh and lower u 2 inside the solar greenhouse similar results were also reported by hanson and may 2006 qiu et al 2013 and gong et al 2019 the values of kc loc under deficit irrigation were also lower than the kc fao in middle and late stages in three years the average kc loc under deficit irrigation at middle and late stages were 0 84 and 0 63 respectively which were 27 0 and 21 3 lower than the kc fao 1 15 and 0 8 for full irrigation the average values of kc loc at three stages were consistently close to the kc fao especially in the middle stage the proposed single crop coefficient model was used to predict kc under two irrigation levels and a good agreement was found between kc est and kc loc in three growth stages both for deficit and full irrigation the kc est values at the middle stage under full irrigation were 1 07 1 02 and 1 09 respectively in 2015 2016 and 2019 a slightly low kc at middle stage comparing to kc adj may be attributed to the reduction of etc by setting the walkways qiu et al 2013 that the canopy did not fully cover the soil surface large discrepancy for kc at middle stage was also reported in literature for instance amayreh and al abed 2005 pointed out that tomato kc was 31 lower than the kc fao at middle stage in jordan the average kc of tomato at mid season under drip irrigation for three years varied from 0 99 to 1 08 hanson and may 2006 razmi and ghaemi 2011 reported that tomato kc was 1 0 at mid stage in a greenhouse for tomato with different planting densities under furrow irrigation in a solar greenhouse the kc at middle stage ranged from 0 77 to 0 97 qiu et al 2013 3 3 2 estimation of etc comparison of daily etc measured and estimated by the proposed single crop coefficient model under full and deficit irrigation in three year experiment is shown in fig 6 the goodness of fit statistical indicators between measurement and estimation of the proposed model is presented in table 4 results showed a good agreement between the measured and estimated daily etc under full and deficit irrigation in three year experiment the b0 were higher than 0 9 for both irrigation treatments the r 2 ranged from 0 78 to 0 90 for deficit irrigation and varied from 0 92 to 0 95 for full irrigation indicating that most of the total variance of the measured values can be explained by the proposed model in addition some residual estimation error indicators further illustrate the goodness of the proposed model mae can represent the magnitude of estimation errors which varied from 0 29 0 43 mm d 1 for deficit irrigation and ranged from 0 25 to 0 33 mm d 1 for full irrigation rsme expresses the variance of the errors it varied from 0 37 to 0 52 and from 0 35 to 0 46 mm d 1 under deficit and full irrigation respectively both the modeling efficiency ef and index of agreement dl were close to 1 all of these indicators show that the performance of the proposed single crop coefficient model is acceptable under different irrigation levels generally the variability of etc can be well described by the proposed single crop coefficient model both for full and deficit irrigation fig 6 a1 c1 however some measurement points deviated from the estimated line which may be attributed to some uncertainty of etc measured by weighing lysimeter the drift of the measured etc may often happen after irrigation e g doy 137 and 168 172 in 2016 many studies also indicated that the measurement error of lysimeter was mainly due to the isolation of lateral soil water movement rana and katerji 2000 ding et al 2013 marek et al 2014 anapalli et al 2016 in addition there was a slight discrepancy between measured and estimated etc at the initial stage fig 6 b1 b3 c1 c3 which may be attributed to the underestimation of the eto in this study the pm equation with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 was used our previous study reported that the aerodynamic resistance in a solar greenhouse in north china may be higher than 295 s m 1 which in turn overestimated the eto gong et al 2017b 4 conclusions in this study a three year experiment was conducted to quantify etc and to investigate the main controlling meteorological factors on etc under full and deficit irrigation a proposed single crop coefficient model was employed to estimate etc of tomato grown in a solar greenhouse in northern china the results indicated that seasonal etc was 260 270 mm and 310 350 mm in deficit and full irrigation respectively path analysis results showed that rn was the major meteorological factor aﬀ ecting tomato etc through the direct eﬀ ect followed by vpd mainly through an indirect eﬀ ect the influence of rn and vpd on etc was greater under full irrigation than under deficit irrigation water stress is another limiting factor of etc under deficit irrigation the kc loc and kc est under full irrigation were consistently close to the kc fao for deficit irrigation the kc loc and kc est values were lower than kc fao with the difference of 27 and 28 in the middle stage 21 and 23 in the late stage respectively the proposed single crop coefficient model could estimate etc reasonably both for deficit and full irrigation treatments these results are valuable and can be used to optimize the irrigation scheduling for drip irrigated tomato cultivated in solar greenhouses declaration of competing interest the authors

10627,the microclimate under the drip and furrow irrigation systems inside a solar greenhouse located in the arid regions of northwestern china was evaluated during the two consecutive tomato growth cycles influence of soil hydrothermal conditions and the energy partitioning process were also analyzed the results showed that when adopting the same water management measures the irrigation amount evapotranspiration etc and soil water content within the planned wet layer of the drip irrigation were significantly lower than those of the furrow irrigation but the soil temperature showed an opposite trend the average air temperature t and vapor pressure deficit vpd for the drip irrigation were significantly higher than furrow irrigation during the whole experimental periods but relative humidity rh was relatively lower however there was no significant difference of the daily average total solar radiation and other radiation components between drip and furrow irrigation systems actually the distinct microclimate of each irrigation system was generated by the specific energy partitioning ratio of the underlying surface mainly due to the application of different irrigation amount higher leaf area index lai irrigation amount soil water content and lower vpd under furrow irrigation reduced the daily average sensible heat flux by 14 5 and 20 0 and reduced the solar radiation heating factor by 11 8 and 27 9 respectively for summer and winter cycle while daily average latent heat flux increased by 20 0 and 11 1 and the evaporation coefficient increased by 14 3 and 6 0 respectively for summer and winter cycle this paper showed that for the low cost and low technology solar greenhouse without an active environmental control system the reasonable water and vent opening management can be used to create a suitable environment for sustaining crop growth by regulating the partitioning and exchange of solar energy inside the greenhouse keywords irrigation method microclimate solar greenhouse soil hydrothermal energy partitioning 1 introduction improving crop productivity and producing high quality agricultural products are some of the important goals to ensure global food security under the climate change threats wheeler and von braun 2013 the solar greenhouse can provide appropriate growth conditions and ensure stable continuous production of crops and improve the quality rosales et al 2011 farneti et al 2013 the solar greenhouse can also decrease negative impacts of adverse external environments such as dramatically changes in temperature lighting or other extreme weather events including excessive or insufficient precipitation al mulla et al 2018 therefore use of solar greenhouses is increasing worldwide especially in the areas with uncertain climatic conditions or relatively scarce land and water resources shamshiri et al 2018 the internal environmental elements of solar greenhouse include microclimate conditions light temperature humidity co2 concentration soil conditions physical chemical and biological characteristics soil moisture and management conditions irrigation fertilization cultivation bisbis et al 2018 the growth yield and quality of crops in solar greenhouses depend largely on the internal microclimate conditions therefore a lot of research has been conducted to improve the orientation gupta and chandra 2002 sethi 2009 building structures vanthoor et al 2011 tong et al 2013 joudi and farhan 2015 enclosure structure materials berroug et al 2011 wang et al 2014 and shading of the solar greenhouse harmanto tantau and salokhe 2006 tanny 2013 ahemd et al 2016 as well as the management of crops grown indoor sethi et al 2013 leyva et al 2015 li et al 2017 the gradual establishment and improvement of various solar greenhouse microclimate simulation models also increased the understanding of the microclimate formation mechanisms of solar greenhouses all the effort mentioned above improved the solar greenhouse parameter design and microclimate management measures mashonjowa et al 2013 the solar greenhouse consists of a complex physical and biological system the growth and development of crops as well as the exchange of energy matter between the internal environment and crops profoundly affect the microclimate in the solar greenhouse the specific heat capacity of water is four times that of air and is often used to regulate or improve the microclimate of farmland near the surface liu and kang 2006a furthermore the plant water status can directly affect the growth development and biochemical processes of crops such as metabolism slatyer 1968 du et al 2015 and the interactions between plants and surrounding environment therefore irrigation can change the microclimate in the solar greenhouse by directly via soil hydrothermal conditions and indirectly via plants and their responses to environment effects of water dos santos et al 2007 cavero et al 2009 alberto et al 2009 the latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are key variables in the exchange process mentioned above and the knowledge of the energy partitioning within the greenhouse is critical in improving the irrigation management and microclimate wilson et al 2002 at present there are a large number of studies on the effects of irrigation methods on the near surface or crop canopy microclimate and energy partitioning of farmland however to the best of our knowledge these studies are mainly conducted in the open field for example the effects of fixed sprinkler irrigation systems on canopy microclimate water status and gas exchange of maize urrego pereira et al 2013 winter wheat liu and kang 2006b and alfalfa cavero et al 2016 some studies focus on the effects of different water layers depth on rice canopy microclimate stuerz et al 2014 or how irrigation strategies influence canopy microclimate and quality of grape fruit dos santos et al 2007 research about the effects of irrigation methods on microclimate or energy partitioning in solar greenhouses grown horticultural crops are relatively scarce qiu et al 2011 teitel 2017 among the studies on the energy partitioning in the protected agriculture the eddy covariance method ec standard technique for direct measurement of whole canopy latent heat in open fields has demonstrated its feasibility for pepper moller et al 2004 and banana dicken et al 2013a in the screenhouse but the expensive sensors the complexity of operating system and the high demand of the data analysis limit its availability at the farm level the penman monteith pm and bulk transfer bt models have been widely used for energy flux research in the greenhouse for more than a decade takakura et al 2009 morille et al 2013 but the accurate parameterization of canopy resistance rc restrict their application yan et al 2019 due to the uneven distribution of the underlying surface papadakis et al 1994 and the validity of the key assumption that eddy transfer coefficients of sensible heat and water vapor are equal may not be straightforward within the greenhouse environment dicken et al 2013b the applying of bowen ratio energy balance breb approach also has some restrictions however the breb method is much cheaper and simpler alternative technique to monitor the energy partitioning by measurement meteorological elements of underlying surfaces in the greenhouse this study evalauted the seasonal and daily variation of main microclimate factors including solar radiation air temperature t relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd inside the solar greenhouse under the traditional furrow irrigation and the optimized drip irrigation from the perspectives of soil hydrothermal status and partitioning of solar energy in the greenhouse the causes of the microclimate formation were analyzed the results of this paper can help readers deepen understanding how to create suitable microclimate conditions for crops grown in the greenhouse and guide the crops water management from the perspective of adjusting the microclimate inside the low cost and low technology greenhouses 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials the experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university from april 20 2017 to april 9 2018 the station is located in wuwei city gansu province china e 102 50 50 n 37 52 20 altitude 1580 m which is a typical continental temperate climate zone the experiment used an unheated naturally ventilated greenhouse 70 m long 8 5 m span and an effective planting area of 360 m2 with an east west orientation the greenhouse supported by steel beams and concrete columns was covered with a 0 4 mm thick single polyethene film pe on the top of the greenhouse roof a vent with a width of 0 5 m was always kept open during summer but only during daytime in winter in addition in order to prevent freeze damage in winter the greenhouse is covered with cotton curtain at night or during snowfall the ground surface was covered with a clear polyethylene film with a thickness of 0 05 mm to reduce soil evaporation and inhibit weed growth the main structural parameters of the greenhouse are shown in fig 1 the tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill planted in the greenhouse was jinpeng 11 a local leading variety summer cycle was from apr 20 2017 to aug 19 with a total growth period of 121 days and winter cycle was from nov 1 2017 to apr 9 2018 with a total growth period of 159 days tomato seedlings were planted in wide narrow row pattern 0 7 m and 0 5 m respectively with a plant spacing within rows of 0 5 m and density of 3 78 plants m2 both for drip and furrow irrigation treatments the drip tape beijing lvyuan plastic co ltd beijing china with emitter spacing of 0 4 m and wall thickness of 0 4 mm was placed against the main stem of tomato plants for each row in the drip irrigation system fig 2 the emitter flow rate at the operating pressure of 0 1 mpa was 1 38 l h in the furrow irrigation system two rows of tomatoes were planted on per ridge with 80 cm width while the furrow was 40 cm width with 25 cm depth fig 2 within the planned depth of wetted soil layer h 0 50 cm the soil inside the greenhouse was irrigated desert soil siltigic orthic anthrosols composed of 12 2 clay 60 3 silt and 27 5 sand the average soil dry bulk density were 1 56 and 1 58 g c m 3 for summer and winter experiment respectively and the field soil water capacity θ f were 0 27 and 0 26 c m 3 c m 3 respectively 2 2 experimental design summer experiment had two treatments drip irrigation under mulch di1 and furrow irrigation under mulch fi1 the aboveground part was partitioned by a polyvinyl chloride mulch and a sunscreen net meanwhile an anti seepage mulch with a depth of 0 8 m was laid underground to separate the greenhouse into two cabins with the equal area fig 3 a the water management of two treatments was shown in table 1 from 10 days after transplanting dat to the end of the experiment once average volumetric water content within the planned wetted soil layer decreased to around 75 2 of θ f plots were irrigated to the upper limit of 90 2 of θ f in each irrigation event the irrigation amount mm for both drip and furrow irrigation systems was calculated as 1 i 10 p θ 1 θ 2 h 0 where p is the designed soil wetting proportion taken as 0 5 and 1 0 for drip and furrow irrigation respectively h 0 is the planned depth of wetted soil layer equal to 50 cm θ 1 is the upper limit of irrigation c m 3 c m 3 i e 90 2 of θ f and θ 2 is the actual soil volumetric water content within planned wetted soil layer before irrigation c m 3 c m 3 as shown in fig 3b using the same materials and methods as the summer cycle the experimental area in the winter trial was divided into three equal parts for three treatments drip irrigation under mulch di2 and di0 and furrow irrigation under mulch fi2 the water management of treatment di2 and fi2 was consistent with that of treatment di1 and fi1 respectively table 1 as a control group the schedule and amount of the irrigation for the treatment di0 were completely the same as the treatment fi2 while the irrigation method was the same as the treatment di2 in each irrigation event the irrigation amount was calculated according to eq 1 fertilization and the agronomic measures such as topping de leafing de worming and weeding were the same for all treatments 2 3 experimental data besides the yield and leaf area index lai the main parameters determined in this experiment were volumetric soil water content and soil temperature within the 50 cm depth t rh and total solar radiation at different heights inside the greenhouse the monitoring probes were arranged on the section near the middle of each plot figs 1 3 data were collected every 5 s and averaged values were recorded every 15 min in an em50 data collector meter group inc wa usa 2 3 1 yield and lai of plant the tomato tested in this experiment was an indeterminate variety so the manual topping was performed to keep each plant with 6 fruit trusses in order to prevent the marginal effects when determining the yield and lai of tomato plants at least two rows of plants which grown adjacent to the east and west boundary of each plot were set as protective rows for the measurement of yield a total of 10 vigorous healthy and representative plants with basically the same growth situation was randomly selected within the central area of each plot for destructive determination the red mature fruits were harvested by hand in the same time among different treatments the number and fresh weight of fruits were measured from the truss ⅰ to truss ⅴ sequentially according to the order of fruit ripening the non commercial fruits with flaws such as cracking or blossom end rot ber were measured separately the total yield in each treatment was calculated based on the average yield of these plants planting density and area regarding the measurement of lai the tomato plant was divided into 5 growth stages firstly for each growth stage 3 vigorous healthy and representative tomato plants with basically the same growth situation were randomly selected within the central area of each plot for destructive sampling the total shoot area sa m2 was the sum of the area of all shoots which was calculated as the length multiplied by maximum width of each shoot and the total leaf area la m2 was obtained by adding up the area of all leaves from the same plant measured with an area meter am300 adc bioscientific ltd hoddesdon uk the data was pooled and a functional relationship between the sa and the la was established by linear regression analysis table 2 afterwards another 3 tomato plants were marked according to the procedures just mentioned in each treatment their sa was constantly monitored in situ using a steel tape according to the equations established before table 2 the la of plants was obtained finally the lai m2 m2 in each treatment can be calculated as the average la of these plants divided by the maximum projected area simplified as a circle with a diameter of 0 5 m for per plant 2 3 2 air temperature and relative humidity t and rh were measured using an atmos 14 probe meter group inc wa usa equipped with a radiation shield temperature range of 40 to 80 c resolution 0 1 c relative humidity range of 0 to 100 resolution 0 1 as shown in figs 1 and 3 two probes were installed in the middle section of each cabin at the vertical distance of 1 and 2 m from the ground according to the data of t and rh v p d kpa was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 2 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 r h 100 2 3 3 total solar radiation and net solar radiation total solar radiation r s was measured using a pyr probe meter group inc wa usa range of 01750 w m2 resolution 0 1 w m2 accuracy 5 as shown in figs 1 and 3 a probe was installed at the middle section of each cabin with a 3 m vertical distance from the ground net solar radiation r n above the tomato canopy was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 3 r n r n s r n l where r n s is net shortwave radiation m j m 2 r n l is net longwave radiation m j m 2 according to allen et al 1998 r n s was calculated after a little modification as follows 4 r n s 1 f c c r s 1 a p f c c r s 1 a s where r s is total solar radiation inside the greenhouse m j m 2 a s is albedo of tomato canopy taken as 0 25 karlberg et al 2006 a p is albedo of the ground surface under mulch taken as 0 3 al helal and abdel ghany 2011 bonachela et al 2012 and f c c is surface canopy coverage m 2 m 2 f c c was calculated as follows karlberg et al 2006 5 f c c p c m a x 1 e p c k l a i where p c m a x is maximum surface

vapor pressure kpa r s o is clear sky solar radiation m j m 2 the last two parameters can be calculated according to allen et al 1998 2 3 4 soil volumetric water content and temperature the volumetric soil water content and temperature were determined using the ech2o soil moisture monitoring system meter group inc wa usa water content range of 0 to 100 vwc resolution 0 08 vwc accuracy 3 vwc temperature range of 40 to 60 c resolution 0 1 c accuracy 1 c the sensors were arranged in the root zone of the tomato plant at the vertical depths of 10 20 40 60 80 cm from the surface the layout of sensors was shown in fig 2 data taken within the 50 cm depth were averaged prior to the analysis before the experiment the probes were calibrated based on the data obtained from soil samples using an oven drying method afterwards the calibrate procedures were been repeated before and after each irrigation event to verify the accuracy of the probes 2 3 5 crop actual evapotranspiration water balance equation was used to obtain actual crop evapotranspiration e t c mm as follows 7 e t c p i w d r δ s where p is precipitation mm equal to zero inside the greenhouse i is irrigation amount mm w is groundwater recharge mm d is deep drainage mm r is surface runoff mm δ s is the change in soil water storage mm the water table in this area is more than 25 m deep qiu et al 2011 so w can be ignored the ground surface in the greenhouse was almost flat and the irrigation amount and emitter flow rate under drip irrigation system for each time were small so r should equal to zero d can be negligible because the previous experiment by our team showed there was no deep drainage below the main root zone of tomato i e calculated depth of soil water storage h 1 80 cm and the maximum soil water content within the planned wetted soil layer was only around 90 of θf in summary eq 7 can be simplified as follows 8 e t c i δ s the irrigation amount of drip and furrow irrigation systems can be calculated according to eq 1 and δ s can be calculated as follows 9 δ s 10 θ t 1 θ t 2 h 1 where h 1 is calculated depth of soil water storage equal to 80 cm and θ t 1 and θ t 2 are the actual soil volumetric water content c m 3 c m 3 within the main root zone at the time t 1 and t 2 respectively 2 3 6 soil heat flux based on one dimensional soil thermal diffusion equation tde soil heat flux g w m 2 can be calculated from the temperature profile t s z i and soil water content as follows yang and wang 2008 10 g g z r e f 1 δ t z r e f z ρ s c s z i t δ t t s z i t δ t ρ s c s z i t t s z i t δ z where g z r e f is the heat flux at a reference depth z ref w m 2 δ t is time step s δ z is soil thickness of each layer m t s is the soil temperature at a certain time and soil depth k ρ s c s is the soil heat capacity at a certain time and soil depth j k g k can be calculated as follows 11 ρ s c s ρ d r y c d r y ρ w c w θ 12 ρ d r y c d r y 1 θ s a t 2 1 10 6 where ρ d r y c d r y is the heat capacity of dry soil j k g k ρ w c w is the heat capacity of liquid water j k g k θ s a t is the soil porosity c m 3 c m 3 θ is the soil volumetric water content c m 3 c m 3 if the reference position is deep enough then g z r e f can be assumed equal to zero because it is much less than surface soil heat flux when there is no plant in the greenhouse the g at the depth of 0 25 m under the mulched soil has no obvious diurnal variation and its average value is close to zero bonachela et al 2012 therefore after considering the impact of the crop it is reasonable to take the reference level equal to 0 8 m in this study 2 3 7 surface energy balance and bowen radio inside the greenhouse solar radiation is a key factor to determine the energy balance of the greenhouse considering the complexity of mass and heat transfer mechanism in the greenhouse a simplified greenhouse energy balance equation can be established based on some assumptions under steady state conditions xu et al 2017 li et al 2017 xu et al 2018 it is generally accepted that greenhouse covers steel frames and humid air do not absorb solar radiation while the thermal radiation between various parts of the greenhouse can be ignored takakura et al 2009 crop canopy is a semi permeable layer containing air and plants tissue the energy absorbed by it converts into latent heat flux or sensible heat flux released into the air finally while the stored energy can be ignored al helal and abdel ghany 2011 zhou et al 2012 part of the solar radiation received by the soil surface is released into the indoor air and other to the deep soil singh and tiwari 2000 therefore solar radiation absorbed by the underlying surface i e crop canopy and soil and the energy stored in the soil should be heat sources in the energy balance equation of the greenhouse li et al 2017 in this experiment the orientation structure size and materials of the north wall are the same in each cabin for a growing season hence there is no difference in the ability of the north wall to absorb store and release energy xu et al 2018 showed that the north wall can absorb 80 of the solar radiation while the soil and the envelope can release 10 of the absorbed solar energy impron et al 2007 by radiation and convection into the air ling et al 2015 consequently it can be concluded that the energy exchange between the north wall and the air in the greenhouse is mainly determined by solar radiation there is no significant difference in r s under different irrigation methods fig 8 and the energy exchange between the north wall and indoor air in each cabin can be assumed equal thus the impact of the north wall on the microclimate of each cabin is consistent and could be ignored in the analysis in summary the energy balance of the underlying surface of the greenhouse is a key factor affecting the formation of its microclimate the equation is as follows 13 r n λ e t h g where λ e t is the latent heat flux m j m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux m j m 2 assuming that the eddy transfer coefficients of sensible heat k h and water vapor k w are equal bowen 1926 proposed a method for calculating the λ e t called the breb method β is defined as the ratio of the h to the λ e t at a certain interface which is a function of the temperature gradient and the humidity gradient in the vertical direction 14 β h λ e t γ δ t δ e a where δ t is the temperature gradients between two high levels δ e a is the vapor pressure gradients between two high levels kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant allen et al 1998 therefore λ e t can be calculated as follows 15 λ e t r n g 1 β the accuracy of the calculation of λ e t by breb method relies largely on the accurate determination of β values gavilán and berengena 2007 and it was more reliable under the unstable atmospheric conditions that sensible heat flux was directed upwards during night time or sunrise and sunset the stable atmospheric condition normally makes the β value infinitely close to 1 prueger et al 1997 which will lead the decreases in the accuracy of the breb method according to the results of dicken et al 2013b we assumed that the breb method can be applied normally in a low cost and low technology solar greenhouse and then compared with the water balance method to verify its accuracy refer to the method proposed by perez et al 1999 and zhang et al 2008 the unreasonable data were discarded and then interpolated by linear interpolation 2 4 data processing and analysis all statistical analysis was performed by ibm spss statistics 20 0 ibm ny usa the one way anova duncan s new multiple range test was used to determine the impact of different treatments on the microclimate and other variables in the solar greenhouse afzalinia and zabihi 2014 the non normal data were appropriately transformed to meet the one way anova requirements the significance test level was p 0 05 the figures in this paper were drawn using originpro 9 1 originlab corporation ma usa 3 results 3 1 yield lai and surface canopy coverage of tomato in the summer cycle fig 4 a the total yield of treatment di1 was 123 0 t ha which was 12 27 lower than that of treatment f1 148 1 t ha but the difference was not significant p 0 143 meanwhile the commercial fruit yield 88 2 t ha and commodity rate 65 50 of drip irrigation system were slightly lower than those 100 5 t ha and 67 41 respectively of furrow irrigation system in the winter cycle fig 4b the total yield of treatment di2 and fi2 were 122 2 and 122 3 t ha respectively without significant differences p 0 986 similar to the summer cycle the commercial fruit yield 101 4 t ha and commodity rate 82 29 of drip irrigation system were slightly lower than those 107 5 t ha and 87 92 respectively of furrow irrigation system the total yield 111 0 t ha commercial fruit yield 91 0 t ha and commodity rate 81 05 of treatment di0 were the lowest among the winter experiment and compared with treatment di2 or fi2 there were no significant difference the dynamic changes of lai and surface canopy coverage with time were basically the same for different irrigation systems and due to the application of agronomic managements such as de leafing and topping during the tomato growth period the values of lai and surface canopy coverage decreased temporarily fig 5 the average lai during the whole experimental period of treatment di1 and di2 was 2 19 and 2 60 m3 m3 which was 12 94 and 7 16 less than that of treatment fi1 2 52 m3 m3 and fi2 2 80 m3 m3 respectively the average surface canopy coverage during the whole experimental period of treatment di1 and di2 was 0 59 and 0 66 m3 m3 which was decreased by 7 16 and 2 27 compared with the treatment fi1 0 63 m3 m3 and fi2 0 68 m3 m3 respectively the differences of these parameters between drip and furrow irrigation systems were not significant in the winter experiment the average lai and surface canopy coverage of treatment di0 during the whole growth period were 2 38 and 0 64 m3 m3 respectively which were not significantly different from those of treatment di2 and fi2 3 2 tomato evapotranspiration and soil hydrothermal conditions in the two consecutive experiments the water content within the planned wetted soil layer of each treatment fluctuated within the range of the experimental design fig 6 a the average volumetric soil water content during the whole growth period of the drip irrigation was 9 32 summer and 5 79 winter lower than that of furrow irrigation in each growth stage of tomato the irrigation amount irrigation times evapotranspiration etc and water consumption intensity of treatment di1 and di2 were all lower than those of treatment fi1 and fi2 respectively fig 7 during the whole experimental period in summer treatment di1 and fi1 were irrigated 16 and 13 times and the total irrigation amount was 228 55 and 275 44 mm respectively leading to a 17 03 reduction of irrigation amount in the drip irrigation system meanwhile the etc of treatment di1 and fi1 was 291 86 and 325 77 mm and the water consumption intensity was 2 43 and 2 71 mm d respectively resulting in a 10 41 reduction in the drip irrigation system in the winter experiment treatment di2 and fi2 were irrigated 12 and 10 times and the total irrigation amount was 124 93 and 178 45 mm respectively resulting in a reduction of 29 92 of the irrigation amount in the drip irrigation system the etc of treatment di2 and fi2 was 212 05 and 240 06 mm and the water consumption intensity was 1 33 and 1 51 mm d respectively leading to a 11 67 reduction in the drip irrigation system the total irrigation amounts 176 98 mm etc 242 36 mm and water consumption intensity 1 52 mm d of treatment di0 were basically the same as treatment fi2 but the volumetric soil water content was higher the soil temperature within the planned wetted soil layer under different irrigation systems had similar seasonal variation fig 6b in the summer experiment the soil temperature fluctuation increased with the average of 25 09 2 24 and 21 62 1 20 c for treatment di1 and fi1 respectively in the winter experiment they decreased first and then increased with the average of 19 09 3 10 and 17 62 2 79 c for treatment di2 and fi2 respectively the average soil temperature of drip irrigation was significantly p 0 001 higher than that of furrow irrigation for both experiments in addition the difference in soil temperature between the drip and furrow irrigation was large in summer experiment average 3 41 c compared with the winter experiment average 1 42 c the average soil temperature for treatment di0 18 51 3 04 c was significantly p 0 008 higher than that of treatment fi2 with the same irrigation regime 3 3 microclimate conditions in the greenhouse the microclimate factors in the greenhouse under different irrigation methods showed similar significant seasonal changes for summer table 3 and winter experiment table 4 respectively independently irrigation methods during the whole growth season the extreme value of t vpd and rh inside the greenhouse appeared in the same month respectively for example throughout the winter cycle the minimum value of t and vpd for each treatment both appeared in january and the maximum value in november the average t and vpd of drip irrigation i e treatment di1 and di2 were significantly higher than those of furrow irrigation i e treatment fi1 and fi2 corresponding also higher during the entire experimental period except for t in the early stage of winter cycle the average rh of different irrigation methods over the whole experimental period was opposite of t or vpd but there was no significant difference during the summer cycle in addition a significant difference in microclimate factors was detected between treatment di0 and di2 in almost all stages of the winter cycle however the difference of t and rh between treatment di0 and fi2 mainly appeared in the early stage november and december as for vpd the difference was not significant the total solar radiation r s inside the greenhouse of different irrigation systems were slightly different summer di1 15 32 5 55 fi1 15 89 5 70 p 0 504 winter di0 10 37 3 47 di2 10 1 3 79 fi2 10 1 3 57 p 0 791 unit mj m2 therefore r s received by each cabin was the same in summer or winter experiments respectively as shown in fig 8 the trend of seasonal change was basically the same for the r s inside average of different irrigation methods and outside the greenhouse and the correlation within them was good r2 0 99 but more solar radiation was lost during the incident progress in summer experiment the t rh and vpd inside the greenhouse under different irrigation systems were generally higher than the outdoor values and the difference in winter experiment was greater fig 9 the same meteorological elements inside and outside the greenhouse showed good correlation and the relationship during summer r2 0 82 0 97 was significantly stronger than that in the winter r2 0 21 0 56 indicating that the microclimate inside the greenhouse was mainly driven by the atmospheric climate and this effect was more pronounced in the summer experiment in order to eliminate the influence of the atmospheric climate on the microclimate inside the greenhouse the simultaneous irrigation events between different treatments were selected 12 and 8 times during the summer and winter cycle respectively the difference between indoor and outdoor meteorological factors within 24 h before and after the irrigation events were analyzed to evaluate the impact of individual irrigation event on the greenhouse microclimate table 5 the results showed that t and vpd for each treatment decreased significantly after the end of irrigation while rh did not exhibit significant difference before and after irrigation in the summer experiment only the difference δs of t and vpd varied significantly between drip and furrow irrigation however the difference δw significantly increased in t and decreased in vpd in the winter cycle 3 4 diurnal variation of microclimate in the greenhouse the diurnal variation of the microclimate factors in the greenhouse under different irrigation systems were basically the same for summer and winter cycle respectively fig 10 independently the irrigation methods t and vpd reached a maximum value around 14 00 and a minimum value around 7 00 during summer cycle comparing with the winter cycle the variation advanced around one hour for the trend of rh the diurnal variation was just the opposite t and vpd of drip irrigation i e treatment di1 and di2 were higher than those of furrow irrigation i e treatment fi1 and fi2 in the whole day corresponding and the difference mainly occurred during the daytime the rh under the different irrigation methods was opposite of t or vpd expect for the daytime in the summer cycle and the difference was bigger during the nighttime in terms of control set di0 t and vpd were generally lower than the other two treatments while the rh was generally between them the diurnal variation of meteorological factors inside and outside the greenhouse was basically the same and there were no significant differences during nighttime except for the air temperature and rh during the winter cycle the maximum values of air temperature rh and vpd outside the greenhouse were 75 91 92 62 and 63 13 of those inside the greenhouse average of different irrigation methods respectively in the summer experiment for the winter experiment the ratio were only 28 54 63 58 and 34 56 respectively 3 5 energy acquisition and partitioning in the greenhouse the cumulative water consumption of tomato during the whole growth period fig 11 estimated by the breb method eq 15 was well correlated with the results calculated by the water balance method eq 8 compared with the water balance method the results calculated by the berb were 11 and 12 lower for treatment di1 and fi1 in the summer respectively and 11 12 and 10 lower for treatment di0 di2 and fi2 in the winter respectively the energy acquisition and partitioning of the underlying surface under the different irrigation methods in the greenhouse were shown in table 6 the difference in the daily average r n above the canopy g other radiation components and the total available energy r n g between two irrigation methods were not significant compared with the drip irrigation the daily average h of the furrow irrigation was reduced by 14 5 summer and 20 0 winter respectively and the solar radiation heating factor defined as the ratio of h to r n was reduced by 11 8 summer and 27 9 winter and the difference in the winter cycle were significant while the daily average λ e t of furrow irrigation significantly increased by 20 0 summer and 11 1 winter respectively and evaporation factor defined as the ratio of λ e t to r n significantly increased by 14 3 summer and 6 0 winter respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of irrigation methods on soil hydrothermal conditions in the greenhouse the average volumetric water content inside the planned wetted soil layer during the whole growth period of the drip irrigation was lower than that of furrow irrigation mainly because of the relatively less irrigation amount fig 7 however the average volumetric soil water content of treatment di0 was 3 23 higher than that of the corresponding furrow irrigation fi2 with almost the same irrigation amount and water consumption likely due to less evaporation and more uniform distribution of soil water in drip irrigation kumar and dey 2011 soil water fluctuates smaller during the two drip irrigation intervals is also one reason for this liu et al 2003 furthermore drip irrigation can effectively improve the water storage capacity of the soil in combination with the mulch film tiwari et al 1998 a small amount of water infiltrated below the planned depth of wetted soil layer 50 cm under the furrow irrigation system resulting in a certain leakage loss fig 12 soil thermal conditions is a combination of the energy and matter exchange between the atmosphere and the underlying surface irrigation method air temperature precipitation surface micro geomorphology vegetation growth and soil type are main factors affecting soil temperature zhang et al 2001 similar to our results scherm and vanbruggen 1995 found that the soil temperature of lettuce fields under subsurface drip irrigation was always higher than that of furrow irrigation in a cool and moist season with an average temperature difference of about 1 c research on lowland rice have shown that soil temperature in aerobic fields from the tillering to the flowering stage was always higher in drip than that in flooded fields during the daytime but it was opposite during the nighttime alberto et al 2009 generally along with the soil water content increases the specific heat capacity of the soil also increases while the exchange rate of the temperature and heat are reduced causing the maximum temperature of the soil to decrease kumar and dey 2011 surface albedo and vegetation canopy coverage affect the ability of soil to absorb solar radiation the optical properties of the surface cover the solar elevation angle the water content and colour of the soil all affect the surface albedo li et al 2006 for example the average albedo of the moist and dry soil was 0 30 and 0 25 respectively abdel ghany and al helal 2011 however during the middle and later growth stages the proportion of bare soil was gradually reduced and the albedo of tomato canopy was not much different from soil karlberg et al 2006 therefore vegetation canopy coverage becomes the main factor affecting the energy balance of the underlying surface the lai and surface canopy coverage of tomato in furrow irrigation were larger than those of drip irrigation fig 5 and caused reductions in soil temperature i e indirect radiation cooling effect yang et al 1999 xu et al 2017 the degree of physical contact between the mulch and soil surface affects the partitioning of the available net energy and the heat transfer process at the air mulch and mulch soil interfaces bonachela et al 2012 which further impacts the heat stored released and temperature of the surface soil liakatas et al 1986 the soil underlying transparent mulch absorbs most of the shortwave radiation the larger air gap between the soil and mulch the more effective the soil can reduce the energy loss caused by heat conduction and convection bonachela et al 2012 the land was levelled so the physical contact between mulch and soil surface was tight under the drip irrigation while the uneven terrain of the furrow irrigation produced a larger air gap between mulch and soil surface therefore the difference in soil temperature between the two irrigation methods was reduced to some extent in our experiments 4 2 the impact of irrigation methods on microclimate in the greenhouse the microclimate inside the solar greenhouse is distinct from the outdoor environment because of the covering and enclosure our results were similar to those reported by impron et al 2008 the correlation between the indoor and outdoor solar radiation was good and the transmission coefficient of coverings were 0 75 and 0 92 for summer and winter respectively on accord with previous researches with single plastic greenhouse hernandez et al 2017 li et al 2017 the partitioning of solar radiation the atmospheric absorption reflection and scattering of solar radiation in various bands and the transparency of the underlying atmosphere at high latitudes are affected by the solar elevation angle rouse 2000 li et al 2017 during the periods with clouds the more solar radiation was diffused and the daily average radiation transmission coefficient of the greenhouse was larger than that in clear sunny days impron et al 2008 therefore we can conclude that the difference in radiation transmission coefficient of the greenhouse between different seasons in this study may be related to the solar elevation angle atmospheric conditions and the cleanness of the covering although a part of the solar radiation and heat flux can penetrate the coverings the exchange of air and water vapor inside and outside the greenhouse were completely isolated by the covering and can only be realized through the open vents therefore in addition to the atmospheric climate outside the opening and closing of the vents also have a significant impact on microclimate in the greenhouse impron et al 2008 in the winter experiment for the requirement of thermal preservation the roof vent of the greenhouse closed at night and the daily opening time was only about 30 of the summer experiment furthermore covering the cotton curtain also reduced the impact of atmospheric climate outdoor on the microclimate inside the greenhouse li et al 2017 therefore the difference between meteorological factors inside and outside the greenhouse during winter experiment was generally greater than that in summer experiment this study also found that irrigation methods have a significant impact on the microclimate t rh vpd etc in the greenhouse tables 3 5 scherm and vanbruggen 1995 reported no significant differences in the microclimate during the warm and dry season in a lettuce fields before irrigation but compared with the subsurface drip irrigation t of furrow irrigation could be reduced by up to 4 c within the 3 days after irrigation and the rh increased by 20 these results corroborated with ours well physically the partitioning of the energy on the underlying surface depends on the wetness of the soil cosic et al 2018 when other factors stay steady increasing soil moisture increased λ e t mahmood et al 2006 reduced surface temperature by evaporative cooling decreased daily average t and vpd and increased water vapor content and rh bonan 2001 xu et al 2017 this effect may last for several months after the irrigation event williams 1992 in addition the crop can convert more energy into λ e t so transpiration plays a decisive role in reducing t in the greenhouse when the lai is high impron et al 2008 in general the transpiration rate per unit leaf area stomatal and aerodynamic conductance and the gas exchange of crops under a dense canopy are significantly higher than those of an open canopy which can effectively reduce canopy temperature and t in the greenhouse katsoulas et al 2002 the r n under furrow irrigation was slightly larger than that of drip irrigation table 6 which might produce the smaller thicker and more deeply lobed or serrated leaves while reduced the boundary layer resistance liu et al 2015 and also increased the stomatal density schuepp 1993 which resulted in stronger convective cooling and transpiration cooling effects defraeye et al 2013 qiu et al 2011 showed that compared with drip irrigation the absolute value of rh of furrow irrigation increased by 6 in the greenhouse and the value could even reach 10 under ventilation conditions but t increased by 3 c which was different from our results mainly due to the r n of drip irrigation in their experiment was only 74 of furrow irrigation which decreased t obviously sprinkler irrigation subsurface and surface drip irrigation had no significant effect on the daily variation of potato canopy temperature and rh olanya et al 2007 while t and vpd wihin winter wheat canopy under sprinkler and surface irrigation were significantly different the difference was greatest at the time when t was highest 14 00 similar observations are given by liu and kang 2006b when t and vpd were higher or the rh was lower outdoor the change of the microclimate inside the greenhouse caused by the irrigation was more obvious because the physiological activity and transpiration of the crop were higher under this condition cavero et al 2009 this is why the differences in microclimate in the greenhouse between treatments mainly occurred during the daytime in our experiments 4 3 the impact of irrigation methods on energy acquisition and partitioning in the greenhouse the effect of irrigation on the near surface microclimate can be reflected in the energy acquisition and partitioning on the underlying surface while e t c is connected to the energy partitioning mass exchange and water use of the plant population therefore it is the basis for studying hydrological and biogeochemical processes and the energy balance of surface ecosystems lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 zhou et al 2012 so analyzing the conversion process of solar radiation to h and λ e t under different irrigation methods can help us understand the mechanism of microclimate formation in the greenhouse the cumulative water consumption of tomato during the whole growth period estimated by the breb method was well correlated with those by water balance method fig 11 but it was generally smaller and was consistent with the results obtained by crop coefficient method liu et al 2014 soil evaporation and condensation inside the mulch were not considered in the energy balance equation of the underlying surface in the greenhouse eq 13 and cannot be detected by the probe placed above the canopy of the crop wu et al 1996 there is evidence that heat flux blocked by the mulch can account for more than 11 of the available energy zhou et al 2012 the inversion above the tomato canopy and the measurement errors of t and rh in the breb system will also cause errors in flux calculation therefore the λ e t i e crop evapotranspiration obtained by the breb method in this paper still has some errors and need be further optimized nevertheless these results were reliable because for estimating crop water consumption in the greenhouse an error of 0 5 mm per day is acceptable kittas 1990 similar to our study table 6 crop evaporation factor λet r n is varies between 0 25 and 1 25 and for greenhouse tomato it generally varies in the range of 0 60 to 0 75 boulard et al 1991 tian et al 2017 while the solar radiation heating factor h r n is usually between 0 1 and 0 7 al helal and abdel ghany 2011 methods for reducing the t in the greenhouse include decreasing radiation load removing excess heat through air exchange and allocating more energy to λ e t luo et al 2005 it is generally believed that agricultural irrigation has little effect on r s r n l and r n on the underlying surface under field conditions katsoulas et al 2002 results in our study indicate that irrigation methods have no obvious impact on the energy acquisition of the underlying surface in the greenhouse the warming of near surface air mainly depends on the h that can be utilized for example the h of aerobic rice fields increased by 45 48 compared with flooded fields and the λ e t decreased by 18 19 correspondingly the average t increased by 0 2 c while average rh and vpd were 3 1 and 0 07 kpa lower respectively during the whole growth periods alberto et al 2009 our study found that more energy was converted into λ e t under furrow irrigation while h was significantly reduced indicating that the irrigation method mainly affected the microclimate in the greenhouse by changing the energy partitioning ratio of the underlying surface table 6 in the case of the orientation size structure of the greenhouse being stable the change of energy partitioning ratio mainly depends on crop characteristics lai r n above the canopy and vpd liu et al 2014 some studies showed meteorological parameters can account for 85 of the change in λ e t tian et al 2017 lai is a major factor in determining plant canopy energy partitioning hammerle et al 2008 with the increase in lai the λ e t r n gradually increases and the h r n gradually decreases katsoulas et al 2002 qiu et al 2011 vpd is significantly positively correlated with λ e t while negatively correlated with h so as vpd increases the less energy is allocated to h to warm the surrounding air in the greenhouse liu et al 2014 our results agreed with these literatures i e vpd table 3 and 4 and lai fig 5 of furrow irrigation treatment fi1 and fi2 respectively were higher than those in drip irrigation treatment di1 and di2 respectively which reduced the t and increased rh in the furrow irrigation system as for the r n h and λ e t are both raised significantly with the increment of it but the partitioning ratio is shown a downward trend katsoulas et al 2002 al helal and abdel ghany 2011 qiu et al 2011 reported similar results for greenhouse grown pepper compared with drip irrigation furrow irrigation increased the daily average λ e t and h by 37 53 and 9 23 respectively while decreased the daily average g by 7 19 meanwhile the λ e t r n increased significantly while the h r n decreased significantly under furrow irrigation which agreed with our findings 5 conclusions the present study confirmed there was a significant difference in the microclimate inside the solar greenhouse between the drip and furrow irrigation systems mainly due to the application of different irrigation amount only minor difference can be detected in microclimate if applying the same irrigation amount the significantly distinct soil hydrothermal conditions affected the growth of tomato plants and the energy matter exchange with the surrounding environment afterwards lai of tomato surface canopy coverage and surface albedo changed making more solar energy eventually allocate to sensible flux to heat the indoor air which resulted in the increment of t and vpd and the decrement of rh under drip irrigation when comparing with furrow irrigation furthermore the atmospheric environment also played a fundamental role in the formation of microclimate inside the solar greenhouse in summary we suggest that the combination of reasonable water management and flexible vent opening management can be used to regulate the partitioning of solar energy and the exchange of matter energy in the greenhouse without the active environmental control system thereby creating suitable growth environment for crops in the follow up studies on the response of crops to irrigation methods which grow in the low cost and low technology greenhouse more attention to the effects of microclimate environment on crop

10627,the microclimate under the drip and furrow irrigation systems inside a solar greenhouse located in the arid regions of northwestern china was evaluated during the two consecutive tomato growth cycles influence of soil hydrothermal conditions and the energy partitioning process were also analyzed the results showed that when adopting the same water management measures the irrigation amount evapotranspiration etc and soil water content within the planned wet layer of the drip irrigation were significantly lower than those of the furrow irrigation but the soil temperature showed an opposite trend the average air temperature t and vapor pressure deficit vpd for the drip irrigation were significantly higher than furrow irrigation during the whole experimental periods but relative humidity rh was relatively lower however there was no significant difference of the daily average total solar radiation and other radiation components between drip and furrow irrigation systems actually the distinct microclimate of each irrigation system was generated by the specific energy partitioning ratio of the underlying surface mainly due to the application of different irrigation amount higher leaf area index lai irrigation amount soil water content and lower vpd under furrow irrigation reduced the daily average sensible heat flux by 14 5 and 20 0 and reduced the solar radiation heating factor by 11 8 and 27 9 respectively for summer and winter cycle while daily average latent heat flux increased by 20 0 and 11 1 and the evaporation coefficient increased by 14 3 and 6 0 respectively for summer and winter cycle this paper showed that for the low cost and low technology solar greenhouse without an active environmental control system the reasonable water and vent opening management can be used to create a suitable environment for sustaining crop growth by regulating the partitioning and exchange of solar energy inside the greenhouse keywords irrigation method microclimate solar greenhouse soil hydrothermal energy partitioning 1 introduction improving crop productivity and producing high quality agricultural products are some of the important goals to ensure global food security under the climate change threats wheeler and von braun 2013 the solar greenhouse can provide appropriate growth conditions and ensure stable continuous production of crops and improve the quality rosales et al 2011 farneti et al 2013 the solar greenhouse can also decrease negative impacts of adverse external environments such as dramatically changes in temperature lighting or other extreme weather events including excessive or insufficient precipitation al mulla et al 2018 therefore use of solar greenhouses is increasing worldwide especially in the areas with uncertain climatic conditions or relatively scarce land and water resources shamshiri et al 2018 the internal environmental elements of solar greenhouse include microclimate conditions light temperature humidity co2 concentration soil conditions physical chemical and biological characteristics soil moisture and management conditions irrigation fertilization cultivation bisbis et al 2018 the growth yield and quality of crops in solar greenhouses depend largely on the internal microclimate conditions therefore a lot of research has been conducted to improve the orientation gupta and chandra 2002 sethi 2009 building structures vanthoor et al 2011 tong et al 2013 joudi and farhan 2015 enclosure structure materials berroug et al 2011 wang et al 2014 and shading of the solar greenhouse harmanto tantau and salokhe 2006 tanny 2013 ahemd et al 2016 as well as the management of crops grown indoor sethi et al 2013 leyva et al 2015 li et al 2017 the gradual establishment and improvement of various solar greenhouse microclimate simulation models also increased the understanding of the microclimate formation mechanisms of solar greenhouses all the effort mentioned above improved the solar greenhouse parameter design and microclimate management measures mashonjowa et al 2013 the solar greenhouse consists of a complex physical and biological system the growth and development of crops as well as the exchange of energy matter between the internal environment and crops profoundly affect the microclimate in the solar greenhouse the specific heat capacity of water is four times that of air and is often used to regulate or improve the microclimate of farmland near the surface liu and kang 2006a furthermore the plant water status can directly affect the growth development and biochemical processes of crops such as metabolism slatyer 1968 du et al 2015 and the interactions between plants and surrounding environment therefore irrigation can change the microclimate in the solar greenhouse by directly via soil hydrothermal conditions and indirectly via plants and their responses to environment effects of water dos santos et al 2007 cavero et al 2009 alberto et al 2009 the latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are key variables in the exchange process mentioned above and the knowledge of the energy partitioning within the greenhouse is critical in improving the irrigation management and microclimate wilson et al 2002 at present there are a large number of studies on the effects of irrigation methods on the near surface or crop canopy microclimate and energy partitioning of farmland however to the best of our knowledge these studies are mainly conducted in the open field for example the effects of fixed sprinkler irrigation systems on canopy microclimate water status and gas exchange of maize urrego pereira et al 2013 winter wheat liu and kang 2006b and alfalfa cavero et al 2016 some studies focus on the effects of different water layers depth on rice canopy microclimate stuerz et al 2014 or how irrigation strategies influence canopy microclimate and quality of grape fruit dos santos et al 2007 research about the effects of irrigation methods on microclimate or energy partitioning in solar greenhouses grown horticultural crops are relatively scarce qiu et al 2011 teitel 2017 among the studies on the energy partitioning in the protected agriculture the eddy covariance method ec standard technique for direct measurement of whole canopy latent heat in open fields has demonstrated its feasibility for pepper moller et al 2004 and banana dicken et al 2013a in the screenhouse but the expensive sensors the complexity of operating system and the high demand of the data analysis limit its availability at the farm level the penman monteith pm and bulk transfer bt models have been widely used for energy flux research in the greenhouse for more than a decade takakura et al 2009 morille et al 2013 but the accurate parameterization of canopy resistance rc restrict their application yan et al 2019 due to the uneven distribution of the underlying surface papadakis et al 1994 and the validity of the key assumption that eddy transfer coefficients of sensible heat and water vapor are equal may not be straightforward within the greenhouse environment dicken et al 2013b the applying of bowen ratio energy balance breb approach also has some restrictions however the breb method is much cheaper and simpler alternative technique to monitor the energy partitioning by measurement meteorological elements of underlying surfaces in the greenhouse this study evalauted the seasonal and daily variation of main microclimate factors including solar radiation air temperature t relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd inside the solar greenhouse under the traditional furrow irrigation and the optimized drip irrigation from the perspectives of soil hydrothermal status and partitioning of solar energy in the greenhouse the causes of the microclimate formation were analyzed the results of this paper can help readers deepen understanding how to create suitable microclimate conditions for crops grown in the greenhouse and guide the crops water management from the perspective of adjusting the microclimate inside the low cost and low technology greenhouses 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials the experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university from april 20 2017 to april 9 2018 the station is located in wuwei city gansu province china e 102 50 50 n 37 52 20 altitude 1580 m which is a typical continental temperate climate zone the experiment used an unheated naturally ventilated greenhouse 70 m long 8 5 m span and an effective planting area of 360 m2 with an east west orientation the greenhouse supported by steel beams and concrete columns was covered with a 0 4 mm thick single polyethene film pe on the top of the greenhouse roof a vent with a width of 0 5 m was always kept open during summer but only during daytime in winter in addition in order to prevent freeze damage in winter the greenhouse is covered with cotton curtain at night or during snowfall the ground surface was covered with a clear polyethylene film with a thickness of 0 05 mm to reduce soil evaporation and inhibit weed growth the main structural parameters of the greenhouse are shown in fig 1 the tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill planted in the greenhouse was jinpeng 11 a local leading variety summer cycle was from apr 20 2017 to aug 19 with a total growth period of 121 days and winter cycle was from nov 1 2017 to apr 9 2018 with a total growth period of 159 days tomato seedlings were planted in wide narrow row pattern 0 7 m and 0 5 m respectively with a plant spacing within rows of 0 5 m and density of 3 78 plants m2 both for drip and furrow irrigation treatments the drip tape beijing lvyuan plastic co ltd beijing china with emitter spacing of 0 4 m and wall thickness of 0 4 mm was placed against the main stem of tomato plants for each row in the drip irrigation system fig 2 the emitter flow rate at the operating pressure of 0 1 mpa was 1 38 l h in the furrow irrigation system two rows of tomatoes were planted on per ridge with 80 cm width while the furrow was 40 cm width with 25 cm depth fig 2 within the planned depth of wetted soil layer h 0 50 cm the soil inside the greenhouse was irrigated desert soil siltigic orthic anthrosols composed of 12 2 clay 60 3 silt and 27 5 sand the average soil dry bulk density were 1 56 and 1 58 g c m 3 for summer and winter experiment respectively and the field soil water capacity θ f were 0 27 and 0 26 c m 3 c m 3 respectively 2 2 experimental design summer experiment had two treatments drip irrigation under mulch di1 and furrow irrigation under mulch fi1 the aboveground part was partitioned by a polyvinyl chloride mulch and a sunscreen net meanwhile an anti seepage mulch with a depth of 0 8 m was laid underground to separate the greenhouse into two cabins with the equal area fig 3 a the water management of two treatments was shown in table 1 from 10 days after transplanting dat to the end of the experiment once average volumetric water content within the planned wetted soil layer decreased to around 75 2 of θ f plots were irrigated to the upper limit of 90 2 of θ f in each irrigation event the irrigation amount mm for both drip and furrow irrigation systems was calculated as 1 i 10 p θ 1 θ 2 h 0 where p is the designed soil wetting proportion taken as 0 5 and 1 0 for drip and furrow irrigation respectively h 0 is the planned depth of wetted soil layer equal to 50 cm θ 1 is the upper limit of irrigation c m 3 c m 3 i e 90 2 of θ f and θ 2 is the actual soil volumetric water content within planned wetted soil layer before irrigation c m 3 c m 3 as shown in fig 3b using the same materials and methods as the summer cycle the experimental area in the winter trial was divided into three equal parts for three treatments drip irrigation under mulch di2 and di0 and furrow irrigation under mulch fi2 the water management of treatment di2 and fi2 was consistent with that of treatment di1 and fi1 respectively table 1 as a control group the schedule and amount of the irrigation for the treatment di0 were completely the same as the treatment fi2 while the irrigation method was the same as the treatment di2 in each irrigation event the irrigation amount was calculated according to eq 1 fertilization and the agronomic measures such as topping de leafing de worming and weeding were the same for all treatments 2 3 experimental data besides the yield and leaf area index lai the main parameters determined in this experiment were volumetric soil water content and soil temperature within the 50 cm depth t rh and total solar radiation at different heights inside the greenhouse the monitoring probes were arranged on the section near the middle of each plot figs 1 3 data were collected every 5 s and averaged values were recorded every 15 min in an em50 data collector meter group inc wa usa 2 3 1 yield and lai of plant the tomato tested in this experiment was an indeterminate variety so the manual topping was performed to keep each plant with 6 fruit trusses in order to prevent the marginal effects when determining the yield and lai of tomato plants at least two rows of plants which grown adjacent to the east and west boundary of each plot were set as protective rows for the measurement of yield a total of 10 vigorous healthy and representative plants with basically the same growth situation was randomly selected within the central area of each plot for destructive determination the red mature fruits were harvested by hand in the same time among different treatments the number and fresh weight of fruits were measured from the truss ⅰ to truss ⅴ sequentially according to the order of fruit ripening the non commercial fruits with flaws such as cracking or blossom end rot ber were measured separately the total yield in each treatment was calculated based on the average yield of these plants planting density and area regarding the measurement of lai the tomato plant was divided into 5 growth stages firstly for each growth stage 3 vigorous healthy and representative tomato plants with basically the same growth situation were randomly selected within the central area of each plot for destructive sampling the total shoot area sa m2 was the sum of the area of all shoots which was calculated as the length multiplied by maximum width of each shoot and the total leaf area la m2 was obtained by adding up the area of all leaves from the same plant measured with an area meter am300 adc bioscientific ltd hoddesdon uk the data was pooled and a functional relationship between the sa and the la was established by linear regression analysis table 2 afterwards another 3 tomato plants were marked according to the procedures just mentioned in each treatment their sa was constantly monitored in situ using a steel tape according to the equations established before table 2 the la of plants was obtained finally the lai m2 m2 in each treatment can be calculated as the average la of these plants divided by the maximum projected area simplified as a circle with a diameter of 0 5 m for per plant 2 3 2 air temperature and relative humidity t and rh were measured using an atmos 14 probe meter group inc wa usa equipped with a radiation shield temperature range of 40 to 80 c resolution 0 1 c relative humidity range of 0 to 100 resolution 0 1 as shown in figs 1 and 3 two probes were installed in the middle section of each cabin at the vertical distance of 1 and 2 m from the ground according to the data of t and rh v p d kpa was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 2 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 r h 100 2 3 3 total solar radiation and net solar radiation total solar radiation r s was measured using a pyr probe meter group inc wa usa range of 01750 w m2 resolution 0 1 w m2 accuracy 5 as shown in figs 1 and 3 a probe was installed at the middle section of each cabin with a 3 m vertical distance from the ground net solar radiation r n above the tomato canopy was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 3 r n r n s r n l where r n s is net shortwave radiation m j m 2 r n l is net longwave radiation m j m 2 according to allen et al 1998 r n s was calculated after a little modification as follows 4 r n s 1 f c c r s 1 a p f c c r s 1 a s where r s

temperature range of 40 to 60 c resolution 0 1 c accuracy 1 c the sensors were arranged in the root zone of the tomato plant at the vertical depths of 10 20 40 60 80 cm from the surface the layout of sensors was shown in fig 2 data taken within the 50 cm depth were averaged prior to the analysis before the experiment the probes were calibrated based on the data obtained from soil samples using an oven drying method afterwards the calibrate procedures were been repeated before and after each irrigation event to verify the accuracy of the probes 2 3 5 crop actual evapotranspiration water balance equation was used to obtain actual crop evapotranspiration e t c mm as follows 7 e t c p i w d r δ s where p is precipitation mm equal to zero inside the greenhouse i is irrigation amount mm w is groundwater recharge mm d is deep drainage mm r is surface runoff mm δ s is the change in soil water storage mm the water table in this area is more than 25 m deep qiu et al 2011 so w can be ignored the ground surface in the greenhouse was almost flat and the irrigation amount and emitter flow rate under drip irrigation system for each time were small so r should equal to zero d can be negligible because the previous experiment by our team showed there was no deep drainage below the main root zone of tomato i e calculated depth of soil water storage h 1 80 cm and the maximum soil water content within the planned wetted soil layer was only around 90 of θf in summary eq 7 can be simplified as follows 8 e t c i δ s the irrigation amount of drip and furrow irrigation systems can be calculated according to eq 1 and δ s can be calculated as follows 9 δ s 10 θ t 1 θ t 2 h 1 where h 1 is calculated depth of soil water storage equal to 80 cm and θ t 1 and θ t 2 are the actual soil volumetric water content c m 3 c m 3 within the main root zone at the time t 1 and t 2 respectively 2 3 6 soil heat flux based on one dimensional soil thermal diffusion equation tde soil heat flux g w m 2 can be calculated from the temperature profile t s z i and soil water content as follows yang and wang 2008 10 g g z r e f 1 δ t z r e f z ρ s c s z i t δ t t s z i t δ t ρ s c s z i t t s z i t δ z where g z r e f is the heat flux at a reference depth z ref w m 2 δ t is time step s δ z is soil thickness of each layer m t s is the soil temperature at a certain time and soil depth k ρ s c s is the soil heat capacity at a certain time and soil depth j k g k can be calculated as follows 11 ρ s c s ρ d r y c d r y ρ w c w θ 12 ρ d r y c d r y 1 θ s a t 2 1 10 6 where ρ d r y c d r y is the heat capacity of dry soil j k g k ρ w c w is the heat capacity of liquid water j k g k θ s a t is the soil porosity c m 3 c m 3 θ is the soil volumetric water content c m 3 c m 3 if the reference position is deep enough then g z r e f can be assumed equal to zero because it is much less than surface soil heat flux when there is no plant in the greenhouse the g at the depth of 0 25 m under the mulched soil has no obvious diurnal variation and its average value is close to zero bonachela et al 2012 therefore after considering the impact of the crop it is reasonable to take the reference level equal to 0 8 m in this study 2 3 7 surface energy balance and bowen radio inside the greenhouse solar radiation is a key factor to determine the energy balance of the greenhouse considering the complexity of mass and heat transfer mechanism in the greenhouse a simplified greenhouse energy balance equation can be established based on some assumptions under steady state conditions xu et al 2017 li et al 2017 xu et al 2018 it is generally accepted that greenhouse covers steel frames and humid air do not absorb solar radiation while the thermal radiation between various parts of the greenhouse can be ignored takakura et al 2009 crop canopy is a semi permeable layer containing air and plants tissue the energy absorbed by it converts into latent heat flux or sensible heat flux released into the air finally while the stored energy can be ignored al helal and abdel ghany 2011 zhou et al 2012 part of the solar radiation received by the soil surface is released into the indoor air and other to the deep soil singh and tiwari 2000 therefore solar radiation absorbed by the underlying surface i e crop canopy and soil and the energy stored in the soil should be heat sources in the energy balance equation of the greenhouse li et al 2017 in this experiment the orientation structure size and materials of the north wall are the same in each cabin for a growing season hence there is no difference in the ability of the north wall to absorb store and release energy xu et al 2018 showed that the north wall can absorb 80 of the solar radiation while the soil and the envelope can release 10 of the absorbed solar energy impron et al 2007 by radiation and convection into the air ling et al 2015 consequently it can be concluded that the energy exchange between the north wall and the air in the greenhouse is mainly determined by solar radiation there is no significant difference in r s under different irrigation methods fig 8 and the energy exchange between the north wall and indoor air in each cabin can be assumed equal thus the impact of the north wall on the microclimate of each cabin is consistent and could be ignored in the analysis in summary the energy balance of the underlying surface of the greenhouse is a key factor affecting the formation of its microclimate the equation is as follows 13 r n λ e t h g where λ e t is the latent heat flux m j m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux m j m 2 assuming that the eddy transfer coefficients of sensible heat k h and water vapor k w are equal bowen 1926 proposed a method for calculating the λ e t called the breb method β is defined as the ratio of the h to the λ e t at a certain interface which is a function of the temperature gradient and the humidity gradient in the vertical direction 14 β h λ e t γ δ t δ e a where δ t is the temperature gradients between two high levels δ e a is the vapor pressure gradients between two high levels kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant allen et al 1998 therefore λ e t can be calculated as follows 15 λ e t r n g 1 β the accuracy of the calculation of λ e t by breb method relies largely on the accurate determination of β values gavilán and berengena 2007 and it was more reliable under the unstable atmospheric conditions that sensible heat flux was directed upwards during night time or sunrise and sunset the stable atmospheric condition normally makes the β value infinitely close to 1 prueger et al 1997 which will lead the decreases in the accuracy of the breb method according to the results of dicken et al 2013b we assumed that the breb method can be applied normally in a low cost and low technology solar greenhouse and then compared with the water balance method to verify its accuracy refer to the method proposed by perez et al 1999 and zhang et al 2008 the unreasonable data were discarded and then interpolated by linear interpolation 2 4 data processing and analysis all statistical analysis was performed by ibm spss statistics 20 0 ibm ny usa the one way anova duncan s new multiple range test was used to determine the impact of different treatments on the microclimate and other variables in the solar greenhouse afzalinia and zabihi 2014 the non normal data were appropriately transformed to meet the one way anova requirements the significance test level was p 0 05 the figures in this paper were drawn using originpro 9 1 originlab corporation ma usa 3 results 3 1 yield lai and surface canopy coverage of tomato in the summer cycle fig 4 a the total yield of treatment di1 was 123 0 t ha which was 12 27 lower than that of treatment f1 148 1 t ha but the difference was not significant p 0 143 meanwhile the commercial fruit yield 88 2 t ha and commodity rate 65 50 of drip irrigation system were slightly lower than those 100 5 t ha and 67 41 respectively of furrow irrigation system in the winter cycle fig 4b the total yield of treatment di2 and fi2 were 122 2 and 122 3 t ha respectively without significant differences p 0 986 similar to the summer cycle the commercial fruit yield 101 4 t ha and commodity rate 82 29 of drip irrigation system were slightly lower than those 107 5 t ha and 87 92 respectively of furrow irrigation system the total yield 111 0 t ha commercial fruit yield 91 0 t ha and commodity rate 81 05 of treatment di0 were the lowest among the winter experiment and compared with treatment di2 or fi2 there were no significant difference the dynamic changes of lai and surface canopy coverage with time were basically the same for different irrigation systems and due to the application of agronomic managements such as de leafing and topping during the tomato growth period the values of lai and surface canopy coverage decreased temporarily fig 5 the average lai during the whole experimental period of treatment di1 and di2 was 2 19 and 2 60 m3 m3 which was 12 94 and 7 16 less than that of treatment fi1 2 52 m3 m3 and fi2 2 80 m3 m3 respectively the average surface canopy coverage during the whole experimental period of treatment di1 and di2 was 0 59 and 0 66 m3 m3 which was decreased by 7 16 and 2 27 compared with the treatment fi1 0 63 m3 m3 and fi2 0 68 m3 m3 respectively the differences of these parameters between drip and furrow irrigation systems were not significant in the winter experiment the average lai and surface canopy coverage of treatment di0 during the whole growth period were 2 38 and 0 64 m3 m3 respectively which were not significantly different from those of treatment di2 and fi2 3 2 tomato evapotranspiration and soil hydrothermal conditions in the two consecutive experiments the water content within the planned wetted soil layer of each treatment fluctuated within the range of the experimental design fig 6 a the average volumetric soil water content during the whole growth period of the drip irrigation was 9 32 summer and 5 79 winter lower than that of furrow irrigation in each growth stage of tomato the irrigation amount irrigation times evapotranspiration etc and water consumption intensity of treatment di1 and di2 were all lower than those of treatment fi1 and fi2 respectively fig 7 during the whole experimental period in summer treatment di1 and fi1 were irrigated 16 and 13 times and the total irrigation amount was 228 55 and 275 44 mm respectively leading to a 17 03 reduction of irrigation amount in the drip irrigation system meanwhile the etc of treatment di1 and fi1 was 291 86 and 325 77 mm and the water consumption intensity was 2 43 and 2 71 mm d respectively resulting in a 10 41 reduction in the drip irrigation system in the winter experiment treatment di2 and fi2 were irrigated 12 and 10 times and the total irrigation amount was 124 93 and 178 45 mm respectively resulting in a reduction of 29 92 of the irrigation amount in the drip irrigation system the etc of treatment di2 and fi2 was 212 05 and 240 06 mm and the water consumption intensity was 1 33 and 1 51 mm d respectively leading to a 11 67 reduction in the drip irrigation system the total irrigation amounts 176 98 mm etc 242 36 mm and water consumption intensity 1 52 mm d of treatment di0 were basically the same as treatment fi2 but the volumetric soil water content was higher the soil temperature within the planned wetted soil layer under different irrigation systems had similar seasonal variation fig 6b in the summer experiment the soil temperature fluctuation increased with the average of 25 09 2 24 and 21 62 1 20 c for treatment di1 and fi1 respectively in the winter experiment they decreased first and then increased with the average of 19 09 3 10 and 17 62 2 79 c for treatment di2 and fi2 respectively the average soil temperature of drip irrigation was significantly p 0 001 higher than that of furrow irrigation for both experiments in addition the difference in soil temperature between the drip and furrow irrigation was large in summer experiment average 3 41 c compared with the winter experiment average 1 42 c the average soil temperature for treatment di0 18 51 3 04 c was significantly p 0 008 higher than that of treatment fi2 with the same irrigation regime 3 3 microclimate conditions in the greenhouse the microclimate factors in the greenhouse under different irrigation methods showed similar significant seasonal changes for summer table 3 and winter experiment table 4 respectively independently irrigation methods during the whole growth season the extreme value of t vpd and rh inside the greenhouse appeared in the same month respectively for example throughout the winter cycle the minimum value of t and vpd for each treatment both appeared in january and the maximum value in november the average t and vpd of drip irrigation i e treatment di1 and di2 were significantly higher than those of furrow irrigation i e treatment fi1 and fi2 corresponding also higher during the entire experimental period except for t in the early stage of winter cycle the average rh of different irrigation methods over the whole experimental period was opposite of t or vpd but there was no significant difference during the summer cycle in addition a significant difference in microclimate factors was detected between treatment di0 and di2 in almost all stages of the winter cycle however the difference of t and rh between treatment di0 and fi2 mainly appeared in the early stage november and december as for vpd the difference was not significant the total solar radiation r s inside the greenhouse of different irrigation systems were slightly different summer di1 15 32 5 55 fi1 15 89 5 70 p 0 504 winter di0 10 37 3 47 di2 10 1 3 79 fi2 10 1 3 57 p 0 791 unit mj m2 therefore r s received by each cabin was the same in summer or winter experiments respectively as shown in fig 8 the trend of seasonal change was basically the same for the r s inside average of different irrigation methods and outside the greenhouse and the correlation within them was good r2 0 99 but more solar radiation was lost during the incident progress in summer experiment the t rh and vpd inside the greenhouse under different irrigation systems were generally higher than the outdoor values and the difference in winter experiment was greater fig 9 the same meteorological elements inside and outside the greenhouse showed good correlation and the relationship during summer r2 0 82 0 97 was significantly stronger than that in the winter r2 0 21 0 56 indicating that the microclimate inside the greenhouse was mainly driven by the atmospheric climate and this effect was more pronounced in the summer experiment in order to eliminate the influence of the atmospheric climate on the microclimate inside the greenhouse the simultaneous irrigation events between different treatments were selected 12 and 8 times during the summer and winter cycle respectively the difference between indoor and outdoor meteorological factors within 24 h before and after the irrigation events were analyzed to evaluate the impact of individual irrigation event on the greenhouse microclimate table 5 the results showed that t and vpd for each treatment decreased significantly after the end of irrigation while rh did not exhibit significant difference before and after irrigation in the summer experiment only the difference δs of t and vpd varied significantly between drip and furrow irrigation however the difference δw significantly increased in t and decreased in vpd in the winter cycle 3 4 diurnal variation of microclimate in the greenhouse the diurnal variation of the microclimate factors in the greenhouse under different irrigation systems were basically the same for summer and winter cycle respectively fig 10 independently the irrigation methods t and vpd reached a maximum value around 14 00 and a minimum value around 7 00 during summer cycle comparing with the winter cycle the variation advanced around one hour for the trend of rh the diurnal variation was just the opposite t and vpd of drip irrigation i e treatment di1 and di2 were higher than those of furrow irrigation i e treatment fi1 and fi2 in the whole day corresponding and the difference mainly occurred during the daytime the rh under the different irrigation methods was opposite of t or vpd expect for the daytime in the summer cycle and the difference was bigger during the nighttime in terms of control set di0 t and vpd were generally lower than the other two treatments while the rh was generally between them the diurnal variation of meteorological factors inside and outside the greenhouse was basically the same and there were no significant differences during nighttime except for the air temperature and rh during the winter cycle the maximum values of air temperature rh and vpd outside the greenhouse were 75 91 92 62 and 63 13 of those inside the greenhouse average of different irrigation methods respectively in the summer experiment for the winter experiment the ratio were only 28 54 63 58 and 34 56 respectively 3 5 energy acquisition and partitioning in the greenhouse the cumulative water consumption of tomato during the whole growth period fig 11 estimated by the breb method eq 15 was well correlated with the results calculated by the water balance method eq 8 compared with the water balance method the results calculated by the berb were 11 and 12 lower for treatment di1 and fi1 in the summer respectively and 11 12 and 10 lower for treatment di0 di2 and fi2 in the winter respectively the energy acquisition and partitioning of the underlying surface under the different irrigation methods in the greenhouse were shown in table 6 the difference in the daily average r n above the canopy g other radiation components and the total available energy r n g between two irrigation methods were not significant compared with the drip irrigation the daily average h of the furrow irrigation was reduced by 14 5 summer and 20 0 winter respectively and the solar radiation heating factor defined as the ratio of h to r n was reduced by 11 8 summer and 27 9 winter and the difference in the winter cycle were significant while the daily average λ e t of furrow irrigation significantly increased by 20 0 summer and 11 1 winter respectively and evaporation factor defined as the ratio of λ e t to r n significantly increased by 14 3 summer and 6 0 winter respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of irrigation methods on soil hydrothermal conditions in the greenhouse the average volumetric water content inside the planned wetted soil layer during the whole growth period of the drip irrigation was lower than that of furrow irrigation mainly because of the relatively less irrigation amount fig 7 however the average volumetric soil water content of treatment di0 was 3 23 higher than that of the corresponding furrow irrigation fi2 with almost the same irrigation amount and water consumption likely due to less evaporation and more uniform distribution of soil water in drip irrigation kumar and dey 2011 soil water fluctuates smaller during the two drip irrigation intervals is also one reason for this liu et al 2003 furthermore drip irrigation can effectively improve the water storage capacity of the soil in combination with the mulch film tiwari et al 1998 a small amount of water infiltrated below the planned depth of wetted soil layer 50 cm under the furrow irrigation system resulting in a certain leakage loss fig 12 soil thermal conditions is a combination of the energy and matter exchange between the atmosphere and the underlying surface irrigation method air temperature precipitation surface micro geomorphology vegetation growth and soil type are main factors affecting soil temperature zhang et al 2001 similar to our results scherm and vanbruggen 1995 found that the soil temperature of lettuce fields under subsurface drip irrigation was always higher than that of furrow irrigation in a cool and moist season with an average temperature difference of about 1 c research on lowland rice have shown that soil temperature in aerobic fields from the tillering to the flowering stage was always higher in drip than that in flooded fields during the daytime but it was opposite during the nighttime alberto et al 2009 generally along with the soil water content increases the specific heat capacity of the soil also increases while the exchange rate of the temperature and heat are reduced causing the maximum temperature of the soil to decrease kumar and dey 2011 surface albedo and vegetation canopy coverage affect the ability of soil to absorb solar radiation the optical properties of the surface cover the solar elevation angle the water content and colour of the soil all affect the surface albedo li et al 2006 for example the average albedo of the moist and dry soil was 0 30 and 0 25 respectively abdel ghany and al helal 2011 however during the middle and later growth stages the proportion of bare soil was gradually reduced and the albedo of tomato canopy was not much different from soil karlberg et al 2006 therefore vegetation canopy coverage becomes the main factor affecting the energy balance of the underlying surface the lai and surface canopy coverage of tomato in furrow irrigation were larger than those of drip irrigation fig 5 and caused reductions in soil temperature i e indirect radiation cooling effect yang et al 1999 xu et al 2017 the degree of physical contact between the mulch and soil surface affects the partitioning of the available net energy and the heat transfer process at the air mulch and mulch soil interfaces bonachela et al 2012 which further impacts the heat stored released and temperature of the surface soil liakatas et al 1986 the soil underlying transparent mulch absorbs most of the shortwave radiation the larger air gap between the soil and mulch the more effective the soil can reduce the energy loss caused by heat conduction and convection bonachela et al 2012 the land was levelled so the physical contact between mulch and soil surface was tight under the drip irrigation while the uneven terrain of the furrow irrigation produced a larger air gap between mulch and soil surface therefore the difference in soil temperature between the two irrigation methods was reduced to some extent in our experiments 4 2 the impact of irrigation methods on microclimate in the greenhouse the microclimate inside the solar greenhouse is distinct from the outdoor environment because of the covering and enclosure our results were similar to those reported by impron et al 2008 the correlation between the indoor and outdoor solar radiation was good and the transmission coefficient of coverings were 0 75 and 0 92 for summer and winter respectively on accord with previous researches with single plastic greenhouse hernandez et al 2017 li et al 2017 the partitioning of solar radiation the atmospheric absorption reflection and scattering of solar radiation in various bands and the transparency of the underlying atmosphere at high latitudes are affected by the solar elevation angle rouse 2000 li et al 2017 during the periods with clouds the more solar radiation was diffused and the daily average radiation transmission coefficient of the greenhouse was larger than that in clear sunny days impron et al 2008 therefore we can conclude that the difference in radiation transmission coefficient of the greenhouse between different seasons in this study may be related to the solar elevation angle atmospheric conditions and the cleanness of the covering although a part of the solar radiation and heat flux can penetrate the coverings the exchange of air and water vapor inside and outside the greenhouse were completely isolated by the covering and can only be realized through the open vents therefore in addition to the atmospheric climate outside the opening and closing of the vents also have a significant impact on microclimate in the greenhouse impron et al 2008 in the winter experiment for the requirement of thermal preservation the roof vent of the greenhouse closed at night and the daily opening time was only about 30 of the summer experiment furthermore covering the cotton curtain also reduced the impact of atmospheric climate outdoor on the microclimate inside the greenhouse li et al 2017 therefore the difference between meteorological factors inside and outside the greenhouse during winter experiment was generally greater than that in summer experiment this study also found that irrigation methods have a significant impact on the microclimate t rh vpd etc in the greenhouse tables 3 5 scherm and vanbruggen 1995 reported no significant differences in the microclimate during the warm and dry season in a lettuce fields before irrigation but compared with the subsurface drip irrigation t of furrow irrigation could be reduced by up to 4 c within the 3 days after irrigation and the rh increased by 20 these results corroborated with ours well physically the partitioning of the energy on the underlying surface depends on the wetness of the soil cosic et al 2018 when other factors stay steady increasing soil moisture increased λ e t mahmood et al 2006 reduced surface temperature by evaporative cooling decreased daily average t and vpd and increased water vapor content and rh bonan 2001 xu et al 2017 this effect may last for several months after the irrigation event williams 1992 in addition the crop can convert more energy into λ e t so transpiration plays a decisive role in reducing t in the greenhouse when the lai is high impron et al 2008 in general the transpiration rate per unit leaf area stomatal and aerodynamic conductance and the gas exchange of crops under a dense canopy are significantly higher than those of an open canopy which can effectively reduce canopy temperature and t in the greenhouse katsoulas et al 2002 the r n under furrow irrigation was slightly larger than that of drip irrigation table 6 which might produce the smaller thicker and more deeply lobed or serrated leaves while reduced the boundary layer resistance liu et al 2015 and also increased the stomatal density schuepp 1993 which resulted in stronger convective cooling and transpiration cooling effects defraeye et al 2013 qiu et al 2011 showed that compared with drip irrigation the absolute value of rh of furrow irrigation increased by 6 in the greenhouse and the value could even reach 10 under ventilation conditions but t increased by 3 c which was different from our results mainly due to the r n of drip irrigation in their experiment was only 74 of furrow irrigation which decreased t obviously sprinkler irrigation subsurface and surface drip irrigation had no significant effect on the daily variation of potato canopy temperature and rh olanya et al 2007 while t and vpd wihin winter wheat canopy under sprinkler and surface irrigation were significantly different the difference was greatest at the time when t was highest 14 00 similar observations are given by liu and kang 2006b when t and vpd were higher or the rh was lower outdoor the change of the microclimate inside the greenhouse caused by the irrigation was more obvious because the physiological activity and transpiration of the crop were higher under this condition cavero et al 2009 this is why the differences in microclimate in the greenhouse between treatments mainly occurred during the daytime in our experiments 4 3 the impact of irrigation methods on energy acquisition and partitioning in the greenhouse the effect of irrigation on the near surface microclimate can be reflected in the energy acquisition and partitioning on the underlying surface while e t c is connected to the energy partitioning mass exchange and water use of the plant population therefore it is the basis for studying hydrological and biogeochemical processes and the energy balance of surface ecosystems lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 zhou et al 2012 so analyzing the conversion process of solar radiation to h and λ e t under different irrigation methods can help us understand the mechanism of microclimate formation in the greenhouse the cumulative water consumption of tomato during the whole growth period estimated by the breb method was well correlated with those by water balance method fig 11 but it was generally smaller and was consistent with the results obtained by crop coefficient method liu et al 2014 soil evaporation and condensation inside the mulch were not considered in the energy balance equation of the underlying surface in the greenhouse eq 13 and cannot be detected by the probe placed above the canopy of the crop wu et al 1996 there is evidence that heat flux blocked by the mulch can account for more than 11 of the available energy zhou et al 2012 the inversion above the tomato canopy and the measurement errors of t and rh in the breb system will also cause errors in flux calculation therefore the λ e t i e crop evapotranspiration obtained by the breb method in this paper still has some errors and need be further optimized nevertheless these results were reliable because for estimating crop water consumption in the greenhouse an error of 0 5 mm per day is acceptable kittas 1990 similar to our study table 6 crop evaporation factor λet r n is varies between 0 25 and 1 25 and for greenhouse tomato it generally varies in the range of 0 60 to 0 75 boulard et al 1991 tian et al 2017 while the solar radiation heating factor h r n is usually between 0 1 and 0 7 al helal and abdel ghany 2011 methods for reducing the t in the greenhouse include decreasing radiation load removing excess heat through air exchange and allocating more energy to λ e t luo et al 2005 it is generally believed that agricultural irrigation has little effect on r s r n l and r n on the underlying surface under field conditions katsoulas et al 2002 results in our study indicate that irrigation methods have no obvious impact on the energy acquisition of the underlying surface in the greenhouse the warming of near surface air mainly depends on the h that can be utilized for example the h of aerobic rice fields increased by 45 48 compared with flooded fields and the λ e t decreased by 18 19 correspondingly the average t increased by 0 2 c while average rh and vpd were 3 1 and 0 07 kpa lower respectively during the whole growth periods alberto et al 2009 our study found that more energy was converted into λ e t under furrow irrigation while h was significantly reduced indicating that the irrigation method mainly affected the microclimate in the greenhouse by changing the energy partitioning ratio of the underlying surface table 6 in the case of the orientation size structure of the greenhouse being stable the change of energy partitioning ratio mainly depends on crop characteristics lai r n above the canopy and vpd liu et al 2014 some studies showed meteorological parameters can account for 85 of the change in λ e t tian et al 2017 lai is a major factor in determining plant canopy energy partitioning hammerle et al 2008 with the increase in lai the λ e t r n gradually increases and the h r n gradually decreases katsoulas et al 2002 qiu et al 2011 vpd is significantly positively correlated with λ e t while negatively correlated with h so as vpd increases the less energy is allocated to h to warm the surrounding air in the greenhouse liu et al 2014 our results agreed with these literatures i e vpd table 3 and 4 and lai fig 5 of furrow irrigation treatment fi1 and fi2 respectively were higher than those in drip irrigation treatment di1 and di2 respectively which reduced the t and increased rh in the furrow irrigation system as for the r n h and λ e t are both raised significantly with the increment of it but the partitioning ratio is shown a downward trend katsoulas et al 2002 al helal and abdel ghany 2011 qiu et al 2011 reported similar results for greenhouse grown pepper compared with drip irrigation furrow irrigation increased the daily average λ e t and h by 37 53 and 9 23 respectively while decreased the daily average g by 7 19 meanwhile the λ e t r n increased significantly while the h r n decreased significantly under furrow irrigation which agreed with our findings 5 conclusions the present study confirmed there was a significant difference in the microclimate inside the solar greenhouse between the drip and furrow irrigation systems mainly due to the application of different irrigation amount only minor difference can be detected in microclimate if applying the same irrigation amount the significantly distinct soil hydrothermal conditions affected the growth of tomato plants and the energy matter exchange with the surrounding environment afterwards lai of tomato surface canopy coverage and surface albedo changed making more solar energy eventually allocate to sensible flux to heat the indoor air which resulted in the increment of t and vpd and the decrement of rh under drip irrigation when comparing with furrow irrigation furthermore the atmospheric environment also played a fundamental role in the formation of microclimate inside the solar greenhouse in summary we suggest that the combination of reasonable water management and flexible vent opening management can be used to regulate the partitioning of solar energy and the exchange of matter energy in the greenhouse without the active environmental control system thereby creating suitable growth environment for crops in the follow up studies on the response of crops to irrigation methods which grow in the low cost and low technology greenhouse more attention to the effects of microclimate environment on crop

10628,soil moisture dynamics in response to rainfall and irrigation events were examined using data obtained from continuous point measurements carried out under rice and wheat crops for an agricultural plot located within the ganga basin india soil moisture data were collected using sm100 and smec300 sensors at 18 subplots and at four different depths 0 80 cm during the period from 5 august 2018 to 31 march 2019 soil moisture was decomposed into temporal mean and temporal anomalies components and its variability was characterized considering both absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies they exhibited similar patterns at all the depths under rice crop cover however it varies with depth under wheat crop cover due to periodic wetting and drying conditions and temporally variable atmospheric demand similarly the spatial variance of absolute soil moisture was decomposed into time invariant and time variant components the results revealed that the time invariant component contribution was dominant at all the depths 72 49 101 46 and the contribution of each component varies with soil wetness and land cover in addition temporal stability analysis of soil moisture was carried out it was observed that the spatial pattern at surface depth cannot be preserved for subsurface depths and similar subplots were found to be temporally stable at the surface and bottom depths under different crop covers the results are expected to help improve the understanding of the nature of soil water dynamics in agricultural fields keywords soil moisture spatio temporal variability landcover temporal stability agricultural fields 1 introduction soil moisture which is a result of complex and interconnected processes is a key parameter in hydrologic and climatic studies lopez 2012 understanding its spatiotemporal variability is necessary for improving the prediction capacity of land surface climate and hydrological models koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 western et al 2002 knowledge of soil water dynamics i e soil moisture variation with time is essential for effective irrigation water management and soil erosion control under

information on hydrological processes can be obtained from the study of soil water movement especially in ungauged or data scarce catchments blume et al 2009 soil moisture dynamics varies with space

spatial heterogeneity and topography are the foremost factors lin 2006 chappell and ternan 1992 soil wetness level is the main factor that complicates soil water movement study because variations at a given scale may change with the mean wetness of a field in order to fully characterize the behavior of soil moisture variability the effects of mean soil moisture content and the extent scale of a study domain need to be considered jointly famiglietti et al 2008 to identify the factors that control soil moisture dynamics mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 decomposed absolute soil moisture into temporal mean and temporal anomalies components similarly its variance was also decomposed into time invariant temporal mean and time variant temporal anomalies plus the covariance of the two components since most of the informative part of soil moisture data is found in their temporally dynamic lot brocca et al 2012 koster et al 2009 reichle and koster 2004 seneviratne et al 2004 the temporal anomalies component is of greater interest van den hurk et al 2012 to understand the variability of soil moisture at different scales both spatially and temporally intensive samplings are required the temporal stability concept was introduced by vachaud et al 1985 to reduce the number of sampling points with minimum information loss it is the soil moisture spatial distribution temporal persistence das neves et al 2017 schneider et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 it allows for resolving issues related to the upscaling of point measurements brocca et al 2017 few measurements from temporally stable spots give the areal mean soil moisture of the site than sampling at many random points jacobs et al 2004 while many studies have analyzed soil moisture dynamics across different regions of the world these studies have been conducted for large scales with few spatial and temporal measurements brocca et al 2010 2014 cosh et al 2006 mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 moreover in an agricultural environment only a few studies exist choi and jacobs 2007 guber et al 2008 özerdem et al 2017 rossato et al 2017 while the findings of these studies can assist in hydrological modeling validating climate models loew et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2006 2010 van den hurk et al 2012 understanding land climate interactions van den hurk et al 2012 and for validation of remote sensing data parinussa et al 2013 they are of limited use to small marginal farmers in an agricultural environment soil properties and vegetation are expected to change with space and time due to crop rotation and various crop management practices fry and guber 2020 since soil moisture and other soil hydraulic properties vary even in small plots hupet and vanclooster 2002 understanding these variabilities in small plots may help marginal farmers to identify the spots where crops suffer from water stress to know the actual soil moisture status in the crop root zone and to decide on the amount of water needed therefore it becomes important to investigate if a temporally stable location can be identified in small agricultural plots and how common agricultural practices and crop cover affect the temporally stable location further the importance of the temporal anomalies component and its physical meaning has not been investigated for an agricultural environment at small scales it is also worth noting that the average farm size in the indo gangetic plain is less than 0 6 ha and it is reducing with increase in landholdings sandhu et al 2016 these farmlands are usually further fragmented by marginal farmers to support multiple crops in a growing season commonly leading to farm size of the magnitude considered in this study deininger et al 2016 monchuk et al 2010 also due to the natural variability of soil moisture distribution and scale issues related to how satellites work accurate soil moisture estimation at fine scales by remote sensing techniques is still a challenging task brocca et al 2010 choi and jacobs 2007 zhang and zhou 2016 although many algorithms such as smap ascat and smos can be used to generate soil moisture data from microwave remote sensing map it can not be used for managing small catchments or plots due to its low temporal and spatial resolution palombo et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2016 el hajj et al 2017 recently tried to map soil moisture up to plot scale by integrating different techniques but the temporal resolution issue persists generally it is difficult to get fine resolution data using remote sensing techniques which will help small scale farmers to assess soil moisture distribution in their plots all this urges the need to investigate spatio temporal dynamics of soil moisture at a scale equivalent to scattered farmer holdings this study aims to better understand the effect of soil properties atmospheric boundary conditions and crop cover on the temporal dynamics of soil moisture in small agricultural plots our hypothesis is that soil moisture control in an agricultural environment is a function of crop cover crop management practices atmospheric boundary conditions and soil depth more specifically it intends i to study the effects of landcover change on soil moisture distribution ii to investigate the effect of soil wetness level on soil moisture variability and iii to examine temporal stability and the effect of landcover change on temporal stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted in an experimental agricultural field 20 m 30 m located at the indian institute of technology kanpur 26 5168 n 80 2314 e altitude 126 m amsl in the upper gangetic plains of uttar pradesh india the plot size is representative of the scattered farm holdings of low income farmers in the region the mean annual precipitation is 801 5 mm the mean annual temperature is 32 2 c and the warmest and coolest months are may and january with a mean temperature of 41 3 c and 8 5 c respectively panwar et al 2019 the study area was divided into 24 subplots with 11 m2 each as shown in fig 1 however continuous data for two seasons were available in only 18 of them due to the malfunctioning of soil moisture sensors on the rest the analysis was done considering data from these 18 subplots only further for the rice crop for a few days soil moisture data could not be retrieved due to operational issues and those dates have been removed from the analysis three soil samples collected at 10 15 cm depth and at random locations in the field revealed that the soil in the field is silty loam with a mean 20 9 69 8 and 9 3 of sand silt and clay textures respectively 2 2 instrumentation and data collection irrigation water was applied in each subplot and measured with a water meter the rice paddy was maintained at 5 cm depth ponded water and the wheat crop was irrigated five times with varying quantities the irrigation water amount applied for the wheat crop was decided based on the wheat growing tradition of the area in consultation with the nearby farmers rainfall was recorded at a 15 minute interval by a tipping bucket rain gauge with a resolution of 0 2 mm and an accuracy of 5 virtual hydromet haridwar india installed at the field the soil was plowed up to 15 cm depth for both crops fertilizers were uniformly applied at each plot at appropriate time intervals and pesticides were used whenever required volumetric soil moisture content was measured using sm100 and smec300 sensors spectrum technologies plainfield il usa from 5 august 2018 to 31 march 2019 in each of the 18 subplots at 10 25 50 and 80 cm depths both sensors have a reported accuracy of 3 vwc watchdog 1000 series micro station was used to record the data with a 15 minute time interval both sm100 at 10 25 and 50 cm and smec300 at 80 cm soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally the sensors were calibrated based on the recommendation of the manufacturer before installation in addition a relation was developed to get the actual volumetric water content from the meter s electronic reading this relation was developed by simultaneously reading vwc by the sensors and measuring the actual vwc by weighing a perforated soil column of known volume the soil column was saturated and allowed to drain the measurement continued until the sample was dried and the overall calibration process took three weeks the calibration equation obtained was 1 v w c a c t 0 706 v w c o b s 6 542 where v w c a c t is actual soil moisture and v w c o b s is measured values by soil moisture sensors the daily evapotranspiration in both wheat and rice crop covers was calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 method from automatically collected weather data with a 15 minutes interval in the same field the reference evapotranspiration e t o for the hypothetical grass reference surface was calculated and it was multiplied by crop coefficient to get the actual evapotranspiration e t a the daily e t a was split between soil evaporation and transpiration components using the partition equation zhang et al 2004 shankar et al 2012 which is based on leaf area index lai of the crop and it is shown in fig 2 a and b the lai data was collected for both wheat and rice crops at varying intervals depending on the type of crop and its growth stage and it is shown in fig 2c root depth was measured at different crop growth stages under both crop covers and is shown in fig 2d 2 3 spatial temporal statistics soil moisture spatial and temporal statistics were used to characterize the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture the magnitude of soil moisture dispersion was examined by descriptive statistics the mean variance and standard deviation are denoted as μ σ 2 and σ respectively to make it consistent with mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 the spatial mean and variance at any time are given by 2 μ n ˆ θ t n 1 n n 1 n θ t n 3 σ n ˆ 2 θ t n 1 n 1 n 1 n θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n 2 where θ t n is absolute soil moisture observed at time t and subplot n and n ˆ and t ˆ denotes spatial and temporal mean respectively similarly the temporal mean for each site can also be expressed as 4 μ t ˆ θ t n 1 t t 1 t θ t n where n and t are the number of subplots and the number of sampling periods respectively 2 4 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 decomposed θ t n into its temporal mean μ t ˆ θ t n and temporal anomalies a t n components to identify the role of time invariant and time variant factors that control soil moisture dynamics the same approach has been utilized in this study and has been briefly reproduced below let the long term mean μ t ˆ θ t n be designated as m t n the observed soil moisture can be written as 5 θ t n m t n a t n similarly the spatial variance of absolute soil moisture σ n ˆ 2 θ t n can be disintegrated into its components mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 as follows 6 σ n ˆ 2 θ t n σ n ˆ 2 m t n σ n ˆ 2 a t n 2 c o v n ˆ m t n a t n where σ n ˆ 2 m t n and σ n ˆ 2 a t n are the spatial variances of temporal mean and temporal anomalies c o v n ˆ m t n a t n is the covariance of temporal mean and temporal anomalies and can be calculated by eqs 2 and 3 by substituting m and a in place of θ respectively eq 6 allows us to examine the individual contributions of each component 2 5 soil moisture temporal stability the temporal stability of soil moisture was described by the mean and standard deviation of relative differences rds the relative differences δ θ t n can be computed from 7 δ θ t n θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n the relative differences of the temporal mean mrd and variance vrd can be calculated from eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 μ t ˆ δ θ t n 1 t t 1 t δ θ t n and 9 σ t ˆ 2 δ θ t n 1 t 1 t 1 t δ θ t n μ t ˆ δ θ t n 2 mrd measures the wetness or dryness of a subplot relative to the spatial mean and relative difference s temporal persistence was measured by vrd gao et al 2015 a negative and positive mrd value indicates that the subplot is drier and wetter than the mean respectively the vrd tells how variable such an estimate is ranks of subplots were obtained by sorting mrd of all subplots the most representative subplot was a subplot with a minimum absolute value of mrd and a lower vrd indicates the temporal persistence of the bias for a given subplot the temporal stability of absolute soil moisture and its components were examined using the difference between spatial mean and the corresponding parameter θ t n m t n or a t n based on mrd analysis mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 since the temporal mean is time invariant it is impossible to study its relations with absolute soil moisture based on vrd analysis to fill this gap gao et al 2015 linked μ n ˆ θ t n with temporal mean and temporal anomalies as described by the following expressions 10 δ m t n m t n μ n ˆ θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n and 11 δ a t n a t n μ n ˆ θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n where δ m t n and δ a t n are the relative differences of temporal mean and temporal anomalies respectively analogs to eq 6 one then will have 12 σ t ˆ 2 δ θ t n σ t ˆ 2 δ m t n σ t ˆ 2 δ a t n 2 c o v δ m t n δ a t n where σ t ˆ 2 δ θ t n σ t ˆ 2 δ m t n and σ t ˆ 2 δ a t n are the temporal variance of δ θ t n δ m t n and δ a t n respectively c o v δ m t n δ a t n is the covariance of the relative differences of time invariant and time variant components many studies have used nonparametric spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s to examine the temporal stability of soil water content e g martinez fernandez and ceballos 2003 peng et al 2016 penna et al 2013 vachaud et al 1985 it is defined as 13 r s 1 6 i 1 n r a b s i r c o m p i 2 n n 2 1 where r a b s i and r c o m p i are the ranks of absolute soil moisture and its components measured at subplot i respectively and n is the total number of subplots absolute soil moisture will show a perfect spatial pattern agreement with the component in question when r s is equal to one in this study both mrd and vrd based r s were computed to examine the relationship of absolute soil moisture temporal stability with its components 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal patterns of absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies the soil moisture dynamics in response to the imposed evapotranspiration and rainfall irrigation under rice and wheat crop covers were analyzed figs 3 and 4 show temporal dynamics of rainfall and irrigation in addition to the spatial means of temporal anomalies and absolute soil moisture at different soil depths under rice and wheat crop covers since soil moisture distribution under ponded water was mainly controlled by time invariant properties absolute soil moisture exhibited similar temporal trends with temporal anomalies at all the depths under rice crop cover however the trends vary with depth under wheat crop cover due to periodic wetting and drying conditions and temporally variable atmospheric demand both absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies responded promptly to water application at 10 and 25 cm depths and it is not significantly visible at the bottom layers i e at 50 and 80 cm depths this is mainly because water takes some time to infiltrate and the amount of added water reaching the subsurface depths decreases with depth absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies exhibited identical temporal trends at the surface depth and parallel trends at subsurface depths except in the last week at the near surface depths where soil moisture was lower due to higher evaporation the mean absolute soil moisture varies from 27 72 at the surface depth to 30 92 at the bottom depth under rice crop cover and 24 81 at the surface depth to 30 51 at the bottom depth under wheat crop cover the higher moisture difference observed between the two crops at the surface depth and the comparable values at the bottom depth reveal the reducing effect of ponded water under rice crop cover the range of mean temporal anomalies decreases with depth it varies between 3 63 3 70 and 12 14 5 01 at the surface depth and 3 15 1 52 and 3 33 2 71 at the bottom depth under rice and wheat crop covers respectively since soil moisture distribution under rice crop cover was controlled by time invariant factors due to ponding the mean temporal anomalies were much lower near the surface as compared to that of under wheat crop cover however the difference was not significant at the bottom depth because the effect of dynamic factors decreases as a result soil moisture stability increases with depth as shown in table 1 the mean values of absolute soil moisture standard deviation increase with depth under rice cover it is due to the homogenizing effect of ponded water on the near surface depths in contrast a higher standard deviation was observed at 10 cm depth relative to 25 and 50 cm depths under wheat crop cover it may be due to tillage which influences soil water storage and hydraulic conductivity xu and mermoud 2001 and resulted in increasing absolute soil moisture standard deviation at the surface as compared to the layer immediately below it temporal anomalies exhibited a distinct profile mean standard deviation distribution from the absolute soil moisture it shows a nonmonotonic trend which is higher at the surface then reduces and further increases at the bottom depths under both crop covers this shows the distinct vertical patterns of spatial variability of temporal anomalies and absolute soil moisture temporal anomalies standard deviation was much lower than that of absolute soil moisture and it concurs with the findings of recent studies e g brocca et al 2014 gao et al 2015 mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 when the temporal mean is subtracted a reduction of 44 39 65 45 and 45 96 66 79 in the temporal anomalies spatial standard deviation at different depths were found as compared to that of absolute soil moisture under rice and wheat crop covers respectively 3 2 soil wetness effect on spatial variability since absolute soil moisture exhibited similar trends as that of temporal anomalies brocca et al 2014 mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 and are positively and highly correlated gao et al 2015 its total variance was related to its components this will help us to examine how each variance component responds to soil wetness level changes as shown in fig 5 under rice crop cover all the variables exhibited lower variability at the surface depth it is related to the ponded water which diminishes the soil moisture variability at the near surface depths combined with the homogenizing effect of vegetation there was a relatively higher variability at lower moisture content and it decreases with increasing wetness at the subsurface depths under wheat crop cover soil moisture range where variability is found to be lower varies with depth i e it was observed when soil is wet at the surface depth and at the intermediate wetness at subsurface depths the absolute soil moisture spatial variance was high when the soil moisture was between 12 and 20 and there was a general declining trend as wetness increases at the surface depth and it agrees with brocca et al 2007 diurnal variation was also visible with clearly defined ranges when the soil moisture level is low it is due to soil water redistribution and dew formation in the early mornings at both 25 and 50 cm depths a concave upward relationship was observed it disagrees with the convex upward relationship reported on soil moisture data collected at 15 cm depth by brocca et al 2010 on a grass dominated agricultural landscape it may be due to the difference in the depth of observation the high variability spots observed at 50 and 80 cm depths were due to high soil moisture recorded for a few days at subplots 7 and 6 under rice and wheat crops respectively the temporal anomalies show the behavior of absolute soil moisture when only its dynamic components are considered unlike what is reported in gao et al 2015 temporal anomalies variance change with soil wetness and corresponds to that of absolute soil moisture it indicates that time variant factors primarily determine the trend of absolute soil moisture the variability range of temporal anomalies decreases with increasing depth due to the temporal stability of soil moisture at deeper depths in contrast to the study of gao et al 2015 who found a very similar pattern between absolute soil moisture variance and covariance with soil wetness level a clearly defined relationship was not observed in this study under both rice and wheat crop covers it is mainly due to the consistently similar trends of temporal anomalies and absolute soil moisture the response of covariance to soil wetness change also varied with depth it was negative at lower soil moisture values and it approaches zero for intermediate and higher wetness at the surface depth under rice crop cover under wheat crop cover it was positive for low values of soil wetness it fluctuates between positive and negative values for intermediate wetness and was negative for high wetness conditions at the surface depth a near zero value was observed at subsurface depths at lower soil moisture and negative at intermediate wetness the effect of landcover on covariance contribution can be clearly observed at the surface depth 3 3 contributions to the total variance the total variance of absolute soil moisture is a combination of the variances of its temporal mean time invariant temporal anomalies time variant and the covariance time variant of the two eq 6 as shown in figs 6 and 7 the components contribution changes with soil wetness land cover and depth of observation the time invariant component contribution was dominant at all the depths under both crop covers under rice crop cover no significant variability for a specific period was observed due to ponding as it is shown under wheat crop cover at the surface depth the temporal mean component contribution was almost constant throughout the season the temporal anomalies and covariance components contribution were higher as compared to subsurface depths under wheat crop cover since soil moisture was much higher than the seasonal average when there was irrigation combined with low evapotranspiration the variability in all variance components was high in those periods though there were significant differences between them temporal mean and temporal anomalies contributions exhibited similar temporal trends most of the time at the surface depth high at the vegetation stage and irrigation application periods and low when there was no water application however when there is high evaporation and no water added as it is observed in the last couple of weeks fig 7a temporal anomalies contribution surpasses that of the temporal mean it indicates that the role of the time variant factors is high at lower moisture contents when the soil is wet the covariance was negative and it was near zero otherwise a possible inverse relationship between the factors that control temporal anomalies and temporal mean may be the reason for its negative contribution as shown in table 2 the spatial mean time invariant contribution range varies with land cover it was between 50 68 184 26 and 24 43 326 06 under rice and wheat crop cover at the surface depth respectively due to low evapotranspiration level field and higher antecedent soil moisture content at the subsurface depths which results in lower infiltration rate the near surface depths high wetness lasts longer as a result the maximum variances were observed after the first irrigation the spatial mean temporal anomalies variance share ranges from 8 26 114 11 on average 31 63 under rice crop cover and 8 14 168 75 on average 32 82 under wheat crop cover the covariance contribution was from 160 13 11 07 on average 33 08 under rice cover and 385 52 36 39 on average 33 46 under wheat crop cover low variability ranges were observed under rice crop cover because of the ponded water though there were periodic wetting and drying under wheat cover which may facilitate water movement as cracks and new pores may be created rasse et al 2000 the seasonal mean variances of all components were almost equal to the rice season the differences were only 0 82 1 19 and 0 38 in temporal mean temporal anomalies and covariance components respectively at the surface depth faisal 2019 measured soil hydraulic properties of van genuchten 1980 for each plot under rice crop cover and on a 10 m 10 m grid with 1 m spacing 100 samples within the study plot on a barren land after the harvesting of the wheat crop at 10 cm depth he found a very small change in the mean soil hydraulic properties it may be difficult to directly compare these results due to the difference in the scale of data collection however considering the small study area and similarity in soil properties in addition to the observed seasonal mean variance similarity it is possible to say that the effect of landcover change and crop management practices on mean soil moisture distribution at the surface depth is negligible the total time variant contribution covariance plus temporal anomalies at the surface depth was 1 46 and 0 64 only under rice and wheat crop covers respectively the temporal mean component spatial variability is time invariant and it was greater than that of the absolute soil moisture as shown in fig 6a except in the last couple of weeks and in fig 7a after the first irrigation its contribution is greater than 100 at the surface depth in such cases the contribution of covariance is negative and higher it indicates that the contrasting interaction between the factors controlling time variant and time invariant components is high when the soil moisture is very high at the bottom layer time variant contribution jumps to 27 52 and 24 94 under rice and wheat crop covers respectively it is due to the positive relationship between the factors controlling temporally static and dynamic components which results in higher and positive covariance share the results indicate that the temporal mean component contribution was significantly higher and its relation with time variant factors varies with depth this implies that the role of time variant factors is visible only in the near surface depths previous studies also reported similar results the time invariant component contribution at any point was high mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 gao et al 2015 in this study its mean contribution ranges between 72 49 101 46 at all the depths under both rice and wheat crop covers at the 10 cm depth it is higher than what was reported by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 for a study area of 31 500 km2 at an equivalent depth of 5 cm where it was found to be 94 it may be related to the size soil properties and levelness in our study plot soil properties are the main time invariant factors in smaller agricultural plots as compared to larger catchments the mean contribution of temporal anomalies in this study was 31 63 and 32 82 at the surface depth under rice and wheat crop covers respectively which is higher than 9 reported by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 though temporal anomalies share was higher the possible inverse interaction between temporal mean and temporal anomalies factors lessened the cumulative effect of time variant components contribution however gao et al 2015 reported a much lesser contribution from the time variant component 66 8 and much higher value from temporal anomalies 57 4 they attributed different spatial scales considered for the difference in magnitude since their study area was 0 58 km2 the temporal mean component contribution at small scales is expected to be lower than the of larger scales brocca et al 2014 however our small study area of 0 0006 km2 revealed that it is not always true at the subsurface depths the temporal changes of time invariant and time variant components relative contribution were similar to those observed at the surface depth the time invariant component still persists to be the dominating contributor and the temporal anomalies component share was very small the results at different depths suggest that it is impossible to assume a similar temporal pattern for both components contribution for surface and subsurface layers the effect of soil wetness on each variance component contribution was also qualitatively characterized and the results are shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the soil wetness level significantly affects the components contributions under rice crop cover the wetness range is small due to the ponded water at the surface depth the contribution of the temporal mean was higher at lower wetness and it shows a general reduction with increasing wetness higher contributions of temporal mean 150 at lower wetness show the dominating effect of time invariant factors similar trends were observed at subsurface depths the variability of all components was low at the bottom depth at lower soil moisture contents the contribution of the temporal mean was small and that of temporal anomalies was high under wheat crop cover at the surface depth the contribution of covariance was positive and near zero it shows that the time variant factors such as climatic conditions were the main factors that control soil moisture dynamics at lower soil moisture under wheat crop cover it is in contrast to what was observed under rice crop cover the variability was high at intermediate wetness with its peak observed at 26 and it decreases at higher wetness in all components at the subsurface layers the temporal mean contribution of spatial variance takes the form of concave downward as it was at the surface depth the variability was observed to be higher at the intermediate soil moisture the temporal anomalies contribution was high at lower moisture and it decreases with depth the covariance contribution is like a mirror image of that of the temporal mean 3 4 time stability analysis temporal stability analysis is used to estimate the spatial mean soil moisture content for the field using representative locations it systematically indicates whether a given location either represents the mean soil wetness of the study area or under or over estimates regardless of the observation time figs 9 and 10 show the rank ordered mrd and the associated standard deviation sdrd at all soil depths in our study area the maximum mrd of 13 33 12 70 24 67 and 29 46 under rice crop cover and 27 85 24 25 26 56 and 26 46 under wheat crop cover were found at 10 25 50 and 80 cm depths respectively lower mrd was observed near the surface depths and its increment with depth under rice crop cover is a result of ponded water under wheat crop cover the largest mrd was observed at 10 cm depth and its variability was significantly higher than the subsurface layers as it has higher sdrd it is due to tillage which may increase standard deviation at the surface depth it is also interesting to see that subplot 3 which was wetter than the average under a ponded water condition is found to be the driest subplot under wheat crop cover though the mean soil texture observed from three points on the field revealed that it is silty loam soil this subplot has higher porosity faisal 2019 and pore connectivity which may contribute to its status change though the ranges of mrd in our study were a bit higher than the values observed in vachaud et al 1985 it was much smaller than recent studies conducted in larger watersheds e g gao and shao 2012 hu et al 2010 the sdrd in this study is much smaller than what was observed in gao and shao 2012 it may be due to the relatively less spatial variability in soil and vegetation properties in our small study area temporal stability analysis of soil water content robustness was measured with sdrd values for 10 25 50 and 80 cm soil depths the mean sdrd was 3 09 3 73 4 01 and 4 17 under rice crop cover and 8 80 5 04 4 03 and 3 48 under wheat crop cover respectively the high sdrd under wheat crop cover is expected since there were seasonal wetting and drying conditions and the variability is known to be high at both ends of wetting and drying conditions the reduction of sdrd with depth under wheat crop cover indicates that soil moisture distribution stability increases with depth it is due to the reduction of the effect of hydrological climatic biological factors and agricultural activities on soil moisture distribution with depth gao and shao 2012 xu and mermoud 2001 however the increment of sdrd with depth reveals the reduction of the homogenizing effect of ponded water under rice crop cover mrd value close to 0 is not a guarantee for temporal stability coppola et al 2011 besides there must be a low standard deviation and root mean square error rmse associated with that rank rmse indicates which plot captures the best mean soil moisture a single subplot may not be the only representative of the area previous studies reported variable figures one de souza et al 2011 xu et al 2015 two coppola et al 2011 or many gao and shao 2012 hu et al 2010 vachaud et al 1985 in this study one representative subplot was found at each depth under both crop covers as shown in figs 9 and 10 and different subplots represented different depths it coincides with earlier studies de souza et al 2011 guber et al 2008 tallon and si 2003 who reported different temporally stable subplots at different depths within the same field similar subplots were found to be temporally stable at the surface and bottom depths irrespective of land cover for example subplot 9 was the temporally stable subplot at the surface depth with an mrd of 0 34 and 1 19 a standard deviation of 3 11 and 2 61 and rmse of 0 86 and 0 69 under rice and wheat crop covers respectively the representation of different depths by different temporally stable subplots may be due to soil properties heterogeneity combined with vegetation and water ponding effect it is possible to say that the equivalent seasonal mean values observed in all variance components in addition to similarity in mean soil hydraulic properties under rice cover and barren land after wheat harvesting at the surface depth were reflections of the temporal persistence of the subplot it also reinforces the hypothesis that the effect of landcover change on mean soil moisture distribution at the surface depth is negligible both mrd and vrd were considered to examine the relations of absolute soil moisture temporal stability with its components using the spearman rank correlation coefficient r s and the results were shown in table 3 a higher r s shows similarity in time stability ranks of absolute soil moisture to the component considered absolute soil moisture exhibited a very strong positive monotonic correlation with temporal mean under both rice and wheat crop covers at all the depths the correlation is especially higher under rice crop cover because of the possible ponding effect which diminishes the effect of the time variant factors however temporal anomalies correlation with absolute soil moisture showed negative monotonicity which ranges from very weak to moderate except at the surface depth under wheat crop cover it is shown that absolute soil moisture almost has no correlation with temporal anomalies at the 50 and 80 cm depths under rice crop cover it reveals that time variant factors have no effect on deeper depths however there was moderate and very weak correlation under wheat crop cover at 50 and 80 cm depths respectively which might be related to its measured 1 1 m rooting depth that is used to extract water at deeper depths under stressed conditions the mrd values showed that absolute soil moisture temporal stability reflects time invariant patterns under both crop covers this agrees with the findings of mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 and gao et al 2015 which are obtained from large scale observations and small catchments respectively this indicates that time stability of soil moisture at both small and large scales is mainly controlled by time invariant factors which concurs with recent studies hu et al 2010 hu and si 2016 jia et al 2015 at subsurface depths absolute soil moisture was very strongly correlated with temporal mean however it showed a negative monotonic and a variable from a very weak to moderate correlation with temporal anomalies the negative r s tells that the factors controlling time variant and time invariant components have an inverse relationship table 4 shows the results of vrd based temporal stability analysis under rice crop cover absolute soil moisture exhibited almost zero correlation with temporal mean moderate correlation with temporal anomalies and very weak and negative correlation with covariance at the surface depth similar relations were observed at subsurface depths with temporal mean and covariance but it exhibited a strong correlation with temporal anomalies absolute soil moisture revealed a negative and very weak correlation with temporal mean under wheat crop cover at the surface depth though absolute soil moisture showed very similar soil moisture temporal patterns with temporal anomalies figs 3 and 4 the vrd based r s between them is weak at the near surface depths it may be due to the inclusion of both negative and positive values in temporal anomalies while absolute soil moisture considers only positive values gao et al 2015 absolute soil moisture shows a moderate correlation with the covariance component at the surface depth and this relation decreases with depth because the variance relation was more explainable by the anomalies component this indicates that absolute soil moisture time stability based on vrd analysis characterizes neither of the variance components patterns the vrd based results are different from mrd based ones this explains that the parameters used either mrd or vrd for the temporal stability analysis determine the relationship between absolute soil moisture and its components 4 conclusions in this study variability and temporal stability of soil moisture were examined at different soil depths under rice and wheat cropped agricultural plot located at the indian institute of technology kanpur india it was found that soil moisture distribution under rice crop cover was mainly controlled by time invariant factors and absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies exhibited similar patterns with time at all the depths however it varied with depth under wheat crop cover due to periodic wetting and drying conditions and temporally variable atmospheric demand the mean absolute soil moisture variance vertical distribution varied with land cover it increased with depth under rice cover due to the homogenizing effect of ponded water and it decreased with depth under wheat crop cover due to the reducing effect of time variant factors the contribution of variance components changes with soil wetness land cover and depth of observation though its share varies with crop cover and depth the time invariant component contribution was always high a variation in the contribution of components with depth suggests that it is impossible to assume a similar temporal pattern for both components at surface and subsurface layers soil wetness level significantly affects the contribution of each component it iwas observed that as soil wetness changes the factors controlling soil moisture dynamics change with land cover for example time invariant and time variant factors were the main factors that control soil moisture dynamics at lower soil moisture under rice and wheat crop covers respectively mean and variance of relative differences were used for temporal stability analysis vertical mrd trend was observed to vary with landcover it increases and decreases with depth under rice and wheat crop covers respectively higher standard deviation of rd was observed at near surface depths under wheat crop cover due to the seasonal wetting and drying conditions and the variability was known to be high at both ends of wetting and drying conditions one representative subplot was identified at each depth under both crop covers different subplots represented different depths and similar subplots were representative at the surface and bottom depths under different crop covers suggesting that crop management practices do not affect the time stable location declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10628,soil moisture dynamics in response to rainfall and irrigation events were examined using data obtained from continuous point measurements carried out under rice and wheat crops for an agricultural plot located within the ganga basin india soil moisture data were collected using sm100 and smec300 sensors at 18 subplots and at four different depths 0 80 cm during the period from 5 august 2018 to 31 march 2019 soil moisture was decomposed into temporal mean and temporal anomalies components and its variability was characterized considering both absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies they exhibited similar patterns at all the depths under rice crop cover however it varies with depth under wheat crop cover due to periodic wetting and drying conditions and temporally variable atmospheric demand similarly the spatial variance of absolute soil moisture was decomposed into time invariant and time variant components the results revealed that the time invariant component contribution was dominant at all the depths 72 49 101 46 and the contribution of each component varies with soil wetness and land cover in addition temporal stability analysis of soil moisture was carried out it was observed that the spatial pattern at surface depth cannot be preserved for subsurface depths and similar subplots were found to be temporally stable at the surface and bottom depths under different crop covers the results are expected to help improve the understanding of the nature of soil water dynamics in agricultural fields keywords soil moisture spatio

information on hydrological processes can be obtained from the study of soil water movement especially in ungauged or data scarce catchments blume et al 2009 soil moisture dynamics varies with space season wetness level wetting and drying cycles and depth it is mainly controlled by soil properties famiglietti et al 1999 vereecken et al 2007 topography famiglietti et al 1998 zhou et al 2007 vegetation covers and rainfall famiglietti et al 1999 teuling and troch 2005 climate teuling et al 2007 and antecedent soil moisture ivanov et al 2010 jacques et al 2001 however soil properties spatial heterogeneity and topography are the foremost factors lin 2006 chappell and ternan 1992 soil wetness level is the main factor that complicates soil water movement study because variations at a given scale may change with the mean wetness of a field in order to fully characterize the behavior of soil moisture variability the effects of mean soil moisture content and the extent scale of a study domain need to be considered jointly famiglietti et al 2008 to identify the factors that control soil moisture dynamics mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 decomposed absolute soil moisture into temporal mean and temporal anomalies components similarly its variance was also decomposed into time invariant temporal mean and time variant temporal anomalies plus the covariance of the two components since most of the informative part of soil moisture data is found in their temporally dynamic lot brocca et al 2012 koster et al 2009 reichle and koster 2004 seneviratne et al 2004 the temporal anomalies component is of greater interest van den hurk et al 2012 to understand the variability of soil moisture at different scales both spatially and temporally intensive samplings are required the temporal stability concept was introduced by vachaud et al 1985 to reduce the number of sampling points with minimum information loss it is the soil moisture spatial distribution temporal persistence das neves et al 2017 schneider et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 it allows for resolving issues related to the upscaling of point measurements brocca et al 2017 few measurements from temporally stable spots give the areal mean soil moisture of the site than sampling at many random points jacobs et al 2004 while many studies have analyzed soil moisture dynamics across different regions of the world these studies have been conducted for large scales with few spatial and temporal measurements brocca et al 2010 2014 cosh et al 2006 mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 moreover in an agricultural environment only a few studies exist choi and jacobs 2007 guber et al 2008 özerdem et al 2017 rossato et al 2017 while the findings of these studies can assist in hydrological modeling validating climate models loew et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2006 2010 van den hurk et al 2012 understanding land climate interactions van den hurk et al 2012 and for validation of remote sensing data parinussa et al 2013 they are of limited use to small marginal farmers in an agricultural environment soil properties and vegetation are expected to change with space and time due to crop rotation and various crop management practices fry and guber 2020 since soil moisture and other soil hydraulic properties vary even in small plots hupet and vanclooster 2002 understanding these variabilities in small plots may help marginal farmers to identify the spots where crops suffer from water stress to know the actual soil moisture status in the crop root zone and to decide on the amount of water needed therefore it becomes important to investigate if a temporally stable location can be identified in small agricultural plots and how common agricultural practices and crop cover affect the temporally stable location further the importance of the temporal anomalies component and its physical meaning has not been investigated for an agricultural environment at small scales it is also worth noting that the average farm size in the indo gangetic plain is less than 0 6 ha and it is reducing with increase in landholdings sandhu et al 2016 these farmlands are usually further fragmented by marginal farmers to support multiple crops in a growing season commonly leading to farm size of the magnitude considered in this study deininger et al 2016 monchuk et al 2010 also due to the natural variability of soil moisture distribution and scale issues related to how satellites work accurate soil moisture estimation at fine scales by remote sensing techniques is still a challenging task brocca et al 2010 choi and jacobs 2007 zhang and zhou 2016 although many algorithms such as smap ascat and smos can be used to generate soil moisture data from microwave remote sensing map it can not be used for managing small catchments or plots due to its low temporal and spatial resolution palombo et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2016 el hajj et al 2017 recently tried to map soil moisture up to plot scale by integrating different techniques but the temporal resolution issue persists generally it is difficult to get fine resolution data using remote sensing techniques which will help small scale farmers to assess soil moisture distribution in their plots all this urges the need to investigate spatio temporal dynamics of soil moisture at a scale equivalent to scattered farmer holdings this study aims to better understand the effect of soil properties atmospheric boundary conditions and crop cover on the temporal dynamics of soil moisture in small agricultural plots our hypothesis is that soil moisture control in an agricultural environment is a function of crop cover crop management practices atmospheric boundary conditions and soil depth more specifically it intends i to study the effects of landcover change on soil moisture distribution ii to investigate the effect of soil wetness level on soil moisture variability and iii to examine temporal stability and the effect of landcover change on temporal stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted in an experimental agricultural field 20 m 30 m located at the indian institute of technology kanpur 26 5168 n 80 2314 e altitude 126 m amsl in the upper gangetic plains of uttar pradesh india the plot size is representative of the scattered farm holdings of low income farmers in the region the mean annual precipitation is 801 5 mm the mean annual temperature is 32 2 c and the warmest and coolest months are may and january with a mean temperature of 41 3 c and 8 5 c respectively panwar et al 2019 the study area was divided into 24 subplots with 11 m2 each as shown in fig 1 however continuous data for two seasons were available in only 18 of them due to the malfunctioning of soil moisture sensors on the rest the analysis was done considering data from these 18 subplots only further for the rice crop for a few days soil moisture data could not be retrieved due to operational issues and those dates have been removed from the analysis three soil samples collected at 10 15 cm depth and at random locations in the field revealed that the soil in the field is silty loam with a mean 20 9 69 8 and 9 3 of sand silt and clay textures respectively 2 2 instrumentation and data collection irrigation water was applied in each subplot and measured with a water meter the rice paddy was maintained at 5 cm depth ponded water and the wheat crop was irrigated five times with varying quantities the irrigation water amount applied for the wheat crop was decided based on the wheat growing tradition of the area in consultation with the nearby farmers rainfall was recorded at a 15 minute interval by a tipping bucket rain gauge with a resolution of 0 2 mm and an accuracy of 5 virtual hydromet haridwar india installed at the field the soil was plowed up to 15 cm depth for both crops fertilizers were uniformly applied at each plot at appropriate time intervals and pesticides were used whenever required volumetric soil moisture content was measured using sm100 and smec300 sensors spectrum technologies plainfield il usa from 5 august 2018 to 31 march 2019 in each of the 18 subplots at 10 25 50 and 80 cm depths both sensors have a reported accuracy of 3 vwc watchdog 1000 series micro station was used to record the data with a 15 minute time interval both sm100 at 10 25 and 50 cm and smec300 at 80 cm soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally the sensors were calibrated based on the recommendation of the manufacturer before installation in addition a relation was developed to get the actual volumetric water content from the meter s electronic reading this relation was developed by simultaneously reading vwc by the sensors and measuring the actual vwc by weighing a perforated soil column of known volume the soil column was saturated and allowed to drain the measurement continued until the sample was dried and the overall calibration process took three weeks the calibration equation obtained was 1 v w c a c t 0 706 v w c o b s 6 542 where v w c a c t is actual soil moisture and v w c o b s is measured values by soil moisture sensors the daily evapotranspiration in both wheat and rice crop covers was calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 method from automatically collected weather data with a 15 minutes interval in the same field the reference evapotranspiration e t o for the hypothetical grass reference surface was calculated and it was multiplied by crop coefficient to get the actual evapotranspiration e t a the daily e t a was split between soil evaporation and transpiration components using the partition equation zhang et al 2004 shankar et al 2012 which is based on leaf area index lai of the crop and it is shown in fig 2 a and b the lai data was collected for both wheat and rice crops at varying intervals depending on the type of crop and its growth stage and it is shown in fig 2c root depth was measured at different crop growth stages under both crop covers and is shown in fig 2d 2 3 spatial temporal statistics soil moisture spatial and temporal statistics were used to characterize the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture the magnitude of soil moisture dispersion was examined by descriptive statistics the mean variance and standard deviation are denoted as μ σ 2 and σ respectively to make it consistent with mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 the spatial mean and variance at any time are given by 2 μ n ˆ θ t n 1 n n 1 n θ t n 3 σ n ˆ 2 θ t n 1 n 1 n 1 n θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n 2 where θ t n is absolute soil moisture observed at time t and subplot n and n ˆ and t ˆ denotes spatial and temporal mean respectively similarly the temporal mean for each site can also be expressed as 4 μ t ˆ θ t n 1 t t 1 t θ t n where n and t are the number of subplots and the number of sampling periods respectively 2 4 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 decomposed θ t n into its temporal mean μ t ˆ θ t n and temporal anomalies a t n components to identify the role of time invariant and time variant factors that control soil moisture dynamics the same approach has been utilized in this study and has been briefly reproduced below let the long term mean μ t ˆ θ t n be designated as m t n the observed soil moisture can be written as 5 θ t n m t n a t n similarly the spatial variance of absolute soil moisture σ n ˆ 2 θ t n can be disintegrated into its components mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 as follows 6 σ n ˆ 2 θ t n σ n ˆ 2 m t n σ n ˆ 2 a t n 2 c o v n ˆ m t n a t n where σ n ˆ 2 m t n and σ n ˆ 2 a t n are the spatial variances of temporal mean and temporal anomalies c o v n ˆ m t n a t n is the covariance of temporal mean and temporal anomalies and can be calculated by eqs 2 and 3 by substituting m and a in place of θ respectively eq 6 allows us to examine the individual contributions of each component 2 5 soil moisture temporal stability the temporal stability of soil moisture was described by the mean and standard deviation of relative differences rds the relative differences δ θ t n can be computed from 7 δ θ t n θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n the relative differences of the temporal mean mrd and variance vrd can be calculated from eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 μ t ˆ δ θ t n 1 t t 1 t δ θ t n and 9 σ t ˆ 2 δ θ t n 1 t 1 t 1 t δ θ t n μ t ˆ δ θ t n 2 mrd measures the wetness or dryness of a subplot relative to the spatial mean and relative difference s temporal persistence was measured by vrd gao et al 2015 a negative and positive mrd value indicates that the subplot is drier and wetter than the mean respectively the vrd tells how variable such an estimate is ranks of subplots were obtained by sorting mrd of all subplots the most representative subplot was a subplot with a minimum absolute value of mrd and a lower vrd indicates the temporal persistence of the bias for a given subplot the temporal stability of absolute soil moisture and its components were examined using the difference between spatial mean and the corresponding parameter θ t n m t n or a t n based on mrd analysis mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 since the temporal mean is time invariant it is impossible to study its relations with absolute soil moisture based on vrd analysis to fill this gap gao et al 2015 linked μ n ˆ θ t n with temporal mean and temporal anomalies as described by the following expressions 10 δ m t n m t n μ n ˆ θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n and 11 δ a t n a t n μ n ˆ θ t n μ n ˆ θ t n where δ m t n and δ a t n are the relative differences of temporal mean and temporal anomalies respectively analogs to eq 6 one then will have 12 σ t ˆ 2 δ θ t n σ t ˆ 2 δ m t n σ t ˆ 2 δ a t n 2 c o v δ m t n δ a t n where σ t ˆ 2 δ θ t n σ t ˆ 2 δ m t n and σ t ˆ 2 δ a t n are the temporal variance of δ θ t n δ m t n and δ a t n respectively c o v δ m t n δ a t n is the covariance of the relative differences of time invariant and time variant components many studies have used nonparametric spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s to examine the temporal stability of soil water content e g martinez fernandez and ceballos 2003 peng et al 2016 penna et al 2013 vachaud et al 1985 it is defined as 13 r s 1 6 i 1 n r a b s i r c o m p i 2 n n 2 1 where r a b s i and r c o m p i are the ranks of absolute soil moisture and its components measured at subplot i respectively and n is the total number of subplots absolute soil moisture will show a perfect spatial pattern agreement with the component in question when r s is equal to one in this study both mrd and vrd based r s were computed to examine the relationship of absolute soil moisture temporal stability with its components 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal patterns of absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies the soil moisture dynamics in response to the imposed evapotranspiration and rainfall irrigation under rice and wheat crop covers were analyzed figs 3 and 4 show temporal dynamics of rainfall and irrigation in addition to the spatial means of temporal anomalies and absolute soil moisture at different soil depths under rice and wheat crop covers since soil moisture distribution under ponded water was mainly controlled by time invariant properties absolute soil moisture exhibited similar temporal trends with temporal anomalies at all the depths under rice crop cover however the trends vary with depth under wheat crop cover due to periodic wetting and drying conditions and temporally variable atmospheric demand both absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies responded promptly to water application at 10 and 25 cm depths and it is not significantly visible at the bottom layers i e at 50 and 80 cm depths this is mainly because water takes some time to infiltrate and the amount of added water reaching the subsurface depths decreases with depth absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies exhibited identical temporal trends at the surface depth and parallel trends at subsurface depths except in the last week at the near surface depths where soil moisture was lower due to higher evaporation the mean absolute soil moisture varies from 27 72 at the surface depth to 30 92 at the bottom depth under rice crop cover and 24 81 at the surface depth to 30 51 at the bottom depth under wheat crop cover the higher moisture difference observed between the two crops at the surface depth and the comparable values at the bottom depth reveal the reducing effect of ponded water under rice crop cover the range of mean temporal anomalies decreases with depth it varies between 3 63 3 70 and 12 14 5 01 at the surface depth and 3 15 1 52 and 3 33 2 71 at the bottom depth under rice and wheat crop covers respectively since soil moisture distribution under rice crop cover was controlled by time invariant factors due to ponding the mean temporal anomalies were much lower near the surface as compared to that of under wheat crop cover however the difference was not significant at the bottom depth because the effect of dynamic factors decreases as a result soil moisture stability increases with depth as shown in table 1 the mean values of absolute soil moisture standard deviation increase with depth under rice cover it is due to the homogenizing effect of ponded water on the near surface depths in contrast a higher standard deviation was observed at 10 cm depth relative to 25 and 50 cm depths under wheat crop cover it may be due to tillage which influences soil water storage and hydraulic conductivity xu and mermoud 2001 and resulted in increasing absolute soil moisture standard deviation at the surface as compared to the layer immediately below it temporal anomalies exhibited a distinct profile mean standard deviation distribution from the absolute soil moisture it shows a nonmonotonic trend which is higher at the surface then reduces and further increases at the bottom depths under both crop covers this shows the distinct vertical patterns of spatial variability of temporal anomalies and absolute soil moisture temporal anomalies standard deviation was much lower than that of absolute soil moisture and it concurs with the findings of recent studies e g brocca et al 2014 gao et al 2015 mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 when the temporal mean is subtracted a reduction of 44 39 65 45 and 45 96 66 79 in the temporal anomalies spatial standard deviation at different depths were found as compared to that of absolute soil moisture under rice and wheat crop covers respectively 3 2 soil wetness effect on spatial variability since absolute soil moisture exhibited similar trends as that of temporal anomalies brocca et al 2014 mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 and are positively and highly correlated gao et al 2015 its total variance was related to its components this will help us to examine how each variance component responds to soil wetness level changes as shown in fig 5 under rice crop cover all the variables exhibited lower variability at the surface depth it is related to the ponded water which diminishes the soil moisture variability at the near surface depths combined with the homogenizing effect of vegetation there was a relatively higher variability at lower moisture content and it decreases with increasing wetness at the subsurface depths under wheat crop cover soil moisture range where variability is found to be lower varies with depth i e it was observed when soil is wet at the surface depth and at the intermediate wetness at subsurface depths the absolute soil moisture spatial variance was high when the soil moisture was between 12 and 20 and there was a general declining trend as wetness increases at the surface depth and it agrees with brocca et al 2007 diurnal variation was also visible with clearly defined ranges when the soil moisture level is low it is due to soil water redistribution and dew formation in the early mornings at both 25 and 50 cm depths a concave upward relationship was observed it disagrees with the convex upward relationship reported on soil moisture data collected at 15 cm depth by brocca et al 2010 on a grass dominated agricultural landscape it may be due to the difference in the depth of observation the high variability spots observed at 50 and 80 cm depths were due to high soil moisture recorded for a few days at subplots 7 and 6 under rice and wheat crops respectively the temporal anomalies show the behavior of absolute soil moisture when only its dynamic components are considered unlike what is reported in gao et al 2015 temporal anomalies variance change with soil wetness and corresponds to that of absolute soil moisture it indicates that time variant factors primarily determine the trend of absolute soil moisture the variability range of temporal anomalies decreases with increasing depth due to the temporal stability of soil moisture at deeper depths in contrast to the study of gao et al 2015 who found a very similar pattern between absolute soil moisture variance and covariance with soil wetness level a clearly defined relationship was not observed in this study under both rice and wheat crop covers it is mainly due to the consistently similar trends of temporal anomalies and absolute soil moisture the response of covariance to soil wetness change also varied with depth it was negative at lower soil moisture values and it approaches zero for intermediate and higher wetness at the surface depth under rice crop cover under wheat crop cover it was positive for low values of soil wetness it fluctuates between positive and negative values for intermediate wetness and was negative for high wetness conditions at the surface depth a near zero value was observed at subsurface depths at lower soil moisture and negative at intermediate wetness the effect of landcover on covariance contribution can be clearly observed at the surface depth 3 3 contributions to the total variance the total variance of absolute soil moisture is a combination of the variances of its temporal mean time invariant temporal anomalies time variant and the covariance time variant of the two eq 6 as shown in figs 6 and 7 the components contribution changes with soil wetness land cover and depth of observation the time invariant component contribution was dominant at all the depths under both crop covers under rice crop cover no significant variability for a specific period was observed due to ponding as it is shown under wheat crop cover at the surface depth the temporal mean component contribution was almost constant throughout the season the temporal anomalies and covariance components contribution were higher as compared to subsurface depths under wheat crop cover since soil moisture was much higher than the seasonal average when there was irrigation combined with low evapotranspiration the variability in all variance components was high in those periods though there were significant differences between them temporal mean and temporal anomalies contributions exhibited similar temporal trends most of the time at the surface depth high at the vegetation stage and irrigation application periods and low when there was no water application however when there is high evaporation and no water added as it is observed in the last couple of weeks fig 7a temporal anomalies contribution surpasses that of the temporal mean it indicates that the role of the time variant factors is high at lower moisture contents when the soil is wet the covariance was negative and it was near zero otherwise a possible inverse relationship between the factors that control temporal anomalies and temporal mean may be the reason for its negative contribution as shown in table 2 the spatial mean time invariant contribution range varies with land cover it was between 50 68 184 26 and 24 43 326 06 under rice and wheat crop cover at the surface depth respectively due to low evapotranspiration level field and higher antecedent soil moisture content at the subsurface depths which results in lower infiltration rate the near surface depths high wetness lasts longer as a result the maximum variances were observed after the first irrigation the spatial mean temporal anomalies variance share ranges from 8 26 114 11 on average 31 63 under rice crop cover and 8 14 168 75 on average 32 82 under wheat crop cover the covariance contribution was from 160 13 11 07 on average 33 08 under rice cover and 385 52 36 39 on average 33 46 under wheat crop cover low variability ranges were observed under rice crop cover because of the ponded water though there were periodic wetting and drying under wheat cover which may facilitate water movement as cracks and new pores may be created rasse et al 2000 the seasonal mean variances of all components were almost equal to the rice season the differences were only 0 82 1 19 and 0 38 in temporal mean temporal anomalies and covariance components respectively at the surface depth faisal 2019 measured soil hydraulic properties of van genuchten 1980 for each plot under rice crop cover and on a 10 m 10 m grid with 1 m spacing 100 samples within the study plot on a barren land after the harvesting of the wheat crop at 10 cm depth he found a very small change in the mean soil hydraulic properties it may be difficult to directly compare these results due to the difference in the scale of data collection however considering the small study area and similarity in soil properties in addition to the observed seasonal mean variance similarity it is possible to say that the effect of landcover change and crop management practices on mean soil moisture distribution at the surface depth is negligible the total time variant contribution covariance plus temporal anomalies at the surface depth was 1 46 and 0 64 only under rice and wheat crop covers respectively the temporal mean component spatial variability is time invariant and it was greater than that of the absolute soil moisture as shown in fig 6a except in the last couple of weeks and in fig 7a after the first irrigation its contribution is greater than 100 at the surface depth in such cases the contribution of covariance is negative and higher it indicates that the contrasting interaction between the factors controlling time variant and time invariant components is high when the soil moisture is very high at the bottom layer time variant contribution jumps to 27 52 and 24 94 under rice and wheat crop covers respectively it is due to the positive relationship between the factors controlling temporally static and dynamic components which results in higher and positive covariance share the results indicate that the temporal mean component contribution was significantly higher and its relation with time variant factors varies with depth this implies that the role of time variant factors is visible only in the near surface depths previous studies also reported similar results the time invariant component contribution at any point was high mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 gao et al 2015 in this study its mean contribution ranges between 72 49 101 46 at all the depths under both rice and wheat crop covers at the 10 cm depth it is higher than what was reported by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 for a study area of 31 500 km2 at an equivalent depth of 5 cm where it was found to be 94 it may be related to the size soil properties and levelness in our study plot soil properties are the main time invariant factors in smaller agricultural plots as compared to larger catchments the mean contribution of temporal anomalies in this study was 31 63 and 32 82 at the surface depth under rice and wheat crop covers respectively which is higher than 9 reported by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 though temporal anomalies share was higher the possible inverse interaction between temporal mean and temporal anomalies factors lessened the cumulative effect of time variant components contribution however gao et al 2015 reported a much lesser contribution from the time variant component 66 8 and much higher value from temporal anomalies 57 4 they attributed different spatial scales considered for the difference in magnitude since their study area was 0 58 km2 the temporal mean component contribution at small scales is expected to be lower than the of larger scales brocca et al 2014 however our small study area of 0 0006 km2 revealed that it is not always true at the subsurface depths the temporal changes of time invariant and time variant components relative contribution were similar to those observed at the surface depth the time invariant component still persists to be the dominating contributor and the temporal anomalies component share was very small the results at different depths suggest that it is impossible to assume a similar temporal pattern for both components contribution for surface and subsurface layers the effect of soil wetness on each variance component contribution was also qualitatively characterized and the results are shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the soil wetness level significantly affects the components contributions under rice crop cover the wetness range is small due to the ponded water at the surface depth the contribution of the temporal mean was higher at lower wetness and it shows a general reduction with increasing wetness higher contributions of temporal mean 150 at lower wetness show the dominating effect of time invariant factors similar trends were observed at subsurface depths the variability of all components was low at the bottom depth at lower soil moisture contents the contribution of the temporal mean was small and that of temporal anomalies was high under wheat crop cover at the surface depth the contribution of covariance was positive and near zero it shows that the time variant factors such as climatic conditions were the main factors that control soil moisture dynamics at lower soil moisture under wheat crop cover it is in contrast to what was observed under rice crop cover the variability was high at intermediate wetness with its peak observed at 26 and it decreases at higher wetness in all components at the subsurface layers the temporal mean contribution of spatial variance takes the form of concave downward as it was at the surface depth the variability was observed to be higher at the intermediate soil moisture the temporal anomalies contribution was high at lower moisture and it decreases with depth the covariance contribution is like a mirror image of that of the temporal mean 3 4 time stability analysis temporal stability analysis is used to estimate the spatial mean soil moisture content for the field using representative locations it systematically indicates whether a given location either represents the mean soil wetness of the study area or under or over estimates regardless of the observation time figs 9 and 10 show the rank ordered mrd and the associated standard deviation sdrd at all soil depths in our study area the maximum mrd of 13 33 12 70 24 67 and 29 46 under rice crop cover and 27 85 24 25 26 56 and 26 46 under wheat crop cover were found at 10 25 50 and 80 cm depths respectively lower mrd was observed near the surface depths and its increment with depth under rice crop cover is a result of ponded water under wheat crop cover the largest mrd was observed at 10 cm depth and its variability was significantly higher than the subsurface layers as it has higher sdrd it is due to tillage which may increase standard deviation at the surface depth it is also interesting to see that subplot 3 which was wetter than the average under a ponded water condition is found to be the driest subplot under wheat crop cover though the mean soil texture observed from three points on the field revealed that it is silty loam soil this subplot has higher porosity faisal 2019 and pore connectivity which may contribute to its status change though the ranges of mrd in our study were a bit higher than the values observed in vachaud et al 1985 it was much smaller than recent studies conducted in larger watersheds e g gao and shao 2012 hu et al 2010 the sdrd in this study is much smaller than what was observed in gao and shao 2012 it may be due to the relatively less spatial variability in soil and vegetation properties in our small study area temporal stability analysis of soil water content robustness was measured with sdrd values for 10 25 50 and 80 cm soil depths the mean sdrd was 3 09 3 73 4 01 and 4 17 under rice crop cover and 8 80 5 04 4 03 and 3 48 under wheat crop cover respectively the high sdrd under wheat crop cover is expected since there were seasonal wetting and drying conditions and the variability is known to be high at both ends of wetting and drying conditions the reduction of sdrd with depth under wheat crop cover indicates that soil moisture distribution stability increases with depth it is due to the reduction of the effect of hydrological climatic biological factors and agricultural activities on soil moisture distribution with depth gao and shao 2012 xu and mermoud 2001 however the increment of sdrd with depth reveals the reduction of the homogenizing effect of ponded water under rice crop cover mrd value close to 0 is not a guarantee for temporal stability coppola et al 2011 besides there must be a low standard deviation and root mean square error rmse associated with that rank rmse indicates which plot captures the best mean soil moisture a single subplot may not be the only representative of the area previous studies reported variable figures one de souza et al 2011 xu et al 2015 two coppola et al 2011 or many gao and shao 2012 hu et al 2010 vachaud et al 1985 in this study one representative subplot was found at each depth under both crop covers as shown in figs 9 and 10 and different subplots represented different depths it coincides with earlier studies de souza et al 2011 guber et al 2008 tallon and si 2003 who reported different temporally stable subplots at different depths within the same field similar subplots were found to be temporally stable at the surface and bottom depths irrespective of land cover for example subplot 9 was the temporally stable subplot at the surface depth with an mrd of 0 34 and 1 19 a standard deviation of 3 11 and 2 61 and rmse of 0 86 and 0 69 under rice and wheat crop covers respectively the representation of different depths by different temporally stable subplots may be due to soil properties heterogeneity combined with vegetation and water ponding effect it is possible to say that the equivalent seasonal mean values observed in all variance components in addition to similarity in mean soil hydraulic properties under rice cover and barren land after wheat harvesting at the surface depth were reflections of the temporal persistence of the subplot it also reinforces the hypothesis that the effect of landcover change on mean soil moisture distribution at the surface depth is negligible both mrd and vrd were considered to examine the relations of absolute soil moisture temporal stability with its components using the spearman rank correlation coefficient r s and the results were shown in table 3 a higher r s shows similarity in time stability ranks of absolute soil moisture to the component considered absolute soil moisture exhibited a very strong positive monotonic correlation with temporal mean under both rice and wheat crop covers at all the depths the correlation is especially higher under rice crop cover because of the possible ponding effect which diminishes the effect of the time variant factors however temporal anomalies correlation with absolute soil moisture showed negative monotonicity which ranges from very weak to moderate except at the surface depth under wheat crop cover it is shown that absolute soil moisture almost has no correlation with temporal anomalies at the 50 and 80 cm depths under rice crop cover it reveals that time variant factors have no effect on deeper depths however there was moderate and very weak correlation under wheat crop cover at 50 and 80 cm depths respectively which might be related to its measured 1 1 m rooting depth that is used to extract water at deeper depths under stressed conditions the mrd values showed that absolute soil moisture temporal stability reflects time invariant patterns under both crop covers this agrees with the findings of mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 and gao et al 2015 which are obtained from large scale observations and small catchments respectively this indicates that time stability of soil moisture at both small and large scales is mainly controlled by time invariant factors which concurs with recent studies hu et al 2010 hu and si 2016 jia et al 2015 at subsurface depths absolute soil moisture was very strongly correlated with temporal mean however it showed a negative monotonic and a variable from a very weak to moderate correlation with temporal anomalies the negative r s tells that the factors controlling time variant and time invariant components have an inverse relationship table 4 shows the results of vrd based temporal stability analysis under rice crop cover absolute soil moisture exhibited almost zero correlation with temporal mean moderate correlation with temporal anomalies and very weak and negative correlation with covariance at the surface depth similar relations were observed at subsurface depths with temporal mean and covariance but it exhibited a strong correlation with temporal anomalies absolute soil moisture revealed a negative and very weak correlation with temporal mean under wheat crop cover at the surface depth though absolute soil moisture showed very similar soil moisture temporal patterns with temporal anomalies figs 3 and 4 the vrd based r s between them is weak at the near surface depths it may be due to the inclusion of both negative and positive values in temporal anomalies while absolute soil moisture considers only positive values gao et al 2015 absolute soil moisture shows a moderate correlation with the covariance component at the surface depth and this relation decreases with depth because the variance relation was more explainable by the anomalies component this indicates that absolute soil moisture time stability based on vrd analysis characterizes neither of the variance components patterns the vrd based results are different from mrd based ones this explains that the parameters used either mrd or vrd for the temporal stability analysis determine the relationship between absolute soil moisture and its components 4 conclusions in this study variability and temporal stability of soil moisture were examined at different soil depths under rice and wheat cropped agricultural plot located at the indian institute of technology kanpur india it was found that soil moisture distribution under rice crop cover was mainly controlled by time invariant factors and absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies exhibited similar patterns with time at all the depths however it varied with depth under wheat crop cover due to periodic wetting and drying conditions and temporally variable atmospheric demand the mean absolute soil moisture variance vertical distribution varied with land cover it increased with depth under rice cover due to the homogenizing effect of ponded water and it decreased with depth under wheat crop cover due to the reducing effect of time variant factors the contribution of variance components changes with soil wetness land cover and depth of observation though its share varies with crop cover and depth the time invariant component contribution was always high a variation in the contribution of components with depth suggests that it is impossible to assume a similar temporal pattern for both components at surface and subsurface layers soil wetness level significantly affects the contribution of each component it iwas observed that as soil wetness changes the factors controlling soil moisture dynamics change with land cover for example time invariant and time variant factors were the main factors that control soil moisture dynamics at lower soil moisture under rice and wheat crop covers respectively mean and variance of relative differences were used for temporal stability analysis vertical mrd trend was observed to vary with landcover it increases and decreases with depth under rice and wheat crop covers respectively higher standard deviation of rd was observed at near surface depths under wheat crop cover due to the seasonal wetting and drying conditions and the variability was known to be high at both ends of wetting and drying conditions one representative subplot was identified at each depth under both crop covers different subplots represented different depths and similar subplots were representative at the surface and bottom depths under different crop covers suggesting that crop management practices do not affect the time stable location declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10629,determining the best management practices bmps under different initial soil mineral n ismn levels is helpful to improve water and n use efficiencies wue nue and protect the environment in this study a two year field experiment of spring maize was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in northwest china five treatments were designed including one local farmer practice i480 4n280 280 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 480 mm with four irrigation events and four conservation treatments i420 4n200 i420 5n200 i420 6n200 and i420 7n200 standing for 200 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 420 mm with four to seven irrigation events respectively measured yield leaf area index soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were used to evaluate a soil crop model whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator which was then used to simulate the effects of water and n management practices on water consumption n fates and crop growth then the integrated index considering the agronomic economic and environmental impacts was simulated using 35 100 combinations of irrigation and fertilizer n scenarios which were designed to develop bmps under different ismn levels ranging from 0 to 625 kg n ha 1 in a 1 8 m soil profile and seasons of weather data from 2001 to 2015 results showed i420 5n200 was the best with a high yield wue and nue and low n loss among five treatments the optimal irrigation amount ranging from 350 600 mm was related to precipitation amount the optimal n rate decreased linearly with the increase of ismn when ismn was 384 kg ha 1 and reached a plateau 0 kg n ha 1 when ismn was 384 kg ha 1 in this study we developed a simple linear model to determine the best n application rates under different ismns this method is important to help farmers achieve multiple goals of high yield resource conservation and reduced environmental impacts simultaneously keywords irrigation scheduling residual soil nitrogen nitrogen leaching best management practices whcns model 1 introduction with the increase of agricultural water consumption and fertilization water shortage and nitrate pollution in groundwater have become common problems in the desert oasis the shiyang river basin is a typical irrigated desert oasis in northwest china fang et al 2007 in this region approximately 480 960 mm of irrigation typically as flood irrigation are needed to meet crop water requirements fang and su 2019 usually irrigation water comes from groundwater jiang et al 2016 in the past several decades the groundwater level has declined at a rate of 9 cm per year and up to 2 m in some years due to over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation liu et al 2018 additionally excessive fertilizer application has led to a large amount of residual n in the soil after harvest which increases the risk of nitrate contamination in the groundwater huang et al 2018 therefore determining optimal water and n management is essential to improve water and n use efficiencies wue nue reduce environmental pollution and maintain sustainable agricultural development in arid areas in order to improve grain yield wue and nue as well as reduce environmental pollution caused by improper irrigation a number of studies have been conducted to optimize irrigation practices in arid areas regulated deficit irrigation is an effective method to improve wue without reducing yield farré and faci 2009 fu et al 2017 found that alternate partial root zone drip irrigation supplying alternate wetting and drying cycling to the root zones could increase n uptake wue and nue for maize ran et al 2017 found that an irrigation level of 65 70 of soil field capacity and an n rate of 100 300 kg n ha 1 was proper for hybrid maize in arid northwest china yang and su 2009 also reported that reducing the irrigation amount by 10 25 combined with 225 kg n ha 1 fertilizer can reduce the groundwater contamination in the heihe oasis however previous research has mainly focused on the determination of the total amount of irrigation and few studies have considered the effect of irrigation frequencies on water percolation and n leaching additionally over fertilization is another serious problem in this region n application rates for spring maize has reached 500 kg n ha 1 in this district liang et al 2016b which leads to high residual soil n rsn after crop harvest residual soil n can be used as a n resource for the next crop but high rsn also likely becomes the resource for groundwater and atmosphere pollution huang et al 2018 a key issue is to reduce n loss by improving the residual n use efficiency therefore various n management systems based on different initial soil mineral n ismn levels have been developed pre plant soil n test ppnt systems are based on the difference between the n requirement for a target yield and ismn wehrmann and scharpf 1979 but it has a fatal shortcoming by considering smn static an improved system the pre side dress soil nitrate n test pstn was recommended by testing soil mineral n content before each n application during the crop growth season magdoff et al 1984 cui et al 2008a 2008b evaluated the system and found it could improve nue and reduce environmental risk in the north china plain ncp however it is difficult to adopt in china because of highly fragmented farmland and higher labor equipment and soil sampling costs soil crop system models can simulate the dynamic processes of crop growth and n fates under different climate soil types and field management practices providing insight into optimum management that compliments field experiments different models have been used to simulate crop growth n leaching and optimum water and n management practices li et al 2018 used the hydrus 1d model to simulate n fates in paddy fields in taihu lake in china and found that deficit irrigation combined with deep application of n fertilizer could effectively reduce n losses zhang et al 2015 used the dndc model to optimize the n application rate for summer maize in the ncp their results showed that when the n application rate was 180 kg n ha 1 the yield reached the maximum and the nitrate leaching was 18 4 kg n ha 1 hu et al 2010 evaluated more than 1700 scenarios of various irrigation and fertilizer practices using the wnmm model to obtain the best management practices bmps results showed that 600 mm of water in eight applications with a single n application of 75 kg n ha 1 was the bmp for the specific desert oasis conditions jiang et al 2019 simulated maize yield under different scenarios of fertilizer n rates using the dndc and dssat models the results showed that a n application rate of 180 210 kg n ha 1 with two splits was suitable in northeast china however these studies ignored the effect of different ismn levels on crop yield n leaching and fertilizer n recommendations the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate crop yield n leaching wue and nue under different irrigation schedules in the oasis spring maize system in northwest china 2 optimize the water and n management under different ismns and weather conditions based on the whcns model aiming to provide management guidance for farmers in the arid regions in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site description a two year field experiment was conducted at the agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station of china agricultural university 102 50 e 37 52 n in the shiyang river basin gansu province from 2014 to 2015 the study area has a continental temperate arid climate at an altitude of 1580 m with average annual temperature of 7 8 c and average annual precipitation of 164 mm this area has an annual evaporation rate 2000 mm the groundwater depth ranges from 40 to 50 m the soil parent material comes from the depression of the shiyang river alluvial fan and soil properties show a high degree of spatial heterogeneity the physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and measurements spring maize variety fuyou 968 was sown on april 23 2014 and april 19 2015 at a density of approximately 75 000 plants ha 1 row spacing of 40 cm and harvested on september 27 and september 20 respectively in this study five treatments were designed including one local farmers practice i480 4n280 280 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 480 mm with four irrigation events and four conservation treatments i420 4n200 i420 5n200 i420 6n200 and i420 7n200 standing for 200 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 420 mm with four to seven irrigation events respectively and shown in table 2 each treatment had 3 replicates randomly arranged and the plot size was 81 25 m2 the amounts and frequencies of irrigation were set based on the local farmers practice and previous study results hu et al 2011 irrigation was usually carried out at the critical crop growth stages for the i480 4 and i420 4 treatments irrigation was applied four times at jointing v12 12th leaf silking and filling stages for i420 5 i420 6 and i420 7 additional irrigations were applied at flowering jointing to tasseling and silking to filling stage respectively the irrigation water came from groundwater using flooding irrigation considering the precipitation during the crop growth period 206 mm in 2014 was higher than previous years average 131 mm the amount of irrigation for five treatments in 2014 was reduced by 40 mm in the later growth stages after maize harvest straw was crushed directly and returned into the soil for all the treatments every year fertilizer n was applied as urea at the v12 and silking stages the fertilizer date was adjusted appropriately according to the irrigation date table 2 before the experiment the basic physical and chemical properties in each layer of the soil profile were measured including soil texture bulk density ph and organic matter table 1 the soil water content was measured once each week at 0 20 m intervals to a depth of 1 80 m in the soil profile using a tdr trime iph imko germany probe soil samples down to 1 80 m were collected at 0 20 m intervals at key crop development stages seedling jointing v12 tasseling filling and maturity and harvest to measure the soil nitrate concentrations using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe germany the ismn before sowing was calculated by the following equation 1 i r s n i 1 n b d c i 0 1 h i where bd is the bulk density of the ith soil layer g cm 3 ci is the nitrate n concentration in the ith soil layer soil mg kg 1 ammonium was not considered because of very low concentration hi is the thickness of the ith soil layer cm the measured ismn for different treatments in 2014 and 2015 are shown in table 2 plant samples were taken to measure leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass at key development stages and yield was measured at harvest meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located at the experimental site including daily rainfall maximum minimum and average temperature relative humidity and average daily wind speed detailed field management measurement procedures and methods are available in the literature shi et al 2018 2 3 whcns model the whcns model includes five main modules soil water soil temperature soil carbon soil n and crop growth the model is driven by daily meteorological data and crop biology parameters and computes daily processes including soil evaporation crop transpiration soil water movement runoff soil temperature soil net mineralization nitrification ammonia volatilization denitrification and crop growth the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 water infiltration and redistribution in the soil profile is described by the green ampt method hachum and alfaro 1980 and richards equation pachepskya et al 2003 respectively the soil heat transfer simulation was taken from the hydrus 1d model using the convection dispersion equation šimůnek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts were taken from the daisy model hansen et al 2012 the crop model was taken from the ps123 model which simulates crop growth processes including crop development stage lai photosynthate accumulation and allocation maintenance respiration and growth respiration driessen and konjin 1992 the water stress factor is calculated by the actual transpiration divided by the potential transpiration the n stress factor is computed based on the simulation of the crop n demand crop n uptake and actual soil n supply more detailed information about the model is available in liang et al 2016a the model has been successfully applied to analyze the effects of various field management practices irrigation fertilization mulching crop rotation straw return etc on water consumption and n fates organic matter turnover and crop growth in farmland ecosystem in china li et al 2015 liang et al 2016b 2018 2019 he et al 2018 shi et al 2020 2 4 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices including root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and index of agreement d were used to evaluate model performance willmott 1981 liang et al 2016a the rmse represents the mean difference between observed and simulated values while nrmse indicates the relative size of the mean difference as an unbounded percentage the index of agreement 0 d 1 is intended to be a descriptive measure and is both a relative and bounded measure the closer the value of d is to 1 the better the model performance yang et al 2014 2 5 integrated index method the integrated index was used to quantitatively analyze the model outputs including yield water drainage n leaching and gaseous n loss to evaluate the performance of each water and n fertilizer management strategy in this study three factors including the agronomy factor af environment factor ef and economy factor the value to cost ratio vcr were computed to evaluate each management strategy and their weights were 0 7 0 2 and 0 5 respectively sun et al 2019 af was calculated using three variables including yield wue and nue each variable was normalized to 0 1 and multiplied using weights of 0 6 0 2 and 0 2 respectively hu et al 2010 ef was calculated using nitrate leaching and gaseous n loss ammonia volatilization and denitrification and their weights were set as 0 5 and 0 5 the af ef and vcr were calculated using the following equations li et al 2015 2 a f y y max 0 6 w u e w u e max 0 2 n u e n u e max 0 2 3 e f n l e a n l e a max 0 5 n g a s n g a s max 0 5 4 v c r y y p w w p f f p where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 nlea is nitrate leaching amount kg n ha 1 ngas is gaseous n loss amount kg n ha 1 and yp is the grain price kg 1 w is the irrigation amount mm and wp is the water price m 3 f is the n fertilizer rate kg and fp is the fertilizer price kg 1 the prices of water fertilizer and maize were assumed to be 0 35 m 3 5 kg 1 and 2 kg 1 respectively sun et al 2019 finally the integrated index ii was calculated by the values of the three factors and their corresponding weights the higher the integrated index the better the management practice 5 i i 0 7 a f 0 2 e f 0 5 v c r 2 6 simulation scenarios in order to explore the relationship of yield and nitrate leaching with different water and fertilizer management practices 9 ismn scenarios were set up in the model in 2015 the ismn scenarios were 625 s1 468 s2 390 s3 343 s4 312 s5 234 s6 156 s7 78 s8 and 0 kg n ha 1 s9 each ismn scenario had 20 irrigation amounts and 13 n fertilizer levels giving a total of 2340 water and fertilizer scenarios the water and n management practice in each scenario was consistent with the best treatment of five treatments selected in 2015 the specific water and n input scenarios were as follows 1 the total amount of irrigation ranged from 50 to 1000 mm at 50 mm intervals 2 the rate of n fertilizer ranged from 0 to 480 kg n ha 1 at 40 kg n ha 1 intervals to consider weather variability over different seasons the whcns model was run from 2001 to 2015 to obtain the simulated crop yield water drainage nitrate leaching gaseous n loss wue and nue for each scenario a total of 35 100 water and fertilizer scenarios were simulated 3 results 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the measured data soil water content nitrate n concentration dry matter weight and crop yield from the i480 4n280 treatment in 2015 was used to calibrate the model all other treatments for two years were used to evaluate the model model input parameters were adjusted by trial and error until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data shi et al 2018 the rmse of soil water content nitrate n concentration and lai of i480 4n280 in 2015 were 0 04 cm3 cm 3 6 43 mg kg 1 and 0 60 m2 m 2 respectively while the nrmse values were 14 61 45 56 and 1 84 respectively the agreement index d for each model output was 0 91 0 81 and 0 99 respectively table s1 indicating that the model calibration results were good after the calibration all parameters were fixed and the model was evaluated using the measured data of the other four treatments in 2015 and all five treatments in 2014 fig s1 compares the simulated and measured data of soil water content nitrate concentration lai and yield for the evaluation treatments the correlation coefficients r were 0 70 0 52 0 98 and 0 82 respectively and p values were 0 01 except for nrmse values of soil nitrate concentration the statistical indices for each treatment were within a reasonable range table s1 considering the complexity of soil n transport and transformation and comparing to previous studies yang et al 2014 liang et al 2016b the simulation results of soil nitrate concentration were acceptable fig s2 thus the model can be used to simulate the crop growth water movement and n transport under different water and n fertilizer management in the region 3 2 crop yield water consumption and n fates under different irrigation schedules according to the measured yields table 3 i420 6n200 in 2014 and i420 5n200 in 2015 gave the highest yield at 16 230 and 17 077 kg ha 1 respectively the lowest performing treatment over both years was the i420 4n200 which gave yields of about 15 300 kg ha 1 which was lower than that of i480 4n280 this indicates that reducing the irrigation and fertilization amounts led to decreased yield using the same irrigation strategies increasing the irrigation frequency can offset the negative effect of the reduction of water and fertilizer amounts tables 3 and 4 show the simulated water and n balance of the 5 treatments over the 1 8 m soil depth water drainage decreased with the increase of irrigation times in 2014 the water drainage in the i480 4n280 treatment was significantly higher than that of 2015 mainly due to the higher rainfall in 2014 the order of water drainage amount for both years was i480 4n280 i420 4n200 i420 5n200 i420 6n200 i420 7n200 showed increasing irrigation frequency can decrease the water drainage the wue was improved with an increase of irrigation frequency with an order of i420 5n200 i420 7n200 i420 6n200 i480 4n280 i420 4n200 n output in farmland mainly includes crop utilization n leaching and gaseous n loss crop utilization accounted for 83 of the n output table 4 with the increase of irrigation times the n uptake by crops increased n leaching was the main source of n loss the n leaching in each treatment was similar to the trend of water percolation fig s3 increasing the irrigation times can significantly reduce n leaching and improve nue the gaseous n loss mainly included ammonia volatilization and denitrification which only accounted for 8 6 of the n output the five treatments were evaluated based on the integrated indices table 4 shows that the order of the average index value of each treatment for two years was i420 5n200 i420 7n200 i420 6n200 i420 4n200 i480 4n280 this indicated that i420 5n200 was the best management practice among the five treatments 3 3 optimization of irrigation and n management under different ismns the i420 5n200 treatment had the highest integrated index and was selected to further optimize water and n management practices the whcns model was used to simulate the crop yield water and n balances for different water and n management under various ismn scenarios in 2015 we only showed the two extreme ismn scenarios s1 and s9 because of space limitations 3 3 1 high ismn scenario s1 in the high ismn scenario s1 625 kg n ha 1 for the 2015 season the simulated maize yield increased with an increase in water input and reached the maximum of 22 184 kg ha 1 fig 1 a this indicated that there was potential for further improvement in crop yield simulated yield slightly decreased with an increasing amount of irrigation water over the critical water input about 650 mm the n application rate had no effect on yield for the high ismn level little water drainage 32 mm occurred when the irrigation amount was 500 mm however drainage increased as irrigation water increased above 500 mm fig 1c the amount of nitrate leaching was positively related to the amount of water drainage and n fertilizer rate fig 1e and the n leaching increased quickly with increasing n application rates when the irrigation amount was 500 mm fig 1e wue increased linearly when the irrigation amount was 450 mm fig 1b however when the irrigation amount exceeded 450 mm no obvious change was observed the nue showed a rapidly increasing trend with increasing irrigation amounts and reached the maximum when the irrigation amount was approximately 450 mm and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased fig 1d the response of wue to n inputs was not significant but nue decreased slightly as the increase of n application rate 3 3 2 low ismn scenario s9 the simulated yield water drainage n leaching wue and nue under the s9 scenario ismn 0 kg n ha 1 for the 2015 season are shown in fig 2 compared with s1 n application rate had significant effects on these indices except for water drainage most of n uptake by the crop came from n fertilizer so the yield significantly increased as n rate increased as the n fertilizer increased more water was needed to obtain the maximum yield fig 2a water drainage was the same as the s1 scenario fig 2c n leaching was similar to the s1 scenario but was significantly lower than s1 fig 2e compared with s1 the effect of different n fertilizer rates on wue and nue in s9 scenario was significant fig 2b and 2d 3 3 3 evaluation of water and n managements under different scenarios the aforementioned results showed that with the increasing input of water and n fertilizer the yield and n loss both increased it was difficult to determine the bmps we applied the integrated index to evaluate the appropriateness of each water and n management under different scenarios table 5 shows the results of two ismn scenarios the higher the integrated index the better the water and n management practice according to the integrated indices table 5 for both scenarios i50n480 50 mm irrigation and 480 kg n ha 1 fertilization had the lowest integrated indices and the yield was about 1745 kg ha 1 under the high ismn scenario s1 i450n0 was the bmp with simulated yield of 19 992 kg ha 1 high wue and nue and low n loss in the low ismn scenario s9 i500n360 was the bmp and gave a simulated yield of 19 870 kg ha 1 the optimal irrigation amount was similar for two ismn scenarios but the optimal n rate was different 3 4 relationships of ismn and optimal irrigation and fertilization amount under different weather conditions based on the simulation results in 2015 we obtained the optimal irrigation amounts and n rates that maximized the integrated indices for 9 ismn scenarios to consider the influence of different weather years and precipitation levels on the optimal irrigation amount and n fertilizer rate the whcns model was run from 2001 to 2015 and the results are showed in figs 3 and 4 the optimal irrigation amount under different ismns in the same year was almost the same fig 3a however there was a slight difference in optimal irrigation amount in different years fig 3b the average optimal irrigation amounts for every year ranged from 400 to 583 mm this was due to the difference in rainfall between years which ranged from 64 to 220 mm for 2001 2015 fig 3a the greater the rainfall during the growing period the lower the optimal irrigation amount there was a significant negative correlation between the optimal n fertilizer rate and ismn when ismn ranged from 0 to 400 kg n ha 1 fig 4b under the same ismn the different climatic conditions had great influence on yield so corresponding optimal n fertilizer rate was also different in 2013 the optimal average yield was the lowest 14 246 kg n ha 1 fig 4a resulting in low n uptake by the crop and giving the lowest optimal n fertilizer rate fig 4b except for the relatively lower optimal n fertilizer rate years 2005 2009 2012 and 2013 we obtained a simple linear model to determine the n fertilizer rate by fitting the ismns with the optimal n rates the resulting equation was optimal n rate 396 1 032 ismn fig 4b when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the residual n in the soil could meet the crop growth demand and less supplemental n was needed when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the ismn was negatively correlated with the optimal n fertilizer rate 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation regime on crop yield and n leaching rational irrigation strategies are essential for agricultural production especially for the areas where water shortage is serious many studies have demonstrated that deficit irrigation can improve wue while maintaining high yields farré and faci 2009 fu et al 2017 in this study i420 4n200 with reduced water and n inputs had the lowest yield for two years however the other three conservation treatments with five to seven irrigation events gave high yields table 3 while water drainage and n leaching was decreased this demonstrated that increasing the irrigation applications could maintain high yield and reduce water and n loss hu et al 2011 recommended five irrigation events for spring corn in shiyang river basin which was consistent with our study liang et al 2016b found that yield increased with increasing amounts of irrigation and then reached a plateau when the irrigation amount was 500 mm in a desert oasis in our results the yield showed a decreased trend when irrigation amount exceeded 650 mm fig 1a this may be caused by different weather and soil conditions the study area was located in northwest china where intensive irrigation or rainfall can easily cause a large amount of n leaching due to high sand content high ismn conditions further increased the risk of n leaching which in turn affected crop yield increasing irrigation events could mitigate n loss by leaching and improve wue and nue 4 2 effects of fertilization on crop yield and n leaching under different ismns many studies have reported that over fertilization did not achieve higher yields but caused serious resource waste and environmental risk zhang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 so it is necessary to optimize the fertilizer rate based on ismns dai et al 2015 found that grain yields and n application rates resulted in different soil residual n huang et al 2018 reported that when the n application rate was 190 kg n ha 1 nitrate remaining in the soil increased greatly and increased the risk of n leaching zhang et al 2015 showed that a fertilizer rate of 150 240 kg n ha 1 could maintain a high yield for maize and keep the nitrate leaching at a low level he also found that an n application rate of 179 kg ha 1 for maize was beneficial for both yield and the environment zhang et al 2018 in our study crop yield and n leaching was related to both ismn and n application rate the n200 treatment had no influence on crop yield compared with n280 treatment but the n leaching was reduced n leaching increased as the n fertilizer rate increased under same ismn level under the high ismn levels less n was needed to maintain yield and over fertilization increased the negative environmental impact as the ismn decreased the soil could not supply enough n to satisfy the crop needs so increasing n rates would have an obvious yield increasing effect our results were consistent with previous studies 4 3 the optimization of n application rate based on ismn because n recommendation methods based on local soil n tests have some weakness many other methods have been proposed to determine the reasonable n rates for different purposes zhang et al 2018 found that the optimal n application rate was the highest when the targeting n uptake followed by crop yield and economic benefit n rates were the smallest when targeting environmental costs zhu 2006 proposed regional average suitable n application rates based on a large number of field experiments but it ignored the spatial variability of soil nutrient in a large region ju and christie 2011 found that the theoretical n application rate was equal to the n uptake by the crop aboveground which was obtained under the conditions that all the straw was returned to the field in this study we gave the n recommendation based on the ismns using a modeling approach with comprehensive consideration of af ef and vcr under different ismn scenarios the optimal n fertilizer rate varied substantially when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the optimal n application rate decreased linearly with the increasing ismn when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the optimum n application rate was 0 cui et al 2008a also found 73 87 of n uptake by the crop came from soil under high soil n content which is consistent with our study due to the soil spatial heterogeneity climate and other management factors in different regions the weight coefficient of af ef and vcr should be adjusted according to the actual conditions the linear model for n rate and ismn also needs to be validated in different places 5 conclusion the whcns model was calibrated and evaluated based on field measured data for spring maize in the oasis farmland of shiyang river basin china the results indicated that the model could be used to quantitatively analyze the n fates wue and nue in the region increasing the irrigation frequency can offset the negative effect of the reduction of water and fertilizer amounts meanwhile maintaining yield and reduce n leaching five irrigation applications was found to be the best treatment with low n leaching and high wue and nue the optimum irrigation amount was determined by the precipitation amount and had no relationship with ismn the relationship between the optimal n application rate and ismn could be described by a linear plus platform model optimal n rate 396 1 032 ismn when the ismn 384 kg ha 1 no or less n fertilizer was needed to maintain yields and reduce the risk of environmental pollution results of this study

10629,determining the best management practices bmps under different initial soil mineral n ismn levels is helpful to improve water and n use efficiencies wue nue and protect the environment in this study a two year field experiment of spring maize was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in northwest china five treatments were designed including one local farmer practice i480 4n280 280 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 480 mm with four irrigation events and four conservation treatments i420 4n200 i420 5n200 i420 6n200 and i420 7n200 standing for 200 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 420 mm with four to seven irrigation events respectively measured yield leaf area index soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were used to evaluate a soil crop model whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator which was then used to simulate the effects of water and n management practices on water consumption n fates and crop growth then the integrated index considering the agronomic economic and environmental impacts was simulated using 35 100 combinations of irrigation and fertilizer n scenarios which were designed to develop bmps under different ismn levels ranging from 0 to 625 kg n ha 1 in a 1 8 m soil profile and seasons of weather data from 2001 to 2015 results showed i420 5n200 was the best with a high yield wue and nue and low n loss among five treatments the optimal irrigation amount ranging from 350 600 mm was related to precipitation amount the optimal n rate decreased linearly with the increase of ismn when ismn was 384 kg ha 1 and reached a plateau 0 kg n ha 1 when ismn was 384 kg ha 1 in this study we developed a simple linear model to determine the best n application rates under different ismns this method is important to help farmers achieve multiple goals of high yield resource conservation and reduced environmental impacts simultaneously keywords irrigation scheduling residual soil nitrogen nitrogen leaching best management practices whcns model 1 introduction with the increase of agricultural water consumption and fertilization water shortage and nitrate pollution in groundwater have become common problems in the desert oasis the shiyang river basin is a typical irrigated desert oasis in northwest china fang et al 2007 in this region approximately 480 960 mm of irrigation typically as flood irrigation are needed to meet crop water requirements fang and su 2019 usually irrigation water comes from groundwater jiang et al 2016 in the past several decades the groundwater level has declined at a rate of 9 cm per year and up to 2 m in some years due to over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation liu et al 2018 additionally excessive fertilizer application has led to a large amount of residual n in the soil after harvest which increases the risk of nitrate contamination in the groundwater huang et al 2018 therefore determining optimal water and n management is essential to improve water and n use efficiencies wue nue reduce environmental pollution and maintain sustainable agricultural development in arid areas in order to improve grain yield wue and nue as well as reduce environmental pollution caused by improper irrigation a number of studies have been conducted to optimize irrigation practices in arid areas regulated deficit irrigation is an effective method to improve wue without reducing yield farré and faci 2009 fu et al 2017 found that alternate partial root zone drip irrigation supplying alternate wetting and drying cycling to the root zones could increase n uptake wue and nue for maize ran et al 2017 found that an irrigation level of 65 70 of soil field capacity and an n rate of 100 300 kg n ha 1 was proper for hybrid maize in arid northwest china yang and su 2009 also reported that reducing the irrigation amount by 10 25 combined with 225 kg n ha 1 fertilizer can reduce the groundwater contamination in the heihe oasis however previous research has mainly focused on the determination of the total amount of irrigation and few studies have considered the effect of irrigation frequencies on water percolation and n leaching additionally over fertilization is another serious problem in this region n application rates for spring maize has reached 500 kg n ha 1 in this district liang et al 2016b which leads to high residual soil n rsn after crop harvest residual soil n can be used as a n resource for the next crop but high rsn also likely becomes the resource for groundwater and atmosphere pollution huang et al 2018 a key issue is to reduce n loss by improving the residual n use efficiency therefore various n management systems based on different initial soil mineral n ismn levels have been developed pre plant soil n test ppnt systems are based on the difference between the n requirement for a target yield and ismn wehrmann and scharpf 1979 but it has a fatal shortcoming by considering smn static an improved system the pre side dress soil nitrate n test pstn was recommended by testing soil mineral n content before each n application during the crop growth season magdoff et al 1984 cui et al 2008a 2008b evaluated the system and found it could improve nue and reduce environmental risk in the north china plain ncp however it is difficult to adopt in china because of highly fragmented farmland and higher labor equipment and soil sampling costs soil crop system models can simulate the dynamic processes of crop growth and n fates under different climate soil types and field management practices providing insight into optimum management that compliments field experiments different models have been used to simulate crop growth n leaching and optimum water and n management practices li et al 2018 used the hydrus 1d model to simulate n fates in paddy fields in taihu lake in china and found that deficit irrigation combined with deep application of n fertilizer could effectively reduce n losses zhang et al 2015 used the dndc model to optimize the n application rate for summer maize in the ncp their results showed that when the n application rate was 180 kg n ha 1 the yield reached the maximum and the nitrate leaching was 18 4 kg n ha 1 hu et al 2010 evaluated more than 1700 scenarios of various irrigation and fertilizer practices using the wnmm model to obtain the best management practices bmps results showed that 600 mm of water in eight applications with a single n application of 75 kg n ha 1 was the bmp for the specific desert oasis conditions jiang et al 2019 simulated maize yield under different scenarios of fertilizer n rates using the dndc and dssat models the results showed that a n application rate of 180 210 kg n ha 1 with two splits was suitable in northeast china however these studies ignored the effect of different ismn levels on crop yield n leaching and fertilizer n recommendations the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate crop yield n leaching wue and nue under different irrigation schedules in the oasis spring maize system in northwest china 2 optimize the water and n management under different ismns and weather conditions based on the whcns model aiming to provide management guidance for farmers in the arid regions in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site description a two year field experiment was conducted at the agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station of china agricultural university 102 50 e 37 52 n in the shiyang river basin gansu province from 2014 to 2015 the study area has a continental temperate arid climate at an altitude of 1580 m with average annual temperature of 7 8 c and average annual precipitation of 164 mm this area has an annual evaporation rate 2000 mm the groundwater depth ranges from 40 to 50 m the soil parent material comes from the depression of the shiyang river alluvial fan and soil properties show a high degree of spatial heterogeneity the physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and measurements spring maize variety fuyou 968 was sown on april 23 2014 and april 19 2015 at a density of approximately 75 000 plants ha 1 row spacing of 40 cm and harvested on september 27 and september 20 respectively in this study five treatments were designed including one local farmers practice i480 4n280 280 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 480 mm with four irrigation events and four conservation treatments i420 4n200 i420 5n200 i420 6n200 and i420 7n200 standing for 200 kg n ha 1 fertilizer and irrigated 420 mm with four to seven irrigation events respectively and shown in table 2 each treatment had 3 replicates randomly arranged and the plot size was 81 25 m2 the amounts and frequencies of irrigation were set based on the local farmers practice and previous study results hu et al 2011 irrigation was usually carried out at the critical crop growth stages for the i480 4 and i420 4 treatments irrigation was applied four times at jointing v12 12th leaf silking and filling stages for i420 5 i420 6 and i420 7 additional irrigations were applied at flowering jointing to tasseling and silking to filling stage respectively the irrigation water came from groundwater using flooding irrigation considering the precipitation during the crop growth period 206 mm in 2014 was higher than previous years average 131 mm the amount of irrigation for five treatments in 2014 was reduced by 40 mm in the later growth stages after maize harvest straw was crushed directly and returned into the soil for all the treatments every year fertilizer n was applied as urea at the v12 and silking stages the fertilizer date was adjusted appropriately according to the irrigation date table 2 before the experiment the basic physical and chemical properties in each layer of the soil profile were measured including soil texture bulk density ph and organic matter table 1 the soil water content was measured once each week at 0 20 m intervals to a depth of 1 80 m in the soil profile using a tdr trime iph imko germany probe soil samples down to 1 80 m were collected at 0 20 m intervals at key crop development stages seedling jointing v12 tasseling filling and maturity and harvest to measure the soil nitrate concentrations using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe germany the ismn before sowing was calculated by the following equation 1 i r s n i 1 n b d c i 0 1 h i where bd is the bulk density of the ith soil layer g cm 3 ci is the nitrate n concentration in the ith soil layer soil mg kg 1 ammonium was not considered because of very low concentration hi is the thickness of the ith soil layer cm the measured ismn for different treatments in 2014 and 2015 are shown in table 2 plant samples were taken to measure leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass at key development stages and yield was measured at harvest meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located at the experimental site including daily rainfall maximum minimum and average temperature relative humidity and average daily wind speed detailed field management measurement procedures and methods are available in the literature shi et al 2018 2 3 whcns model the whcns model includes five main modules soil water soil temperature soil carbon soil n and crop growth the model is driven by daily meteorological data and crop biology parameters and computes daily processes including soil evaporation crop transpiration soil water movement runoff soil temperature soil net mineralization nitrification ammonia volatilization denitrification and crop growth the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 water infiltration and redistribution in the soil profile is described by the green ampt method hachum and alfaro 1980 and richards equation pachepskya et al 2003 respectively the soil heat transfer simulation was taken from the hydrus 1d model using the convection dispersion equation šimůnek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts were taken from the daisy model hansen et al 2012 the crop model was taken from the ps123 model which simulates crop growth processes including crop development stage lai photosynthate accumulation and allocation maintenance respiration and growth respiration driessen and konjin 1992 the water stress factor is calculated by the actual transpiration divided by the potential transpiration the n stress factor is computed based on the simulation of the crop n demand crop n uptake and actual soil n supply more detailed information about the model is available in liang et al 2016a the model has been successfully applied to analyze the effects of various field management practices irrigation fertilization mulching crop rotation straw return etc on water consumption and n fates organic matter turnover and crop growth in farmland ecosystem in china li et al 2015 liang et al 2016b 2018 2019 he et al 2018 shi et al 2020 2 4 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices including root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and index of agreement d were used to evaluate model performance willmott 1981 liang et al 2016a the rmse represents the mean difference between observed and simulated values while nrmse indicates the relative size of the mean difference as an unbounded percentage the index of agreement 0 d 1 is intended to be a descriptive measure and is both a relative and bounded measure the closer the value of d is to 1 the better the model performance yang et al 2014 2 5 integrated index method the integrated index was used to quantitatively analyze the model outputs including yield water drainage n leaching and gaseous n loss to evaluate the performance of each water and n fertilizer management strategy in this study three factors including the agronomy factor af environment factor ef and economy factor the value to cost ratio vcr were computed to evaluate each management strategy and their weights were 0 7 0 2 and 0 5 respectively sun et al 2019 af was calculated using three variables including yield wue and nue each variable was normalized to 0 1 and multiplied using weights of 0 6 0 2 and 0 2 respectively hu et al 2010 ef was calculated using nitrate leaching and gaseous n loss ammonia volatilization and denitrification and their weights were set as 0 5 and 0 5 the af ef and vcr were calculated using the following equations li et al 2015 2 a f y y max 0 6 w u e w u e max 0 2 n u e n u e max 0 2 3 e f n l e a n l e a max 0 5 n g a s n g a s max 0 5 4 v c r y y p w w p f f p where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 nlea is nitrate leaching amount kg n ha 1 ngas is gaseous n loss amount kg n ha 1 and yp is the grain price kg 1 w is the irrigation amount mm and wp is the water price m 3 f is the n fertilizer rate kg and fp is the fertilizer price kg 1 the prices of water fertilizer and maize were assumed to be 0 35 m 3 5 kg 1 and 2 kg 1 respectively sun et al 2019 finally the integrated index ii was calculated by the values of the three factors and their corresponding weights the higher the integrated index the better the management practice 5 i i 0 7 a f 0 2 e f 0 5 v c r 2 6 simulation scenarios in order to explore the relationship of yield and nitrate leaching with different water and fertilizer management practices 9 ismn scenarios were set up in the model in 2015 the ismn scenarios were 625 s1 468 s2 390 s3 343 s4 312 s5 234 s6 156 s7 78 s8 and 0 kg n ha 1 s9 each ismn scenario had 20 irrigation amounts and 13 n fertilizer levels giving a total of 2340 water and fertilizer scenarios the water and n management practice in each scenario was consistent with the best treatment of five treatments selected in 2015 the specific water and n input scenarios were as follows 1 the total amount of irrigation ranged from 50 to 1000 mm at 50 mm intervals 2 the rate of n fertilizer ranged from 0 to 480 kg n ha 1 at 40 kg n ha 1 intervals to consider weather variability over different seasons the whcns model was run from 2001 to 2015 to obtain the simulated crop yield water drainage nitrate leaching gaseous n loss wue and nue for each scenario a total of 35 100 water and fertilizer scenarios were simulated 3 results 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the measured data soil water content nitrate n concentration dry matter weight and crop yield from the i480 4n280 treatment in 2015 was used to calibrate the model all other treatments for two years were used to evaluate the model model input parameters were adjusted by trial and error until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data shi et al 2018 the rmse of soil water content nitrate n concentration and lai of i480 4n280 in 2015 were 0 04 cm3 cm 3 6 43 mg kg 1 and 0 60 m2 m 2 respectively while the nrmse values were 14 61 45 56 and 1 84 respectively the agreement index d for each model output was 0 91 0 81 and 0 99 respectively table s1 indicating that the model calibration results were good after the calibration all parameters were fixed and the model was evaluated using the measured data of the other four treatments in 2015 and all five treatments in 2014 fig s1 compares the simulated and measured data of soil water content nitrate concentration lai and yield for the evaluation treatments the correlation coefficients r were 0 70 0 52 0 98 and 0 82 respectively and p values were 0 01 except for nrmse values of soil nitrate concentration the statistical indices for each treatment were within a reasonable range table s1 considering the complexity of soil n transport and transformation and comparing to previous studies yang et al 2014 liang et al 2016b the simulation results of soil nitrate concentration were acceptable fig s2 thus the model can be used to simulate the crop growth water movement and n transport under different water and n fertilizer management in the region 3 2 crop yield water consumption and n fates under different irrigation schedules according to the measured yields table 3 i420 6n200 in 2014 and i420 5n200 in 2015 gave the highest yield at 16 230 and 17 077 kg ha 1 respectively the lowest performing treatment over both years was the i420 4n200 which gave yields of about 15 300 kg ha 1 which was lower than that of i480 4n280 this indicates that reducing the irrigation and fertilization amounts led to decreased yield using the same irrigation strategies increasing the irrigation frequency can offset the negative effect of the reduction of water and fertilizer amounts tables 3 and 4 show the simulated water and n balance of the 5 treatments over the 1 8 m soil depth water drainage decreased with the increase of irrigation times in 2014 the water drainage in the i480 4n280 treatment was significantly higher than that of 2015 mainly due to the higher rainfall in 2014 the order of water drainage amount for both years was i480 4n280 i420 4n200 i420 5n200 i420 6n200 i420 7n200 showed increasing irrigation frequency can decrease the water drainage the wue was improved with an increase of irrigation frequency with an order of i420 5n200 i420 7n200 i420 6n200 i480 4n280 i420 4n200 n output in farmland mainly includes crop utilization n leaching and gaseous n loss crop utilization accounted for 83 of the n output table 4 with the increase of irrigation times the n uptake by crops increased n leaching was the main source of n loss the n leaching in each treatment was similar to the trend of water percolation fig s3 increasing the irrigation times can significantly reduce n leaching and improve nue the gaseous n loss mainly included ammonia volatilization and denitrification which only accounted for 8 6 of the n output the five treatments were evaluated based on the integrated indices table 4 shows that the order of the average index value of each treatment for two years was i420 5n200 i420 7n200 i420 6n200 i420 4n200 i480 4n280 this indicated that i420 5n200 was the best management practice among the five treatments 3 3 optimization of irrigation and n management under different ismns the i420 5n200 treatment had the highest integrated index and was selected to further optimize water and n management practices the whcns model was used to simulate the crop yield water and n balances for different water and n management under various ismn scenarios in 2015 we only showed the two extreme ismn scenarios s1 and s9 because of space limitations 3 3 1 high ismn scenario s1 in the high ismn scenario s1 625 kg n ha 1 for the 2015 season the simulated maize yield increased with an increase in water input and reached the maximum of 22 184 kg ha 1 fig 1 a this indicated that there was potential for further improvement in crop yield simulated yield slightly decreased with an increasing amount of irrigation water over the critical water input about 650 mm the n application rate had no effect on yield for the high ismn level little water drainage 32 mm occurred when the irrigation amount was 500 mm however drainage increased as irrigation water increased above 500 mm fig 1c the amount of nitrate leaching was positively related to the amount of water drainage and n fertilizer rate fig 1e and the n leaching increased quickly with increasing n application rates when the irrigation amount was 500 mm fig 1e wue increased linearly when the irrigation amount was 450 mm fig 1b however when the irrigation amount exceeded 450 mm no obvious change was observed the nue showed a rapidly increasing trend with increasing irrigation amounts and reached the maximum when the irrigation amount was approximately 450 mm and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased fig 1d the response of wue to n inputs was not significant but nue decreased slightly as the increase of n application rate 3 3 2 low ismn scenario s9 the simulated yield water drainage n leaching wue and nue under the s9 scenario ismn 0 kg n ha 1 for the 2015 season are shown in fig 2 compared with s1 n application rate had significant effects on these indices except for water drainage most of n uptake by the crop came from n fertilizer so the yield significantly increased as n rate increased as the n fertilizer increased more water was needed to obtain the maximum yield fig 2a water drainage was the same as the s1 scenario fig 2c n leaching was similar to the s1 scenario but was significantly lower than s1 fig 2e compared with s1 the effect of different n fertilizer rates on wue and nue in s9 scenario was significant fig 2b and 2d 3 3 3 evaluation of water and n managements under different scenarios the aforementioned results showed that with the increasing input of water and n fertilizer the yield and n loss both increased it was difficult to determine the bmps we applied the integrated index to evaluate the appropriateness of each water and n management under different scenarios table 5 shows the results of two ismn scenarios the higher the integrated index the better the water and n management practice according to the integrated indices table 5 for both scenarios i50n480 50 mm irrigation and 480 kg n ha 1 fertilization had the lowest integrated indices and the yield was about 1745 kg ha 1 under the high ismn scenario s1 i450n0 was the bmp with simulated yield of 19 992 kg ha 1 high wue and nue and low n loss in the low ismn scenario s9 i500n360 was the bmp and gave a simulated yield of 19 870 kg ha 1 the optimal irrigation amount was similar for two ismn scenarios but the optimal n rate was different 3 4 relationships of ismn and optimal irrigation and fertilization amount under different weather conditions based on the simulation results in 2015 we obtained the optimal irrigation amounts and n rates that maximized the integrated indices for 9 ismn scenarios to consider the influence of different weather years and precipitation levels on the optimal irrigation amount and n fertilizer rate the whcns model was run from 2001 to 2015 and the results are showed in figs 3 and 4 the optimal irrigation amount under different ismns in the same year was almost the same fig 3a however there was a slight difference in optimal irrigation amount in different years fig 3b the average optimal irrigation amounts for every year ranged from 400 to 583 mm this was due to the difference in rainfall between years which ranged from 64 to 220 mm for 2001 2015 fig 3a the greater the rainfall during the growing period the lower the optimal irrigation amount there was a significant negative correlation between the optimal n fertilizer rate and ismn when ismn ranged from 0 to 400 kg n ha 1 fig 4b under the same ismn the different climatic conditions had great influence on yield so corresponding optimal n fertilizer rate was also different in 2013 the optimal average yield was the lowest 14 246 kg n ha 1 fig 4a resulting in low n uptake by the crop and giving the lowest optimal n fertilizer rate fig 4b except for the relatively lower optimal n fertilizer rate years 2005 2009 2012 and 2013 we obtained a simple linear model to determine the n fertilizer rate by fitting the ismns with the optimal n rates the resulting equation was optimal n rate 396 1 032 ismn fig 4b when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the residual n in the soil could meet the crop growth demand and less supplemental n was needed when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the ismn was negatively correlated with the optimal n fertilizer rate 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation regime on crop yield and n leaching rational irrigation strategies are essential for agricultural production especially for the areas where water shortage is serious many studies have demonstrated that deficit irrigation can improve wue while maintaining high yields farré and faci 2009 fu et al 2017 in this study i420 4n200 with reduced water and n inputs had the lowest yield for two years however the other three conservation treatments with five to seven irrigation events gave high yields table 3 while water drainage and n leaching was decreased this demonstrated that increasing the irrigation applications could maintain high yield and reduce water and n loss hu et al 2011 recommended five irrigation events for spring corn in shiyang river basin which was consistent with our study liang et al 2016b found that yield increased with increasing amounts of irrigation and then reached a plateau when the irrigation amount was 500 mm in a desert oasis in our results the yield showed a decreased trend when irrigation amount exceeded 650 mm fig 1a this may be caused by different weather and soil conditions the study area was located in northwest china where intensive irrigation or rainfall can easily cause a large amount of n leaching due to high sand content high ismn conditions further increased the risk of n leaching which in turn affected crop yield increasing irrigation events could mitigate n loss by leaching and improve wue and nue 4 2 effects of fertilization on crop yield and n leaching under different ismns many studies have reported that over fertilization did not achieve higher yields but caused serious resource waste and environmental risk zhang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 so it is necessary to optimize the fertilizer rate based on ismns dai et al 2015 found that grain yields and n application rates resulted in different soil residual n huang et al 2018 reported that when the n application rate was 190 kg n ha 1 nitrate remaining in the soil increased greatly and increased the risk of n leaching zhang et al 2015 showed that a fertilizer rate of 150 240 kg n ha 1 could maintain a high yield for maize and keep the nitrate leaching at a low level he also found that an n application rate of 179 kg ha 1 for maize was beneficial for both yield and the environment zhang et al 2018 in our study crop yield and n leaching was related to both ismn and n application rate the n200 treatment had no influence on crop yield compared with n280 treatment but the n leaching was reduced n leaching increased as the n fertilizer rate increased under same ismn level under the high ismn levels less n was needed to maintain yield and over fertilization increased the negative environmental impact as the ismn decreased the soil could not supply enough n to satisfy the crop needs so increasing n rates would have an obvious yield increasing effect our results were consistent with previous studies 4 3 the optimization of n application rate based on ismn because n recommendation methods based on local soil n tests have some weakness many other methods have been proposed to determine the reasonable n rates for different purposes zhang et al 2018 found that the optimal n application rate was the highest when the targeting n uptake followed by crop yield and economic benefit n rates were the smallest when targeting environmental costs zhu 2006 proposed regional average suitable n application rates based on a large number of field experiments but it ignored the spatial variability of soil nutrient in a large region ju and christie 2011 found that the theoretical n application rate was equal to the n uptake by the crop aboveground which was obtained under the conditions that all the straw was returned to the field in this study we gave the n recommendation based on the ismns using a modeling approach with comprehensive consideration of af ef and vcr under different ismn scenarios the optimal n fertilizer rate varied substantially when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the optimal n application rate decreased linearly with the increasing ismn when the ismn was 384 kg n ha 1 the optimum n application rate was 0 cui et al 2008a also found 73 87 of n uptake by the crop came from soil under high soil n content which is consistent with our study due to the soil spatial heterogeneity climate and other management factors in different regions the weight coefficient of af ef and vcr should be adjusted according to the actual conditions the linear model for n rate and ismn also needs to be validated in different places 5 conclusion the whcns model was calibrated and evaluated based on field measured data for spring maize in the oasis farmland of shiyang river basin china the results indicated that the model could be used to quantitatively analyze the n fates wue and nue in the region increasing the irrigation frequency can offset the negative effect of the reduction of water and fertilizer amounts meanwhile maintaining yield and reduce n leaching five irrigation applications was found to be the best treatment with low n leaching and high wue and nue the optimum irrigation amount was determined by the precipitation amount and had no relationship with ismn the relationship between the optimal n application rate and ismn could be described by a linear plus platform model optimal n rate 396 1 032 ismn when the ismn 384 kg ha 1 no or less n fertilizer was needed to maintain yields and reduce the risk of environmental pollution results of this study provide guidance to farmers in this region on how to manage irrigation and n application rates based on ismn levels declaration of competing interest the authors have declared that no competing
