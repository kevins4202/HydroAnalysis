16830,this study aimed to assess the role of hydrothermal carbonisation htc in digestate processing in centralised biogas plants receiving dewatered sludge from regional wastewater treatment plants and producing biomethane and fertilisers chemically conditioned and mechanically dewatered sludge was used as such total solids ts 25 or as diluted 15 ts with reject water in 30 min or 120 min htc treatments at 210 c 230 c or 250 c and the produced slurry was filtered to produce hydrochars and filtrates the different hydrochars contributed to 20 55 of the original mass 72 88 of the ts 74 87 of the energy content 71 92 of the carbon above 86 of phosphorous and 38 64 of the nitrogen present in the original digestates the hydrochars energy content higher heating values were 11 3 12 2 mj kg ts were similar to that of the digestates while the ash contents increased from 43 up to 57 htc treatments produced filtrates in volumes of 42 76 of the dewatered digestate having a soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of 28 44 g l of which volatile fatty acids vfas contributed 10 34 and methane potentials of 182 206 ml ch4 g scod without any major indication of inhibition all 32 pharmaceuticals detected in the digestates were below the detection limit in hydrochars and filtrates save for ibuprofen and benzotriazole in filtrate while heavy metals were concentrated in the hydrochars but below the national limits for fertiliser use save for mercury the integration of htc to a centralised biogas plant was extrapolated to enhance the annual biogas production by 5 and ammonium recovery by 25 and the hydrochar was estimated to produce 83 gj upon combustion or to direct 350 t phosphorous to agriculture annually graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge digestate hydrothermal carbonisation hydrochar phosphorous nutrient recovery energy recovery 1 introduction municipal wastewaters are typically treated using an activated sludge process that results in high amounts of sewage sludge including primary sludge consisting of wastewater solids and biosludge consisting of aerobic microbes in wastewater treatment plants sewage sludge is often gravimetrically thickened and then stabilised in anaerobic digestion ad which recovers the energy from the process as biogas which is valued as a renewable energy source the digestated material is typically mechanically dewatered using polymers into solid fraction and liquid fraction referred to as reject water the solid fraction total solids ts 15 30 with high organic and nutrient content may be composted to be used as soil amendment or combusted alvarenga et al 2015 the reject water is usually circulated to the wastewater treatment plant the sewage sludge energy content recovered in ad has recently been increasingly considered for upgrading into biofuel or gas grid injection to promote energy transition for economic reasons centralised biogas plants treating dewatered sludge from several sewage plants are used furthermore the recovery of sewage sludge nutrients and residual carbon especially that of phosphorous is of major interest because of diminishing phosphorous resources and to reduce the climate impacts of nitrogen fertilizer production becker et al 2019 however in practice the use of sewage sludge digestates in agriculture is a concern because of contaminants thus the use of sewage sludge based nutrients is facing major challenges the concern is about certain contaminants such as heavy metals pharmaceuticals and microplastics which the biological processes alone are incapable of converting into something more harmless and part of which can also end up in the digestate alvarenga et al 2015 hence to harness sewage sludge digestate in a safe manner an additional post treatment step needs to be considered one such recently discussed sludge post treatment is hydrothermal carbonisation htc aragón briceño et al 2017 htc is a thermal treatment applicable for organic material and is conducted at temperatures of 180 250 c with residence times from 0 5 to several hours libra et al 2011 particularly htc is considered for moist ts 10 50 organic material which differentiates it from other thermal processes for example pyrolysis which typically requires a higher solids content ts 90 bridgwater et al 1999 and utilises comparatively high temperatures 500 800 c paneque et al 2017 htc yields a moist carbonaceous solid fraction that is usually separated into a solid and liquid i e hydrochar and filtrate respectively in addition htc releases exhaust gas comprising primarily of co2 but also of other compounds such as hydrogen sulphide nitrogen dioxide nitric oxide and ammonia hence requiring further treatment berge et al 2011 danso boateng et al 2015 the amounts and characteristics of the three fractions are affected by the feedstock e g berge et al 2011 and the used htc conditions such as temperature and residence time htc has been studied for a range of feedstocks to produce hydrochar which could be used as is or after downstream processing for example as a soil amendment bargmann et al 2014 for sequestrating atmospheric carbon to soils libra et al 2011 as an adsorbent sun et al 2011 or for combustion smith et al 2016 htc treatment has also been studied for sewage sludge for example to screen the effects of htc on the treatment of sludges from different phases of the plant merzari et al 2020 to compare with different feedstocks including agricultural waste he et al 2019 and to determine the effects of htc treatment conditions on hydrochar danso boateng et al 2015 the ad process affects the characteristics of the sludge in many ways for example it lowers the carbon content of the sludge impacts its sulphur and phosphate chemistry and increases the ammonium concentration thus the characteristics of the hydrochar and filtrate from the htc treatment of digestate may differ from those of the htc treated raw sewage sludge aragón briceño et al 2017 there are several laboratory studies on the htc treatment of digested sewage sludge that have shown for example that the filtrate of htc treated digested sewage sludge at 240 c has a clear inhibition towards methane production marin batista et al 2020 whereas at lower temperatures no clear inhibition has been reported aragón briceño et al 2017 regarding the effects of htc on digestate phosphorous marin batista et al 2020 reported an increase in phosphorous content in the filtrate with increasing htc temperatures while merzari et al 2020 observed no increase or even a decrease in the filtrate s phosphorous content after htc however the studies on sewage sludge digestates differ for example in the origin of the digestate before or after dewatering in the htc conditions studied and in the processing of the samples in the laboratory before htc for example merzari et al 2020 studied dewatered sewage sludge digestate ts 25 that they however diluted for the htc treatment 15 g sludge and 10 g water resulting in ca 17 ts digestate aragón briceño et al 2020 on the other hand studied sewage sludge digestate with an original ts of 3 but processed the sample in the laboratory to study htc at eight different ts contents 2 5 30 thus there is a lack of information on the dewatered digestates representing real conditions also the separation techniques employed to obtain hydrochar and filtrate vary including filtering through a cellulose filter paper merzari et al 2020 vacuum filtration 0 9 mm followed by an additional supernatant filtration 0 45 µm marin batista et al 2020 and through glass microfibre filters aragón briceño et al 2020 the current work examined the effects of htc process parameters on the amounts and characteristics of the hydrochar and filtrate produced from dewatered digested sewage sludge the studied dewatered digestate was obtained directly from the centralised biogas plant and it was studied as such ts of 25 and after dilution with dewatering reject water to ts of 15 using temperatures of 210 c 230 c and 250 c and residence times of 30 or 120 min the separation of hydrochar and filtrate was conducted at a pilot scale the energy and nutrient characteristics and recovery of both fractions were determined and the mass balances were evaluated results from the laboratory scale study are needed to assess the technological and economic feasibility of scale up applications for centralised biogas plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 digestates and reject water in the htc experiments mechanically dewatered digestate from an industrial thermophilic sewage sludge digester was used mechanical dewatering of digested sludge was done in the plant with a decanter centrifuge along with polymer addition also reject water from dewatering was used the materials were obtained from a centralised biogas plant in topinoja turku finland which treated during the experiments annually 75 000 t ca 23 ts 16 500 t ts a of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge transported from six regional municipal wastewater treatment plants producing 30 000 t of dewatered digestate ca 30 ts 9000 t ts a for the biomethane potential bmp assays the inoculum was from a mesophilic municipal biowaste digestion facility riihimäki finland all samples were anaerobically stored at 4 c for 1 2 months until used in the htc experiments the digestate was used as such ts 25 referred to as digestate or diluted to 15 ts by adding 400 ml of reject water to 600 g of the digestate referred to as diluted digestate the dilutions were performed right before the htc treatments the material characteristics are shown in table 1 2 2 htc treatments the htc treatment used a two litre parr 4500 pressure reactor with an external circulating cooling water system and internal rotary mixer initially 40 rpm the final mixing speed increased as a result of the viscosity decrease of the samples during the treatments table 2 the sample wet weight for the experiments was 1 kg and the treatment temperatures were 210 c 230 c or 250 c with residence times of 30 or 120 min table 2 the heating of the reactor vessel to the target temperatures was achieved within ca 90 min the temperature was manually adjusted using parr 4848 reactor controllers the vessel pressure started to increase after the inside temperature reached 100 c and then increased to 20 to 40 bar depending on the applied temperature the vessel was held at the target temperature for the pre set residence time the realised temperatures fluctuated but remained within 9 c from the targeted temperature table 2 the 250 c runs started when the vessel temperature had reached 245 c because of difficulties in attaining the targeted temperature within 90 min in all the runs after the residence time the heating was switched off an arbitrary volume of gas was released and cooling water circulation was initiated in the water jacket the gas release reduced the inside pressure and temperature by 2 4 bar and 1 4 c respectively of which purpose was to prevent possible condensation the water cooling lasted until the vessel temperature had decreased to 40 70 c which was achieved within 30 40 min after the htc treatments the whole sample volume was weighed recovered and stored at 4 c prior to solid liquid separation by filtration filtration for the htc treated sludges called slurry was conducted in a small scale pressurised filtration unit the temperature during filtration was ca 60 c which was attained by warming up the samples ca 1 kg in a water bath before filtration the heated sample was placed onto a filter cloth inside a cylinder the pressure in the closed cylinder gradually increased 5 min to 1 bar 10 min to 4 bar and then to the final pressure of 15 bar the total pressing time for the digestate samples was about 20 min whereas for the diluted digestate samples it was about 30 min the end products of filtration are from now on called hydrochar solid fraction and filtrate liquid fraction the hydrochar product is comprised of both moisture that was not removed by filtration and of dry solids that are obtained after evaporation the weights of the recovered filtrate and hydrochar were recorded 2 3 biomethane potential assays the bmps of the filtrates of the htc treated digestates were determined in static 37 day long batch assays in triplicate at 35 c in all assays 120 ml serum bottles and 3 4 g wet weight of inoculum were used the scod concentration of the filtrate was set to 2 g scod l nahco3 4 g l was used as a buffer and distilled water was added to the bottles to reach the volumes of 64 ml the initial ph was adjusted between 7 and 8 with hcl 1 m after which the bottles were closed with rubber stoppers anaerobic conditions were created inside by flushing with nitrogen gas for 3 min assays containing only water buffer and inoculum functioned as the control and their methane production was subtracted from the methane production of the sample assays the methane concentrations in the bmp determination were measured with a gc fid perkin elmer clarus as described previously kinnunen et al 2015 and the bmps were calculated as presented in eq s1 2 4 chemical analysis and calculations the ts and volatile solids vs were gravimetrically determined according to standard methods apha 2540 the ash content measurements at 550 c and 815 c followed the same gravimetric principle the ph level was measured with a wtw ph 3210 metre using wtw sentix 41 electrode cod and scod were analysed according to finnish standard methods sfs 5504 volatile fatty acids vfa were determined with gc fid as described previously kokko et al 2018 prior to the analysis of vfa and scod the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter chromafil xtra pet the total nitrogen and soluble ammonium nitrogen in the liquid phase were analysed using hach lange kits lck 238 lck 338 lck 305 and lck 303 according to the instructions provided by the company the other cations than ammonium nitrogen in the liquid samples were analysed according to the ion chromatography standard sfs en iso 10 304 1 using an ion chromatograph dionex dx 120 usa with as40 autosampler ionpac cs12a cation exchange column and csrs 300 suppressor 4 mm the eluent contained 2 mm methane sulphonic acid and the flow rate was 1 ml min the solid phase total carbon hydrogen nitrogen and sulphur were determined by elemental analysis in thermo scientific flashsmart elemental analyzer chns o with tcd thermal conductivity detector before the analysis samples were properly homogenized samples were first dried in oven at 100 c overnight after which the dry samples were grinded with mortar to obtain fine powder the samples for chns analysis were weighted 2 3 mg on a microgram balance mettler toledo wxts microbalance in tin cups calibration was evaluated analysing bbot 2 5 bis 5 tert butyl 2 benzo oxazol 2 yl as a standard gases used were helium as a carrier gas and oxygen as a gas for sample oxidation the total phosphorous and other elements in the solid and liquid samples were determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for further details of this analysis see supporting information the calorific values of the solid samples were determined in duplicate with a parr 6725 semi micro oxygen bomb calorimeter according to the iso 1928 standard prior to the analysis the samples were dried overnight at 100 c the sample weight for the analysis was 0 2 0 3 g the hydrochar yields y energy densification ed and energy recovery of hydrochar were calculated as described previously danso boateng et al 2015 the energy content and energy recoveries of the filtrates were calculated based on the results of the bmp and the mass distribution after different htc runs the mass of digestate converted to gas during htc treatment was calculated by the difference in the masses of the input digestate and the obtained slurry after htc eq s7 for further details of the calculations see supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass and ts recoveries the htc treatment yielded three fractions the relative mass yields of which depended on the applied htc conditions fig 1 the produced hydrochar masses wet basis covered 30 55 and 20 34 of the original masses of the digestate and diluted digestate respectively fig 1 the moisture content of the hydrochars after filtration ranged between 37 and 61 and 46 and 65 for the digestate and diluted digestate respectively table 3 the vs ts ratio decreased from 57 of the digestates to 43 50 in the hydrochars the hydrochar yields dry basis were between 72 and 87 and between 72 and 88 for the digestate and diluted digestate table 3 respectively suggesting that the ts content of the digestate does not affect the recovery of ts in hydrochar with the digestate an increased treatment temperature decreased the hydrochar mass and ts yields and increased the yields of the filtrate and gas fig 1 while the effects were not so clear for the diluted digestate the mass of the filtrate varied between 42 and 60 and between 60 and 76 for the digestate and diluted digested fig 1 respectively the calculated gas formation ranged from 1 to 11 of the original digestate mass and was larger in the htc of the digestate than in the htc of diluted digestate the highest hydrochar ts yields of 87 6 and 88 3 were obtained at 210 c for 120 min for the digestate and diluted digestate respectively while the residence time had no clear effect on hydrochar ts yield the present study and other research aragón briceño et al 2017 have shown that in processing mechanically dewatered digestate htc treatment with subsequent solids separation can produce hydrochar with recoveries even above 70 85 of the original ts while contributing to around 40 50 of the original mass the present hydrochar yields on a ts basis 72 88 are at the upper range of the hydrochar yields of 66 75 at 220 250 c and 67 74 at 180 210 c reported in other htc studies with digested sewage sludge with a ts content of 17 merzari et al 2020 or 16 5 marin batista et al 2020 respectively with decreased hydrochar yields at increased temperatures which is also observed in the current study however a hydrochar yield of 51 was obtained at 240 c marin batista et al 2020 indicating that the original characteristics of the sewage sludge digestate have a major effect on the product characteristics in htc studies conducted with digested sewage sludge at a lower ts content of below 5 the hydrochar yields on a ts basis have varied from 47 berge et al 2011 to 56 78 aragón briceño et al 2017 merzari et al 2020 without a clear effect of temperature on hydrochar yield as what is found at higher digestate ts contents thus the hydrochar ts yield may not be fully deduced from the ts content or the htc conditions but also from the chemical characteristics of the sludge merzari et al 2020 parmar and ross 2019 the hydrochar mass yield in the present study 30 55 for digestate and 20 34 for diluted digestate was considerably lower than the 66 88 obtained for digested sewage sludge with ts content of 17 merzari et al 2020 however it should be noted that the reported mass and ts yields of hydrochar and filtrate are affected along with the digestate characteristics by the separation technique used to separate the hydrochar and filtrate which vary by research 3 2 energy characteristics 3 2 1 hydrochar the energy content and solid fuel properties of the different hydrochars and digestates were assessed using moisture content heating values and the ash content which is responsible for the combustion furnace fouling jenkins et al 1998 the energy content and solid fuel properties of the 12 hydrochars and the digestate and diluted digestate are presented in table 3 the hhv of all the hydrochars were of a similar range 11 3 12 2 mj kg ts as the digestates hhvs 11 5 11 9 mj kg ts with energy densification values of 0 95 1 05 the hhv of the digestate hydrochars was 1 2 5 5 higher than the hhv of the digestate after all the treatments except for the mildest ones conducted at 210 c conversely the hhv of diluted digestate hydrochar increased by 2 2 from the digestate hhv only in the severest treatment 250 c 120 min while the other treatment conditions decreased the hhv by 0 6 4 9 the ash content determined at 550 c of the hydrochars increased from 50 to 57 with increasing treatment temperature and residence time while the ash contents of both the digestate and diluted digestate were 43 based on the current study and what is reported in the literature it appears that the effects of htc treatment on the hhv of the digestate are quite minimal less than 4 5 the hhv of the digestates used in the present study 11 5 11 9 mj kg ts was much lower than reported in other studies with digestate ts content of 16 5 14 9 mj kg ts marin batista et al 2020 or 17 16 0 mj kg ts merzari et al 2020 a lower hhv of the digestate 10 7 mj kg ts has been reported with 2 9 ts in the digestate merzari et al 2020 the hhvs of the hydrochars differed less than 2 martin batista et al 2020 and less than 5 merzari et al 2020 from the hhvs of the digestates with a ts content above 15 which is in accordance with the findings of the present study higher differences in the hhvs of the digestate and hydrochar of 7 2 26 have been reported for digestates with a lower ts content of 2 9 4 5 table 5 while a high ash content of the feedstock is related to decreased hhvs zhuang et al 2018 it does not explain the difference in the observed hhv for the different digestate hydrochars between the present and previous studies marin batista et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 thus it seems that the hhv of the digested sewage sludge hydrochar depends on the hhv of the digestate used as feedstock although the effects of htc treatment on the hhv are often negligible htc treatment results in higher ash content of the hydrochar compared with the original digestate in the present study the ash content of the digested sewage sludge increased from 43 to as high as 50 57 on htc treatment while with other digested sewage sludge the ash content increased from 40 to 42 48 marin batista et al 2020 and from 28 to 35 43 merzari et al 2020 on htc treatment of digestates with ts content of 16 5 and 17 respectively htc treatment of digested sewage sludge with a lower ts content of 2 9 3 0 has resulted in an even higher increase in the ash content from 35 to 55 berge et al 2011 and from 45 to 57 77 merzari et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 linked the lower ash content of the dewatered digestate 28 4 compared with the original digestate 45 to the removal of inorganic compounds such as nh4 n caco3 mg and na that end up in the reject water during conditioning and dewatering in terms of fouling slagging and corrosion the inorganics contained in the ash influence the fuel behaviour upon combustion thus affecting the choice of an appropriate combustion technology smith et al 2016 these ash forming inorganic elements include alkali and earth alkali metals na k mg and ca as well as p fe si and s smith et al 2016 in the present study the increase in the concentrations of calcium with temperature of htc treatment in the hydrochars were similar for the digestate and diluted digestate from 22 to 24 to 23 2 35 1 g ca kg ts whereas those of sodium and potassium were decreased for diluted digestate from 6 2 to 3 0 4 2 g na kg ts and from 2 4 to 1 5 2 0 g k kg ts and were increased or unaffected for digestate from 4 25 to 2 8 4 1 g na kg ts and from 1 7 to 1 6 2 0 g k kg ts table s1 in the case of iron a larger decrease in concentration from 229 to 165 201 g fe kg ts was observed with the digestate than with the diluted digestate from 184 to 133 182 g fe kg ts which could be due to the degradation of digestate particles and their extraction into the liquid fraction wang et al 2019 in addition in the present study the htc treatment slightly decreased the sulphur concentrations from 23 g s kg ts of digestates to 18 22 g s kg ts of hydrochars these concentrations of sulphur were higher than in the digested sewage sludge hydrochars reported elsewhere maximum sulphur concentration of 12 g s kg ts aragón briceño et al 2017 parmar and ross 2019 which was because of their lower initial digestate sulphur concentration when compared with the present digestate the comparatively high sulphur content in the present digestate may arise from the addition of phosphorous precipitation chemical fe ii so4 at the wwtp which is also supported by the high iron concentrations in the hydrochars that are ca 10 fold higher than that reported for dewatered digestate by marin batista et al 2020 3 2 2 filtrate the htc treatment produced filtrates with ph of 8 4 9 0 from the digestate initial ph 7 5 and with a ph of 9 3 9 7 for the diluted digestate initial ph 7 9 htc treatment of digested sewage sludge results in alkaline filtrates aragón briceño et al 2017 marin batista et al 2020 even though the degradation products of hydrolysis generated during htc often promote acidity rather than alkalinity qiao et al 2011 however the final ph is also impacted by volatilisation for example of ammonia during htc treatment liu et al 2019 even though the ph values of the filtrate are higher than those considered optimum for anaerobic treatment the treatment of the filtrates in ad may be managed without ph adjustment because the process operation and co digestion can be adjusted the scods of the htc filtrates ranged from 37 to 44 g l and from 28 to 32 g l for the digestate and diluted digestate respectively being 10 20 times higher than in the feedstocks the scods were slightly higher at higher htc treatment temperatures but no major effects of the htc conditions were obvious however even though the scod changed only a little its composition varied because total vfa contributed ca 30 of the scod at higher temperatures while at 210 c tvfas were ca 10 of scod the higher treatment temperature especially increased the propionate concentration from around 0 4 g l at 210 c to 6 9 g l at 250 c while the changes in other vfa concentrations were low increased residence time increased acetate concentration slightly 1 8 g l at all temperatures even though the scod composition varied in different filtrates the cumulative methane production profiles of all the filtrates were almost similar with an initial two day lag phase fig 2 the resulting bmps varied from 185 to 206 ml ch4 g scod with little difference and without a clear impact resulting from the htc conditions table 4 the bmp yields of the htc filtrates were around two fold higher compared with the bmp yield of the filtrate of the original digestate the present and previous studies have shown that htc treatment increases the scod of the filtrate several fold compared with the scod of the sewage sludge digestate resulting in reported scod values ranging from 5 7 g l up to 72 g l for htc filtrates table 6 this increase in scod is a result from the hydrolysis of fats carbohydrates and proteins into smaller units that is fatty acids vfas sugars and amino acids qiao et al 2011 with a specific feedstock the feedstock solids content used in the htc treatment affects the scod concentration for example htc treatment 250 c 30 min of sewage sludge digestate increased filtrate scods from 9 7 g l up to 72 g l when the ts content of the digestate used in htc treatment was increased from 2 5 to 30 aragón briceño et al 2020 contrary to our study aragón briceño et al 2020 reported that htc treatment decreased the share of vfas of the scod because it was around 15 for the digestate and at the highest 10 for htc filtrate furthermore the share of the vfas of the scod decreased with increasing loading from 10 to ca 5 of the highest solids loading of 72 g l aragón briceño et al 2020 it should be noted that in htc treatments some produced compounds may also volatilise and be discharged in the gas phase based on the current study and the literature the htc treatment of digested sewage sludge has resulted in two to three fold higher methane production per g scod aragón briceño et al 2017 compared with reject water from sewage sludge digestate even though the effects on scod composition vary the batch assays used to determine methane production have not suggested major inhibition in most of the studies aragón briceño et al 2020 parmar and ross 2019 on the other hand severe inhibition was observed in bmp assays with a 240 c filtrate marin batista et al 2020 however it should be noted that the methane potential is assayed in specific conditions e g batch with different substrate dilutions and care should be taken in practice if an anaerobic process is used for the treatment of filtrates it should also be noted that the volume of the filtrate may be up to 76 of the digestate and close to the feedstock volume furthermore the introduction of the filtrate into the digestor affects the composition of the reject water the digestate to be treated in htc and subsequently the filtrate characteristics 3 2 3 overall energy balance the combined energy contents kwh kg feed and recoveries of the original feed of the hydrochars as hhv and filtrates as bmp were assessed for the digestate and of the hydrochars for the diluted digestate fig 3 the values presented do not consider the energy consumed in the htc the hydrochars covered 74 87 of the total energy content of the digestate and diluted digestate while the filtrates covered 4 6 of the total energy content of the digestate the highest energy contents were obtained in the digestate hydrochars from the treatments at 210 c and 230 c 0 66 0 69 kwh kg feed overall the hydrochar energy content was more influenced by the digestate ts content than the different htc conditions it has been observed that the energy recovery in hydrochar decreases with increasing temperature and time aragón briceño et al 2017 danso boateng et al 2015 but according to the present results also with the ts content of the original digestate the energy balance suggests that htc downgrades the energetic potential of digested sewage sludge by 7 20 however the benefit of the htc treatment may not come from the absolute energy recovery alone but from the improved suitability for combustion here considering that the moisture content and a favourable ash composition may diminish fouling smith et al 2016 3 3 nutrients to assess the fate of the nutrients present in the dewatered sewage sludge digestate and diluted digestate the hydrochars and filtrates phosphorous and nitrogen contents were analysed for the different htc conditions studied tables 3 and 4 for the total phosphorus concentrations htc showed an increase by 25 52 and 19 61 compared with the original digestate 37 2 g kg ts and diluted digestate 31 5 g kg ts respectively the filtrates from the digestate and diluted digestate had total phosphorous concentrations of 510 890 mg l and 330 1130 mg l and phosphate concentrations of 40 99 mg l and 87 176 mg l respectively although phosphate was increasingly formed during the htc treatments not detected in the original digestate filtrate the total phosphorous concentration of the filtrates decreased 1080 mg l in the original digestate filtrate indicating that part of the total phosphorous was transferred to the hydrochar fraction in the present study the recovery of phosphorous in the hydrochar was higher or similar as previously reported even though the initial phosphorous concentrations were at a lower range much like in our study an increase in phosphorous concentrations from 45 8 g kg ts to 52 8 63 0 g kg ts with an increase of 15 38 and from 9 2 g kg ts to 9 2 10 9 g kg ts with an increase of 0 18 have been shown to occur with digestate ts contents of 16 5 and 17 respectively marin batista et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 the phosphorous content g kg ts of the hydrochar has been increased with increasing htc treatment temperature and residence time marin batista et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 as also reported in the current study the difference in the phosphorous concentrations in the hydrochars in different studies table 5 is dictated by the digestate phosphorus concentration and may also be affected by the phosphorous removal method at wwtp phosphorous is often precipitated at wwtps with aluminium or iron salts in the present study sewage sludge originated from wwtp using iron salts for phosphorous precipitation resulting in iron concentrations of 180 230 mg g ts in the digested sewage sludge the al and fe concentrations in the digestated sewage sludge were 41 9 mg g ts and 15 8 mg g ts in marin batista et al 2020 whereas in merzari et al 2020 the al concentration in the digested sewage sludge it was around 2 5 mg g ts however in these two studies the unit processes of wastewater treatment for example phosphorous removal technologies were not defined making it difficult to interpret some nutrient results phosphorous only exists either in a solid or liquid state hence the phosphorous balance was created by summing the elemental phosphorous analysed in the filtrate and hydrochar the total phosphorous mass balance in fig 4 b exceeded the input mass of phosphorous in nearly all treatments which was due to heterogeneity of the analysed material and a small sample amount in the icp ms analysis however it can be concluded that the majority 90 of the phosphorus was recovered in the hydrochar fig 4a and 4b to which the different htc conditions gave little variety the dissolved phosphorous in the filtrates were slightly higher for the htc treated diluted digestate 4 13 than for digestate 2 5 it has been reported that lower solids loading studied ts ranged from 2 5 to 30 of sewage sludge digestate promotes phosphorous solubility which can be attributed to the decreased precipitation of phosphorous with metal ions that are present in lesser amounts with lower solids input aragón briceño et al 2020 the dissolution of phosphorous from the digestate was enhanced with the longer treatment times except for htc treated digestate at 250 c thus to enable the utilisation of phosphorous it should be either leached from the hydrochar becker et al 2019 or the hydrochar should be amenable as a fertiliser bargmann et al 2014 the total nitrogen concentration in the hydrochars were 21 4 25 8 g tn kg ts and reduced by 23 39 and 17 31 relative to the digestate and diluted digestate respectively table 3 the total nitrogen concentrations in the filtrates varied in the range of 4 9 6 1 g l for the digestate and 4 3 4 8 g l for the diluted digestate while the ammonium nitrogen concentrations presented only slight variations between treatments 2 5 3 3 g l there was a significant increase in the total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen concentrations when compared with their concentrations in the liquid fraction of the digestate 0 32 g tn l 2 mg nh4 n l however in the reject water used to dilute the digestate the total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen concentrations were 3 7 g l and 2 9 g l respectively the present study has shown that htc converts nitrogen from the solid phase of the dewatered digestate into the liquid phase similarly a decrease in hydrochar nitrogen content compared with the dewatered digestate has been reported in other studies from 51 to 41 42 g tn kg ts at htc temperatures of 180 240 c marin batista et al 2020 from 40 to 19 28 g tn kg ts at 250 c aragón briceño et al 2020 and from 58 1 to 31 2 42 7 g tn kg ts at htc temperature of 190 250 c merzari et al 2020 with a digestate without dewatering a decrease in hydrochar nitrogen content from 50 4 to 20 1 42 3 g tn kg ts was observed at htc temperatures of 220 c and 250 c while at an htc temperature of 160 c the nitrogen content increased from 50 4 to 51 1 g tn kg ts aragón briceño et al 2017 an increase in the htc temperature decreased the nitrogen content in the solid fraction aragón briceño et al 2017 merzari et al 2020 which was also found to be the case in the current study the observed increase of nitrogen percentage in the hydrochar fraction at a higher ts content of the hydrochar was also reported by aragón briceño et al 2020 who tested htc treatment with digested sewage sludge ts contents from 2 5 to 30 during htc treatment a decline in nitrogen content in hydrochars has been reported to occur because of the decomposition of labile and organic nitrogen compounds while the volatile nitrogen compounds are already devolatilised below temperatures of 220 c to the liquid and gas phases zhuang et al 2018 the increase in ammonium nitrogen concentration in the filtrate at increased htc temperatures has been connected to the hydrolysis of proteins through peptides and amino acids to fatty acids and ammonia marin batista et al 2020 the volatilisation of nitrogen compounds was observed in the current study fig 5 both in the filtrates and hydrochars upon increasing the htc temperature and time the original nitrogen content and its distribution to the htc products are presented in fig 5 the total nitrogen lost in the gas phase varied between 3 and 20 which however was calculated by difference therefore giving some room for error the nitrogen recovery into the product fractions depended on the digestate ts because the digestate hydrochars retained 46 64 and the diluted digestate hydrochars 36 46 of the total nitrogen the filtrates from the digestate and diluted digestate contained 26 40 and 41 48 of the total nitrogen respectively high volumes of filtrate and high concentrations of nitrogen in the filtrate present an interesting option for nitrogen recovery if the filtrate was fed back to the biogas digestor the ammonium nitrogen could be recovered from the filtrate in addition to that in the reject water from the mechanical dewatering of digestate for example with ammonium stripping but then again the unionised form of ammonium ammonia nh3 at too high concentrations can inhibit methanogens in ad jiang et al 2019 which could be avoided by treating the filtrate directly in ammonium stripping however the hydrochar also contained a large portion 21 4 27 0 g kg ts of the total nitrogen the carbon contents of the hydrochars ranged from 29 to 31 table 3 which is typical for hydrochars from digested sewage sludge table 5 the carbon recoveries were on average 82 7 and 83 5 in the hydrochars from the digestate and diluted digestate respectively decreasing with treatment severity 3 4 trace elements heavy metals and pharmaceuticals the trace elements cu zn al and ni and heavy metals au as cd cr hg and pb of the hydrochars and filtrates were analysed tables s1 and s2 all the concentrations were below the permitted limit values dictated by the eu 86 278 eec and finnish authorities ylivainio and turtola 2016 except the limit concentration of mercury for fertilisers used in finland 0 001 mg hg g ts was already exceeded in the digestates 0 02 mg hg g ts and its concentration increased in htc to 0 02 0 03 mg hg g ts in the hydrochars overall the heavy metal and trace element concentrations per ts were slightly increased in all hydrochars from those of the digestates which could be attributed to the mass decrease of the solid phase during htc and or to the precipitation of these metal ions as salts in the hydrochar zhang et al 2014 pharmaceuticals are known to be present in sewage sludge and digestates radjenović et al 2009 the present results showed two hormones and 23 pharmaceuticals in the digestate for example 0 15 mg kg ts estrone 2 4 mg kg ts tetracycline 0 24 mg kg ts diclofenac and 0 93 mg kg ts doxycycline in the solid fraction and 8 µg l tetracycline and 5 4 µg l diclofenac in the liquid fraction of the digestate table s3 after htc treatment no hormones or pharmaceuticals analyszed were detected in the hydrochar fraction below the detection limit in the filtrate only two pharmaceuticals were detected 330 µg l benzotriazole and 230 µg l ibuprofen while the concentrations of the other pharmaceuticals were below the detection limit the detection limits for most of the hormones and pharmaceuticals in the hydrochar and filtrate were under 0 5 mg kg ts and1 0 µg l respectively while the detection limits after htc were higher for ciprofloxacin 50 µg l tetracycline 10 µg l and mirtazapine sertraline norsertraline and cetirizine 5 µg l in the filtrate thus the presence of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline in the filtrate cannot be excluded benzotriazole is widely used in cosmetics and in corrosion prevention thus ending up in municipal wastewater zhang et al 2011 although in the current study htc treatment removed most of the pharmaceuticals not all possible hormones and pharmaceuticals nor their degradation products were analysed other studies have also concluded that htc has potential to degrade organic pollutants while emphasising its limitedness in complete removal or detoxification of chlorinated aromatics and for example phenazone vom eyser et al 2015 weiner et al 2013 4 practical implications the present results and previous information on htc treatment of digestate can be used to assess the potential of htc for individual cases and for example to calculate a techno economic analysis in each case the utilisation of biogas hydrochars and filtrates as well as the energy and nutrient contents in these streams depend on many local factors which further affect the technological system its economics and sustainability an example extrapolation calculation for integrating htc into a biogas process was done for a centralised topinoja biogas plant from where the dewatered sewage sludge digestate for the current study was obtained and compared with the process at the time of the experiments fig 6 the biogas plant annually treats 75 000 t of sewage sludge 22 ts and produces 30 000 t of dewatered digestate 30 ts the htc assessment was done by averaging the results from three htc runs with the digestate 210 c for 120 min and 230 c for 30 min or 120 min considered relevant for practical application it was assumed that ca 40 of the digestate volume 36 000 t 25 ts ends up in hydrochar and the rest to filtrate minimal losses of mass to the gas phase in such a case ca 14 400 t of hydrochar would be produced which has a ts content of 50 and an energy content of ca 11 5 mj kg ts the hydrochar could currently be considered for different end use applications for example used in agriculture where it would promote carbon and nutrient utilisation thus benefitting circular economy or for co combustion with an annual energy production from the hydrochar of ca 82 800 gj fig 6 the economic benefit from the hydrochar production for energy recovery has been reported to even exceed the profits from biogas production per tonne of sewage sludge aragón briceño et al 2021 if the filtrate ca 18 000 t a was fed to the biogas process it would enhance the annual methane production with ca 140 000 m3 1 4 gwh that is 4 5 from the current annual methane production of ca 3 million m3 30 gwh furthermore the feeding of the filtrate to the biogas process would enable the recovery of the ammonium nitrogen present in the filtrate ca 3 1 g nh4 n l from the reject water of the digestate after dewatering in the topinoja plant ammonium is recovered from the dewatering reject water via ammonia stripping ca 4000 t of ammonium water 12 nh4 n and directing filtrate to the biogas process could increase the volume of ammonium water up to 5000 t fig 6 it has been reported that the integration of htc with ad has potential to increase the profits for wwtp aragón briceño et al 2021 which however is case dependant as the required capital costs for the investment to an existing wwtp vary and may not be covered by the revenues from hydrochar utilisation medina martos et al 2020 nevertheless the utilisation of hydrochar may have more potential in respect to digestate due to its higher phosphorous and lower pharmaceutical contents as well as decreased end product volume which decreases the transportation needs and costs furthermore directing the hydrochar to agriculture could also promote carbon storage and carbon neutral agriculture which should be further evaluated returning the filtrate with readily biodegradable organic and high ammonium nitrogen contents to the biogas process requires optimisation of its downstream processes e g the energy balance considerations and use of polymers in digestate dewatering 5 conclusions the current study evaluated htc treatment at 210 250 c for 30 or 60 min and subsequent filtration of mechanically dewatered digestate ts 25 from a full scale centralised biogas plant treating mechanically dewatered sewage sludge the volume of different hydrochars was 30 55 of the dewatered digestate s volume and the ts content of the hydrochars was 53 64 the hydrochars contained over 90 of the phosphorous in the digestate up to 56 g kg ts ca 30 carbon per ts pharmaceuticals were below detection limits and heavy metals were under legislative limits apart from mercury the high phosphorous content of hydrochars could favour its use in agriculture as fertiliser the hydrochars could also be for example co combusted since the hydrochars hhv 11 3 12 2 mj kg ts was similar to that of the digestate although the high ash content 50 57 may reduce its attractiveness as all the htc conditions applied in this study generated hydrochars of little variations in properties it could be recommended to use the lowest temperature 210 c and shortest residence time 30 min for hydrochar production from digestate another htc end product is filtrate which had a high scod content of 39 44 g l of which 10 33 was vfas methane potential of ca 190 l ch4 kg scod and high nitrogen content of 4 9 6 1 g l feeding the filtrate to the biogas digester would enable increased methane production and enhanced nitrogen recovery from the reject water of the anaerobic digestor the temperature of 230 c could be regarded as the optimum temperature for generating filtrates with the highest methane production potential and ammonium content enabling ammonium recovery extrapolating the results to a centralised biogas plant indicated that the integration of htc to a biogas plant could enhance the annual biogas production by 5 and ammonium recovery by 25 while the produced hydrochar could be used to produce 83 gj or to direct 350 t phosphorous to agriculture annually declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16830,this study aimed to assess the role of hydrothermal carbonisation htc in digestate processing in centralised biogas plants receiving dewatered sludge from regional wastewater treatment plants and producing biomethane and fertilisers chemically conditioned and mechanically dewatered sludge was used as such total solids ts 25 or as diluted 15 ts with reject water in 30 min or 120 min htc treatments at 210 c 230 c or 250 c and the produced slurry was filtered to produce hydrochars and filtrates the different hydrochars contributed to 20 55 of the original mass 72 88 of the ts 74 87 of the energy content 71 92 of the carbon above 86 of phosphorous and 38 64 of the nitrogen present in the original digestates the hydrochars energy content higher heating values were 11 3 12 2 mj kg ts were similar to that of the digestates while the ash contents increased from 43 up to 57 htc treatments produced filtrates in volumes of 42 76 of the dewatered digestate having a soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of 28 44 g l of which volatile fatty acids vfas contributed 10 34 and methane potentials of 182 206 ml ch4 g scod without any major indication of inhibition all 32 pharmaceuticals detected in the digestates were below the detection limit in hydrochars and filtrates save for ibuprofen and benzotriazole in filtrate while heavy metals were concentrated in the hydrochars but below the national limits for fertiliser use save for mercury the integration of htc to a centralised biogas plant was extrapolated to enhance the annual biogas production by 5 and ammonium recovery by 25 and the hydrochar was estimated to produce 83 gj upon combustion or to direct 350 t phosphorous to agriculture annually graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge digestate hydrothermal carbonisation hydrochar phosphorous nutrient recovery energy recovery 1 introduction municipal wastewaters are typically treated using an activated sludge process that results in high amounts of sewage sludge including primary sludge consisting of wastewater solids and biosludge consisting of aerobic microbes in wastewater treatment plants sewage sludge is often gravimetrically thickened and then stabilised in anaerobic digestion ad which recovers the energy from the process as biogas which is valued as a renewable energy source the digestated material is typically mechanically dewatered using polymers into solid fraction and liquid fraction referred to as reject water the solid fraction total solids ts 15 30 with high organic and nutrient content may be composted to be used as soil amendment or combusted alvarenga et al 2015 the reject water is usually circulated to the wastewater treatment plant the sewage sludge energy content recovered in ad has recently been increasingly considered for upgrading into biofuel or gas grid injection to promote energy transition for economic reasons centralised biogas plants treating dewatered sludge from several sewage plants are used furthermore the recovery of sewage sludge nutrients and residual carbon especially that of phosphorous is of major interest because of diminishing phosphorous resources and to reduce the climate impacts of nitrogen fertilizer production becker et al 2019 however in practice the use of sewage sludge digestates in agriculture is a concern because of contaminants thus the use of sewage sludge based nutrients is facing major challenges the concern is about certain contaminants such as heavy metals pharmaceuticals and microplastics which the biological processes alone are incapable of converting into something more harmless and part of which can also end up in the digestate alvarenga et al 2015 hence to harness sewage sludge digestate in a safe manner an additional post treatment step needs to be considered one such recently discussed sludge post treatment is hydrothermal carbonisation htc aragón briceño et al 2017 htc is a thermal treatment applicable for organic material and is conducted at temperatures of 180 250 c with residence times from 0 5 to several hours libra et al 2011 particularly htc is considered for moist ts 10 50 organic material which differentiates it from other thermal processes for example pyrolysis which typically requires a higher solids content ts 90 bridgwater et al 1999 and utilises comparatively high temperatures 500 800 c paneque et al 2017 htc yields a moist carbonaceous solid fraction that is usually separated into a solid and liquid i e hydrochar and filtrate respectively in addition htc releases exhaust gas comprising primarily of co2 but also of other compounds such as hydrogen sulphide nitrogen dioxide nitric oxide and ammonia hence requiring further treatment berge et al 2011 danso boateng et al 2015 the amounts and characteristics of the three fractions are affected by the feedstock e g berge et al 2011 and the used htc conditions such as temperature and residence time htc has been studied for a range of feedstocks to produce hydrochar which could be used as is or after downstream processing for example as a soil amendment bargmann et al 2014 for sequestrating atmospheric carbon to soils libra et al 2011 as an adsorbent sun et al 2011 or for combustion smith et al 2016 htc treatment has also been studied for sewage sludge for example to screen the effects of htc on the treatment of sludges from different phases of the plant merzari et al 2020 to compare with different feedstocks including agricultural waste he et al 2019 and to determine the effects of htc treatment conditions on hydrochar danso boateng et al 2015 the ad process affects the characteristics of the sludge in many ways for example it lowers the carbon content of the sludge impacts its sulphur and phosphate chemistry and increases the ammonium concentration thus the characteristics of the hydrochar and filtrate from the htc treatment of digestate may differ from those of the htc treated raw sewage sludge aragón briceño et al 2017 there are several laboratory studies on the htc treatment of digested sewage sludge that have shown for example that the filtrate of htc treated digested sewage sludge at 240 c has a clear inhibition towards methane production marin batista et al 2020 whereas at lower temperatures no clear inhibition has been reported aragón briceño et al 2017 regarding the effects of htc on digestate phosphorous marin batista et al 2020 reported an increase in phosphorous content in the filtrate with increasing htc temperatures while merzari et al 2020 observed no increase or even a decrease in the filtrate s phosphorous content after htc however the studies on sewage sludge digestates differ for example in the origin of the digestate before or after dewatering in the htc conditions studied and in the processing of the samples in the laboratory before htc for example merzari et al 2020 studied dewatered sewage sludge digestate ts 25 that they however diluted for the htc treatment 15 g sludge and 10 g water resulting in ca 17 ts digestate aragón briceño et al 2020 on the other hand studied sewage sludge digestate with an original ts of 3 but processed the sample in the laboratory to study htc at eight different ts contents 2 5 30 thus there is a lack of information on the dewatered digestates representing real conditions also the separation techniques employed to obtain hydrochar and filtrate vary including filtering through a cellulose filter paper merzari et al 2020 vacuum filtration 0 9 mm followed by an additional supernatant filtration 0 45 µm marin batista et al 2020 and through glass microfibre filters aragón briceño et al 2020 the current work examined the effects of htc process parameters on the amounts and characteristics of the hydrochar and filtrate produced from dewatered digested sewage sludge the studied dewatered digestate was obtained directly from the centralised biogas plant and it was studied as such ts of 25 and after dilution with dewatering reject water to ts of 15 using temperatures of 210 c 230 c and 250 c and residence times of 30 or 120 min the separation of hydrochar and filtrate was conducted at a pilot scale the energy and nutrient characteristics and recovery of both fractions were determined and the mass balances were evaluated results from the laboratory scale study are needed to assess the technological and economic feasibility of scale up applications for centralised biogas plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 digestates and reject water in the htc experiments mechanically dewatered digestate from an industrial thermophilic sewage sludge digester was used mechanical dewatering of digested sludge was done in the plant with a decanter centrifuge along with polymer addition also reject water from dewatering was used the materials were obtained from a centralised biogas plant in topinoja turku finland which treated during the experiments annually 75 000 t ca 23 ts 16 500 t ts a of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge transported from six regional municipal wastewater treatment plants producing 30 000 t of dewatered digestate ca 30 ts 9000 t ts a for the biomethane potential bmp assays the inoculum was from a mesophilic municipal biowaste digestion facility riihimäki finland all samples were anaerobically stored at 4 c for 1 2 months until used in the htc experiments the digestate was used as such ts 25 referred to as digestate or diluted to 15 ts by adding 400 ml of reject water to 600 g of the digestate referred to as diluted digestate the dilutions were performed right before the htc treatments the material characteristics are shown in table 1 2 2 htc treatments the htc treatment used a two litre parr 4500 pressure reactor with an external circulating cooling water system and internal rotary mixer initially 40 rpm the final mixing speed increased as a result of the viscosity decrease of the samples during the treatments table 2 the sample wet weight for the experiments was 1 kg and the treatment temperatures were 210 c 230 c or 250 c with residence times of 30 or 120 min table 2 the heating of the reactor vessel to the target temperatures was achieved within ca 90 min the temperature was manually adjusted using parr 4848 reactor controllers the vessel pressure started to increase after the inside temperature reached 100 c and then increased to 20 to 40 bar depending on the applied temperature the vessel was held at the target temperature for the pre set residence time the realised temperatures fluctuated but remained within 9 c from the targeted temperature table 2 the 250 c runs started when the vessel temperature had reached 245 c because of difficulties in attaining the targeted temperature within 90 min in all the runs after the residence time the heating was switched off an arbitrary volume of gas was released and cooling water circulation was initiated in the water jacket the gas release reduced the inside pressure and temperature by 2 4 bar and 1 4 c respectively of which purpose was to prevent possible condensation the water cooling lasted until the vessel temperature had decreased to 40 70 c which was achieved within 30 40 min after the htc treatments the whole sample volume was weighed recovered and stored at 4 c prior to solid liquid separation by filtration filtration for the htc treated sludges called slurry was conducted in a small scale pressurised filtration unit the temperature during filtration was ca 60 c which was attained by warming up the samples ca 1 kg in a water bath before filtration the heated sample was placed onto a filter cloth inside a cylinder the pressure in the closed cylinder gradually increased 5 min to 1 bar 10 min to 4 bar and then to the final pressure of 15 bar the total pressing time for the digestate samples was about 20 min whereas for the diluted digestate samples it was about 30 min the end products of filtration are from now on called hydrochar solid fraction and filtrate liquid fraction the hydrochar product is comprised of both moisture that was not removed by filtration and of dry solids that are obtained after evaporation the weights of the recovered filtrate and hydrochar were recorded 2 3 biomethane potential assays the bmps of the filtrates of the htc treated digestates were determined in static 37 day long batch assays in triplicate at 35 c in all assays 120 ml serum bottles and 3 4 g wet weight of inoculum were used the scod concentration of the filtrate was set to 2 g scod l nahco3 4 g l was used as a buffer and distilled water was added to the bottles to reach the volumes of 64 ml the initial ph was adjusted between 7 and 8 with hcl 1 m after which the bottles were closed with rubber stoppers anaerobic conditions were created inside by flushing with nitrogen gas for 3 min assays containing only water buffer and inoculum functioned as the control and their methane production was subtracted from the methane production of the sample assays the methane concentrations in the bmp determination were measured with a gc fid perkin elmer clarus as described previously kinnunen et al 2015 and the bmps were calculated as presented in eq s1 2 4 chemical analysis and calculations the ts and volatile solids vs were gravimetrically determined according to standard methods apha 2540 the ash content measurements at 550 c and 815 c followed the same gravimetric principle the ph level was measured with a wtw ph 3210 metre using wtw sentix 41 electrode cod and scod were analysed according to finnish standard methods sfs 5504 volatile fatty acids vfa were determined with gc fid as described previously kokko et al 2018 prior to the analysis of vfa and scod the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter chromafil xtra pet the total nitrogen and soluble ammonium nitrogen in the liquid phase were analysed using hach lange kits lck 238 lck 338 lck 305 and lck 303 according to the instructions provided by the company the other cations than ammonium nitrogen in the liquid samples were analysed according to the ion chromatography standard sfs en iso 10 304 1 using an ion chromatograph dionex dx 120 usa with as40 autosampler ionpac cs12a cation exchange column and csrs 300 suppressor 4 mm the eluent contained 2 mm methane sulphonic acid and the flow rate was 1 ml min the solid phase total carbon hydrogen nitrogen and sulphur were determined by elemental analysis in thermo scientific flashsmart elemental analyzer chns o with tcd thermal conductivity detector before the analysis samples were properly homogenized samples were first dried in oven at 100 c overnight after which the dry samples were grinded with mortar to

2 benzo oxazol 2 yl as a standard gases used were helium as a carrier gas and oxygen as a gas for sample oxidation the total phosphorous and other elements in the solid and liquid samples were determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for further details of this analysis see supporting information the calorific values of the solid samples were determined in duplicate with a parr 6725 semi micro oxygen bomb calorimeter according to the iso 1928 standard prior to the analysis the samples were dried overnight at 100 c the sample weight for the analysis was 0 2 0 3 g the hydrochar yields y energy densification ed and energy recovery of hydrochar were calculated as described previously danso boateng et al 2015 the energy content and energy recoveries of the filtrates were calculated based on the results of the bmp and the mass distribution after different htc runs the mass of digestate converted to gas during htc treatment was calculated by the difference in the masses of the input digestate and the obtained slurry after htc eq s7 for further details of the calculations see supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass and ts recoveries the htc treatment yielded three fractions the relative mass yields of which depended on the applied htc conditions fig 1 the produced hydrochar masses wet basis covered 30 55 and 20 34 of the original masses of the digestate and diluted digestate respectively fig 1 the moisture content of the hydrochars after filtration ranged between 37 and 61 and 46 and 65 for the digestate and diluted digestate respectively table 3 the vs ts ratio decreased from 57 of the digestates to 43 50 in the hydrochars the hydrochar yields dry basis were between 72 and 87 and between 72 and 88 for the digestate and diluted digestate table 3 respectively suggesting that the ts content of the digestate does not affect the recovery of ts in hydrochar with the digestate an increased treatment temperature decreased the hydrochar mass and ts yields and increased the yields of the filtrate and gas fig 1 while the effects were not so clear for the diluted digestate the mass of the filtrate varied between 42 and 60 and between 60 and 76 for the digestate and diluted digested fig 1 respectively the calculated gas formation ranged from 1 to 11 of the original digestate mass and was larger in the htc of the digestate than in the htc of diluted digestate the highest hydrochar ts yields of 87 6 and 88 3 were obtained at 210 c for 120 min for the digestate and diluted digestate respectively while the residence time had no clear effect on hydrochar ts yield the present study and other research aragón briceño et al 2017 have shown that in processing mechanically dewatered digestate htc treatment with subsequent solids separation can produce hydrochar with recoveries even above 70 85 of the original ts while contributing to around 40 50 of the original mass the present hydrochar yields on a ts basis 72 88 are at the upper range of the hydrochar yields of 66 75 at 220 250 c and 67 74 at 180 210 c reported in other htc studies with digested sewage sludge with a ts content of 17 merzari et al 2020 or 16 5 marin batista et al 2020 respectively with decreased hydrochar yields at increased temperatures which is also observed in the current study however a hydrochar yield of 51 was obtained at 240 c marin batista et al 2020 indicating that the original characteristics of the sewage sludge digestate have a major effect on the product characteristics in htc studies conducted with digested sewage sludge at a lower ts content of below 5 the hydrochar yields on a ts basis have varied from 47 berge et al 2011 to 56 78 aragón briceño et al 2017 merzari et al 2020 without a clear effect of temperature on hydrochar yield as what is found at higher digestate ts contents thus the hydrochar ts yield may not be fully deduced from the ts content or the htc conditions but also from the chemical characteristics of the sludge merzari et al 2020 parmar and ross 2019 the hydrochar mass yield in the present study 30 55 for digestate and 20 34 for diluted digestate was considerably lower than the 66 88 obtained for digested sewage sludge with ts content of 17 merzari et al 2020 however it should be noted that the reported mass and ts yields of hydrochar and filtrate are affected along with the digestate characteristics by the separation technique used to separate the hydrochar and filtrate which vary by research 3 2 energy characteristics 3 2 1 hydrochar the energy content and solid fuel properties of the different hydrochars and digestates were assessed using moisture content heating values and the ash content which is responsible for the combustion furnace fouling jenkins et al 1998 the energy content and solid fuel properties of the 12 hydrochars and the digestate and diluted digestate are presented in table 3 the hhv of all the hydrochars were of a similar range 11 3 12 2 mj kg ts as the digestates hhvs 11 5 11 9 mj kg ts with energy densification values of 0 95 1 05 the hhv of the digestate hydrochars was 1 2 5 5 higher than the hhv of the digestate after all the treatments except for the mildest ones conducted at 210 c conversely the hhv of diluted digestate hydrochar increased by 2 2 from the digestate hhv only in the severest treatment 250 c 120 min while the other treatment conditions decreased the hhv by 0 6 4 9 the ash content determined at 550 c of the hydrochars increased from 50 to 57 with increasing treatment temperature and residence time while the ash contents of both the digestate and diluted digestate were 43 based on the current study and what is reported in the literature it appears that the effects of htc treatment on the hhv of the digestate are quite minimal less than 4 5 the hhv of the digestates used in the present study 11 5 11 9 mj kg ts was much lower than reported in other studies with digestate ts content of 16 5 14 9 mj kg ts marin batista et al 2020 or 17 16 0 mj kg ts merzari et al 2020 a lower hhv of the digestate 10 7 mj kg ts has been reported with 2 9 ts in the digestate merzari et al 2020 the hhvs of the hydrochars differed less than 2 martin batista et al 2020 and less than 5 merzari et al 2020 from the hhvs of the digestates with a ts content above 15 which is in accordance with the findings of the present study higher differences in the hhvs of the digestate and hydrochar of 7 2 26 have been reported for digestates with a lower ts content of 2 9 4 5 table 5 while a high ash content of the feedstock is related to decreased hhvs zhuang et al 2018 it does not explain the difference in the observed hhv for the different digestate hydrochars between the present and previous studies marin batista et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 thus it seems that the hhv of the digested sewage sludge hydrochar depends on the hhv of the digestate used as feedstock although the effects of htc treatment on the hhv are often negligible htc treatment results in higher ash content of the hydrochar compared with the original digestate in the present study the ash content of the digested sewage sludge increased from 43 to as high as 50 57 on htc treatment while with other digested sewage sludge the ash content increased from 40 to 42 48 marin batista et al 2020 and from 28 to 35 43 merzari et al 2020 on htc treatment of digestates with ts content of 16 5 and 17 respectively htc treatment of digested sewage sludge with a lower ts content of 2 9 3 0 has resulted in an even higher increase in the ash content from 35 to 55 berge et al 2011 and from 45 to 57 77 merzari et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 linked the lower ash content of the dewatered digestate 28 4 compared with the original digestate 45 to the removal of inorganic compounds such as nh4 n caco3 mg and na that end up in the reject water during conditioning and dewatering in terms of fouling slagging and corrosion the inorganics contained in the ash influence the fuel behaviour upon combustion thus affecting the choice of an appropriate combustion technology smith et al 2016 these ash forming inorganic elements include alkali and earth alkali metals na k mg and ca as well as p fe si and s smith et al 2016 in the present study the increase in the concentrations of calcium with temperature of htc treatment in the hydrochars were similar for the digestate and diluted digestate from 22 to 24 to 23 2 35 1 g ca kg ts whereas those of sodium and potassium were decreased for diluted digestate from 6 2 to 3 0 4 2 g na kg ts and from 2 4 to 1 5 2 0 g k kg ts and were increased or unaffected for digestate from 4 25 to 2 8 4 1 g na kg ts and from 1 7 to 1 6 2 0 g k kg ts table s1 in the case of iron a larger decrease in concentration from 229 to 165 201 g fe kg ts was observed with the digestate than with the diluted digestate from 184 to 133 182 g fe kg ts which could be due to the degradation of digestate particles and their extraction into the liquid fraction wang et al 2019 in addition in the present study the htc treatment slightly decreased the sulphur concentrations from 23 g s kg ts of digestates to 18 22 g s kg ts of hydrochars these concentrations of sulphur were higher than in the digested sewage sludge hydrochars reported elsewhere maximum sulphur concentration of 12 g s kg ts aragón briceño et al 2017 parmar and ross 2019 which was because of their lower initial digestate sulphur concentration when compared with the present digestate the comparatively high sulphur content in the present digestate may arise from the addition of phosphorous precipitation chemical fe ii so4 at the wwtp which is also supported by the high iron concentrations in the hydrochars that are ca 10 fold higher than that reported for dewatered digestate by marin batista et al 2020 3 2 2 filtrate the htc treatment produced filtrates with ph of 8 4 9 0 from the digestate initial ph 7 5 and with a ph of 9 3 9 7 for the diluted digestate initial ph 7 9 htc treatment of digested sewage sludge results in alkaline filtrates aragón briceño et al 2017 marin batista et al 2020 even though the degradation products of hydrolysis generated during htc often promote acidity rather than alkalinity qiao et al 2011 however the final ph is also impacted by volatilisation for example of ammonia during htc treatment liu et al 2019 even though the ph values of the filtrate are higher than those considered optimum for anaerobic treatment the treatment of the filtrates in ad may be managed without ph adjustment because the process operation and co digestion can be adjusted the scods of the htc filtrates ranged from 37 to 44 g l and from 28 to 32 g l for the digestate and diluted digestate respectively being 10 20 times higher than in the feedstocks the scods were slightly higher at higher htc treatment temperatures but no major effects of the htc conditions were obvious however even though the scod changed only a little its composition varied because total vfa contributed ca 30 of the scod at higher temperatures while at 210 c tvfas were ca 10 of scod the higher treatment temperature especially increased the propionate concentration from around 0 4 g l at 210 c to 6 9 g l at 250 c while the changes in other vfa concentrations were low increased residence time increased acetate concentration slightly 1 8 g l at all temperatures even though the scod composition varied in different filtrates the cumulative methane production profiles of all the filtrates were almost similar with an initial two day lag phase fig 2 the resulting bmps varied from 185 to 206 ml ch4 g scod with little difference and without a clear impact resulting from the htc conditions table 4 the bmp yields of the htc filtrates were around two fold higher compared with the bmp yield of the filtrate of the original digestate the present and previous studies have shown that htc treatment increases the scod of the filtrate several fold compared with the scod of the sewage sludge digestate resulting in reported scod values ranging from 5 7 g l up to 72 g l for htc filtrates table 6 this increase in scod is a result from the hydrolysis of fats carbohydrates and proteins into smaller units that is fatty acids vfas sugars and amino acids qiao et al 2011 with a specific feedstock the feedstock solids content used in the htc treatment affects the scod concentration for example htc treatment 250 c 30 min of sewage sludge digestate increased filtrate scods from 9 7 g l up to 72 g l when the ts content of the digestate used in htc treatment was increased from 2 5 to 30 aragón briceño et al 2020 contrary to our study aragón briceño et al 2020 reported that htc treatment decreased the share of vfas of the scod because it was around 15 for the digestate and at the highest 10 for htc filtrate furthermore the share of the vfas of the scod decreased with increasing loading from 10 to ca 5 of the highest solids loading of 72 g l aragón briceño et al 2020 it should be noted that in htc treatments some produced compounds may also volatilise and be discharged in the gas phase based on the current study and the literature the htc treatment of digested sewage sludge has resulted in two to three fold higher methane production per g scod aragón briceño et al 2017 compared with reject water from sewage sludge digestate even though the effects on scod composition vary the batch assays used to determine methane production have not suggested major inhibition in most of the studies aragón briceño et al 2020 parmar and ross 2019 on the other hand severe inhibition was observed in bmp assays with a 240 c filtrate marin batista et al 2020 however it should be noted that the methane potential is assayed in specific conditions e g batch with different substrate dilutions and care should be taken in practice if an anaerobic process is used for the treatment of filtrates it should also be noted that the volume of the filtrate may be up to 76 of the digestate and close to the feedstock volume furthermore the introduction of the filtrate into the digestor affects the composition of the reject water the digestate to be treated in htc and subsequently the filtrate characteristics 3 2 3 overall energy balance the combined energy contents kwh kg feed and recoveries of the original feed of the hydrochars as hhv and filtrates as bmp were assessed for the digestate and of the hydrochars for the diluted digestate fig 3 the values presented do not consider the energy consumed in the htc the hydrochars covered 74 87 of the total energy content of the digestate and diluted digestate while the filtrates covered 4 6 of the total energy content of the digestate the highest energy contents were obtained in the digestate hydrochars from the treatments at 210 c and 230 c 0 66 0 69 kwh kg feed overall the hydrochar energy content was more influenced by the digestate ts content than the different htc conditions it has been observed that the energy recovery in hydrochar decreases with increasing temperature and time aragón briceño et al 2017 danso boateng et al 2015 but according to the present results also with the ts content of the original digestate the energy balance suggests that htc downgrades the energetic potential of digested sewage sludge by 7 20 however the benefit of the htc treatment may not come from the absolute energy recovery alone but from the improved suitability for combustion here considering that the moisture content and a favourable ash composition may diminish fouling smith et al 2016 3 3 nutrients to assess the fate of the nutrients present in the dewatered sewage sludge digestate and diluted digestate the hydrochars and filtrates phosphorous and nitrogen contents were analysed for the different htc conditions studied tables 3 and 4 for the total phosphorus concentrations htc showed an increase by 25 52 and 19 61 compared with the original digestate 37 2 g kg ts and diluted digestate 31 5 g kg ts respectively the filtrates from the digestate and diluted digestate had total phosphorous concentrations of 510 890 mg l and 330 1130 mg l and phosphate concentrations of 40 99 mg l and 87 176 mg l respectively although phosphate was increasingly formed during the htc treatments not detected in the original digestate filtrate the total phosphorous concentration of the filtrates decreased 1080 mg l in the original digestate filtrate indicating that part of the total phosphorous was transferred to the hydrochar fraction in the present study the recovery of phosphorous in the hydrochar was higher or similar as previously reported even though the initial phosphorous concentrations were at a lower range much like in our study an increase in phosphorous concentrations from 45 8 g kg ts to 52 8 63 0 g kg ts with an increase of 15 38 and from 9 2 g kg ts to 9 2 10 9 g kg ts with an increase of 0 18 have been shown to occur with digestate ts contents of 16 5 and 17 respectively marin batista et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 the phosphorous content g kg ts of the hydrochar has been increased with increasing htc treatment temperature and residence time marin batista et al 2020 merzari et al 2020 as also reported in the current study the difference in the phosphorous concentrations in the hydrochars in different studies table 5 is dictated by the digestate phosphorus concentration and may also be affected by the phosphorous removal method at wwtp phosphorous is often precipitated at wwtps with aluminium or iron salts in the present study sewage sludge originated from wwtp using iron salts for phosphorous precipitation resulting in iron concentrations of 180 230 mg g ts in the digested sewage sludge the al and fe concentrations in the digestated sewage sludge were 41 9 mg g ts and 15 8 mg g ts in marin batista et al 2020 whereas in merzari et al 2020 the al concentration in the digested sewage sludge it was around 2 5 mg g ts however in these two studies the unit processes of wastewater treatment for example phosphorous removal technologies were not defined making it difficult to interpret some nutrient results phosphorous only exists either in a solid or liquid state hence the phosphorous balance was created by summing the elemental phosphorous analysed in the filtrate and hydrochar the total phosphorous mass balance in fig 4 b exceeded the input mass of phosphorous in nearly all treatments which was due to heterogeneity of the analysed material and a small sample amount in the icp ms analysis however it can be concluded that the majority 90 of the phosphorus was recovered in the hydrochar fig 4a and 4b to which the different htc conditions gave little variety the dissolved phosphorous in the filtrates were slightly higher for the htc treated diluted digestate 4 13 than for digestate 2 5 it has been reported that lower solids loading studied ts ranged from 2 5 to 30 of sewage sludge digestate promotes phosphorous solubility which can be attributed to the decreased precipitation of phosphorous with metal ions that are present in lesser amounts with lower solids input aragón briceño et al 2020 the dissolution of phosphorous from the digestate was enhanced with the longer treatment times except for htc treated digestate at 250 c thus to enable the utilisation of phosphorous it should be either leached from the hydrochar becker et al 2019 or the hydrochar should be amenable as a fertiliser bargmann et al 2014 the total nitrogen concentration in the hydrochars were 21 4 25 8 g tn kg ts and reduced by 23 39 and 17 31 relative to the digestate and diluted digestate respectively table 3 the total nitrogen concentrations in the filtrates varied in the range of 4 9 6 1 g l for the digestate and 4 3 4 8 g l for the diluted digestate while the ammonium nitrogen concentrations presented only slight variations between treatments 2 5 3 3 g l there was a significant increase in the total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen concentrations when compared with their concentrations in the liquid fraction of the digestate 0 32 g tn l 2 mg nh4 n l however in the reject water used to dilute the digestate the total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen concentrations were 3 7 g l and 2 9 g l respectively the present study has shown that htc converts nitrogen from the solid phase of the dewatered digestate into the liquid phase similarly a decrease in hydrochar nitrogen content compared with the dewatered digestate has been reported in other studies from 51 to 41 42 g tn kg ts at htc temperatures of 180 240 c marin batista et al 2020 from 40 to 19 28 g tn kg ts at 250 c aragón briceño et al 2020 and from 58 1 to 31 2 42 7 g tn kg ts at htc temperature of 190 250 c merzari et al 2020 with a digestate without dewatering a decrease in hydrochar nitrogen content from 50 4 to 20 1 42 3 g tn kg ts was observed at htc temperatures of 220 c and 250 c while at an htc temperature of 160 c the nitrogen content increased from 50 4 to 51 1 g tn kg ts aragón briceño et al 2017 an increase in the htc temperature decreased the nitrogen content in the solid fraction aragón briceño et al 2017 merzari et al 2020 which was also found to be the case in the current study the observed increase of nitrogen percentage in the hydrochar fraction at a higher ts content of the hydrochar was also reported by aragón briceño et al 2020 who tested htc treatment with digested sewage sludge ts contents from 2 5 to 30 during htc treatment a decline in nitrogen content in hydrochars has been reported to occur because of the decomposition of labile and organic nitrogen compounds while the volatile nitrogen compounds are already devolatilised below temperatures of 220 c to the liquid and gas phases zhuang et al 2018 the increase in ammonium nitrogen concentration in the filtrate at increased htc temperatures has been connected to the hydrolysis of proteins through peptides and amino acids to fatty acids and ammonia marin batista et al 2020 the volatilisation of nitrogen compounds was observed in the current study fig 5 both in the filtrates and hydrochars upon increasing the htc temperature and time the original nitrogen content and its distribution to the htc products are presented in fig 5 the total nitrogen lost in the gas phase varied between 3 and 20 which however was calculated by difference therefore giving some room for error the nitrogen recovery into the product fractions depended on the digestate ts because the digestate hydrochars retained 46 64 and the diluted digestate hydrochars 36 46 of the total nitrogen the filtrates from the digestate and diluted digestate contained 26 40 and 41 48 of the total nitrogen respectively high volumes of filtrate and high concentrations of nitrogen in the filtrate present an interesting option for nitrogen recovery if the filtrate was fed back to the biogas digestor the ammonium nitrogen could be recovered from the filtrate in addition to that in the reject water from the mechanical dewatering of digestate for example with ammonium stripping but then again the unionised form of ammonium ammonia nh3 at too high concentrations can inhibit methanogens in ad jiang et al 2019 which could be avoided by treating the filtrate directly in ammonium stripping however the hydrochar also contained a large portion 21 4 27 0 g kg ts of the total nitrogen the carbon contents of the hydrochars ranged from 29 to 31 table 3 which is typical for hydrochars from digested sewage sludge table 5 the carbon recoveries were on average 82 7 and 83 5 in the hydrochars from the digestate and diluted digestate respectively decreasing with treatment severity 3 4 trace elements heavy metals and pharmaceuticals the trace elements cu zn al and ni and heavy metals au as cd cr hg and pb of the hydrochars and filtrates were analysed tables s1 and s2 all the concentrations were below the permitted limit values dictated by the eu 86 278 eec and finnish authorities ylivainio and turtola 2016 except the limit concentration of mercury for fertilisers used in finland 0 001 mg hg g ts was already exceeded in the digestates 0 02 mg hg g ts and its concentration increased in htc to 0 02 0 03 mg hg g ts in the hydrochars overall the heavy metal and trace element concentrations per ts were slightly increased in all hydrochars from those of the digestates which could be attributed to the mass decrease of the solid phase during htc and or to the precipitation of these metal ions as salts in the hydrochar zhang et al 2014 pharmaceuticals are known to be present in sewage sludge and digestates radjenović et al 2009 the present results showed two hormones and 23 pharmaceuticals in the digestate for example 0 15 mg kg ts estrone 2 4 mg kg ts tetracycline 0 24 mg kg ts diclofenac and 0 93 mg kg ts doxycycline in the solid fraction and 8 µg l tetracycline and 5 4 µg l diclofenac in the liquid fraction of the digestate table s3 after htc treatment no hormones or pharmaceuticals analyszed were detected in the hydrochar fraction below the detection limit in the filtrate only two pharmaceuticals were detected 330 µg l benzotriazole and 230 µg l ibuprofen while the concentrations of the other pharmaceuticals were below the detection limit the detection limits for most of the hormones and pharmaceuticals in the hydrochar and filtrate were under 0 5 mg kg ts and1 0 µg l respectively while the detection limits after htc were higher for ciprofloxacin 50 µg l tetracycline 10 µg l and mirtazapine sertraline norsertraline and cetirizine 5 µg l in the filtrate thus the presence of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline in the filtrate cannot be excluded benzotriazole is widely used in cosmetics and in corrosion prevention thus ending up in municipal wastewater zhang et al 2011 although in the current study htc treatment removed most of the pharmaceuticals not all possible hormones and pharmaceuticals nor their degradation products were analysed other studies have also concluded that htc has potential to degrade organic pollutants while emphasising its limitedness in complete removal or detoxification of chlorinated aromatics and for example phenazone vom eyser et al 2015 weiner et al 2013 4 practical implications the present results and previous information on htc treatment of digestate can be used to assess the potential of htc for individual cases and for example to calculate a techno economic analysis in each case the utilisation of biogas hydrochars and filtrates as well as the energy and nutrient contents in these streams depend on many local factors which further affect the technological system its economics and sustainability an example extrapolation calculation for integrating htc into a biogas process was done for a centralised topinoja biogas plant from where the dewatered sewage sludge digestate for the current study was obtained and compared with the process at the time of the experiments fig 6 the biogas plant annually treats 75 000 t of sewage sludge 22 ts and produces 30 000 t of dewatered digestate 30 ts the htc assessment was done by averaging the results from three htc runs with the digestate 210 c for 120 min and 230 c for 30 min or 120 min considered relevant for practical application it was assumed that ca 40 of the digestate volume 36 000 t 25 ts ends up in hydrochar and the rest to filtrate minimal losses of mass to the gas phase in such a case ca 14 400 t of hydrochar would be produced which has a ts content of 50 and an energy content of ca 11 5 mj kg ts the hydrochar could currently be considered for different end use applications for example used in agriculture where it would promote carbon and nutrient utilisation thus benefitting circular economy or for co combustion with an annual energy production from the hydrochar of ca 82 800 gj fig 6 the economic benefit from the hydrochar production for energy recovery has been reported to even exceed the profits from biogas production per tonne of sewage sludge aragón briceño et al 2021 if the filtrate ca 18 000 t a was fed to the biogas process it would enhance the annual methane production with ca 140 000 m3 1 4 gwh that is 4 5 from the current annual methane production of ca 3 million m3 30 gwh furthermore the feeding of the filtrate to the biogas process would enable the recovery of the ammonium nitrogen present in the filtrate ca 3 1 g nh4 n l from the reject water of the digestate after dewatering in the topinoja plant ammonium is recovered from the dewatering reject water via ammonia stripping ca 4000 t of ammonium water 12 nh4 n and directing filtrate to the biogas process could increase the volume of ammonium water up to 5000 t fig 6 it has been reported that the integration of htc with ad has potential to increase the profits for wwtp aragón briceño et al 2021 which however is case dependant as the required capital costs for the investment to an existing wwtp vary and may not be covered by the revenues from hydrochar utilisation medina martos et al 2020 nevertheless the utilisation of hydrochar may have more potential in respect to digestate due to its higher phosphorous and lower pharmaceutical contents as well as decreased end product volume which decreases the transportation needs and costs furthermore directing the hydrochar to agriculture could also promote carbon storage and carbon neutral agriculture which should be further evaluated returning the filtrate with readily biodegradable organic and high ammonium nitrogen contents to the biogas process requires optimisation of its downstream processes e g the energy balance considerations and use of polymers in digestate dewatering 5 conclusions the current study evaluated htc treatment at 210 250 c for 30 or 60 min and subsequent filtration of mechanically dewatered digestate ts 25 from a full scale centralised biogas plant treating mechanically dewatered sewage sludge the volume of different hydrochars was 30 55 of the dewatered digestate s volume and the ts content of the hydrochars was 53 64 the hydrochars contained over 90 of the phosphorous in the digestate up to 56 g kg ts ca 30 carbon per ts pharmaceuticals were below detection limits and heavy metals were under legislative limits apart from mercury the high phosphorous content of hydrochars could favour its use in agriculture as fertiliser the hydrochars could also be for example co combusted since the hydrochars hhv 11 3 12 2 mj kg ts was similar to that of the digestate although the high ash content 50 57 may reduce its attractiveness as all the htc conditions applied in this study generated hydrochars of little variations in properties it could be recommended to use the lowest temperature 210 c and shortest residence time 30 min for hydrochar production from digestate another htc end product is filtrate which had a high scod content of 39 44 g l of which 10 33 was vfas methane potential of ca 190 l ch4 kg scod and high nitrogen content of 4 9 6 1 g l feeding the filtrate to the biogas digester would enable increased methane production and enhanced nitrogen recovery from the reject water of the anaerobic digestor the temperature of 230 c could be regarded as the optimum temperature for generating filtrates with the highest methane production potential and ammonium content enabling ammonium recovery extrapolating the results to a centralised biogas plant indicated that the integration of htc to a biogas plant could enhance the annual biogas production by 5 and ammonium recovery by 25 while the produced hydrochar could be used to produce 83 gj or to direct 350 t phosphorous to agriculture annually declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

institute for water research icra girona spain seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months this provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro thermodynamics in related water bodies e g lakes or reservoirs obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables e g discharge and water temperature requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes however this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions in this paper we introduce a feasible robust and open source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles the workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir and is optimized in this study for four catchment lake systems to help in their proactive management we assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake pseudo observations reanalysis precisely we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill performance or quality of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events we used the current seasonal climate forecast system seas5 and reanalysis era5 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf we found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time scales over the locations of the four case studies europe and south of australia seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance skill for the atmospheric variables considered nevertheless seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study moreover seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia i e lead in conditions keywords seasonal forecasting water management hydrologic modeling lake modeling 1 introduction water resources are closely dependent on the services supplied by ecosystems that maintain both water quantity and quality carpenter et al 2009 and lakes and reservoirs constitute key ecosystems for the provision of such services however these services are continuously threatened by climate extreme events hours to days seasonal climate variations 1 3 months and long term climate change many years which are affecting water management decisions around the world hence climate predictions encompass a time frame that can potentially be useful for early decision making in the water resources sector allowing implementation of preventive and mitigation measures to reduce the vulnerability to foreseen climate extreme anomalies e g floods and droughts pozzi et al 2013 this decision making is affected depending on the time scale from hours to many years of the climate anomalies we focus on seasonal forecast 1 3 months of key variables for the water sector for two reasons i there are some studies presenting predictions in a short term scale in water bodies e g frassl et al 2018 thomas et al 2020 and many relate projections of long term climate change to consequences in the same systems e g komatsu et al 2007 woolway et al 2021 but studies relating seasonal prediction to lakes or reservoir are less common ii for water managers a short term prediction helps in taking reactive decisions and a long term projection supports general decisions beyond the real case timing of water management but a seasonal prediction for water quality variables introduces an opportunity for controlling key variables in a feasible time scale for water management treatment in addition most seasonal climate prediction exercises in water resources have focused on hydrologic applications bazile et al 2017 emerton et al 2018 greuell et al 2019 luo et al 2007 rosenberg et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 but in this study we go one step further and also connected seasonal climate predictions to water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs besides a few basic applications e g climate copernicus eu lake surface water temperature no longer operational studies applying seasonal climate prediction for forecasting water temperature the most basic water quality variable in lakes and reservoirs are absent in the literature despite the manifold consequences of temperature changes on lake thermal regimes lake ecosystem processes and the provision of lake ecosystem services yang et al 2020 this is partly attributable to the challenges in applying seasonal climate forecasts to catchment hydrologic simulations and water temperature predictions in lakes sene et al 2018 turner et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 these challenges are overcome in this study such as the complexity of accessing the climate data by non climate experts multiple databases formats and variables wood et al 2002 the spatial scale mismatch between the global circulation modeling data and a local catchment blöschl and sivapalan 1995 finding a proper physical representation of the problem impact model applicable in different forecasting scenarios gupta et al 1998 the probabilistic nature of the predictions and the mounting uncertainty propagated to the final prediction through the connection of climate catchment and lake models the aim of this work is to establish a feasible and reproducible workflow that facilitates the application of seasonal climate forecasts to the water sector through a catchment lake impact model chain the workflow connects seasonal climate data to hydrologic and lake modeling to obtain seasonal predictions of water temperature profiles the workflow evaluates the performance of the predictions in relation to three areas i bias corrected calibration process to adjust climate model outputs using as reference local observations seasonal climate forecasts for hydrologic and lake model forcing variables note that this step is necessary before using model data in impact studies ii lake inflow discharge derived from hydrologic models forced by bias corrected seasonal climate forecasts and iii lake temperature profiles derived from lake models forced by model derived discharge and bias corrected seasonal climate forecast the implementation of the workflow is exemplified in four case studies catchment lake or reservoir systems for which water temperature is a relevant water quality variable that is routinely monitored by managers and stakeholders to facilitate reproducibility code and data are publicly available at https nivanorge github io seasonal

catchment lake systems the workflow presented here describes the application of seasonal climate forecasts to four geographically separate catchment lake reservoir case studies table 1 included in the eu funded watexr project https watexr eu and https nivanorge github io seasonal forecasting watexr three of them located in europe and one located in south australia fig 1 the australian case study was selected to provide an example application of the workflow in a region of the world where seasonal climate forecasts are typically more skillful better performance than in europe zhang et al 2019 however as we further demonstrate this was not the case on this occasion to implement the performance assessment of the seasonal forecast the availability of long term term water quality data is not needed but is recommended especially in this case where we are introducing the workflow and these four case studies have the information needed to validate the results however the use of pseudo observations or reanalysis see next section as used in this study provides the opportunity to apply the workflow to any water body even under very different climate conditions and limited observations see discussion section the details relating the actual management challenges and other characteristics of the four catchment lake systems can be found in supplementary material supplementary pdf at https git io j3tdn github 2 2 climate data we used two different climate datasets in this study a climate reanalysis and a seasonal climate forecasting product these two products are necessary to implement a performance assessment or in other words to assess whether the forecast system has skill or not the word skill is common in climate science but less common in water science skill is a metric used for seasonal forecast performance evaluation a general definition is a set of forecasts is skilful if it is better than another set known as the reference forecasts skill is therefore a comparative quantity rather than an absolute quantity mason 2013 i e the skill reflects the performance or quality of the forecast system a reanalysis is a pseudo observation obtained from modeling exercises and data assimilation applied to local measured observations that might be more precise but limited in time and space to obtain historical data with a homogeneous spatial and temporal coverage taking advantage of its potential here we used it for i workflow verification performance assessment in past conditions known as hindcast period to build confidence in subsequent predictions about the future ii for bias correction of climate predictions and iii to derive historical pseudo observations for catchment hydrology i e discharge and lake reservoir thermal metrics i e water column temperatures at multiple depths for the same hindcast period we use the latest reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 specific details about era5 are presented in table 2 a seasonal forecasting system provides an ensemble of coupled ocean atmosphere model runs known as members whereby each member represents a different prediction of the medium term weeks to months evolution of the climate system i e a co varying multi variable system with global coverage this ensemble of members must be used together with a reanalysis with historical observations era5 in this study it is imposed by the complexity uncertainties and non linear interactions in the earth climate system we used the latest seasonal forecasting system provided by the ecmwf seas5 johnson et al 2019 specific details about seass5 are presented in table 2 seas5 provides both real time seasonal forecasts and retrospective seasonal forecasts for past years hindcasts but in this study only retrospective seasonal forecasts hindcasts were used to validate the workflows due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of seasonal forecasts it is essential to provide measures of the quality accuracy reliability etc and how much better are the forecasts compared to a reference prediction system e g climatology in this study a hindcast is used for this forecast verification the graphical comparison of the spatial resolution between seas5 and era5 is shown in fig 1a and b respectively the period from 1994 to 2016 is considered in this study for the same variables selected for the era5 data the analysis is focused on the boreal seasons table 1 with one month as lead time i e forecasts are initialised one month in advance of the target season to access download bias correct and visualize the climatic data we used an r based framework climate4r bundle iturbide et al 2019 prior to hydrologic and lake model forcing and retrospective forecast performance skill evaluation seasonal climate forecast members must be pre processed to minimise systematic bias implicit in the raw gridded outputs of global climate models relative to climate pseudo observations era5 reanalysis in this case the quantile mapping technique was selected to correct the global climate model data used gutiérrez et al 2018 we used the empirical approach eqm due to its ability to deal with multivariate problems wilcke et al 2013 specific details about this technique are presented in supplementary material supplementary pdf at https git io j3tdn github the resulting bias corrected data were used for hydrologic and lake model meteorological forcing the time series obtained for appended era5 seas5 meteorological hydrologic and lake model forcing variables revealed smooth transitions from climate pseudo observations during the spin up period era5 to the seasonal climate forecast ensemble predictions seas5 we found no evidence of discontinuities or jumps 2 3 hydrologic and lake temperature modeling owing to different flow regimes and water management challenges in the various catchment lake reservoir systems we used a variety of hydrologic and lake models however the common workflow transcends model choices by providing common methods and code to manipulate input and output data for the various models the role of the models in the workflow is producing seasonal forecasts for impact variables discharge and water temperature profiles but are not the main focus of the article nor is comparing the catchment lake systems in which case it would be mandatory to use the same model setups four hydrologic models were used to simulate lake reservoir inflow discharge one for each case study the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm v5 9 http www ufz de mhm was used to simulate hydrology in the ter river catchment which is the main inflow for sau reservoir the génie rural gr suite of models implemented within the r package airgr coron et al 2017 were used to model the inflows for the wupper reservoir and the mt bold reservoir onkaparinga and echunga creek namely gr6j and gr4j respectively the hydrologic module of the simplyp catchment model for phosphorus simplyq was used to model the inflows to lake vansj norway and is described in detail by jackson blake et al 2017 two 1d lake models were used to simulate lake reservoir water column temperature the general ocean turbulence model gotm http gotm net was used for simulating the thermal dynamics of sau reservoir spain and lake vansj norway the general lake model glm hipsey et al 2019 was used for simulating the thermal dynamics of the mt bold and wupper reservoirs calibration of models against observations using reanalysis data pseud observations was implemented for all case studies tables 1 and 2 in the supplementary material supplementary pdf at https git io j3tdn github provide details about calibration periods and fitting statistics plots showing the resulting calibration are show at the same link following the corresponding folder for each case study e g spain river calibration plots or spain lake calibration plots for the spanish case study since calibration plot contains observations for australia they are not shown to avoid issues that could compromise the data provider commercially or reputationally finally after calibration lake models water temperature calibrated and hydrologic models discharge calibrated were forced with era5 data for the full reanalysis period 1988 2016 obtaining pseudo observations of discharge and water temperature profile for the same period 3 the workflow seasonal prediction the workflow to apply seasonal forecasting to the four catchment lake reservoir systems followed a two step process seasonal climate forecasts were downscaled see section 3 1 1 before forcing hydrologic and lake temperature models in a sequential chain thus incorporating the influence of both inflow discharge and meteorological forcing on lake water temperature fig 2 the downscaling procedure corrects the bias associated with the seasonal climate forecast data seas5 before using it to force the hydrologic and lake temperature models this correction is implemented after calibrating and validating the models for water temperature and discharge using era5 as meteorological pseudo observational forcing data tables 1 and 2 of supplementary material supplementary pdf in https git io j3tdn github and calibration plots in the same link seasonal forecast ensemble predictions were derived for each boreal season and case study model chain i e watershed and lake temperature models considering three periods model spin up forced by era5 forecast initialisation month seas5 and target season seas5 see fig 3 as an example of spring 2003 the impact models need a spin up period before the forecast initialisation period to avoid the impact of physically inconsistent initial hydrologic and lake conditions across state variables on model results trial and error showed that the hydrologic models were no longer affected by initial conditions mainly related to subsurface water storage after 5 years whereas lake temperature models were insensitive to initial conditions after 1 year of simulation spin up periods were simulated using era5 thus for every modelled season during the hindcast period time range 11 1993 11 2016 that is 92 runs from 23 years x 4 seasons the following procedure was implemented to obtain seasonal river discharge hydrologic and surface and bottom water temperature lake ensemble predictions 1 the impact models hydrologic and lake were warmed up spin up using era5 2 then a 4 month long simulation was run driven by the 25 ensemble members from the bias corrected seas5 hindcast set for each initialisation considered e g february for spring hydrologic and lake model outputs for the final 3 months march to may corresponding to the target season are selected for calculation of probabilistic expectations while the initialisation month is removed from the analysis since it is considered as a transitory period this procedure was applied for each case study and is exemplified for sau reservoir in fig 3 to simulate the spring of 2003 the hydrologic and lake models were first run for 5 and 1 year respectively using era5 as spin up forcing data then the first four months of each of the 25 ensemble members of the bias corrected seas5 hindcast initialised in february 2003 were used for model forcing finally the seasonal forecasts resulting from the target season march to may for spring of 2003 were selected for subsequent derivation of probabilistic analysis it is important to mention that our workflow implies that most of the uncertainty propagated to final forecasts comes from the 25 ensemble members of the seasonal climate prediction although it may be reasonable to consider the climate prediction as the main source of uncertainty in the modeling chain this has been recently demonstrated by thomas et al 2020 in a similar workflow like study other sources of uncertainty would also be present e g uncertainties arising from the parameterisation of hydrologic and lake temperature models or structural uncertainty in those models in this paper our focus is on exploring how errors introduced by the seasonal climate forecasts propagate through the process based model chains we examine whether seasonal climate forecasts introduce any added value in seasonal lake predictions compared to predictions produced by running models driven by historic observed meteorological data alone other sources of uncertainty e g uncertainties in climate reanalysis and lake models themselves are not considered nor is model performance compared to actual lake observations we used lake pseudo observations although calibration details are included in the supplementary materials these additional sources of error and their significance in terms of water management will be more fully explored in subsequent work 3 1 analysing the forecast performance to analyse the forecast performance skill for climate variables discharge and water temperature in the lake the visualizer package frías et al 2018 was used to obtain tercile plots fig 4 for bias corrected climate variables discharge and water temperature hindcasts to build a tercile plot for a given variable and season observations and multi member ensemble derived predictions of the forecast system are categorised into three anomaly categories according to the statistical distribution of the variable being assessed during the selected season throughout the entire hindcast period above normal upper tercile for data points falling in the percentile range 66 100 normal for the range 33 66 and below normal lower tercile for the range 0 33 a tercile plot illustrates the distribution of hindcast member seasonal summary statistics among these three anomaly categories for all years in the hindcast period together with an indication of the categories into which each year s seasonal summary statistic calculated from observations falls forecast member seasonal summary statistic distributions among categories are quantified in terms of proportions per category i e 0 for no members in a category 1 for all members in a category and are indicated by a color ramp each year s corresponding observed anomaly is indicated by a symbol in the appropriate category the tercile plot therefore facilitates a visual comparison between the relative strengths of probabilistic expectations among anomalies derived from the seasonal forecast system and observed anomalies for the entire hindcast period two common measures to evaluate the skill of the probabilistic forecast jolliffe and stephenson 2003 mason 2013 for each variable were used the ranked probability skill score rpss and the relative operating characteristic skill score rocss the ranked probability score rps compares the probabilities given by the forecast to the distribution of observations over a given number of discrete probability categories 3 considered here above normal normal and below normal and it is calculated as a squared error between the probability distribution of forecasts and observations across categories the rpss compares rps for the forecast with rps from a reference usually average climate which in this study is the climatology derived from pseudo observation then rpss is a measure of the relative improvement of the probabilistic ensemble based forecast over climatology in predicting the category into which the observations fall as a result an rpss 0 means that forecasts is better than the reference 1 indicates perfect multi category probabilistic forecasts while a zero value or less indicates the forecast performed not better than the reference climatology in this study on the other hand the relative operating characteristic roc quantifies the ability of the forecast to discriminate between events and non events i e translating the probabilistic forecast into a deterministic forecast by picking the most probable tercile roc is based on the ratio between the hit rate and the false alarm rate and is evaluated for each category above normal normal or below normal separately rocss evaluates the relative improvement to roc provided by the forecast expectations relative to reference forecast and ranges from 1 perfect discrimination to 1 perfectly bad discrimination a zero value indicating no skill low quality or performance compared to a long term climatology 4 results and discussion 4 1 seasonal climate forecast according to rpss values there was no significant 95 confidence improvement of the prediction respect to climatology for the climate variables in any of the case studies except for potential evaporation during spring in mt bold reservoir australia and during summer in wupper reservoir germany this suggests substantial biases in the forecast for climate variables however rocss scores showed more significant results for all case studies in some terciles and variables which suggested some discrimination power autumn potential evaporation and summer dew point for sau reservoir solar radiation horizontal wind potential evaporation pressure cloud cover and temperature in autumn pressure and dew point in winter long wave radiation in spring and cloud cover in summer for mt bold reservoir solar radiation long wave radiation cloud cover and vertical wind in winter pressure cloud cover long wave radiation dew point temperature and both wind components in spring and long wave radiation in summer for vansjo norway and temperature in autumn long wave radiation and vertical wind in winter dew point in spring and horizontal wind in summer for wupper reservoir note that some of these significant results could also be due to chance given the 95 significance level used in the test the complete set of plots and results for all climate variables and seasons for each case study can be found at https git io j3tdn github from here following the folder for each case study e g spain atmosphere plots for the spanish case study 4 2 seasonal forecast for discharge and water temperature in this section we analyze predictions for discharge and water temperature for one relevant season for each case study fig 4 subsequently we evaluate all seasons for each case study table 3 a key season for the spanish case study sau reservoir is autumn because most of the annual rainfall is produced during these 3 months influencing the water quantity and quality of the river and consequently of the reservoir management of the reservoir during this season requires a number of decisions by the stakeholder to keep water quality at the inlet of the water treatment plant within safe operational standards e g temperature turbidity reduced metals organic matter among management actions outflow rate and withdrawal depth selection are the most relevant however predictions for discharge from the ter river showed low values of the rpss suggesting that they are not reliable biased even if there was significant discrimination rocss value for the upper tercile overall the analysis suggests that the predicted skill for discharge is very limited i e there is a low performance of seasonal forecast discharge fig 4 and that while we found some capacity for discrimination predictions seemed to be biased very low rpss despite the absence of skill found in the seasonal climate and discharge forecasts in sau reservoir in autumm the water temperature forecasts in this system revealed discrimination skill it is able to discriminate the occurrence or not of events for the lower and upper terciles for bottom temperature fig 4 however the forecast does not improved respect to climatology non significant rpss in deep layers probably due to the effect on rpss of forecats which are sometimes very concentrated in the wrong tercile that discrimination skill is apparently disconnected from prediction skill in climate and discharge suggests that the source of predictability for water temperature in deep water was the inertia of the system in surface waters the skill was non significant the performance of the forecast was low for surface temperature probably because this layer is more affected by inflow and climate conditions which we cannot predict with much confidence similar results were found for the rest of the seasons table 3 with the presence of more discrimination skill for bottom temperature 5 terciles in total than for surface layers 2 terciles in total only spring forecasts for surface waters presented improvement respect to climatology significant rpss but no discrimination skill non significant rocss was detected in general there could be some windows of opportunity for using seasonal prediction for this case study particularly when discriminating between below and above normal categories during summer and autumn the low rpss scores suggested biased forecasts that could be improved by additional improvements to impact models calibration the australian case study mt bold reservoir showed very little skill low performance across all meteorological variables for each season the winter season which is the austral summer is characterised by the absence of precipitation leading to multiple management decisions related to transferring water from other sources algal bloom events and in general water quality issues associated with low flows from the discharge and water temperature results fig 4 only bottom temperature shows the below normal category as significant in spite of this having knowledge of bottom temperature conditions in this season is important for assessing the potential risks of phosphorus re suspension and potential transfer further downstream overall for the impact models there were few variables that exhibited significant skill also supported by the rest of the seasons table 3 in summer the lower category was significant for bottom temperature no variables were significant in autumn and one of the inflows echunga creek had significance for the lower category in spring this highlights that for this reservoir there is low confidence in climate and impact model predictions for the norwegian case study lake vansj the most skillful forecasts for both the river and lake were obtained during spring with the highest rocss obtained for lower and higher categories see fig 4 rocss show significant discrimination skill the system is prone to discriminate between occurrence and non occurrence of events for the outputs of the coupled hydrologic and lake model discharge and surface and bottom lake temperature while rpss attributed significant improvement respect to climatology to the surface and bottom temperature forecasts for the other seasons table 3 some discriminating skill rocss was found in winter for surface below normal category and bottom below and above normal categories temperature autumn was also another interesting season since the seasonal forecast improved with respect to climatology significant rpss for surface and bottom temperature lake vansj presented the best prediction skill the best performance among all case studies because i it has the highest or less bad predictability in the atmospheric variables especially in spring and winter ii it shows some skill in discharge particularly in spring and iii there is less human management controlling the water balance which reduces the need for precise inflow and outflow forecasts which were required for the other three case studies and therefore avoids unpredictable anthropogenic consequences affecting the thermal dynamics of the water body for the german case study wupper reservoir summer represents the most critical season in terms of water quality owing to the association between high temperature and algal growth in terms of seasonal climate forecasts there was no skill low performance in any of the meteorological variables in summer fig 4 for this target season seasonal forecasts for discharge and surface temperature revealed no significant discrimination or improvement respect to climatology whereas bottom temperature exhibited significant rpss and discrimination rocss skill for the below and above normal categories for the wupper reservoir which has a bottom outlet discrimination skill for bottom temperature is relevant as the reservoir s discharge directly impacts the downstream water quality for all other seasons table 3 there appears to be no windows of opportunity when discriminating among terciles however the rpss values reflect that seas5 can improve the prediction with respect to climatology in predicting the spring and autumn seasons for surface temperature and the autumn season for bottom temperature 5 applications and limitations overall the predictability for climate variables in our case studies was limited to some combinations of seasons and variables predictability concentrates in mt bold reservoir and vansj in autumn and spring respectively this is not at odds with the well known observation that the skill performance of the forecast system of seasonal climate forecasts at extratropical latitudes is limited manzanas et al 2014 and related to windows of opportunity connected to relevant drivers of predictability such as el niño la niña events frías et al 2010 the limited predictability of climate variables at the seasonal scale in our case studies poses a fundamental obstacle for the usability of hydrologic discharge and water quality water temperature predictions however the general trend is that predictability increases as we move from climate to discharge to lake temperature predictions this is an intriguing result and although it is out of the scope of this study it may be explained by either the temporal or across variables integration of the climate signal by watershed hydrologic processes and lake temperature dynamics or by strong inertia of these two variables if the inertia highly influenced the scores found here all predictability found in this study would be independent of climate predictions and should be attributed to the initial conditions indeed a close inspection of the tercile plots across seasons showed that both mechanisms may apply since correct tercile predictions coincided with seasons in which the tercile did not change between initial conditions and prediction but we also identified many cases in which a correct prediction implied a change in the tercile suggesting there are windows of opportunity when seasonal climate prediction can be useful exploring this in depth will be the subject of future work and must be considered in relation to statistical power benchmarking against climatology and testing the seasonal forecast with multiple scenarios should be an appropriate next step to follow in any case the accumulation of skill i e the increase in performance of the forecast system in the downstream part of our modeling chain is a stimulating result suggesting that the mounting uncertainty as we progress through the modeling chain is not an insurmountable obstacle to produce useful seasonal predictions for water quality variables nonetheless discharge and water temperature predictions showed skill intermittently which indicates that prediction would be useful only for certain windows of opportunity i e for certain variables terciles and seasons also the improvement of the prediction respect to climatology rpss and discrimination rocss skill were usually not coincident suggesting that the workflow can be improved by additional calibration of the model chain to move towards more useful forecasting there are several approaches in the literature for forecasting hydrologic and water quality variables using statistical approaches such as neural networks palani et al 2008 machine learning barzegar et al 2018 and data assimilation loos et al 2020 which may be easier to calibrate that the process based models used in this study however these approaches also have limitations such as the necessity of a large historical database which could lead to inaccurate forecasts during extreme events for which extrapolation beyond historical observed ranges might be required the use of process based models makes the application of the workflow in data limited regions case studies easier and would probably be more reliable than a statistical approach during climate extreme events the value of process based models was made evident by the skillful forecasts for impact variables discharge and water temperature in a background of limited skill performance for climate variables for instance in lake vansj norway the fact that the forecasts were most skillful for spring is likely related to the impact of the preceding winter on the lake e g a cold dry winter would involve lower lake temperature in spring similar outcomes were also present in sau reservoir where changes in the atmospheric component had a low impact on water temperature in deep waters during some periods which suggests inertia of the lake was the fundamental source of predictability this kind of behaviour would be very difficult to mimic with a pure statistical modeling chain one limitation worth mentioning in the use of reanalysis pseudo observations because it introduces an additional level of uncertainty to the workflow using real observations would be the ideal option when implementing seasonal forecasting but then reduces the transferability of the workflow the comparison of seasonal forecasts with real observations will be subject of future work here we use a perfect model assumption so that we can specifically explore how well seasonal climate forecast skill propagates through seasonal forecasting in lakes the use of reanalysis together with seasonal forecast systems is a common approach when implementing seasonal forecasting of impact variables e g pechlivanidis et al 2020 wood et al 2016 another important issue emerges when predicting inflows and outflows in reservoirs because our analysis suggested it affects predictability this was made evident by the conspicuous reduced discrimination skill decrease in the performance for surface and bottom water temperature in mt bold and wupper reservoirs 2 and 1 significant terciles respectively compared to sau reservoir 7 significant terciles this was caused by a slight difference in the way water inflows and outflows were modelled to avoid water dry outs in the reservoir during forecasting georgakakos and graham 2008 li et al 2014 in mt bold and wupper inflows and outflows were dynamically corrected during runs to avoid water dry outs these may result due to inconsistencies between the forecasted discharge and the assumed outflows during the forecasted season while in sau reservoir we did not correct for this effect which resulted in some dummy predictions due to dry outs empty boxes in fig 7 however discrimination skill in sau was higher suggesting the water level correction algorithm used in mt bold and wupper should be reconsidered 6 conclusions managing water quantity and quality is a challenging task for the catchment lake systems presented here since managers must regulate the water supply and ecological and recreational services under constant and even unprecedented changes in climate this requires making decisions according to the changes in water quantity and quality over time depending on the influencing meteorological and hydrologic conditions currently the management of these lakes reservoirs is mainly based on previous experience and expert decision to support this decision making we have presented a feasible and robust workflow to connect climate forecast data with hydrologic and lake modeling to obtain seasonal forecasts of discharge and lake temperature profiles even considering the limited skill performance found in our seasonal predictions vs climatology the few windows of opportunity that seasonal prediction might offer may help managers to anticipate general trends of water quantity and quality changes the advanced warning provided by seasonal forecasts could return huge benefits in terms of treatment costs reputation of industry and water authorities and safe provision of ecosystem services in any case the probabilistic nature of seasonal predictions and the limited skill performance found in the studied regions requires careful approach when informing managers about these predictions and the confidence they may place in them failing to transparently convey these two properties would compromise the use of seasonal predictions in water resource management in a future with more reliable seasonal climate predictions outside the tropical regions however our study points to some windows of opportunity that are worth exploring to make the most of the current state of the art of climate and water quality prediction

institute for water research icra girona spain seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months this provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro thermodynamics in related water bodies e g lakes or reservoirs obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables e g discharge and water temperature requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes however this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions in this paper we introduce a feasible robust and open source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles the workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir and is optimized in this study for four catchment lake systems to help in their proactive management we assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake pseudo observations reanalysis precisely we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill performance or quality of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events we used the current seasonal climate forecast system seas5 and reanalysis era5 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf we found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time scales over the locations of the four case studies europe and south of australia seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance skill for the atmospheric variables considered nevertheless seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study moreover seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia i e lead in conditions keywords seasonal forecasting water management hydrologic modeling lake modeling 1 introduction water resources are closely dependent on the services supplied by ecosystems that maintain both water quantity and quality carpenter et al 2009 and lakes and reservoirs constitute key ecosystems for the provision of such services however these services are continuously threatened by climate extreme events hours to days seasonal climate variations 1 3 months and long term climate change many years which are affecting water management decisions around the world hence climate predictions encompass a time frame that can potentially be useful for early decision making in the water resources sector allowing implementation of preventive and mitigation measures to reduce the vulnerability to foreseen climate extreme anomalies e g floods and droughts pozzi et al 2013 this decision making is affected depending on the time scale from hours to many years of the climate anomalies we focus on seasonal forecast 1 3 months of key variables for the water sector for two reasons i there are some studies presenting predictions in a short term scale in water bodies e g frassl et al 2018 thomas et al 2020 and many relate projections of long term climate change to consequences in the same systems e g komatsu et al 2007 woolway et al 2021 but studies relating seasonal prediction to lakes or reservoir are less common ii for water managers a short term prediction helps in taking reactive decisions and a long term projection supports general decisions beyond the real case timing of water management but a seasonal prediction for water quality variables introduces an opportunity for controlling key variables in a feasible time scale for water management treatment in addition most seasonal climate prediction exercises in water resources have focused on hydrologic applications bazile et al 2017 emerton et al 2018 greuell et al 2019 luo et al 2007 rosenberg et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 but in this study we go one step further and also connected seasonal climate predictions to water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs besides a few basic applications e g climate copernicus eu lake surface water temperature no longer operational studies applying seasonal climate prediction for forecasting water temperature the most basic water quality variable in lakes and reservoirs are absent in the literature despite the manifold consequences of temperature changes on lake thermal regimes lake ecosystem processes and the provision of lake ecosystem services yang et al 2020 this is partly attributable to the challenges in applying seasonal climate forecasts to catchment hydrologic simulations and water temperature predictions in lakes sene et al 2018 turner et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 these challenges are overcome in this study such as the complexity of accessing the climate data by non climate experts multiple databases formats and variables wood et al 2002 the spatial scale mismatch between the global circulation modeling data and a local catchment blöschl and sivapalan 1995 finding a proper physical representation of the problem impact model applicable in different forecasting scenarios gupta et al 1998 the probabilistic nature of the predictions and the mounting uncertainty propagated to the final prediction through the connection of climate catchment and lake models the aim of this work is to establish a feasible and reproducible workflow that facilitates the application of seasonal climate forecasts to the water sector through a catchment lake impact model chain the workflow connects seasonal climate data to hydrologic and lake modeling to obtain seasonal predictions of water temperature profiles the workflow evaluates the performance of the predictions in relation to three areas i bias corrected calibration process to adjust climate model outputs using as reference local observations seasonal climate forecasts for hydrologic and lake model forcing variables note that this step is necessary before using model data in impact studies ii lake inflow discharge derived from hydrologic models forced by bias corrected seasonal climate forecasts and iii lake temperature profiles derived from lake models forced by model derived discharge and bias corrected seasonal climate forecast the implementation of the workflow is exemplified in four case studies catchment lake or reservoir systems for which water temperature is a relevant water quality variable that is routinely monitored by managers and stakeholders to facilitate reproducibility code and data are publicly available at https nivanorge github io seasonal

catchment lake systems the workflow presented here describes the application of seasonal climate forecasts to four geographically separate catchment lake reservoir case studies table 1 included in the eu funded watexr project https watexr eu and https nivanorge github io seasonal forecasting watexr three of them located in europe and one located in south australia fig 1 the australian case study was selected to provide an example application of the workflow in a region of the world where seasonal climate forecasts are typically more skillful better performance than in europe zhang et al 2019 however as we further demonstrate this was not the case on this occasion to implement the performance assessment of the seasonal forecast the availability of long term term water quality data is not needed but is recommended especially in this case where we are introducing the workflow and these four case studies have the information needed to validate the results however the use of pseudo observations or reanalysis see next section as used in this study provides the opportunity to apply the workflow to any water body even under very different climate conditions and limited observations see discussion section the details relating the actual management challenges and other characteristics of the four catchment lake systems can be found in supplementary material supplementary pdf at https git io j3tdn github 2 2 climate data we used two different climate datasets in this study a climate reanalysis and a seasonal climate forecasting product these two products are necessary to implement a performance assessment or in other words to assess whether the forecast system has skill or not the word skill is common in climate science but less common in water science skill is a metric used for seasonal forecast performance evaluation a general definition is a set of forecasts is skilful if it is better than another set known as the reference forecasts skill is therefore a comparative quantity rather than an absolute quantity mason 2013 i e the skill reflects the performance or quality of the forecast system a reanalysis is a pseudo observation obtained from modeling exercises and data assimilation applied to local measured observations that might be more precise but limited in time and space to obtain historical data with a homogeneous spatial and temporal coverage taking advantage of its potential here we used it for i workflow verification performance assessment in past conditions known as hindcast period to build confidence in subsequent predictions about the future ii for bias correction of climate predictions and iii to derive historical pseudo observations for catchment hydrology i e discharge and lake reservoir thermal metrics i e water column temperatures at multiple depths for the same hindcast period we use the latest reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 specific details about era5 are presented in table 2 a seasonal forecasting system provides an ensemble of coupled ocean atmosphere model runs known as members whereby each member represents a different prediction of the medium term weeks to months evolution of the climate system i e a co varying multi variable system with global coverage this ensemble of members must be used together with a reanalysis with historical observations era5 in this study it is imposed by the complexity uncertainties and non linear interactions in the earth climate system we used the latest seasonal forecasting system provided by the ecmwf seas5 johnson et al 2019 specific details about seass5 are presented in table 2 seas5 provides both real time seasonal forecasts and retrospective seasonal forecasts for past years hindcasts but in this study only retrospective seasonal forecasts hindcasts were used to validate the workflows due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of seasonal forecasts it is essential to provide measures of the quality accuracy reliability etc and how much better are the forecasts compared to a reference prediction system e g climatology in this study a hindcast is used for this forecast verification the graphical comparison of the spatial resolution between seas5 and era5 is shown in fig 1a and b respectively the period from 1994 to 2016 is considered in this study for the same variables selected for the era5 data the analysis is focused on the boreal seasons table 1 with one month as lead time i e forecasts are initialised one month in advance of the target season to access download bias correct and visualize the climatic data we used an r based framework climate4r bundle iturbide et al 2019 prior to hydrologic and lake model forcing and retrospective forecast performance skill evaluation seasonal climate forecast members must be pre processed to minimise systematic bias implicit in the raw gridded outputs of global climate models relative to climate pseudo observations era5 reanalysis in this case the quantile mapping technique was selected to correct the global climate model data used gutiérrez et al 2018 we used the empirical approach eqm due to its ability to deal with multivariate problems wilcke et al 2013 specific details about this technique are presented in supplementary material supplementary pdf at https git io j3tdn github the resulting bias corrected data were used for hydrologic and lake model meteorological forcing the time series obtained for appended era5 seas5 meteorological hydrologic and lake model forcing variables revealed smooth transitions from climate pseudo observations during the spin up period era5 to the seasonal climate forecast ensemble predictions seas5 we found no evidence of discontinuities or jumps 2 3 hydrologic and lake temperature modeling owing to different flow regimes and water management challenges in the various catchment lake reservoir systems we used a variety of hydrologic and lake models however the common workflow transcends model choices by providing common methods and code to manipulate input and output data for the various models the role of the models in the workflow is producing seasonal forecasts for impact variables discharge and water temperature profiles but are not the main focus of the article nor is comparing the catchment lake systems in which case it would be mandatory to use the same model setups four hydrologic models were used to simulate lake reservoir inflow discharge one for each case study the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm v5 9 http www ufz de mhm was used to simulate hydrology in the ter river catchment which is the main inflow for sau reservoir the génie rural gr suite of models implemented within the r package airgr coron et al 2017 were used to model the inflows for the wupper reservoir and the mt bold reservoir onkaparinga and echunga creek namely gr6j and gr4j respectively the hydrologic module of the simplyp catchment model for phosphorus simplyq was used to model the inflows to lake vansj norway and is described in detail by jackson blake et al 2017 two 1d lake models were used to simulate lake reservoir water column temperature the general ocean turbulence model gotm http gotm net was used for simulating the thermal dynamics of sau reservoir spain and lake vansj norway the general lake model glm hipsey et al 2019 was used for simulating the thermal dynamics of the mt bold and wupper reservoirs calibration of models against observations using reanalysis data pseud observations was implemented for all case studies tables 1 and 2 in the supplementary material supplementary pdf at https git io j3tdn github provide details about calibration periods and fitting statistics plots showing the resulting calibration are show at the same link following the corresponding folder for each case study e g spain river calibration plots or spain lake calibration plots for the spanish case study since calibration plot contains observations for australia they are not shown to avoid issues that could compromise the data provider commercially or reputationally finally after calibration lake models water temperature calibrated and hydrologic models discharge calibrated were forced with era5 data for the full reanalysis period 1988 2016 obtaining pseudo observations of discharge and water temperature profile for the same period 3 the workflow seasonal prediction the workflow to apply seasonal forecasting to the four catchment lake reservoir systems followed a two step process seasonal climate forecasts were downscaled see section 3 1 1 before forcing hydrologic and lake temperature models in a sequential chain thus incorporating the influence of both inflow discharge and meteorological forcing on lake water temperature fig 2 the downscaling procedure corrects the bias associated with the seasonal climate forecast data seas5 before using it to force the hydrologic and lake temperature models this correction is implemented after calibrating and validating the models for water temperature and discharge using era5 as meteorological pseudo observational forcing data tables 1 and 2 of supplementary material supplementary pdf in https git io j3tdn github and calibration plots in the same link seasonal forecast ensemble predictions were derived for each boreal season and case study model chain i e watershed and lake temperature models considering three periods model spin up forced by era5 forecast initialisation month seas5 and target season seas5 see fig 3 as an example of spring 2003 the impact models need a spin up period before the forecast initialisation period to avoid the impact of physically inconsistent initial hydrologic and lake conditions across state variables on model results trial and error showed that the hydrologic models were no longer affected by initial conditions mainly related to subsurface water storage after 5 years whereas lake temperature models were insensitive to initial conditions after 1 year of simulation spin up periods were simulated using era5 thus for every modelled season during the hindcast period time range 11 1993 11 2016 that is 92 runs from 23 years x 4 seasons the following procedure was implemented to obtain seasonal river discharge hydrologic and surface and bottom water temperature lake ensemble predictions 1 the impact models hydrologic and lake were warmed up spin up using era5 2 then a 4 month long simulation was run driven by the 25 ensemble members from the bias corrected seas5 hindcast set for each initialisation considered e g february for spring hydrologic and lake model outputs for the final 3 months march to may corresponding to the target season are selected for calculation of probabilistic expectations while the initialisation month is removed from the analysis since it is considered as a transitory period this procedure was applied for each case study and is exemplified for sau reservoir in fig 3 to simulate the spring of 2003 the hydrologic and lake models were first run for 5 and 1 year respectively using era5 as spin up forcing data then the first four months of each of the 25 ensemble members of the bias corrected seas5 hindcast initialised in february 2003 were used for model forcing finally the seasonal forecasts resulting from the target season march to may for spring of 2003 were selected for subsequent derivation of probabilistic analysis it is important to mention that our workflow implies that most of the uncertainty propagated to final forecasts comes from the 25 ensemble members of the seasonal climate prediction although it may be reasonable to consider the climate prediction as the main source of uncertainty in the modeling chain this has been recently demonstrated by thomas et al 2020 in a similar workflow like study other sources of uncertainty would also be present e g uncertainties arising from the parameterisation of hydrologic and lake temperature models or structural uncertainty in those models in this paper our focus is on exploring how errors introduced by the seasonal climate forecasts propagate through the process based model chains we examine whether seasonal climate forecasts introduce any added value in seasonal lake predictions compared to predictions produced by running models driven by historic observed meteorological data alone other sources of uncertainty e g uncertainties in climate reanalysis and lake models themselves are not considered nor is model performance compared to actual lake observations we used lake pseudo observations although calibration details are included in the supplementary materials these additional sources of error and their significance in terms of water management will be more fully explored in subsequent work 3 1 analysing the forecast performance to analyse the forecast performance skill for climate variables discharge and water temperature in the lake the visualizer package frías et al 2018 was used to obtain tercile plots fig 4 for bias corrected climate variables discharge and water temperature hindcasts to build a tercile plot for a given variable and season observations and multi member ensemble derived predictions of the forecast system are categorised into three anomaly categories according to the statistical distribution of the variable being assessed during the selected season throughout the entire hindcast period above normal upper tercile for data points falling in the percentile range 66 100 normal for the range 33 66 and below normal lower tercile for the range 0 33 a tercile plot illustrates the distribution of hindcast member seasonal summary statistics among these three anomaly categories for all years in the hindcast period together with an indication of the categories into which each year s seasonal summary statistic calculated from observations falls forecast member seasonal summary statistic distributions among categories are quantified in terms of proportions per category i e 0 for no members in a category 1 for all members in a category and are indicated by a color ramp each year s corresponding observed anomaly is indicated by a symbol in the appropriate category the tercile plot therefore facilitates a visual comparison between the relative strengths of probabilistic expectations among anomalies derived from the seasonal forecast system and observed anomalies for the entire hindcast period two common measures to evaluate the skill of the probabilistic forecast jolliffe and stephenson 2003 mason 2013 for each variable were used the ranked probability skill score rpss and the relative operating characteristic skill score rocss the ranked probability score rps compares the probabilities given by the forecast to the distribution of observations over a given number of discrete probability categories 3 considered here above normal normal and below normal and it is calculated as a squared error between the probability distribution of forecasts and observations across categories the rpss compares rps for the forecast with rps from a reference usually average climate which in this study is the climatology derived from pseudo observation then rpss is a measure of the relative improvement of the probabilistic ensemble based forecast over climatology in predicting the category into which the observations fall as a result an rpss 0 means that forecasts is better than the reference 1 indicates perfect multi category probabilistic forecasts while a zero value or less indicates the forecast performed not better than the reference climatology in this study on the other hand the relative operating characteristic roc quantifies the ability of the forecast to discriminate between events and non events i e translating the probabilistic forecast into a deterministic forecast by picking the most probable tercile roc is based on the ratio between the hit rate and the false alarm rate and is evaluated for each category above normal normal or below normal separately rocss evaluates the relative improvement to roc provided by the forecast expectations relative to reference forecast and ranges from 1 perfect discrimination to 1 perfectly bad discrimination a zero value indicating no skill low quality or performance compared to a long term climatology 4 results and discussion 4 1 seasonal climate forecast according to rpss values there was no significant 95 confidence improvement of the prediction respect to climatology for the climate variables in any of the case studies except for potential evaporation during spring in mt bold reservoir australia and during summer in wupper reservoir germany this suggests substantial biases in the forecast for climate variables however rocss scores showed more significant results for all case studies in some terciles and variables which suggested some discrimination power autumn potential evaporation and summer dew point for sau reservoir solar radiation horizontal wind potential evaporation pressure cloud cover and temperature in autumn pressure and dew point in winter long wave radiation in spring and cloud cover in summer for mt bold reservoir solar radiation long wave radiation cloud cover and vertical wind in winter pressure cloud cover long wave radiation dew point temperature and both wind components in spring and long wave radiation in summer for vansjo norway and temperature in autumn long wave radiation and vertical wind in winter dew point in spring and horizontal wind in summer for wupper reservoir note that some of these significant results could also be due to chance given the 95 significance level used in the test the complete set of plots and results for all climate variables and seasons for each case study can be found at https git io j3tdn github from here following the folder for each case study e g spain atmosphere plots for the spanish case study 4 2 seasonal forecast for discharge and water temperature in this section we analyze predictions for discharge and water temperature for one relevant season for each case study fig 4 subsequently we evaluate all seasons for each case study table 3 a key season for the spanish case study sau reservoir is autumn because most of the annual rainfall is produced during these 3 months influencing the water quantity and quality of the river and consequently of the reservoir management of the reservoir during this season requires a number of decisions by the stakeholder to keep water quality at the inlet of the water treatment plant within safe operational standards e g temperature turbidity reduced metals organic matter among management actions outflow rate and withdrawal depth selection are the most relevant however predictions for discharge from the ter river showed low values of the rpss suggesting that they are not reliable biased even if there was significant discrimination rocss value for the upper tercile overall the analysis suggests that the predicted skill for discharge is very limited i e there is a low performance of seasonal forecast discharge fig 4 and that while we found some capacity for discrimination predictions seemed to be biased very low rpss despite the absence of skill found in the seasonal climate and discharge forecasts in sau reservoir in autumm the water temperature forecasts in this system revealed discrimination skill it is able to discriminate the occurrence or not of events for the lower and upper terciles for bottom temperature fig 4 however the forecast does not improved respect to climatology non significant rpss in deep layers probably due to the effect on rpss of forecats which are sometimes very concentrated in the wrong tercile that discrimination skill is apparently disconnected from prediction skill in climate and discharge suggests that the source of predictability for water temperature in deep water was the inertia of the system in surface waters the skill was non significant the performance of the forecast was low for surface temperature probably because this layer is more affected by inflow and climate conditions which we cannot predict with much confidence similar results were found for the rest of the seasons table 3 with the presence of more discrimination skill for bottom temperature 5 terciles in total than for surface layers 2 terciles in total only spring forecasts for surface waters presented improvement respect to climatology significant rpss but no discrimination skill non significant rocss was detected in general there could be some windows of opportunity for using seasonal prediction for this case study particularly when discriminating between below and above normal categories during summer and autumn the low rpss scores suggested biased forecasts that could be improved by additional improvements to impact models calibration the australian case study mt bold reservoir showed very little skill low performance across all meteorological variables for each season the winter season which is the austral summer is characterised by the absence of precipitation leading to multiple management decisions related to transferring water from other sources algal bloom events and in general water quality issues associated with low flows from the discharge and water temperature results fig 4 only bottom temperature shows the below normal category as significant in spite of this having knowledge of bottom temperature conditions in this season is important for assessing the potential risks of phosphorus re suspension and potential transfer further downstream overall for the impact models there were few variables that exhibited significant skill also supported by the rest of the seasons table 3 in summer the lower category was significant for bottom temperature no variables were significant in autumn and one of the inflows echunga creek had significance for the lower category in spring this highlights that for this reservoir there is low confidence in climate and impact model predictions for the norwegian case study lake vansj the most skillful forecasts for both the river and lake were obtained during spring with the highest rocss obtained for lower and higher categories see fig 4 rocss show significant discrimination skill the system is prone to discriminate between occurrence and non occurrence of events for the outputs of the coupled hydrologic and lake model discharge and surface and bottom lake temperature while rpss attributed significant improvement respect to climatology to the surface and bottom temperature forecasts for the other seasons table 3 some discriminating skill rocss was found in winter for surface below normal category and bottom below and above normal categories temperature autumn was also another interesting season since the seasonal forecast improved with respect to climatology significant rpss for surface and bottom temperature lake vansj presented the best prediction skill the best performance among all case studies because i it has the highest or less bad predictability in the atmospheric variables especially in spring and winter ii it shows some skill in discharge particularly in spring and iii there is less human management controlling the water balance which reduces the need for precise inflow and outflow forecasts which were required for the other three case studies and therefore avoids unpredictable anthropogenic consequences affecting the thermal dynamics of the water body for the german case study wupper reservoir summer represents the most critical season in terms of water quality owing to the association between high temperature and algal growth in terms of seasonal climate forecasts there was no skill low performance in any of the meteorological variables in summer fig 4 for this target season seasonal forecasts for discharge and surface temperature revealed no significant discrimination or improvement respect to climatology whereas bottom temperature exhibited significant rpss and discrimination rocss skill for the below and above normal categories for the wupper reservoir which has a bottom outlet discrimination skill for bottom temperature is relevant as the reservoir s discharge directly impacts the downstream water quality for all other seasons table 3 there appears to be no windows of opportunity when discriminating among terciles however the rpss values reflect that seas5 can improve the prediction with respect to climatology in predicting the spring and autumn seasons for surface temperature and the autumn season for bottom temperature 5 applications and limitations overall the predictability for climate variables in our case studies was limited to some combinations of seasons and variables predictability concentrates in mt bold reservoir and vansj in autumn and spring respectively this is not at odds with the well known observation that the skill performance of the forecast system of seasonal climate forecasts at extratropical latitudes is limited manzanas et al 2014 and related to windows of opportunity connected to relevant drivers of predictability such as el niño la niña events frías et al 2010 the limited predictability of climate variables at the seasonal scale in our case studies poses a fundamental obstacle for the usability of hydrologic discharge and water quality water temperature predictions however the general trend is that predictability increases as we move from climate to discharge to lake temperature predictions this is an intriguing result and although it is out of the scope of this study it may be explained by either the temporal or across variables integration of the climate signal by watershed hydrologic processes and lake temperature dynamics or by strong inertia of these two variables if the inertia highly influenced the scores found here all predictability found in this study would be independent of climate predictions and should be attributed to the initial conditions indeed a close inspection of the tercile plots across seasons showed that both mechanisms may apply since correct tercile predictions coincided with seasons in which the tercile did not change between initial conditions and prediction but we also identified many cases in which a correct prediction implied a change in the tercile suggesting there are windows of opportunity when seasonal climate prediction can be useful exploring this in depth will be the subject of future work and must be considered in relation to statistical power benchmarking against climatology and testing the seasonal forecast with multiple scenarios should be an appropriate next step to follow in any case the accumulation of skill i e the increase in performance of the forecast system in the downstream part of our modeling chain is a stimulating result suggesting that the mounting uncertainty as we progress through the modeling chain is not an insurmountable obstacle to produce useful seasonal predictions for water quality variables nonetheless discharge and water temperature predictions showed skill intermittently which indicates that prediction would be useful only for certain windows of opportunity i e for certain variables terciles and seasons also the improvement of the prediction respect to climatology rpss and discrimination rocss skill were usually not coincident suggesting that the workflow can be improved by additional calibration of the model chain to move towards more useful forecasting there are several approaches in the literature for forecasting hydrologic and water quality variables using statistical approaches such as neural networks palani et al 2008 machine learning barzegar et al 2018 and data assimilation loos et al 2020 which may be easier to calibrate that the process based models used in this study however these approaches also have limitations such as the necessity of a large historical database which could lead to inaccurate forecasts during extreme events for which extrapolation beyond historical observed ranges might be required the use of process based models makes the application of the workflow in data limited regions case studies easier and would probably be more reliable than a statistical approach during climate extreme events the value of process based models was made evident by the skillful forecasts for impact variables discharge and water temperature in a background of limited skill performance for climate variables for instance in lake vansj norway the fact that the forecasts were most skillful for spring is likely related to the impact of the preceding winter on the lake e g a cold dry winter would involve lower lake temperature in spring similar outcomes were also present in sau reservoir where changes in the atmospheric component had a low impact on water temperature in deep waters during some periods which suggests inertia of the lake was the fundamental source of predictability this kind of behaviour would be very difficult to mimic with a pure statistical modeling chain one limitation worth mentioning in the use of reanalysis pseudo observations because it introduces an additional level of uncertainty to the workflow using real observations would be the ideal option when implementing seasonal forecasting but then reduces the transferability of the workflow the comparison of seasonal forecasts with real observations will be subject of future work here we use a perfect model assumption so that we can specifically explore how well seasonal climate forecast skill propagates through seasonal forecasting in lakes the use of reanalysis together with seasonal forecast systems is a common approach when implementing seasonal forecasting of impact variables e g pechlivanidis et al 2020 wood et al 2016 another important issue emerges when predicting inflows and outflows in reservoirs because our analysis suggested it affects predictability this was made evident by the conspicuous reduced discrimination skill decrease in the performance for surface and bottom water temperature in mt bold and wupper reservoirs 2 and 1 significant terciles respectively compared to sau reservoir 7 significant terciles this was caused by a slight difference in the way water inflows and outflows were modelled to avoid water dry outs in the reservoir during forecasting georgakakos and graham 2008 li et al 2014 in mt bold and wupper inflows and outflows were dynamically corrected during runs to avoid water dry outs these may result due to inconsistencies between the forecasted discharge and the assumed outflows during the forecasted season while in sau reservoir we did not correct for this effect which resulted in some dummy predictions due to dry outs empty boxes in fig 7 however discrimination skill in sau was higher suggesting the water level correction algorithm used in mt bold and wupper should be reconsidered 6 conclusions managing water quantity and quality is a challenging task for the catchment lake systems presented here since managers must regulate the water supply and ecological and recreational services under constant and even unprecedented changes in climate this requires making decisions according to the changes in water quantity and quality over time depending on the influencing meteorological and hydrologic conditions currently the management of these lakes reservoirs is mainly based on previous experience and expert decision to support this decision making we have presented a feasible and robust workflow to connect climate forecast data with hydrologic and lake modeling to obtain seasonal forecasts of discharge and lake temperature profiles even considering the limited skill performance found in our seasonal predictions vs climatology the few windows of opportunity that seasonal prediction might offer may help managers to anticipate general trends of water quantity and quality changes the advanced warning provided by seasonal forecasts could return huge benefits in terms of treatment costs reputation of industry and water authorities and safe provision of ecosystem services in any case the probabilistic nature of seasonal predictions and the limited skill performance found in the studied regions requires careful approach when informing managers about these predictions and the confidence they may place in them failing to transparently convey these two properties would compromise the use of seasonal predictions in water resource management in a future with more reliable seasonal climate predictions outside the tropical regions however our study points to some windows of opportunity that are worth exploring to make the most of the current state of the art of climate and water quality prediction

16832,dimethyl sulfide dms serves as an anti greenhouse gas plays multiple roles in aquatic ecosystems and contributes to the global sulfur cycle the chlorophyll a chl an indicator of phytoplankton biomass dms relationship is critical for estimating dms emissions from aquatic ecosystems importantly recent research has identified that the chl dms relationship has a breakpoint where the relationship is positive below a chl threshold and negative at higher chl concentrations conventionally mean regression methods are employed to characterize the chl dms relationship however these approaches focus on the response of mean conditions and cannot illustrate responses of other parts of the dms distribution which could be important in order to obtain a complete view of the chl dms relationship in this study for the first time we proposed a novel bayesian change point quantile regression bcpqr model that integrates and inherits advantages of bayesian change point models and bayesian quantile regression models our objective was to examine whether or not the bcpqr approach could enhance the understanding of shifting chl dms relationships in aquatic ecosystems we fitted bcpqr models at five regression quantiles for freshwater lakes and for seas we found that bcpqr models could provide a relatively complete view on the chl dms relationship in particular it quantified the upper boundary of the relationship representing the limiting effect of chl on dms based on the results of paired parameter comparisons we revealed the inequality of regression slopes in bcpqr models for seas indicating that applying the mean regression method to develop the chl dms relationship in seas might not be appropriate we also confirmed relationship differences between lakes and seas at multiple regression quantiles further by introducing the concept of dms emission potential we found that ph was not likely a key factor leading to the change of the chl dms relationship in lakes these findings cannot be revealed using piecewise linear regression we thereby concluded that the bcpqr model does indeed enhance the understanding of shifting chl dms relationships in aquatic ecosystems and is expected to benefit efforts aimed at estimating dms emissions considering that shifting threshold relationships are not rare and that the bcpqr model can easily be adapted to different systems the bcpqr approach is expected to have great potential for generalization in other environmental and ecological studies keywords bayesian inference change point analysis quantile regression shifting relationship chlorophyll a dimethyl sulfide emission 1 introduction dimethyl sulfide dms was recognized as an anti greenhouse gas because its oxidized products acted as cloud condensation nuclei which reflected solar irradiation and thereby contributed to the reduction of earth temperature i e the claw hypothesis charlson et al 1987 despite recent debates or rejection of the claw hypothesis cropp et al 2018 quinn and bates 2011 the hypothesis is likely relevant in some regions like the southern and arctic oceans krüger and graßl 2011 levasseur 2013 dms also plays multiple essential roles in aquatic ecosystems such as serving as an antioxidant for phytoplankton sunda et al 2002 and facilitating a tritrophic mutualism between primary producers and top predators savoca and nevitt 2014 in addition dms is important to the global sulfur cycle eyice et al 2015 accounting for about 80 of global biogenic sulfur emissions to the atmosphere kettle and andreae 2000 phytoplankton indicated by chlorophyll a chl bates et al 1994 zhang et al 2008 is the major producer of dms charlson et al 1987 gondwe et al 2003 therefore understanding the chl dms relationship is critical for estimating regional or global dms emissions from aquatic ecosystems anderson et al 2001 galí et al 2015 simó and dachs 2002 correlation analysis and ordinary linear regression have been the most widely used methods to explore the chl dms relationship most studies revealed a positive effect of chl on dms e g a significantly positive correlation coefficient or regression slope gao et al 2017 iverson et al 1989 lana et al 2011 law et al 2017 lizotte et al 2020 tan et al 2017 tortell et al 2011 walker et al 2000 yang 1999 2000 yang and tsunogai 2005 yang et al 2009 2011 zhang et al 2014 while several studies reported a negative relationship froelichd et al 1985 or no relationship at all nemcek et al 2008 watanabe et al 1995 we note that maximum chl concentrations in studies deducing positive chl dms relationships were always much lower than those deducing negative or no relationships for example chl concentrations in a series of studies on chinese seas yang 1999 2000 yang and tsunogai 2005 yang et al 2009 2011 were all lower than 4 μ g l in contrast the chl concentration can reach approximate 60 μ g l in froelichd et al 1985 a recent study examining the chl dms relationship across a broad range of chl concentrations implemented a change point model to capture the ascending and descending limbs of this relationship deng et al 2020 the change point model aims to determine one or more unknown change points at which the stressor response relationship changes in deng et al 2020 the authors used 246 paired observations of chl and dms from 100 chinese lakes and collected 426 paired observations from global oceans they applied a piecewise linear regression model muggeo 2003 to detect thresholds of chl concentration at which chl dms relationships significantly changed benefiting from the novel application of piecewise regression the authors revealed hump shaped chl dms relationships in both lakes and seas which were expected to increase the estimation accuracy of global dms emissions from aquatic ecosystems deng et al 2020 the hump shaped relationship also seemed to resolve the contradiction of the sign of the chl dms relationship in previous studies whose deductions might have been constrained by a relatively smaller sample size a narrow range of sampled chl concentration or an application of a overly simplified linear regression model although many informative studies have investigated the chl dms relationship we note that those studies mainly used mean regression methods e g the ordinary linear regression or piecewise regression by which the relationship between chl and the mean of dms distribution was estimated a practically important alternative to classical mean regression methods is quantile regression qr koenker and bassett 1978 to the best of our knowledge qr has not been used to examine chl dms relationships qr explores the effect of one or more predictors on any quantile of the response variable distribution das et al 2019 koenker and bassett 1978 compared with mean regression methods qr can provide a more complete view of possible causal relationships and can reveal useful predictive relationships at some parts of the response variable distribution even when there is a weak or no predictive relationship between the predictor s and the mean of the response variable distribution cade and noon 2003 in addition qr appears more robust to outliers of the response variable scharf et al 1998 and is not constrained by the equal variance assumption cade and noon 2003 das et al 2019 qr has been successfully applied to environmental and ecological studies qr has been used to 1 illustrate a relatively complete view of stressor response relationships at multiple regression quantiles cade et al 2008 liang et al 2021 muller et al 2018 niinemets and valladares 2006 simkin et al 2016 xu et al 2015 2 obtain reliable prediction intervals of the response variable heiskary and bouchard 2015 kampichler and sierdsema 2018 and 3 reveal the limiting effect of the stressor on the response variable via the upper boundary of the stressor response relationship fornaroli et al 2016 keeley et al 2012 youngflesh et al 2017 the upper boundary of a stressor response relationship illustrates the behavior of response variable when the stressor is the limiting factor cade et al 1999 sankaran et al 2005 because the chl dms relationship represents a stressor response relationship mcdowell et al 2018 qr seems applicable and helpful to enhance the understanding of the chl dms relationship considering the recent finding on the shifting nature of chl dms relationships deng et al 2020 a simple linear qr might not be adequate a qr method with the ability to detect a change point is required but has rarely been explored an exploration of this approach could be found in zhou et al 2015 who proposed a sequential change point detection method for linear qr in this study we propose a novel bayesian change point quantile regression bcpqr approach to investigate the chl dms relationship in aquatic ecosystems the bcpqr model integrates two well developed bayesian models a bayesian change point bcp model barry and hartigan 1993 erdman and emerson 2007 and a bayesian quantile regression bqr model benoit and van den poel 2017 yu and moyeed 2001 both the bcp model beckage et al 2007 liang et al 2019 thomson et al 2010 and the bqr model barneche et al 2016 uranchimeg et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zou and shi 2020 have been recently introduced and applied to develop a stressor response relationship in environmental and ecological fields however to our knowledge this is the first proposal of bcpqr model in environmental and ecological studies there are several features of the bcpqr model that makes it desirable for ecological investigations first the bcpqr model inherits advantages of the bqr model and the bcp model it is expected to be able to provide a complete view on the stressor response relationship muller et al 2018 xu et al 2015 the detection of any change point in the regression intercept slopes and or variance of residuals is possible beckage et al 2007 liang et al 2019 second the bayesian framework would provide the convenience for parameters estimation we can straightforwardly incorporate the change point into the bqr model structure parameter estimation of bcpqr model could then be achieved using markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods qian et al 2003 moreover the parameter estimation framework would allow for the calculation of probability densities representing the uncertainty of parameters including the change point and the other model parameters ellison 2004 gende et al 2011 underwood et al 2017 in addition based on posterior distributions of parameters comparing parameters is straightforward alameddine et al 2011 qian et al 2009 finally prior information if available could be used during model development ellison 1996 2004 our objective was to examine whether or not the bcpqr approach can enhance the understanding of chl dms relationships in lakes and seas we applied the proposed bcpqr model to reevaluate shifting chl dms relationships revealed in deng et al 2020 we separately fitted bcpqr models at five regression quantiles to avoid over confidence in the change point model a common practice is comparing the change point model with a model without any change point cahill et al 2015 liang et al 2019 therefore we also fitted a bqr model at each regression quantile and compared performances of the two models as a means to select the best model for characterizing the chl dms relationship 2 materials and methods 2 1 data source observations of chl dms and ph in lakes were directly obtained from deng et al 2020 in which the authors sampled 246 sites from 100 shallow lakes in china locations of these lakes range from 111 e to 122 e in longitude and from 28 n to 39 n in latitude chl concentrations varied widely ranging from 0 55 μ g l to 58 μ g l with an average of 11 87 μ g l and a standard deviation of 10 95 μ g l the average dms concentration was 175 ng l with a standard deviation of 189 ng l in seas deng et al 2020 complied 426 paired observations of chl and dms from 20 contributors of the global surface seawater dms database https saga pmel noaa gov dms the sampling occurred during 1981 and 2012 according to the contributors table supplementary table 2 in deng et al 2020 we found 25 rather than 20 contributors meeting the data filtering requirements in our analysis all the data from these 25 contributors were included we aggregated data by the sampling year and location longitude and latitude so that yearly site specific averages of chl and dms were used to develop the chl dms relationship in seas the final sample size was 497 rather than the 426 in deng et al 2020 chl concentrations ranged from 0 04 μ g l to 57 71 μ g l with an average of 3 11 μ g l and a standard deviation of 6 11 μ g l the average dms concentration was 378 ng l with a standard deviation of 540 ng l detailed information on the 25 contributors code for data aggregation and the aggregated chl and dms data can be found in the supplementary materials 2 2 model development we fitted separate chl dms relationship for lakes and seas at five regression quantiles 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 we did not explore more extreme regression quantiles e g 0 01 0 05 0 95 or 0 99 because the uncertainty of estimated parameters increases scharf et al 1998 with less data available at the tails of distribution of the response variable for each regression quantile of a certain ecosystem type we first developed a bqr model and a bcpqr model respectively then we compared performances of these two models based on the deviance information criterion dic and selected the model with better performance as our top ranked model consideration of both models is helpful for the development of a more reliable relationship compared to relying on either model independently cahill et al 2015 in the following subsections we introduce the bqr model and the bcpqr model because the estimation of the change point can be straightforwardly incorporated into the modeling framework of the bqr model we did not separately introduce the bcp model for detailed information on the bcp model please refer to beckage et al 2007 or erdman and emerson 2007 2 2 1 bayesian quantile regression a simple linear qr model to estimate the chl dms relationship at a specific regression quantile p 0 p 1 can be expressed by eq 1 1 y i α 0 p α 1 p x i ε i p where y represents the log 10 transformed dms concentration ng l x represents the log 10 transformed chl concentration μ g l and i is the order of observations α 0 p and α 1 p are the regression intercept and slope at the p quantile respectively ε p represents the error the parameter estimation is based on the minimization of weighted sums of absolute deviations koenker and bassett 1978 muller et al 2018 which can be expressed by eq 2 in our case 2 min α 0 α 1 i ρ p ε i p min α 0 α 1 i ρ p y i α 0 p α 1 p x i where ρ p is the loss function and can be expressed by eq 3 for a given value u 3 ρ p u u p i u 0 where i u 0 means the value will be one if u 0 and zero otherwise the bqr was first proposed by yu and moyeed 2001 in which the loss function eq 3 was revealed to be equivalent to the maximization of a likelihood function formed by combining independently distributed asymmetric laplace densities since then asymmetric laplace distribution ald has been widely used for the bqr model alhamzawi 2018 benoit and van den poel 2017 benefiting from the attractive feature of ald the error can be expressed by eq 4 kotz et al 2001 wang et al 2016 zou and shi 2020 4 ε i p 1 2 p p 1 p w i 2 w i δ p p 1 p z i where δ p represents the precision parameter of the ald w is an exponentially distributed random variable with a rate of δ p and z is a random variable with a standard normal distribution it is wroth noting that the two random variables w and z are independent kotz et al 2001 zou and shi 2020 as such according to eqs 1 and 4 the distribution of y can be expressed by eq 5 5 y i n α 0 p α 1 p x i 1 2 p w i p 1 p 2 w i δ p p 1 p then posterior distributions of all the parameters can be deduced by eq 6 6 π α 0 p α 1 p δ p i 1 n n y i α 0 p α 1 p x i 1 2 p w i p 1 p 2 w i δ p p 1 p π α 0 p π α 1 p π w i δ p π δ p where n is the sample size as noted by yu and moyeed 2001 standard conjugate prior distributions might not be available however according to eq 6 mcmc methods can be easily applied to calculate posterior distributions of unknown parameters chernozhukov and hong 2003 kozumi and kobayashi 2011 lee and neocleous 2010 yu and moyeed 2001 for more detailed introductions on the derivation of the bqr model please refer to yu and moyeed 2001 lancaster and jun 2009 or zou and shi 2020 2 2 2 bayesian change point quantile regression the main functions of bcpqr model used in the chl dms relationship development can be expressed by eq 7 and eq 8 7 y i β 0 p β 1 ϕ p i p x i c p p ε i p 8 ϕ p i 1 x i c p p 2 x i c p p where cp p represent the change point of log 10 transformed chl at which the chl dms relationship changes β 1 1 and β 1 2 are regression slopes before and after the change point respectively ϕ p i is the step function controlling the index of regression slope β 0 is the estimated value of log 10 transformed dms at the change point we did not seek to estimate two different regression intercepts but used eq 7 to make sure the continuity of relationship at the change point comparing functions of the bcp model with those of bcpqr model we can find that the major difference is the addition of a change point in the bcpqr model structure benefiting from the flexibility of bayesian framework it is straightforward to incorporate the estimation of a change point into the parameter estimation process of the bqr model specifically we can modify the parameter estimation process for a bayesian linear regression model to that of a bcp model cahill et al 2015 liang et al 2019 following similar steps of eq 2 4 we can easily obtain the distribution expression of y in the bcpqr model eq 9 9 y i n β 0 p β 1 ϕ p i p x i c p p 1 2 p w ϕ p i i p 1 p 2 w ϕ p i i δ ϕ p i p p 1 p accordingly posterior distributions of all the parameters in the bcpqr model can be expressed by eq 10 which can be further deduced using mcmc methods wang et al 2016 10 π β 0 p β 1 1 p β 1 2 p δ p c p p i 1 n n y i β 0 p β 1 ϕ p i p x i c p p

bcpqr model we calculated dic values for each pair of models dic combines a measure of goodness of fit and a measure of model complexity spiegelhalter et al 2002 dic is a reliable criterion and has been widely used for bayesian model selection cahill et al 2015 liang et al 2019 meyer 2016 a smaller dic indicates a better model generally the model with a smaller dic is strongly supported if the difference of dic values between the two moddels is larger than 10 ribatet 2020 2 2 4 parameter comparisons parameter comparison aims to test whether or not a significant difference exists between two estimated parameters for bayesian models posterior distributions of parameters can be conveniently used to calculate the posterior distribution of the difference between two parameters qian et al 2009 in this study to compare the difference of paired parameters we used 3000 samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters of interest and derived the posterior distribution of the difference between the parameters being compared we then calculated the 95 credible interval of the difference and if the 95 credible interval covered zero then we deduced that the two parameters were not significantly different otherwise the two parameters were considered significantly different we used parameter comparisons to examine the equality of regression slopes at multiple regression quantiles classical mean regression methods including piecewise regression should meet the assumption of equal variance cade and noon 2003 conventionally comparing regression slopes of qr models at a range of regression quantiles is an effective tool to test the equal variance assumption das et al 2019 if all the test results were not significant then the equal variance assumption was assured otherwise the assumption was violated and applications of mean regression methods were deemed inappropriate we also compared parameters of bcpqr models for lakes with those for seas at each regression quantile we tested differences of four regression parameters including β 0 β 1 1 β 1 2 and cp in eq 7 in addition to indicating parameter differences the comparison can also reveal differences between relationships in lakes and those in seas if any test result was significant then the model for lakes and that for seas would be considered significantly different based on the results of bcpqr models we can examine whether or not the bcpqr approach can enhance the understanding of chl dms relationships based on previous studies utilizing bayesian analysis cahill et al 2015 yu and moyeed 2001 and examining chl dms relationships deng et al 2020 we expected that the bcpqr model would provide new findings on three aspects of the chl dms relationship specifically the bcpqr model would 1 advance the statistical modeling of chl dms relationships and therefore the inferences that can be made about the ecological implications of this relationship 2 elucidate relationship differences between lakes and seas and 3 identify factors that might mediate the chl dms relationship the modeling of chl dms relationship includes providing a full view of the relationship at multiple regression quantiles reflecting the limiting effect of chl on dms and testing the violation of equal variance assumption specifically based on the results of bcpqr models we expected to be able to show a relatively complete view of chl dms relationships at multiple regression quantiles reflecting responses across much of the dms distribution illustrate the limiting effect of chl on dms using the upper boundary of relationship test the equality of regression slopes at multiple regression quantiles to determine whether or not a mean regression method is adequate to develop a reliable chl dms relationship detect relationships differences between lakes and seas at multiple regression quantiles explore whether or not another variable i e ph influences the limiting effect of chl on dms in lakes all computations were conducted using the r software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 we used the jags software version 4 3 0 plummer 2017 for parameter estimation of all the bqr and bcpqr models we called jags from r using the rjags plummer 2019 and r2jags su and yajima 2020 packages diffuse priors were used for all the parameters we used four chains with random initial values and ran 1 000 000 iterations for each chain the first half of the iterations were used for the burn in process while the second half were used for summarizing the posterior distribution model convergence was evaluated by the gelman rubin convergence statistic r brooks and gelman 1998 and assured by r 1 10 filstrup et al 2017 code for model development and parameters estimation are available in the supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 model selection dic values for each pair of bqr and bcpqr models at each regression quantile in lakes or seas are summarized in table 1 the dic difference was calculated by subtracting the dic value of the bqr model from the dic value of bcpqr model for all model pairs the bcpqr model had a much smaller dic value compared with the bqr model dic differences 47 for all comparisons table 1 according to ribatet 2020 a dic difference larger than 10 indicates that the model with a larger dic value has no support relative to the model with the lowest dic value therefore dic results support the bcpqr model for describing the chl dms relationship at all regression quantiles and in both lakes and seas 3 2 parameter estimation because the bcpqr model was the top ranked model based on dic we only reported parameter estimates for the bcpqr models posterior distributions of the four key parameters are shown in fig 1 because regression slopes were all positive before the change point and post change point slopes were all negative the regression parameter β 0 can be interpreted as the maximum of log 10 dms at the corresponding regression quantile according to eq 7 as noted in fig 1a the parameter β 0 increased with increasing regression quantile which is expected because the observed dms should be greater at higher quantiles from the 0 1 quantile to the 0 9 quantile the posterior mean of β 0 increases from 2 08 to 2 98 for lakes and from 2 16 to 3 26 for seas corresponding to an average increase of dms from 120 ng l to 955 ng l for lakes and from 145 ng l to 1820 ng l for seas as for the estimated change points of log 10 chl cp fig 1b posterior means ranged from 0 656 to 0 828 this corresponds to chl concentrations on the raw scale of 4 53 μ g l and 6 73 μ g l which is a relatively narrow range comparing change points of bcpqr models for lakes and those for seas there are large overlaps in posterior distributions at all the regression quantiles and the posterior means of the change points are very similar except for those at the 0 1 regression quantile posterior means of the slopes before the change point for lakes varied substantially with regression quantile while those for seas were relatively stable fig 1c estimates for lakes are also more uncertain compared to estimates for seas however for the slopes after the change point the opposite is true that is the posterior means of slopes after the change point for lakes were relatively stable while those for seas varied with regression quantile and are more uncertain fig 1d in addition for seas the absolute value of slopes increases before the change point with increasing regression quantile fig 1c and decreases after the change point fig 1d for lakes before the change point the regression slope decreases except at the 0 9 quantile fig 1c after the change point the regression slopes show no apparent pattern fig 1d 4 discussion 4 1 relationships at multiple regression quantiles while a mean regression method e g the piecewise linear regression used in deng et al 2020 focuses on the mean of dms distribution the bcpqr model revealed a more complete view of the chl dms relationships at multiple regression quantiles fig 2 thus allowing for a more thorough understanding of the response of dms to changes in chl across the dms distribution in practice it is difficult to obtain the true upper boundary of the relationship due to the lack of data at the tail ends of the distribution however the model at an upper regression quantile provides a reasonable approximation of the true upper boundary cade et al 1999 therefore if we are interested in the upper boundary of the chl dms relationship which generally represents the limiting effect of chl on dms we can set the regression quantile to be 0 9 top curves in fig 2a b similarly we could explore the relationship at the 0 1 quantile if we want to explore the relationship when dms is mainly limited by factors other than chl furthermore combining prediction results at the 0 1 and 0 9 quantiles results in the 80 prediction interval of the dms distribution if the range of the dms distribution is of interest it is also convenient to conduct uncertainty analysis for regression parameters fig 1 and for predicted dms values shaded regions in fig 2 in addition the results provide a visual comparison of relationship differences at multiple regression quantiles for the relationship in seas dms increases faster before the change point but reduces slower after the change point with increasing regression quantile fig 2b also revealed by the parameter estimation results in fig 1 the chl dms relationship in lakes varies but shows no monotonic trend with the change of regression quantile fig 2a the variations among regression slopes fig 1 and the relationship differences at multiple regression quantiles fig 2 reflect varied responses to chl among different parts of dms distribution these observed differences in chl dms relationships at different quantiles and before and after change points highlights the fact that multiple mechanisms and processes are likely involved in governing chl dms dynamics and that these drivers may differ between seas and lakes currently we do not have specific hypotheses regarding what drivers might be involved however identifying primary drivers and if these drivers vary in importance as a function of chl or dms concentrations represents an area of meaningful future research 4 2 limiting effect of chl on dms the theoretical basis of limiting effect comes from liebigs law of the minimum in which a limiting factor is the one least available among those factors affecting the response variable cade et al 1999 in our analysis the limiting effect is when chl is the limiting factor of dms which can be illustrated by the upper quantile of the chl dms relationship fig 3 in contrast piecewise linear regression results solid lines in fig 3 cannot quantify such a limiting effect cade et al 1999 following common practice of qr joseph et al 2016 keeley et al 2012 mönkkönen et al 2017 we employed the relationship deduced by the bcpqr model at the 0 9 regression quantile as the upper boundary of chl dms relationship to reflect the limiting effect of chl on dms we back transformed log 10 chl and log 10 dms to their raw scales fig 3 on the raw scales the difference between the upper boundary of chl dms relationship in lakes and that in seas is apparent the upper boundary in seas is much greater than that in lakes in addition before the change point dms increases more sharply with an increase in chl in seas when compared to that in lakes both upper boundaries are right skewed which means with the increase of chl dms increases faster before the change point and then decreases slower after the change point 4 3 equality of regression slopes the examination of equality of regression slopes can determine whether or not a mean regression method violates the equal variance assumption das et al 2019 parameter differences of paired slopes are shown in fig 4 for slope differences of bcpqr models in seas 95 credible intervals of several paired slopes e g 0 5 0 1 in fig 4a and 0 9 0 1 in fig 4b do not cover zero indicating significant differences therefore the equal variance assumption is violated that is mean regression methods are not appropriate for developing the chl dms relationship in seas although some mean regression methods could be used to deduce some quantiles of the dms distribution borsuk et al 2002 it can be problematic when trying to predict some quantiles of dms distribution using a mean regression method because of the violation of the equal variance assumption cade and noon 2003 das et al 2019 for the lake model there were no significant differences between paired slopes fig 4 however the sample size is relatively small and uncertainties of regression slopes were large fig 1c d which contributed to the insignificance of parameter differences before additional data are included to further confirm results of parameter differences piecewise linear regression methods might be used with caution for the development of chl dms relationship in lakes while the piecewise linear regression method might not be appropriate for the development of chl dms relationship in seas the bcpqr model is not constrained by the equal variance assumption cade and noon 2003 and thereby can be used as a reliable and robust tool for dms prediction because the median regression is a robust alternative to ordinary linear regression koenker and hallock 2001 the bcpqr model at the 0 5 regression quantile can act as an effective alternative to the piecewise linear regression in addition because of the violation of equal variance assumption the piecewise linear regression should not be used to deduce predicted quantiles of the dms distribution das et al 2019 whereas reliable intervals of predicted dms distributions are possible using the bcpqr model heiskary and bouchard 2015 kampichler and sierdsema 2018 4 4 relationship differences between lakes and seas we compared the chl dms relationships in lakes to those in seas by comparing the parameters of the bcpqr models at multiple regression quantiles fig 5 the parameter comparisons provide statistical evidence that the chl dms relationship does in fact differ between lakes and seas considering that β 0 in the bcpqr model represents a log 10 transformed dms concentration eq 7 fig 1a when calculating the difference we retransformed β 0 to the raw unit of dms ng l fig 5a with increasing regression quantile the difference of maximum dms increases specifically at the 0 7 and 0 9 quantiles posterior means of the differences are more than 500 ng l dms concentratons in seas are higher than in lakes which are large considering the average dms concentrations for lakes and seas are only 175 ng l and 378 ng l respectively we also retransformed the cp parameter into the raw units of chl concentration μ g l to calculate differences between change points for the lake and seas models fig 5b we found no significant differences particularly posterior means of differences were close to zero ranging from 1 78 μ g l to 0 59 μ g l also for each ecosystem type tests on paired cp values showed no significant differences for all combinations of regression quantiles fig s2 these results indicate that the change point of chl at which the chl dms relationship changes is consistent at multiple regression quantiles and for different ecosystem types while deng et al 2020 revealed that change points were very close for lakes and seas using the piecewise linear regression method we confirmed this conclusions at multiple regression quantiles based on results from the bcpqr models it is worth emphasizing as previously mentioned that despite the relatively consistent location of chl change points corresponding dms concentrations are substantially different at some regression quantiles fig 5a before the change point regression slopes of bcpqr models for lakes are significantly larger than those for seas except for those at the 0 7 regression quantile fig 5c while deng et al 2020 found that the slope before the change point for lakes were almost twice as large as the value for seas 1 22 and 0 62 respectively our results show that the ratio is not as simple as two at varied quantiles according to the results of bcpqr models fig 1c the ratio would be 4 3 2 7 2 4 2 0 and 2 8 for the five regression quantiles from 0 1 to 0 9 respectively as for regression slopes after the change point the only significant difference was at the 0 1 regression quantile fig 5d considering significant differences of some regression parameters between models for lakes and those for seas we conclude that the chl dms relationship in lakes and that in seas are different at each regression quantile despite the consistency of chl change points obviously the piecewise linear regression method cannot reveal the consistency of chl change points for lakes and seas and cannot examine parameter and relationship differences at multiple regression quantiles the chl dms relationship differences between lakes and seas indicates that some drivers or processes controlling the emission of dms are likely to be different in lakes and seas deng et al 2020 revealed the effect of ph on the chl dms relationship in lakes and also extended the finding to seas however based on our results currently transferring any potential mechanisms controlling dms in either lake or sea ecosystems into the other ecosystem may be misleading a possible explanation for the ecosystem dependent relationship might be the difference in salinity between lakes and seas with dms emission likely increasing with increasing salinity concentrations gibson et al 1991 taalba et al 2013 concentrations that promote the production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate major precursor for dms curson et al 2017 importantly however additonal efforts are needed to explore drivers and processes leading to the relationship differences between lakes and seas 4 5 impact of ph on chl dms relationship the ph was emphasized to be the key factor impacting the chl dms relationship in deng et al 2020 specifically the emission of dms would increase with increasing chl when ph 8 1 and would decease when ph 8 1 deng et al 2020 we reevaluated the effect of ph on the limiting effect of chl on dms we first defined a term emission potential to represent the difference between the maximum emission when dms was solely limited by chl and observed dms emission the emission potential can be calculated by the predicted upper boundary minus observed dms values next assuming that ph is the key factor impacting dms emission ph should explain a large proportion of variation of emission potential specifically since the ph threshold value favoring dms emission is 8 1 the emission potential of dms should decrease with increasing ph when ph 8 1 and should increase with additional increases in ph when ph 8 1 that is the observed dms should become closer to the upper boundary and the emission potential should become smaller when ph approaches 8 1 to examine whether or not the above assumption was reasonable we used the predicted dms emissions deduced from the bcpqr model for lakes at the 0 9 regression quantile minus the observed dms concentrations to reflect the emission potential of dms fig 6 surprisingly we found that ph does not explain significant variation in the dms emission potential the assumption that ph is a key factor impacting the chl dms relationship is not supported by our results although there is a significant change point of ph in the ph dms relationship refer to fig 1c in deng et al 2020 considering the obvious positive ph chl correlation refer to fig 1d in deng et al 2020 and that chl can be a causal variable impacting both ph and dms charlson et al 1987 nakano and watanabe 2005 the causal effect of ph on the chl dms relationship change point is likely a result of a statistical correlation resulting from a shared environmental driver i e chl drives dms and ph however it is hard to distinguish the causal effect from correlation using a mean regression method by contrast the bcpqr model is a useful tool for such an analysis by introducing the emission potential and linking it to the possible driver note that the calculation of emission potential relies on the upper boundary deduced from the bcpqr model 4 6 implications for understanding chl dms relationships in this study we proposed a novel bcpqr model to quantify the chl dms relationship in aquatic ecosystems here we summarize how the bcpqr approach enhanced the understanding of shifting chl dms relationships by comparing it with the application of piecewise regression method bcpqr models provided a relatively complete view of shifting chl dms relationships at multiple regression quantiles rather than only focusing on the mean of the dms distribution as done with piecewise linear regression the upper boundary of the relationship was quantified by the bcpqr model at the 0 9 regression quantile while the piecewise regression cannot show such an effect we revealed that the equal variance assumption was violated when applying piecewise linear regression in seas while the bcpqr model could be employed to predict different parts e g the median or an interval of the dms distribution without being constrained by this assumption we found consistency in change points of the chl dms relationships for lakes and seas however chl dms relationships in lakes and seas were substantially different at all regression quantiles as such we caution against transferring results and inferences from one ecoystem type to another according to the upper boundary of chl dms relationship we introduced and calculated the emission potential of dms using this metric we showed that ph was not likely to be the key factor impacting the chl dms relationship in lakes while piecewise linear regression cannot distinguish causality from correlation the application of bcpqr model might be helpful for causality detection 4 7 generalizations of the proposed approach in practice shifting stressor response relationsships e g the hump shaped stressor response relationship or other shapes of stressor response relationship with a change point e g the sign remains the same but the magnitude of regression slope changes are not rare in ecology keeley et al 2012 liang et al 2019 wagner and midway 2014 most commonly mean regression methods such as the piecewise regression have been applied to detect the change point and develop the shifting stressor response relationship massicotte et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in this study we made a step forward in modeling shifting stressor response relationships in environmental and ecological research we have demonstrated that the bcpqr model is an effective tool to understand a shifting stressor response relationship by identifying the change point providing a complete view on the relationship across the distribution of the response variable examining significance of parameter differences making robust predictions and conducting uncertainty analysis moreover benefiting from the flexibility of bayesian framework the bcpqr model can be easily modified which will allow for it to be broadly applied in ecological investigations potential modifications to the bcpqr model to address other ecological questions include detecting change points over time time could be added as the predictor to estimate a temporal change point similar to what cahill et al 2015 did for a bcp model multivariate regression adding other predictor variables and modeling change points is straightforward under a bayesian framework liang et al 2019 detecting multiple change points the model can be modified to accommodate multiple change points which has been done using other modeling approaches beaulieu et al 2009 jochner and menzel 2015 binary or discrete response variables the chl dms relationship is a continuous response case in environmental and ecological studies the response variable is often binary or discrete e g count data wagner and midway 2014 since the bqr model can accommodate binary or discrete response variables benoit and van den poel 2017 lee and neocleous 2010 the bcpqr model can as well hierarchical modeling the hierarchical structure of regression parameters e g regression slopes before and after the change point can be incorporated into the modeling as in a hierarchical bcp model authier et al 2011 thomson et al 2010 therefore the proposed bcpqr model is expected to have great potential for generalizing to other ecological questions which will help to better understand shifting stressor response relationships in environmental and ecological studies note that several other qr methods such as polynomial regression fornaroli et al 2016 youngflesh et al 2017 spline smoothing keeley et al 2012 quantile regression forest kampichler and sierdsema 2018 veronesi and schillaci 2019 and quantile regression neural networks cannon 2011 can be used to fit a nonlinear stressor response relationship and thereby might be applicable to the development of a shifting chl dms relationship compared with these methods the bcpqr model is parameterized to have fewer parameters which can effectively avoid over fitting the novelty of our research is due to two primary factors the proposal of the novel bcpqr model and the enhanced understanding of chl dms relationships in this study for the first time we integrated the bcp model and the bqr model to reveal shifting stressor response relationships at multiple regression quantiles the proposal of the novel approach thereby contributes to the research field of environmental and ecological modeling we applied our novel model to reevaluate published chl dms relationships in aquatic ecosystems by which we found several meaningful and insightful findings regarding the chl dms relationship insight that would not be possible using a traditional piecewise linear regression approach the insight derived from the proposed approach may also help improve overall estimates of dms emission from aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusions integrating the bcp model and the bqr model we proposed a novel bcpqr model that was able to detect a change point in the qr we employed the proposed approach to investigate the chl dms relationship in aquatic ecosystems we revealed new findings in the chl dms relationship modeling relationship differences between lakes and seas and factors impacting the chl dms relationship we thereby concluded that the bcpqr model could indeed enhance the understanding of shifting chl dms relationship we believe that the bcpqr approach can be generalized to other cases where shifting stressor response relationships are observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16832,dimethyl sulfide dms serves as an anti greenhouse gas plays multiple roles in aquatic ecosystems and contributes to the global sulfur cycle the chlorophyll a chl an indicator of phytoplankton biomass dms relationship is critical for estimating dms emissions from aquatic ecosystems importantly recent research has identified that the chl dms relationship has a breakpoint where the relationship is positive below a chl threshold and negative at higher chl concentrations conventionally mean regression methods are employed to characterize the chl dms relationship however these approaches focus on the response of mean conditions and cannot illustrate responses of other parts of the dms distribution which could be important in order to obtain a complete view of the chl dms relationship in this study for the first time we proposed a novel bayesian change point quantile regression bcpqr model that integrates and inherits advantages of bayesian change point models and bayesian quantile regression models our objective was to examine whether or not the bcpqr approach could enhance the understanding of shifting chl dms relationships in aquatic ecosystems we fitted bcpqr models at five regression quantiles for freshwater lakes and for seas we found that bcpqr models could provide a relatively complete view on the chl dms relationship in particular it quantified the upper boundary of the relationship representing the limiting effect of chl on dms based on the results of paired parameter comparisons we revealed the inequality of regression slopes in bcpqr models for seas indicating that applying the mean regression method to develop the chl dms relationship in seas might not be appropriate we also confirmed relationship differences between lakes and seas at multiple regression quantiles further by introducing the concept of dms emission potential we found that ph was not likely a key factor leading to the change of the chl dms relationship in lakes these findings cannot be revealed using piecewise linear regression we thereby concluded that the bcpqr model does indeed enhance the understanding of shifting chl dms relationships in aquatic ecosystems and is expected to benefit efforts aimed at estimating dms emissions considering that shifting threshold relationships are not rare and that the bcpqr model can easily be adapted to different systems the bcpqr approach is expected to have great potential for generalization in other environmental and ecological studies keywords bayesian inference change point analysis quantile regression shifting relationship chlorophyll a dimethyl sulfide emission 1 introduction dimethyl sulfide dms was recognized as an anti greenhouse gas because its oxidized products acted as cloud condensation nuclei which reflected solar irradiation and thereby contributed to the reduction of earth temperature i e the claw hypothesis charlson et al 1987 despite recent debates or rejection of the claw hypothesis cropp et al 2018 quinn and bates 2011 the hypothesis is likely relevant in some regions like the southern and arctic oceans krüger and graßl 2011 levasseur 2013 dms also plays multiple essential roles in aquatic ecosystems such as serving as an antioxidant for phytoplankton sunda et al 2002 and facilitating a tritrophic mutualism between primary producers and top predators savoca and nevitt 2014 in addition dms is important to the global sulfur cycle eyice et al 2015 accounting for about 80 of global biogenic sulfur emissions to the atmosphere kettle and andreae 2000 phytoplankton indicated by chlorophyll a chl bates et al 1994 zhang et al 2008 is the major producer of dms charlson et al 1987 gondwe et al 2003 therefore understanding the chl dms relationship is critical for estimating regional or global dms emissions from aquatic ecosystems anderson et al 2001 galí et al 2015 simó and dachs 2002 correlation analysis and ordinary linear regression have been the most widely used methods to explore the chl dms relationship most studies revealed a positive effect of chl on dms e g a significantly positive correlation coefficient or regression slope gao et al 2017 iverson et al 1989 lana et al 2011 law et al 2017 lizotte et al 2020 tan et al 2017 tortell et al 2011 walker et al 2000 yang 1999 2000 yang and tsunogai 2005 yang et al 2009 2011 zhang et al 2014 while several studies reported a negative relationship froelichd et al 1985 or no relationship at all nemcek et al 2008 watanabe et al 1995 we note that maximum chl concentrations in studies deducing positive chl dms relationships were always much lower than those deducing negative or no relationships for example chl concentrations in a series of studies on chinese seas yang 1999 2000 yang and tsunogai 2005 yang et al 2009 2011 were all lower than 4 μ g l in contrast the chl concentration can reach approximate 60 μ g l in froelichd et al 1985 a recent study examining the chl dms relationship across a broad range of chl concentrations implemented a change point model to capture the ascending and descending limbs of this relationship deng et al 2020 the change point model aims to determine one or more unknown change points at which the stressor response relationship changes in deng et al 2020 the authors used 246 paired observations of chl and dms from 100 chinese lakes and collected 426 paired observations from global oceans they applied a piecewise linear regression model muggeo 2003 to detect thresholds of chl concentration at which chl dms relationships significantly changed benefiting from the novel application of piecewise regression the authors revealed hump shaped chl dms relationships in both lakes and seas which were expected to increase the estimation accuracy of global dms emissions from aquatic ecosystems deng et al 2020 the hump shaped relationship also seemed to resolve the contradiction of the sign of the chl dms relationship in previous studies whose deductions might have been constrained by a relatively smaller sample size a narrow range of sampled chl concentration or an application of a overly simplified linear regression model although many informative studies have investigated the chl dms relationship we note that those studies mainly used mean regression methods e g the ordinary linear regression or piecewise regression by which the relationship between chl and the mean of dms distribution was estimated a practically important alternative to classical mean regression methods is quantile regression qr koenker and bassett 1978 to the best of our knowledge qr has not been used to examine chl dms relationships qr explores the effect of one or more predictors on any quantile of the response variable distribution das et al 2019 koenker and bassett 1978 compared with mean regression methods qr can provide a more complete view of possible causal relationships and can reveal useful predictive relationships at some parts of the response variable distribution even when there is a weak or no predictive relationship between the predictor s and the mean of the response variable distribution cade and noon 2003 in addition qr appears more robust to outliers of the response variable scharf et al 1998 and is not constrained by the equal variance assumption cade and noon 2003 das et al 2019 qr has been successfully applied to environmental and ecological studies qr has been used to 1 illustrate a relatively complete view of stressor response relationships at multiple regression quantiles cade et al 2008 liang et al 2021 muller et al 2018 niinemets and valladares 2006 simkin et al 2016 xu et al 2015 2 obtain reliable prediction intervals of the response variable heiskary and bouchard 2015 kampichler and sierdsema 2018 and 3 reveal the limiting effect of the stressor on the response variable via the upper boundary of the stressor response relationship fornaroli et al 2016 keeley et al 2012 youngflesh et al 2017 the upper boundary of a stressor response relationship illustrates the behavior of response variable when the stressor is the limiting factor cade et al 1999 sankaran et al 2005 because the chl dms relationship represents a stressor response relationship mcdowell et al 2018 qr seems applicable and helpful to enhance the understanding of the chl dms relationship considering the recent finding on the shifting nature of chl dms relationships deng et al 2020 a simple linear qr might not be adequate a qr method with the ability to detect a change point is required but has rarely been explored an exploration of this approach could be found in zhou et al 2015 who proposed a sequential change point detection method for linear qr in this study we propose a novel bayesian change point quantile regression bcpqr approach to investigate the chl dms relationship in aquatic ecosystems the bcpqr model integrates two well developed bayesian models a bayesian change point bcp model barry and hartigan 1993 erdman and emerson 2007 and a bayesian quantile regression bqr model benoit and van den poel 2017 yu and moyeed 2001 both the bcp model beckage et al 2007 liang et al 2019 thomson et al 2010 and the bqr model barneche et al 2016 uranchimeg et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zou and shi 2020 have been recently introduced and applied to develop a stressor response relationship in environmental and ecological fields however to our knowledge this is the first proposal of bcpqr model in environmental and ecological studies there are several features of the bcpqr model that makes it desirable for ecological investigations first the bcpqr model inherits advantages of the bqr model and the bcp model it is expected to be able to provide a complete view on the stressor response relationship muller et al 2018 xu et al 2015 the detection of any change point in the regression intercept slopes and or variance of residuals is possible beckage et al 2007 liang et al 2019 second the bayesian framework would provide the convenience for parameters estimation we can straightforwardly incorporate the change point into the bqr model structure parameter estimation of bcpqr model could then be achieved using markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods qian et al 2003 moreover the parameter estimation framework would allow for the calculation of probability densities representing the uncertainty of parameters including the change point and the other model parameters ellison 2004 gende et al 2011 underwood et al 2017 in addition based on posterior distributions of parameters comparing parameters is straightforward alameddine et al 2011 qian et al 2009 finally prior information if available could be used during model development ellison 1996 2004 our objective was to examine whether or not the bcpqr approach can enhance the understanding of chl dms relationships in lakes and seas we applied the proposed bcpqr model to reevaluate shifting chl dms relationships revealed in deng et al 2020 we separately fitted bcpqr models at five regression quantiles to avoid over confidence in the change point model a common practice is comparing the change point model with a model without any change point cahill et al 2015 liang et al 2019 therefore we also fitted a bqr model at each regression quantile and compared performances of the two models as a means to select the best model for characterizing the chl dms relationship 2 materials and methods 2 1 data source observations of chl dms and ph in lakes were directly obtained from deng et al 2020 in which the authors sampled 246 sites from 100 shallow lakes in china locations of these lakes range from 111 e to 122 e in longitude and from 28 n to 39 n in latitude chl concentrations varied widely ranging from 0 55 μ g l to 58 μ g l with an average of 11 87 μ g l and a standard deviation of 10 95 μ g l the average dms concentration was 175 ng l with a standard deviation of 189 ng l in seas deng et al 2020 complied 426 paired observations of chl and dms from 20 contributors of the global surface seawater dms database https saga pmel noaa gov dms the sampling occurred during 1981 and 2012 according to the contributors table supplementary table 2 in deng et al 2020 we found 25 rather than 20 contributors meeting the data filtering requirements in our analysis all the data from these 25 contributors were included we aggregated data by the sampling year and location longitude and latitude so that yearly site specific averages of chl and dms were used to develop the chl dms relationship in seas the final sample size was 497 rather than the 426 in deng et al 2020 chl concentrations ranged from 0 04 μ g l to 57 71 μ g l with an average of 3 11 μ g l and a standard deviation of 6 11 μ g l the average dms concentration was 378 ng l with a standard deviation of 540 ng l detailed information on the 25 contributors code for data aggregation and the aggregated chl and dms data can be found in the supplementary materials 2 2 model development we fitted separate chl dms relationship for lakes and seas at five regression quantiles 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 we did not explore more extreme regression quantiles e g 0 01 0 05 0 95 or 0 99 because the uncertainty of estimated parameters increases scharf et al 1998 with less data available at the tails of distribution of the response variable for each regression quantile of a certain ecosystem type we first developed a bqr model and a bcpqr model respectively then we compared performances of these two models based on the deviance information criterion dic and selected the model with better performance as our top ranked model consideration of both models is helpful for the development of a more reliable relationship compared to relying on either model independently cahill et al 2015 in the following subsections we introduce the bqr model and the bcpqr model because the estimation of the change point can be straightforwardly incorporated into the modeling framework of the bqr model we did not separately introduce the bcp model for detailed information on the bcp model please refer to beckage et al 2007 or erdman and emerson 2007 2 2 1 bayesian quantile regression a simple linear qr model to estimate the chl dms relationship at a specific regression quantile p 0 p 1 can be expressed by eq 1 1 y i α 0 p α 1 p x i ε i p where y represents the log 10 transformed dms concentration ng l x represents the log 10 transformed chl concentration μ g l and i is the order of observations α 0 p and α 1 p are the regression intercept and slope at the p quantile respectively ε p represents the error the parameter estimation is based on the minimization of weighted sums of absolute deviations koenker and bassett 1978 muller et al 2018 which can be expressed by eq 2 in our case 2 min α 0 α 1 i ρ p ε i p min α 0 α 1 i ρ p y i α 0 p α 1 p x i where ρ p is the loss function and can be expressed by eq 3 for a given value u 3 ρ p u u p i u 0 where i u 0 means the value will be one if u 0 and zero otherwise the bqr was first proposed by yu and moyeed 2001 in which the loss function eq 3 was revealed to be equivalent to the maximization of a likelihood function formed by combining independently distributed asymmetric laplace densities since then asymmetric laplace distribution ald has been widely used for the bqr model alhamzawi 2018 benoit and van den poel 2017 benefiting from the attractive feature of ald the error can be expressed by eq 4 kotz et al 2001 wang et al 2016 zou and shi 2020 4 ε i p 1 2 p p 1 p w i 2 w i δ p p 1 p z i where δ p represents the precision parameter of the ald w is an exponentially distributed random variable with a rate of δ p and z is a random variable with a standard normal distribution it is wroth noting that the two random variables w and z are independent kotz et al 2001 zou and shi 2020 as such according to eqs 1 and 4 the distribution of y can be expressed by eq 5 5 y i n α 0 p α 1 p x i 1 2 p w i p 1 p 2 w i δ p p 1 p then posterior distributions of all the parameters can be deduced by eq 6 6 π α 0 p α 1 p δ p i 1 n n y i α 0 p α 1 p x i 1 2 p w i p 1 p 2 w i δ p p 1 p π α 0 p π α 1 p π w i δ p π δ p where n is the sample size as noted by yu and moyeed 2001 standard conjugate prior distributions might not be available however according to eq 6 mcmc methods can be easily applied to calculate posterior distributions of unknown parameters chernozhukov and hong 2003 kozumi and kobayashi 2011 lee and neocleous 2010 yu and moyeed 2001 for more detailed introductions on the derivation of the bqr model please refer to yu and moyeed 2001 lancaster and jun 2009 or zou and shi 2020 2 2 2 bayesian change point quantile regression the main functions of bcpqr model used in the chl dms relationship development can be expressed by eq 7 and eq 8 7 y i β 0 p β 1 ϕ p i p x i c p p ε i p 8 ϕ p i 1 x i c p p 2 x i c p p where cp p represent the change point of log 10 transformed chl at which the chl dms relationship changes β 1 1 and β 1 2 are regression slopes before and after the change point respectively ϕ p i is the step function controlling the index of regression slope β 0 is the estimated value of log 10 transformed dms at the change point we did not seek to estimate two different regression intercepts but used eq 7 to make sure the continuity of relationship at the change point comparing functions of the bcp model with those of bcpqr model we can find that the major difference is the addition of a change point in the bcpqr model structure benefiting from the flexibility of bayesian framework it is straightforward to incorporate the estimation of a change point into the parameter estimation process of the bqr model specifically we can modify the parameter estimation process for a bayesian linear regression model to that of a bcp model cahill et al 2015 liang et al 2019 following similar steps of eq 2 4 we can easily obtain the distribution expression of y in the bcpqr model eq 9 9 y i n β 0 p β 1 ϕ p i p x i c p p 1 2 p w ϕ p i i p 1 p 2 w ϕ p i i δ ϕ p i p p 1 p accordingly posterior distributions of all

bcpqr model we calculated dic values for each pair of models dic combines a measure of goodness of fit and a measure of model complexity spiegelhalter et al 2002 dic is a reliable criterion and has been widely used for bayesian model selection cahill et al 2015 liang et al 2019 meyer 2016 a smaller dic indicates a better model generally the model with a smaller dic is strongly supported if the difference of dic values between the two moddels is larger than 10 ribatet 2020 2 2 4 parameter comparisons parameter comparison aims to test whether or not a significant difference exists between two estimated parameters for bayesian models posterior distributions of parameters can be conveniently used to calculate the posterior distribution of the difference between two parameters qian et al 2009 in this study to compare the difference of paired parameters we used 3000 samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters of interest and derived the posterior distribution of the difference between the parameters being compared we then calculated the 95 credible interval of the difference and if the 95 credible interval covered zero then we deduced that the two parameters were not significantly different otherwise the two parameters were considered significantly different we used parameter comparisons to examine the equality of regression slopes at multiple regression quantiles classical mean regression methods including piecewise regression should meet the assumption of equal variance cade and noon 2003 conventionally comparing regression slopes of qr models at a range of regression quantiles is an effective tool to test the equal variance assumption das et al 2019 if all the test results were not significant then the equal variance assumption was assured otherwise the assumption was violated and applications of mean regression methods were deemed inappropriate we also compared parameters of bcpqr models for lakes with those for seas at each regression quantile we tested differences of four regression parameters including β 0 β 1 1 β 1 2 and cp in eq 7 in addition to indicating parameter differences the comparison can also reveal differences between relationships in lakes and those in seas if any test result was significant then the model for lakes and that for seas would be considered significantly different based on the results of bcpqr models we can examine whether or not the bcpqr approach can enhance the understanding of chl dms relationships based on previous studies utilizing bayesian analysis cahill et al 2015 yu and moyeed 2001 and examining chl dms relationships deng et al 2020 we expected that the bcpqr model would provide new findings on three aspects of the chl dms relationship specifically the bcpqr model would 1 advance the statistical modeling of chl dms relationships and therefore the inferences that can be made about the ecological implications of this relationship 2 elucidate relationship differences between lakes and seas and 3 identify factors that might mediate the chl dms relationship the modeling of chl dms relationship includes providing a full view of the relationship at multiple regression quantiles reflecting the limiting effect of chl on dms and testing the violation of equal variance assumption specifically based on the results of bcpqr models we expected to be able to show a relatively complete view of chl dms relationships at multiple regression quantiles reflecting responses across much of the dms distribution illustrate the limiting effect of chl on dms using the upper boundary of relationship test the equality of regression slopes at multiple regression quantiles to determine whether or not a mean regression method is adequate to develop a reliable chl dms relationship detect relationships differences between lakes and seas at multiple regression quantiles explore whether or not another variable i e ph influences the limiting effect of chl on dms in lakes all computations were conducted using the r software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 we used the jags software version 4 3 0 plummer 2017 for parameter estimation of all the bqr and bcpqr models we called jags from r using the rjags plummer 2019 and r2jags su and yajima 2020 packages diffuse priors were used for all the parameters we used four chains with random initial values and ran 1 000 000 iterations for each chain the first half of the iterations were used for the burn in process while the second half were used for summarizing the posterior distribution model convergence was evaluated by the gelman rubin convergence statistic r brooks and gelman 1998 and assured by r 1 10 filstrup et al 2017 code for model development and parameters estimation are available in the supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 model selection dic values for each pair of bqr and bcpqr models at each regression quantile in lakes or seas are summarized in table 1 the dic difference was calculated by subtracting the dic value of the bqr model from the dic value of bcpqr model for all model pairs the bcpqr model had a much smaller dic value compared with the bqr model dic differences 47 for all comparisons table 1 according to ribatet 2020 a dic difference larger than 10 indicates that the model with a larger dic value has no support relative to the model with the lowest dic value therefore dic results support the bcpqr model for describing the chl dms relationship at all regression quantiles and in both lakes and seas 3 2 parameter estimation because the bcpqr model was the top ranked model based on dic we only reported parameter estimates for the bcpqr models posterior distributions of the four key parameters are shown in fig 1 because regression slopes were all positive before the change point and post change point slopes were all negative the regression parameter β 0 can be interpreted as the maximum of log 10 dms at the corresponding regression quantile according to eq 7 as noted in fig 1a the parameter β 0 increased with increasing regression quantile which is expected because the observed dms should be greater at higher quantiles from the 0 1 quantile to the 0 9 quantile the posterior mean of β 0 increases from 2 08 to 2 98 for lakes and from 2 16 to 3 26 for seas corresponding to an average increase of dms from 120 ng l to 955 ng l for lakes and from 145 ng l to 1820 ng l for seas as for the estimated change points of log 10 chl cp fig 1b posterior means ranged from 0 656 to 0 828 this corresponds to chl concentrations on the raw scale of 4 53 μ g l and 6 73 μ g l which is a relatively narrow range comparing change points of bcpqr models for lakes and those for seas there are large overlaps in posterior distributions at all the regression quantiles and the posterior means of the change points are very similar except for those at the 0 1 regression quantile posterior means of the slopes before the change point for lakes varied substantially with regression quantile while those for seas were relatively stable fig 1c estimates for lakes are also more uncertain compared to estimates for seas however for the slopes after the change point the opposite is true that is the posterior means of slopes after the change point for lakes were relatively stable while those for seas varied with regression quantile and are more uncertain fig 1d in addition for seas the absolute value of slopes increases before the change point with increasing regression quantile fig 1c and decreases after the change point fig 1d for lakes before the change point the regression slope decreases except at the 0 9 quantile fig 1c after the change point the regression slopes show no apparent pattern fig 1d 4 discussion 4 1 relationships at multiple regression quantiles while a mean regression method e g the piecewise linear regression used in deng et al 2020 focuses on the mean of dms distribution the bcpqr model revealed a more complete view of the chl dms relationships at multiple regression quantiles fig 2 thus allowing for a more thorough understanding of the response of dms to changes in chl across the dms distribution in practice it is difficult to obtain the true upper boundary of the relationship due to the lack of data at the tail ends of the distribution however the model at an upper regression quantile provides a reasonable approximation of the true upper boundary cade et al 1999 therefore if we are interested in the upper boundary of the chl dms relationship which generally represents the limiting effect of chl on dms we can set the regression quantile to be 0 9 top curves in fig 2a b similarly we could explore the relationship at the 0 1 quantile if we want to explore the relationship when dms is mainly limited by factors other than chl furthermore combining prediction results at the 0 1 and 0 9 quantiles results in the 80 prediction interval of the dms distribution if the range of the dms distribution is of interest it is also convenient to conduct uncertainty analysis for regression parameters fig 1 and for predicted dms values shaded regions in fig 2 in addition the results provide a visual comparison of relationship differences at multiple regression quantiles for the relationship in seas dms increases faster before the change point but reduces slower after the change point with increasing regression quantile fig 2b also revealed by the parameter estimation results in fig 1 the chl dms relationship in lakes varies but shows no monotonic trend with the change of regression quantile fig 2a the variations among regression slopes fig 1 and the relationship differences at multiple regression quantiles fig 2 reflect varied responses to chl among different parts of dms distribution these observed differences in chl dms relationships at different quantiles and before and after change points highlights the fact that multiple mechanisms and processes are likely involved in governing chl dms dynamics and that these drivers may differ between seas and lakes currently we do not have specific hypotheses regarding what drivers might be involved however identifying primary drivers and if these drivers vary in importance as a function of chl or dms concentrations represents an area of meaningful future research 4 2 limiting effect of chl on dms the theoretical basis of limiting effect comes from liebigs law of the minimum in which a limiting factor is the one least available among those factors affecting the response variable cade et al 1999 in our analysis the limiting effect is when chl is the limiting factor of dms which can be illustrated by the upper quantile of the chl dms relationship fig 3 in contrast piecewise linear regression results solid lines in fig 3 cannot quantify such a limiting effect cade et al 1999 following common practice of qr joseph et al 2016 keeley et al 2012 mönkkönen et al 2017 we employed the relationship deduced by the bcpqr model at the 0 9 regression quantile as the upper boundary of chl dms relationship to reflect the limiting effect of chl on dms we back transformed log 10 chl and log 10 dms to their raw scales fig 3 on the raw scales the difference between the upper boundary of chl dms relationship in lakes and that in seas is apparent the upper boundary in seas is much greater than that in lakes in addition before the change point dms increases more sharply with an increase in chl in seas when compared to that in lakes both upper boundaries are right skewed which means with the increase of chl dms increases faster before the change point and then decreases slower after the change point 4 3 equality of regression slopes the examination of equality of regression slopes can determine whether or not a mean regression method violates the equal variance assumption das et al 2019 parameter differences of paired slopes are shown in fig 4 for slope differences of bcpqr models in seas 95 credible intervals of several paired slopes e g 0 5 0 1 in fig 4a and 0 9 0 1 in fig 4b do not cover zero indicating significant differences therefore the equal variance assumption is violated that is mean regression methods are not appropriate for developing the chl dms relationship in seas although some mean regression methods could be used to deduce some quantiles of the dms distribution borsuk et al 2002 it can be problematic when trying to predict some quantiles of dms distribution using a mean regression method because of the violation of the equal variance assumption cade and noon 2003 das et al 2019 for the lake model there were no significant differences between paired slopes fig 4 however the sample size is relatively small and uncertainties of regression slopes were large fig 1c d which contributed to the insignificance of parameter differences before additional data are included to further confirm results of parameter differences piecewise linear regression methods might be used with caution for the development of chl dms relationship in lakes while the piecewise linear regression method might not be appropriate for the development of chl dms relationship in seas the bcpqr model is not constrained by the equal variance assumption cade and noon 2003 and thereby can be used as a reliable and robust tool for dms prediction because the median regression is a robust alternative to ordinary linear regression koenker and hallock 2001 the bcpqr model at the 0 5 regression quantile can act as an effective alternative to the piecewise linear regression in addition because of the violation of equal variance assumption the piecewise linear regression should not be used to deduce predicted quantiles of the dms distribution das et al 2019 whereas reliable intervals of predicted dms distributions are possible using the bcpqr model heiskary and bouchard 2015 kampichler and sierdsema 2018 4 4 relationship differences between lakes and seas we compared the chl dms relationships in lakes to those in seas by comparing the parameters of the bcpqr models at multiple regression quantiles fig 5 the parameter comparisons provide statistical evidence that the chl dms relationship does in fact differ between lakes and seas considering that β 0 in the bcpqr model represents a log 10 transformed dms concentration eq 7 fig 1a when calculating the difference we retransformed β 0 to the raw unit of dms ng l fig 5a with increasing regression quantile the difference of maximum dms increases specifically at the 0 7 and 0 9 quantiles posterior means of the differences are more than 500 ng l dms concentratons in seas are higher than in lakes which are large considering the average dms concentrations for lakes and seas are only 175 ng l and 378 ng l respectively we also retransformed the cp parameter into the raw units of chl concentration μ g l to calculate differences between change points for the lake and seas models fig 5b we found no significant differences particularly posterior means of differences were close to zero ranging from 1 78 μ g l to 0 59 μ g l also for each ecosystem type tests on paired cp values showed no significant differences for all combinations of regression quantiles fig s2 these results indicate that the change point of chl at which the chl dms relationship changes is consistent at multiple regression quantiles and for different ecosystem types while deng et al 2020 revealed that change points were very close for lakes and seas using the piecewise linear regression method we confirmed this conclusions at multiple regression quantiles based on results from the bcpqr models it is worth emphasizing as previously mentioned that despite the relatively consistent location of chl change points corresponding dms concentrations are substantially different at some regression quantiles fig 5a before the change point regression slopes of bcpqr models for lakes are significantly larger than those for seas except for those at the 0 7 regression quantile fig 5c while deng et al 2020 found that the slope before the change point for lakes were almost twice as large as the value for seas 1 22 and 0 62 respectively our results show that the ratio is not as simple as two at varied quantiles according to the results of bcpqr models fig 1c the ratio would be 4 3 2 7 2 4 2 0 and 2 8 for the five regression quantiles from 0 1 to 0 9 respectively as for regression slopes after the change point the only significant difference was at the 0 1 regression quantile fig 5d considering significant differences of some regression parameters between models for lakes and those for seas we conclude that the chl dms relationship in lakes and that in seas are different at each regression quantile despite the consistency of chl change points obviously the piecewise linear regression method cannot reveal the consistency of chl change points for lakes and seas and cannot examine parameter and relationship differences at multiple regression quantiles the chl dms relationship differences between lakes and seas indicates that some drivers or processes controlling the emission of dms are likely to be different in lakes and seas deng et al 2020 revealed the effect of ph on the chl dms relationship in lakes and also extended the finding to seas however based on our results currently transferring any potential mechanisms controlling dms in either lake or sea ecosystems into the other ecosystem may be misleading a possible explanation for the ecosystem dependent relationship might be the difference in salinity between lakes and seas with dms emission likely increasing with increasing salinity concentrations gibson et al 1991 taalba et al 2013 concentrations that promote the production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate major precursor for dms curson et al 2017 importantly however additonal efforts are needed to explore drivers and processes leading to the relationship differences between lakes and seas 4 5 impact of ph on chl dms relationship the ph was emphasized to be the key factor impacting the chl dms relationship in deng et al 2020 specifically the emission of dms would increase with increasing chl when ph 8 1 and would decease when ph 8 1 deng et al 2020 we reevaluated the effect of ph on the limiting effect of chl on dms we first defined a term emission potential to represent the difference between the maximum emission when dms was solely limited by chl and observed dms emission the emission potential can be calculated by the predicted upper boundary minus observed dms values next assuming that ph is the key factor impacting dms emission ph should explain a large proportion of variation of emission potential specifically since the ph threshold value favoring dms emission is 8 1 the emission potential of dms should decrease with increasing ph when ph 8 1 and should increase with additional increases in ph when ph 8 1 that is the observed dms should become closer to the upper boundary and the emission potential should become smaller when ph approaches 8 1 to examine whether or not the above assumption was reasonable we used the predicted dms emissions deduced from the bcpqr model for lakes at the 0 9 regression quantile minus the observed dms concentrations to reflect the emission potential of dms fig 6 surprisingly we found that ph does not explain significant variation in the dms emission potential the assumption that ph is a key factor impacting the chl dms relationship is not supported by our results although there is a significant change point of ph in the ph dms relationship refer to fig 1c in deng et al 2020 considering the obvious positive ph chl correlation refer to fig 1d in deng et al 2020 and that chl can be a causal variable impacting both ph and dms charlson et al 1987 nakano and watanabe 2005 the causal effect of ph on the chl dms relationship change point is likely a result of a statistical correlation resulting from a shared environmental driver i e chl drives dms and ph however it is hard to distinguish the causal effect from correlation using a mean regression method by contrast the bcpqr model is a useful tool for such an analysis by introducing the emission potential and linking it to the possible driver note that the calculation of emission potential relies on the upper boundary deduced from the bcpqr model 4 6 implications for understanding chl dms relationships in this study we proposed a novel bcpqr model to quantify the chl dms relationship in aquatic ecosystems here we summarize how the bcpqr approach enhanced the understanding of shifting chl dms relationships by comparing it with the application of piecewise regression method bcpqr models provided a relatively complete view of shifting chl dms relationships at multiple regression quantiles rather than only focusing on the mean of the dms distribution as done with piecewise linear regression the upper boundary of the relationship was quantified by the bcpqr model at the 0 9 regression quantile while the piecewise regression cannot show such an effect we revealed that the equal variance assumption was violated when applying piecewise linear regression in seas while the bcpqr model could be employed to predict different parts e g the median or an interval of the dms distribution without being constrained by this assumption we found consistency in change points of the chl dms relationships for lakes and seas however chl dms relationships in lakes and seas were substantially different at all regression quantiles as such we caution against transferring results and inferences from one ecoystem type to another according to the upper boundary of chl dms relationship we introduced and calculated the emission potential of dms using this metric we showed that ph was not likely to be the key factor impacting the chl dms relationship in lakes while piecewise linear regression cannot distinguish causality from correlation the application of bcpqr model might be helpful for causality detection 4 7 generalizations of the proposed approach in practice shifting stressor response relationsships e g the hump shaped stressor response relationship or other shapes of stressor response relationship with a change point e g the sign remains the same but the magnitude of regression slope changes are not rare in ecology keeley et al 2012 liang et al 2019 wagner and midway 2014 most commonly mean regression methods such as the piecewise regression have been applied to detect the change point and develop the shifting stressor response relationship massicotte et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in this study we made a step forward in modeling shifting stressor response relationships in environmental and ecological research we have demonstrated that the bcpqr model is an effective tool to understand a shifting stressor response relationship by identifying the change point providing a complete view on the relationship across the distribution of the response variable examining significance of parameter differences making robust predictions and conducting uncertainty analysis moreover benefiting from the flexibility of bayesian framework the bcpqr model can be easily modified which will allow for it to be broadly applied in ecological investigations potential modifications to the bcpqr model to address other ecological questions include detecting change points over time time could be added as the predictor to estimate a temporal change point similar to what cahill et al 2015 did for a bcp model multivariate regression adding other predictor variables and modeling change points is straightforward under a bayesian framework liang et al 2019 detecting multiple change points the model can be modified to accommodate multiple change points which has been done using other modeling approaches beaulieu et al 2009 jochner and menzel 2015 binary or discrete response variables the chl dms relationship is a continuous response case in environmental and ecological studies the response variable is often binary or discrete e g count data wagner and midway 2014 since the bqr model can accommodate binary or discrete response variables benoit and van den poel 2017 lee and neocleous 2010 the bcpqr model can as well hierarchical modeling the hierarchical structure of regression parameters e g regression slopes before and after the change point can be incorporated into the modeling as in a hierarchical bcp model authier et al 2011 thomson et al 2010 therefore the proposed bcpqr model is expected to have great potential for generalizing to other ecological questions which will help to better understand shifting stressor response relationships in environmental and ecological studies note that several other qr methods such as polynomial regression fornaroli et al 2016 youngflesh et al 2017 spline smoothing keeley et al 2012 quantile regression forest kampichler and sierdsema 2018 veronesi and schillaci 2019 and quantile regression neural networks cannon 2011 can be used to fit a nonlinear stressor response relationship and thereby might be applicable to the development of a shifting chl dms relationship compared with these methods the bcpqr model is parameterized to have fewer parameters which can effectively avoid over fitting the novelty of our research is due to two primary factors the proposal of the novel bcpqr model and the enhanced understanding of chl dms relationships in this study for the first time we integrated the bcp model and the bqr model to reveal shifting stressor response relationships at multiple regression quantiles the proposal of the novel approach thereby contributes to the research field of environmental and ecological modeling we applied our novel model to reevaluate published chl dms relationships in aquatic ecosystems by which we found several meaningful and insightful findings regarding the chl dms relationship insight that would not be possible using a traditional piecewise linear regression approach the insight derived from the proposed approach may also help improve overall estimates of dms emission from aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusions integrating the bcp model and the bqr model we proposed a novel bcpqr model that was able to detect a change point in the qr we employed the proposed approach to investigate the chl dms relationship in aquatic ecosystems we revealed new findings in the chl dms relationship modeling relationship differences between lakes and seas and factors impacting the chl dms relationship we thereby concluded that the bcpqr model could indeed enhance the understanding of shifting chl dms relationship we believe that the bcpqr approach can be generalized to other cases where shifting stressor response relationships are observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16833,biofouling causing an increase in plastic density and sinking is one of the hypotheses to account for the unexpectedly low amount of buoyant plastic debris encountered at the ocean surface field surveys show that polyethylene and polypropylene the two most abundant buoyant plastics both occur below the surface and in sediments and experimental studies confirm that biofouling can cause both of these plastics to sink however studies quantifying the actual density of fouled plastics are rare despite the fact that density will determine the transport and eventual fate of plastic in the ocean here we investigated the role of microbial biofilms in sinking of polyethylene microplastic and quantified the density changes natural biofouling communities cause in the coastal waters of the north sea molecular data confirmed the variety of bacteria and eukaryotes including animals and other multicellular organisms colonizing the plastic over time fouling communities increased the density of plastic and caused sinking and the plastic remained negatively buoyant even during the winter with lower growth rates relative surface area alone however did not predict whether a plastic piece sank due to patchy colonization fragmentation of sinking pieces may result in smaller pieces regaining buoyancy and returning to the surface our results suggest that primarily multicellular organisms cause sinking of plastic pieces with surface area to volume ratios sa v below 100 generally pieces above a couple hundred micrometers in size and that this is a tipping point at which microbial biofilms become the key players causing sinking of smaller pieces with higher sa v ratios including most fibers that are too small for larger multicellular organisms to colonize graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastisphere biofouling density changes plastic debris 1 introduction the observation that we can only account for a small percentage of the plastic waste that budget estimates predict has ended up in the ocean lebreton et al 2019 has led to hypotheses about the fate of this missing plastic many polymers are denser than seawater and will sink but the two most produced plastic polymers are less dense than seawater so they should float polyethylene pe with a density of 0 91 to 0 965 g cm 3 and polypropylene pp with a density of 0 90 g cm 3 andrady 2017 potential losses of the buoyant plastic include 1 fragmentation into pieces small enough to pass through the nets that have been used in most surveys generally 333 500 µm mesh 2 biofouling increasing the density so that plastic sinks below the surface kooi et al 2017 ye and andrady 1991 3 wind mixing kukulka et al 2012 reisser et al 2015 and 4 ingestion and egestion of plastic as fecal pellets cole et al 2016 the first two hypotheses of fragmentation and biofouling are related in that smaller particles have a higher surface area to volume ratio sa v so colonization by organisms denser than seawater will have more of an effect on smaller particles biofouling leading to sinking of otherwise buoyant low density polyethylene ldpe was first reported over 45 years ago holmström 1975 and described ldpe sheets covered with calcareous bryozoa and algae that were recovered from fishing trawls in water up to 400 m deep since then there have been multiple reports of plastics that should be buoyant occurring below the surface or at the bottom bergmann et al 2017 gomiero et al 2019 peng et al 2017 the change in plastic density due to fouling was first quantified by ye and andrady 1991 who reported that the pe and pp materials they tested in the subtropical waters of biscayne bay usa became denser than seawater reaching a specific gravity of 1 03 to 1 14 after 7 9 weeks since then a number of authors have studied the role biofouling plays in altering the buoyancy of plastic in both marine and fresh waters but most have only described whether the plastic sinks chen et al 2019 fazey and ryan 2016 or measured sinking rates kaiser et al 2017 miao et al 2021 other than ye and andrady s gravimetric measurements there are very few data available regarding the actual density of fouled plastic but density measurements are critical to determining the transport of plastic in aquatic systems the sinking rate of particles depends on density size and shape kowalski et al 2016 but the density of a piece of plastic marine debris pmd determines where it ultimately ends up whether at the surface on the bottom or suspended at a level of equal density in the water column kooi et al 2017 the fouling community is diverse and includes organisms from unicellular bacteria and diatoms to animals such as barnacles ye and andrady 1991 described but did not quantify the initial formation of a transparent slimy biofilm on the surface after a couple of days rummel et al 2017 suggested that studying how biofilms influence vertical transport of microplastic should be a research priority to understand the fate and effects of microplastic in aquatic environments the formation of a microbial biofilm on plastic the so called plastisphere zettler et al 2013 alters the physical chemical and biological characteristics of plastic in aquatic environments and wright et al 2020 point out that the plastisphere forms the interface and thus drives interactions between the plastic and the environment in this study our goal was to quantify how biofouling by microbial biofilms alone as well as by natural fouling communities including multicellular algae and metazoans affects the density of pe pieces in a coastal environment our hypotheses were 1 the sa v of a piece of plastic would determine when and if a piece of plastic sinks and 2 during early spring bloom conditions rapid growth by attached microbes such as diatoms could increase the density of microplastic particles enough to cause them to sink resulting in seasonal pulses of microplastic from surface waters to the benthos 2 materials and methods 2 1 polymer properties there are many formulations of pe with varying additives crystallinity and surface texture among other characteristics in this study we used defined pe polymers of uniform composition provided by the american chemistry council acc three formulations of pe table s1 of 6 different thicknesses 0 025 0 051 0 076 0 102 0 152 and 0 203 mm were sterilized by immersing in 70 ethanol for 10 min then rinsing in 0 2 µm sterile filtered laboratory grade distilled deionized water before being used for experiments the different thicknesses provided a range of sa v ratios ranging from 10 to 80 using 5 5 mm pieces 2 2 microbial biofilms we tested 25 individual unialgal cultures to determine whether they would attach to plastic and could cause sinking of the plastic films table s2 note that our cultures were not axenic so the density changes we report are for a biofilm consisting of a single photosynthetic alga as well as any associated bacteria cultures were grown in f 2 medium silicate guillard and ryther 1962 made with sterilized wadden sea water approximately 1 ml of culture was inoculated into a 125 ml flask containing 50 ml of f 2 and 6 10 squares of polymer that had been sterilized by immersion in 70 ethanol for 10 min then rinsed in sterile laboratory grade water for each polymer and thickness 3 replicate flasks were incubated on an orbital shaker 60 rpm at 20 c 16 8 hour light dark cycle at an illumination of 50 µmol m 2 s 1 control flasks were included for each polymer and thickness containing f 2 culture medium and plastic but no microalgae flasks were checked starting during the lag phase through exponential growth and into senescence daily for the first week then twice a week for at least 6 weeks at each time point each culture flask was examined to determine whether plastic had visible biofilms had sunk below the surface film or had sunk to the bottom of the flask as soon as any piece of plastic was observed below the surface it was tested in a density column cultures to check the density of diatom biofilms alone without plastic were grown under the same culture conditions as the flasks above but in flat polystyrene tissue culture flasks one week after the cultures were inoculated and had formed a visible biofilm on the bottom of the flask a cell scraper was used to remove the biofilm ten milliliters of this slurry were transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged gently 1000 rpm for 2 min in a clinical centrifuge with a swing out rotor a wide bore pipet was used to gently transfer a portion of the biofilm pellet from the bottom of the tube to central portion of the surface of a thawed nycodenz density gradient see section 2 4 below 2 3 natural biofilms individual plastic strips 5

bag of fiberglass window screening mesh opening 1 0 1 7 mm to keep them from escaping and to protect them from macro grazers we wanted to monitor the development of the biofilm and fouling community without it being removed by fish crabs sea stars etc in this shallow productive system the plastic pieces in the mesh bag were immersed in seawater at the nioz jetty n 53 002 4 789 e in the wadden sea a shallow tidal inlet of the north sea fig 1 a by attaching it with stainless steel clips to a vertical anchor line secured at the top to a platform over the water and at the bottom to a steel weight resting on the sea floor this kept the samples approximately 1 5 m off the bottom and 0 5 2 m below the surface tidal range 1 5 m samples were deployed in may 2019 and sampled at 14 28 42 56 152 259 and 335 days at each sampling the mesh bags were placed in a clean bucket of whole seawater from the site and taken to the laboratory in the lab 0 5 cm was cut from the bottom of each strip with sterile scissors and rinsed gently in 0 2 µm filtered seawater from the site to remove non attached organisms at each sampling the remaining experimental plastic strips were transferred to a clean mesh bag to reduce external fouling kept continuously immersed in seawater and re submerged at the jetty anchoring system within 30 min after removing any large invertebrates bivalves tunicates that had settled as larvae back in the lab the 0 5 5 cm strip was cut into sections approximately 5 5 mm with sterile scissors and some pieces were used to determine density immediately see below other pieces were preserved for dna analyses in gentra puregene tissue cell lysis solution qiagen benelux b v venlo the netherlands and frozen at 20 c for scanning electron microscopy sem plastic was fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde at 5 c for 2 18 h then transferred to a 50 50 solution of phosphate buffered saline pbs and ethanol and stored at 20 c 2 4 density to determine density we used gradients produced

temperature nycodenz solutions self form a density gradient murayama et al 2001 we were particularly interested in quantifying densities when plastic started to sink in seawater so we chose a 20 nycodenz solution to produce a gradient that ranged from approximately 1 0068 1 3523 g cm 3 and that is linear between 1 02 g cm 3 approximate density of seawater and 1 15 g cm 3 because we were determining the density of live biofilms we dissolved the nycodenz in 1 x pbs phosphate buffered saline solution we froze 40 ml of the 20 nycodenz solution in 50 ml centrifuge tubes removing the number needed the morning of a sampling date and allowing it to thaw slowly at laboratory temperature 20 c without being disturbed once the nycodenz thawed and came to room temperature we gently added our sample plastic or diatom biofilm to the surface along with a mix of three color coded density standard beads from cospheric www cospheric com green 1 02 g cm 3 blue 1 13 g cm 3 and red 1 20 g cm 3 plastic samples were added in the center of the tube and a small drop of density beads were added around the edges to avoid the beads interfering with the biofilms tubes were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min in a temperature controlled centrifuge with swing out rotors at 20 c after centrifugation the distance from the surface of the nycodenz to the center of each sample and to each band of beads was measured to the nearest mm linear regression of the depth vs density of the standard beads provided a calibration curve for each tube that was used to calculate the density of cultures and plastic samples with biofilms between 1 02 and 1 20 g cm 3 outside of this range the slope of the nycodenz density gradient changes so for plastic pieces that settled outside of our density bead range

salinity and temperature over the course of the experiment are shown in fig 1b along with sampling dates additional environmental parameters for each sampling date are shown in table s3 our experiment was designed to capture the spring bloom as water temperatures rose and then continued sampling at lower frequency throughout an annual cycle temperature and salinity vary considerably in this intertidal coastal area with significant freshwater input 3 2 density change due to microbial biofilms alone the sa v ratio of the six thicknesses of plastic we used ranged from about 10 to 80 fig 2 we used pieces approximately 5 5 mm to simplify handling and to conform to the generally accepted definition of microplastic but note that the sa v ratio is determined mostly by the thickness of the piece of plastic rather than the other dimensions unialgal cultures including dinoflagellates cyanobacteria and diatoms attached readily to the surface of hdpe ldpe and lldpe pieces of all thicknesses fig s1a b in all of our tests we observed only seven individual pieces of plastic that sank due to colonization by unialgal cultures alone one with diatom wh23 and two each with cyanobacterium phormidium sp cyanobacterium spirulina sp and dinoflagellate prorocentrum lima six of these were pieces with high sa v ratios of 80 and one with sa v ratio of 40 in all cases this occurred during late exponential or stationary phase and was due to large clumps of cells extending beyond the plastic surface e g fig s1a b these were fragile enough that they usually broke off during the centrifugation in the density gradients and the plastic became buoyant again in our experiments microbes attached to the actual surface of the plastic did not generally provide sufficient ballasting to cause plastic to sink the pieces of plastic were initially quite hydrophobic and floated at or on the surface film of the seawater all cultures attached to plastic and appeared to decrease the hydrophobicity of the plastic within a week allowing even the thickest 0 203 mm pieces to slip below the surface film fig s1c plastic strips in the control flasks without microalgae or bacteria remained on the surface film throughout the experiment of the cultured microbes that caused our 5 5 mm pieces of plastic to sink diatoms attached most consistently to the plastic surfaces and formed robust biofilms based on this and because diatoms have relatively dense silicon dioxide frustules shells and are some of the most commonly reported early colonizers we also determined the density of biofilms formed by three diatoms isolated from surfaces in coastal waters for calculating whether microbes alone might be able to cause sinking of plastic with even higher sa v isolate names source and density are shown in table 1 3 3 density change due to natural fouling communities in the wadden sea the attached communities that developed on plastic during the in situ colonization experiment caused two of the pieces with the highest sa v ratio to move down in the density gradient after just 2 weeks table s5 but none exceeded the density of seawater until week 4 fig 3 as soon as pieces started moving down in the density gradients we knew their density was increasing however because our first density calibration bead was 1 02 g cm 3 we could not quantify the exact density until a piece exceeded that value and became denser than seawater these pieces that were increasing in density but would still float in seawater are plotted ordinally without a scale between 1 01 g cm 3 floating on top of the density column and 1 02 g cm 3 in fig 3 likewise samples with densities above our densest standard of 1 20 g cm 3 are plotted without a scale above 1 20 g cm 3 generally speaking pieces with equal fouling coverage that had higher sa v increased in density more quickly fig s2 but the patchy distribution of fouling often obscured this pattern fig s3 by week 6 the average density of all three polymers was greater than seawater but even after that there were generally a minority of pieces at each sampling that were buoyant fig 3 and table s5 hdpe is the densest polymer of this group and it remained densest for the first 28 days but after that there was no clear pattern in density differences among the three polymers note that at the final time point 7 all but five plastic strips had been lost due to a storm including all hdpe so only ldpe and lldpe are shown 3 4 community composition after two weeks plastic strips were coated with a thin slimy biofilm with occasional worm tubes and small colonies of bryozoa as time went on bryozoan colonies continued to spread and visual and sem surveys fig 4 demonstrated a wide spectrum of other invertebrates colonizing the plastic surface including bivalves echinoderms colonial hydroids barnacles tunicates and worms amplicon sequencing of dna extracted from the plastic samples revealed the complex communities that developed on the plastic and how they changed over time fig 5 for eukaryotes at week 2 t1 ciliates echinoderms annelids and bryozoa had colonized the plastic with some variation depending on the polymer but by week 4 t2 bryozoa became the dominant organisms on all substrates in this system bacterial communities were dominated by proteobacteria and bacteroidota throughout the experiment with some changes over time among the less dominant groups including increases in firmicutes and planctomycetota photosynthetic cyanobacteria were present at all time points but seldom made up more than 5 of the population 4 discussion 4 1 density changes due to microbial biofilms a number of studies have documented increases in weight and sinking due to biofilm development and biofouling reviewed in onda and sharief 2021 but far fewer quantify density changes the impact of microbial biofilms compared to macroalgae and invertebrates is also not clear despite the often stated opinion that microbial biofilms increase weight of plastic and cause sinking in some cases biofilms may even cause the density of plastic particles to decrease miao et al 2021 measured densities of microbial cells and biofilms reported in the literature are few and vary widely van ierland and peperzak 1983 used density gradient centrifugation to measure the density of nine diatom species in natural marine plankton samples from the north sea ranging from 1 03 to 1 23 g cm 3 in a theoretical study kooi et al 2017 used a median biofilm density of 1 38 g cm 3 this was calculated from estimated wet weight and volumes reported by fisher et al 1983 but these yield density estimates from 0 53 to 4 35 g cm 3 so they are not very realistic the density of granite stone is only 2 75 g cm 3 van melkebeke et al 2020 used more realistic values of 1 1 0 1 g cm 3 but these were based on calculations not measurements we measured the density of biofilms created by three types of diatoms that were isolated from pe and other surfaces in marine systems and found these ranged from 1 15 to 1 18 g cm 3 table 1 diatoms are consistently reported as early and dominant colonizers of pmd bravo et al 2011 carson et al 2013 eich et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 and the silicon dioxide frustule density 2 6 g cm 3 of these protists can make them substantially denser than seawater consequently diatoms might be expected to contribute to sinking of pmd however our laboratory experiments with diatoms and other attached phytoplankton showed that although they appear to decrease the hydrophobicity and cause plastic to sink below the surface film fig s1c microbial biofilms consisting of unialgal cultures along with associated bacteria eps and adhered particles alone rarely caused sinking of microplastic some of those that did sink had relatively loosely attached clumps of cells so despite the fact that they sank in our experimental containers that were oscillated to simulate movement at sea in the density column many of the clumps of cells detached and the polymer became buoyant again sinking due to microbial biofilms alone may be more prevalent in freshwaters with a density around 1 g cm 3 chen et al 2019 wright et al 2020 mention the lack of experimental measurements of the impact of microbial biofilms on plastic density they also calculated the thickness of biofilms of various densities 1 1 1 5 g cm 3 necessary to make pp and pe spheres of different diameters sink our experimental results support their model prediction that microbial biofilms 10 µm thick with a density of 1 1 g cm 3 could cause pe spheres smaller than 100 µm in diameter to sink our wh23 cells isolated from pe in woods hole usa measure 12 5 4 5 3 µm l x w x h with a density 1 17 g cm 3 a biofilm layer 10 µm thick would accommodate three layers of these 3 µm thick diatoms and if they covered 100 of a 100 µm pe sphere the combined density of the pe and diatoms would be 1 035 g cm 3 denser than seawater while theoretically possible 100 coverage of a plastic piece by a three cell thick biofilm of diatoms is unlikely also a 100 µm sphere has a sa v ratio of 60 and in our experiments films with a higher sa v of 80 did not sink even when heavily coated with a diatom biofilm so as other authors have mentioned shape is important as well as density however diatoms can almost cover a piece of plastic recently immersed in seawater fig s4 so calculations using a slightly more realistic scenario of a layer of diatoms one cell thick covering 100 of the surface suggest diatoms could cause the sinking of a pe sphere of 40 µm diameter with a sa v ratio of 150 at this scale it starts to beg the question of whether the particle is plastic covered with microbes or a microbial tep aggregate with included plastic pieces under some bloom conditions diatoms can cover almost 100 of the plastic surface fig s4 but field data suggest coverage is almost never this high dussud et al 2018 our own observations based on sem imaging of the biofilms on hundreds of pieces of plastic collected in the pacific and atlantic amaral zettler et al 2015 as well as in the mediterranean amaral zettler et al 2021 also show that natural biofilms on plastic seldom cover more than 50 of the surface of a piece of plastic however they are often greater than 1 cell thick and include dead cells and diatom frustules that can extend the microbial biofilm up to a thickness of 50 µm these results based on actual measured values for biofilm density coverage and thickness suggest that microbial biofilms alone can cause plastic to sink but generally only on items with sa v ratios above 100 such as thin films and fragments and filaments with diameters less than 50 µm for larger fragments the most important role of microbial biofilms causing plastic to sink may be by decreasing hydrophobicity and providing chemical cues that encourage the settlement and facilitate adhesion of invertebrates zardus et al 2008 we observed that pieces originally floating on top of the surface film eventually sank below the surface even though they were still buoyant fig s1c lobelle and cunliffe 2011 noted that this behavior correlated with quantitative decreases in hydrophobicity of pe food bags this may be the first stage of sinking because it increases the surface area available for settlement of additional organisms bravo et al 2011 many of the taxa encountered on beached debris by winston et al 1997 are calcifying and these can increase the density of plastic quickly 4 2 surface area to volume considerations ryan 2015 pointed out the importance of sa v ratios of different shapes and observed fewer thin items further from shore in the south atlantic subsequently fazey and ryan 2016 used hdpe and ldpe sheets of thicknesses ranging from 0 1 to 4 mm to show in field experiments that smaller pieces down to 5 mm and pieces with higher sa v ratio sink faster when colonized they quantified coverage by macro colonizers and concluded that biofouling may account for a substantial portion of the missing surface plastic we confirmed their finding that for a given size and shape pieces with high sa v ratios generally sink sooner figs s2 s3 van melkebeke et al 2020 also provided analyses of sinking rates and calculations showing that films are far more likely than other shapes of plastic to develop a biofilm sufficient to cause sinking of buoyant plastics based on this we concentrated on thin films as the items most likely to sink quickly due to biofouling for films the thickness dominates their sa v fig 2 while the length and width determine the sa and therefore who can colonize a given piece for example a piece of film that is 0 1 mm thick and 2 2 mm has a sa v ratio of 22 while a piece of the same film that is 200 200 mm has a sa v ratio of 20 02 this 10 difference in sa v is minor relative to the 10 000 x difference in the sa of those same pieces 8 8 mm2 vs 80 080 mm2 and this huge difference will influence what and how many organisms can colonize the plastic the much larger piece has a marginally lower sa v but it is more likely to develop a fouling community of invertebrates and other multicellular organisms that will make it sink this also means that depending on shape macroplastic films many cm in size have higher sa v ratios than microplastic fragments and are more likely to sink 4 3 density changes due to mixed biofilms of microbes and metazoans in our field experiments the fouling community caused the density of plastic to increase rapidly during the spring bloom and by week 6 most pieces of plastic were sinking as the average density for all three polymers was greater than that of seawater fig 3 the timing and average densities during our experiment are very similar to those reported in the pioneering work by ye and andrady 1991 but in their case the early colonization leading to sinking was dominated by algae while ours was due primarily to bryozoa figs 4 5 several factors affect our results including constraining the plastic strips in a mesh bag as opposed to experimentally tethered or naturally free floating plastic we did this to contain the plastic in this high energy tidal environment with significant wind exposure as well as to exclude macro grazers to keep them from resetting our biofilms the mesh bags undoubtedly change the hydrodynamics and access to the plastic surface by settling propagules the colonization by microbes should not have been strongly affected and in addition to bryozoans we saw bivalves tunicates echinoderms and crustaceans settling on the plastic however we saw very little macroalgae though these have been primary colonizers in other studies mentioned above and our setup in mesh bags as in all experiments undoubtedly exerted some filtering influence on the resulting communities our molecular results fig 5 provided more details on other taxa including microbes that colonized the plastic after two weeks the plastic visually appeared mostly bare but already had a diverse community of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes by four weeks small colonies of bryozoa were already visible and molecular results confirmed they were the dominant colonizer but that other animal groups including annelids arthropods and echinoderms had also started to settle along with numerous bacteria and protists including ciliates fig 5a b the plastisphere community is dynamic and changes seasonally and geographically amaral zettler et al 2020 photosynthetic cyanobacteria were present at all time points fig 5b but the communities at this location during the almost yearlong experiment were dominated by heterotrophs diatoms and other phototrophic protists were present but seldom seen in the sem images and contributed only a small proportion of the sequences analyzed so they were below the cut off of 100 occurrences across all samples we chose for plotting the primary colonizers at different times and in different locations will almost certainly vary but it appears that at least in most coastal areas there are macro organisms that will colonize plastic and cause it to sink including algae ye and andrady 1991 bivalves kaiser et al 2017 and bryozoa this study how commonly fouling causes the sinking of plastic in the oligotrophic open ocean is unknown but the most common taxa reported from pelagic pmd generally include a number of calcifying organisms including barnacles bryozoa and shelled mollusks goldstein et al 2014 gregory 2009 kiessling et al 2015 our samples were held at constant depth and protected from macro grazers by a mesh bag so we did not observe defouling and resurfacing of submerged samples as proposed by ye and andrady 1991 at our experimental site we saw very little algal growth so lack of light as they sank would not affect our pieces as much the primary causes of the density increase in our experiment was encrustation by carbonate producing bryozoa and their ballasting shells would not necessarily be removed even if they are grazed or die as the plastic sinks in our experiment once it became denser than seawater the plastic remained negatively buoyant throughout the year including during winter when growth rates are lower we have also commonly observed in sem images that the lower frustule of diatoms remains attached to plastic after the diatom is grazed so these would continue to ballast the plastic in addition winston et al 1997 in their survey of encrusting organisms on plastic found that some were found only on buoyant plastic some were found only on non buoyant plastic but most were found on both buoyant and non buoyant plastic so sinking alone will not always lead to loss of the ballasting organisms cozar et al 2014 suggested that in the deep sea carbonate ballast may dissolve at depth due to increasing acidity below the ccd but this mechanism does not exist in coastal waters and at least some calcium carbonate encrusting organisms persist when buoyant plastic such as pe sinks gundogdu et al 2017 in shallow freshwaters loading of the biofilm with mineral particles caused the sinking of experimental plastic pieces chen et al 2019 and this may also play a role in shallow turbid coastal marine environments such as the wadden sea kooi et al 2017 predicted vertical oscillations based on photosynthetic algae alone but the plastisphere has many heterotrophs and animals that are not immediately impacted by the loss of light at night or as they sink into the twilight zone in fact if the phototrophs start dying this could lead to an increase in heterotrophs that can utilize the pom and dom released from the dying cells as pointed out by gerritse et al 2020 several studies have remarked on the paucity of floating plastic particles smaller than 1 mm cozar et al 2014 eriksen et al 2014 kooi et al 2017 supporting the hypothesis that smaller particles with higher sa v ratio may be removed more rapidly due to ballasting while in general this is true fig s2 during our experiment smaller sections cut from larger pieces that sank sometimes became buoyant again those plotted below dotted line in fig 3 ye and andrady 1991 mentioned the non uniformity of fouling as did fazey and ryan 2016 and in our experiment the uneven distribution of bryozoa and other larger organisms meant that sometimes a subsample had insufficient ballasting to sink table s5 so although fragmentation increases sa v ratio it will not always increase sinking and may actually lead to pieces of plastic on the bottom rising back to the surface 4 4 suggestion of a sa v tipping point for metazoan vs microbe mediated sinking our results suggest that for microplastic in the mm size range and above fouling by biofilms consisting only of microbes with their associated eps and bacteria alone is seldom sufficient to cause sinking but the diverse community of invertebrates in coastal regions that settle after the microbes are established can cause sinking of microplastic as well as thin plastic films of almost any size during the spring bloom this may lead to a pulse of buoyant plastic to the benthos zhao et al 2020 calculated that the microbial carbon on the floating plastic in the world ocean represents approximately 1 of the total carbon in surface microlayer of the ocean so sinking due to biofouling may be moving a portion of this c to the deep ocean continually representing an important source of c to the benthic community calculations based on our measured diatom densities and dimensions provide additional evidence that pieces of plastic much smaller than those we used may sink from the surface during the spring bloom but this remains to be demonstrated however many of the calcifying invertebrates such as barnacles mollusks and bryozoa that cause most of the density increase cannot mature on fragments of plastic smaller than a couple of hundred micrometers square microbes such as diatoms on the other hand can attach to plastic pieces down to 10 s of micrometers in size kaiser et al 2017 found that even pieces of pe as small as 1 mm could be colonized by multiple mussels that caused them to sink they suggested there is a lower limit to the size of particles that can be sunk by attached invertebrates and point out the lack of data regarding the impact of fouling on sub mm size plastics that are more readily incorporated into food webs limited data on the density of bacterial cells suggest they range from 1 11 1 18 lewis et al 2014 this study did not quantify density changes due to heterotrophic bacteria alone as our objective was primarily to investigate the impact of biofilms on plastic in illuminated surface waters where phototrophs typically flourish however bacteria can attach to plastic particles as small as 5 µm yi et al 2021 and probably play a larger role in altering the density of smaller pieces of plastic especially on those transported below the euphotic zone where biofilms will be dominated by heterotrophs our data support this size sa v tipping point and we suggest it is at a sa v ratio of approximately 100 with sinking of larger pieces of plastic with sa v below this dominated by invertebrates but for smaller pieces of plastic with sa v above 100 including small fibers sinking may be mediated by microbial biofilms or incorporation into aggregates zhao et al 2018 the exact sa v for the proposed tipping point will vary depending on the polymer geographic region and season due to differences in polymer density microbial and larval populations and environmentally constrained growth rates 5 conclusions biofilm formation and fouling organisms will vary from system to system but this work provides a range of experimentally determined results that start to constrain realistic changes in density due to biofouling of plastic in coastal environments these data are critical to help modeling efforts that inform plastic litter budgets predicting the fate of plastic pollution in the environment our results confirm that fouling by multicellular organisms can cause buoyant plastic to sink in coastal environments but that except for pieces with sa v above 100 microbial biofilms alone seldom cause sinking as plastic pieces become smaller at some point they are too small for multicellular organisms to attach therefore future work should quantify

16833,biofouling causing an increase in plastic density and sinking is one of the hypotheses to account for the unexpectedly low amount of buoyant plastic debris encountered at the ocean surface field surveys show that polyethylene and polypropylene the two most abundant buoyant plastics both occur below the surface and in sediments and experimental studies confirm that biofouling can cause both of these plastics to sink however studies quantifying the actual density of fouled plastics are rare despite the fact that density will determine the transport and eventual fate of plastic in the ocean here we investigated the role of microbial biofilms in sinking of polyethylene microplastic and quantified the density changes natural biofouling communities cause in the coastal waters of the north sea molecular data confirmed the variety of bacteria and eukaryotes including animals and other multicellular organisms colonizing the plastic over time fouling communities increased the density of plastic and caused sinking and the plastic remained negatively buoyant even during the winter with lower growth rates relative surface area alone however did not predict whether a plastic piece sank due to patchy colonization fragmentation of sinking pieces may result in smaller pieces regaining buoyancy and returning to the surface our results suggest that primarily multicellular organisms cause sinking of plastic pieces with surface area to volume ratios sa v below 100 generally pieces above a couple hundred micrometers in size and that this is a tipping point at which microbial biofilms become the key players causing sinking of smaller pieces with higher sa v ratios including most fibers that are too small for larger multicellular organisms to colonize graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastisphere biofouling density changes plastic debris 1 introduction the observation that we can only account for a small percentage of the plastic waste that budget estimates predict has ended up in the ocean lebreton et al 2019 has led to hypotheses about the fate of this missing plastic many polymers are denser than seawater and will sink but the two most produced plastic polymers are less dense than seawater so they should float polyethylene pe with a density of 0 91 to 0 965 g cm 3 and polypropylene pp with a density of 0 90 g cm 3 andrady 2017

seawater will have more of an effect on smaller particles biofouling leading to sinking of otherwise buoyant low density polyethylene ldpe was first reported over 45 years ago holmström 1975 and described ldpe sheets covered with calcareous bryozoa and algae that were recovered from fishing trawls in water up to 400 m deep since then there have been multiple reports of plastics that should be buoyant occurring below the surface or at the bottom bergmann et al 2017 gomiero et al 2019 peng et al 2017 the change in plastic density due to fouling was first quantified by ye and andrady 1991 who reported that the pe and pp materials they tested in the subtropical waters of biscayne bay usa became denser than seawater reaching a specific gravity of 1 03 to 1 14 after 7 9 weeks since then a number of authors have studied the role biofouling plays in altering the buoyancy of plastic in both marine and fresh waters but most have only described whether the plastic sinks chen et al 2019 fazey and ryan 2016 or measured sinking rates kaiser et al 2017 miao et al 2021 other than ye and andrady s gravimetric measurements there are very few data available regarding the actual density of fouled plastic but density measurements are critical to determining the transport of plastic in aquatic systems the sinking rate of particles depends on density size and shape kowalski et al 2016 but the density of a piece of plastic marine debris pmd determines where it ultimately ends up whether at the surface on the bottom or suspended at a level of equal density in the water column kooi et al 2017 the fouling community is diverse and includes organisms from unicellular bacteria and diatoms to animals such as barnacles ye and andrady 1991 described but did not quantify the initial formation of a transparent slimy biofilm on the surface after a couple of days rummel et al 2017 suggested that studying how biofilms influence vertical transport of microplastic should be a research priority to understand the fate and effects of microplastic in aquatic environments the formation of a microbial biofilm on plastic the so called plastisphere zettler et al 2013 alters the physical chemical and biological characteristics of plastic in aquatic environments and wright et al 2020 point out that the plastisphere forms the interface and thus drives interactions between the plastic and the environment in this study our goal was to quantify how biofouling by microbial biofilms alone as well as by natural fouling communities including multicellular algae and metazoans affects the density of pe pieces in a coastal environment our hypotheses were 1 the sa v of a piece of plastic would determine when and if a piece of plastic sinks and 2 during early spring bloom conditions rapid growth by attached microbes such as diatoms could increase the density of microplastic particles enough to cause them to sink resulting in seasonal pulses of microplastic from surface waters to the benthos 2 materials and methods 2 1 polymer properties there are many formulations of pe with varying additives crystallinity and surface texture among other characteristics in this study we used defined pe polymers of uniform composition provided by the american chemistry council acc three formulations of pe table s1 of 6 different thicknesses 0 025 0 051 0 076 0 102 0 152 and 0 203 mm were sterilized by immersing in 70 ethanol for 10 min then rinsing in 0 2 µm sterile filtered laboratory grade distilled deionized water before being used for experiments the different thicknesses provided a range of sa v ratios ranging from 10 to 80 using 5 5 mm pieces 2 2 microbial biofilms we tested 25 individual unialgal cultures to determine whether they would attach to plastic and could cause sinking of the plastic films table s2 note that our cultures were not axenic so the density changes we report are for a biofilm consisting of a single photosynthetic alga as well as any associated bacteria cultures were grown in f 2 medium silicate guillard and ryther 1962 made with sterilized wadden sea water approximately 1 ml of culture was inoculated into a 125 ml flask containing 50 ml of f 2 and 6 10 squares of polymer that had been sterilized by immersion in 70 ethanol for 10 min then rinsed in sterile laboratory grade water for each polymer and thickness 3 replicate flasks were incubated on an orbital shaker 60 rpm at 20 c 16 8 hour light dark cycle at an illumination of 50 µmol m 2 s 1 control flasks were included for each polymer and thickness containing f 2 culture medium and plastic but no microalgae flasks were checked starting during the lag phase through exponential growth and into senescence daily for the first week then twice a week for at least 6 weeks at each time point each culture flask was examined to determine whether plastic had visible biofilms had sunk below the surface film or had sunk to the bottom of the flask as soon as any piece of plastic was observed below the surface it was tested in a density column cultures to check the density of diatom biofilms alone without plastic were grown under the same culture conditions as the flasks above but in flat polystyrene tissue culture flasks one week after the cultures were inoculated and had formed a visible biofilm on the bottom of the flask a cell scraper was used to remove the biofilm ten milliliters of this slurry were transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged gently 1000 rpm for 2 min in a clinical centrifuge with a swing out rotor a wide bore pipet was used to gently transfer a portion of the biofilm pellet from the bottom of the tube to central portion of the surface of a thawed nycodenz density gradient see section 2 4 below 2 3 natural biofilms individual plastic strips 5

bag of fiberglass window screening mesh opening 1 0 1 7 mm to keep them from escaping and to protect them from macro grazers we wanted to monitor the development of the biofilm and fouling community without it being removed by fish crabs sea stars etc in this shallow productive system the plastic pieces in the mesh bag were immersed in seawater at the nioz jetty n 53 002 4 789 e in the wadden sea a shallow tidal inlet of the north sea fig 1 a by attaching it with stainless steel clips to a vertical anchor line secured at the top to a platform over the water and at the bottom to a steel weight resting on the sea floor this kept the samples approximately 1 5 m off the bottom and 0 5 2 m below the surface tidal range 1 5 m samples were deployed in may 2019 and sampled at 14 28 42 56 152 259

sterile scissors and rinsed gently in 0 2 µm filtered seawater from the site to remove non attached organisms at each sampling the remaining experimental plastic strips were transferred to a clean mesh bag to reduce external fouling kept continuously immersed in seawater and re submerged at the jetty anchoring system within 30 min after removing any large invertebrates bivalves tunicates that had settled as larvae back in the lab the 0 5 5 cm strip was cut into sections approximately 5 5 mm with sterile scissors and some pieces were used to determine density immediately see below other pieces were preserved for dna analyses in gentra puregene tissue cell lysis solution qiagen benelux b v venlo the netherlands and frozen at 20 c for scanning electron microscopy sem plastic was fixed

temperature nycodenz solutions self form a density gradient murayama et al 2001 we were particularly interested in quantifying densities when plastic started to sink in seawater so we chose a 20 nycodenz solution to produce a gradient that ranged from approximately 1 0068 1 3523 g cm 3 and that is linear between 1 02 g cm 3 approximate density of seawater and 1 15 g cm 3 because we were determining the density of live biofilms we dissolved the nycodenz in 1 x pbs phosphate buffered saline solution we froze 40 ml of the 20 nycodenz solution in 50 ml centrifuge tubes removing the number needed the morning of a sampling date and allowing it to thaw slowly at laboratory temperature 20 c without being disturbed once the nycodenz thawed and came to room temperature we gently added our sample plastic or diatom biofilm to the surface along with a mix of three color coded density standard beads from cospheric www cospheric com green 1 02 g cm 3 blue 1 13 g cm 3 and red 1 20 g cm 3 plastic samples were added in the center of the tube and a small drop of density beads were added around the edges to avoid the beads interfering with the biofilms tubes were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min in a temperature controlled centrifuge with swing out rotors at 20 c after centrifugation the distance from the surface of the nycodenz to the center of each sample and to each band of beads was measured to the nearest mm linear regression of the depth vs density of the standard beads provided a calibration curve for each tube that was used to calculate the density of cultures and plastic samples with biofilms between 1 02 and 1 20 g cm 3 outside of this range the slope of the nycodenz density gradient changes so for plastic pieces that settled outside of our density bead range

salinity and temperature over the course of the experiment are shown in fig 1b along with sampling dates additional environmental parameters for each sampling date are shown in table s3 our experiment was designed to capture the spring bloom as water temperatures rose and then continued sampling at lower frequency throughout an annual cycle temperature and salinity vary considerably in this intertidal coastal area with significant freshwater input 3 2 density change due to microbial biofilms alone the sa v ratio of the six thicknesses of plastic we used ranged from about 10 to 80 fig 2 we used pieces approximately 5 5 mm to simplify handling and to conform to the generally accepted definition of microplastic but note that the sa v ratio is determined mostly by the thickness of the piece of plastic rather than the other dimensions unialgal cultures including dinoflagellates cyanobacteria and diatoms attached readily to the surface of hdpe ldpe and lldpe pieces of all thicknesses fig s1a b in all of our tests we observed only seven individual pieces of plastic that sank due to colonization by unialgal cultures alone one with diatom wh23 and two each with cyanobacterium phormidium sp cyanobacterium spirulina sp and dinoflagellate prorocentrum lima six of these were pieces with high sa v ratios of 80 and one with sa v ratio of 40 in all cases this occurred during late exponential or stationary phase and was due to large clumps of cells extending beyond the plastic surface e g fig s1a b these were fragile enough that they usually broke off during the centrifugation in the density gradients and the plastic became buoyant again in our experiments microbes attached to the actual surface of the plastic did not generally provide sufficient ballasting to cause plastic to sink the pieces of plastic were initially quite hydrophobic and floated at or on the surface film of the seawater all cultures attached to plastic and appeared to decrease the hydrophobicity of the plastic within a week allowing even the thickest 0 203 mm pieces to slip below the surface film fig s1c plastic strips in the control flasks without microalgae or bacteria remained on the surface film throughout the experiment of the cultured microbes that caused our 5 5 mm pieces of plastic to sink diatoms attached most consistently to the plastic surfaces and formed robust biofilms based on this and because diatoms have relatively dense silicon dioxide frustules shells and are some of the most commonly reported early colonizers we also determined the density of biofilms formed by three diatoms isolated from surfaces in coastal waters for calculating whether microbes alone might be able to cause sinking of plastic with even higher sa v isolate names source and density are shown in table 1 3 3 density change due to natural fouling communities in the wadden sea the attached communities that developed on plastic during the in situ colonization experiment caused two of the pieces with the highest sa v ratio to move down in the density gradient after just 2 weeks table s5 but none exceeded the density of seawater until week 4 fig 3 as soon as pieces started moving down in the density gradients we knew their density was increasing however because our first density calibration bead was 1 02 g cm 3 we could not quantify the exact density until a piece exceeded that value and became denser than seawater these pieces that were increasing in density but would still float in seawater are plotted ordinally without a scale between 1 01 g cm 3 floating on top of the density column and 1 02 g cm 3 in fig 3 likewise samples with densities above our densest standard of 1 20 g cm 3 are plotted without a scale above 1 20 g cm 3 generally speaking pieces with equal fouling coverage that had higher sa v increased in density more quickly fig s2 but the patchy distribution of fouling often obscured this pattern fig s3 by week 6 the average density of all three polymers was greater than seawater but even after that there were generally a minority of pieces at each sampling that were buoyant fig 3 and table s5 hdpe is the densest polymer of this group and it remained densest for the first 28 days but after that there was no clear pattern in density differences among the three polymers note that at the final time point 7 all but five plastic strips had been lost due to a storm including all hdpe so only ldpe and lldpe are shown 3 4 community composition after two weeks plastic strips were coated with a thin slimy biofilm with occasional worm tubes and small colonies of bryozoa as time went on bryozoan colonies continued to spread and visual and sem surveys fig 4 demonstrated a wide spectrum of other invertebrates colonizing the plastic surface including bivalves echinoderms colonial hydroids barnacles tunicates and worms amplicon sequencing of dna extracted from the plastic samples revealed the complex communities that developed on the plastic and how they changed over time fig 5 for eukaryotes at week 2 t1 ciliates echinoderms annelids and bryozoa had colonized the plastic with some variation depending on the polymer but by week 4 t2 bryozoa became the dominant organisms on all substrates in this system bacterial communities were dominated by proteobacteria and bacteroidota throughout the experiment with some changes over time among the less dominant groups including increases in firmicutes and planctomycetota photosynthetic cyanobacteria were present at all time points but seldom made up more than 5 of the population 4 discussion 4 1 density changes due to microbial biofilms a number of studies have documented increases in weight and sinking due to biofilm development and biofouling reviewed in onda and sharief 2021 but far fewer quantify density changes the impact of microbial biofilms compared to macroalgae and invertebrates is also not clear despite the often stated opinion that microbial biofilms increase weight of plastic and cause sinking in some cases biofilms may even cause the density of plastic particles to decrease miao et al 2021 measured densities of microbial cells and biofilms reported in the literature are few and vary widely van ierland and peperzak 1983 used density gradient centrifugation to measure the density of nine diatom species in natural marine plankton samples from the north sea ranging from 1 03 to 1 23 g cm 3 in a theoretical study kooi et al 2017 used a median biofilm density of 1 38 g cm 3 this was calculated from estimated wet weight and volumes reported by fisher et al 1983 but these yield density estimates from 0 53 to 4 35 g cm 3 so they are not very realistic the density of granite stone is only 2 75 g cm 3 van melkebeke et al 2020 used more realistic values of 1 1 0 1 g cm 3 but these were based on calculations not measurements we measured the density of biofilms created by three types of diatoms that were isolated from pe and other surfaces in marine systems and found these ranged from 1 15 to 1 18 g cm 3 table 1 diatoms are consistently reported as early and dominant colonizers of pmd bravo et al 2011 carson et al 2013 eich et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 and the silicon dioxide frustule density 2 6 g cm 3 of these protists can make them substantially denser than seawater consequently diatoms might be expected to contribute to sinking of pmd however our laboratory experiments with diatoms and other attached phytoplankton showed that although they appear to decrease the hydrophobicity and cause plastic to sink below the surface film fig s1c microbial biofilms consisting of unialgal cultures along with associated bacteria eps and adhered particles alone rarely caused sinking of microplastic some of those that did sink had relatively loosely attached clumps of cells so despite the fact that they sank in our experimental containers that were oscillated to simulate movement at sea in the density column many of the clumps of cells detached and the polymer became buoyant again sinking due to microbial biofilms alone may be more prevalent in freshwaters with a density around 1 g cm 3 chen et al 2019 wright et al 2020 mention the lack of experimental measurements of the impact of microbial biofilms on plastic density they also calculated the thickness of biofilms of various densities 1 1 1 5 g cm 3 necessary to make pp and pe spheres of different diameters sink our experimental results support their model prediction that microbial biofilms 10 µm thick with a density of 1 1 g cm 3 could cause pe spheres smaller than 100 µm in diameter to sink our wh23 cells isolated from pe in woods hole usa measure 12 5 4 5 3 µm l x w x h with a density 1 17 g cm 3 a biofilm layer 10 µm thick would accommodate three layers of these 3 µm thick diatoms and if they covered 100 of a 100 µm pe sphere the combined density of the pe and diatoms would be 1 035 g cm 3 denser than seawater while theoretically possible 100 coverage of a plastic piece by a three cell thick biofilm of diatoms is unlikely also a 100 µm sphere has a sa v ratio of 60 and in our experiments films with a higher sa v of 80 did not sink even when heavily coated with a diatom biofilm so as other authors have mentioned shape is important as well as density however diatoms can almost cover a piece of plastic recently immersed in seawater fig s4 so calculations using a slightly more realistic scenario of a layer of diatoms one cell thick covering 100 of the surface suggest diatoms could cause the sinking of a pe sphere of 40 µm diameter with a sa v ratio of 150 at this scale it starts to beg the question of whether the particle is plastic covered with microbes or a microbial tep aggregate with included plastic pieces under some bloom conditions diatoms can cover almost 100 of the plastic surface fig s4 but field data suggest coverage is almost never this high dussud et al 2018 our own observations based on sem imaging of the biofilms on hundreds of pieces of plastic collected in the pacific and atlantic amaral zettler et al 2015 as well as in the mediterranean amaral zettler et al 2021 also show that natural biofilms on plastic seldom cover more than 50 of the surface of a piece of plastic however they are often greater than 1 cell thick and include dead cells and diatom frustules that can extend the microbial biofilm up to a thickness of 50 µm these results based on actual measured values for biofilm density coverage and thickness suggest that microbial biofilms alone can cause plastic to sink but generally only on items with sa v ratios above 100 such as thin films and fragments and filaments with diameters less than 50 µm for larger fragments the most important role of microbial biofilms causing plastic to sink may be by decreasing hydrophobicity and providing chemical cues that encourage the settlement and facilitate adhesion of invertebrates zardus et al 2008 we observed that pieces originally floating on top of the surface film eventually sank below the surface even though they were still buoyant fig s1c lobelle and cunliffe 2011 noted that this behavior correlated with quantitative decreases in hydrophobicity of pe food bags this may be the first stage of sinking because it increases the surface area available for settlement of additional organisms bravo et al 2011 many of the taxa encountered on beached debris by winston et al 1997 are calcifying and these can increase the density of plastic quickly 4 2 surface area to volume considerations ryan 2015 pointed out the importance of sa v ratios of different shapes and observed fewer thin items further from shore in the south atlantic subsequently fazey and ryan 2016 used hdpe and ldpe sheets of thicknesses ranging from 0 1 to 4 mm to show in field experiments that smaller pieces down to 5 mm and pieces with higher sa v ratio sink faster when colonized they quantified coverage by macro colonizers and concluded that biofouling may account for a substantial portion of the missing surface plastic we confirmed their finding that for a given size and shape pieces with high sa v ratios generally sink sooner figs s2 s3 van melkebeke et al 2020 also provided analyses of sinking rates and calculations showing that films are far more likely than other shapes of plastic to develop a biofilm sufficient to cause sinking of buoyant plastics based on this we concentrated on thin films as the items most likely to sink quickly due to biofouling for films the thickness dominates their sa v fig 2 while the length and width determine the sa and therefore who can colonize a given piece for example a piece of film that is 0 1 mm thick and 2 2 mm has a sa v ratio of 22 while a piece of the same film that is 200 200 mm has a sa v ratio of 20 02 this 10 difference in sa v is minor relative to the 10 000 x difference in the sa of those same pieces 8 8 mm2 vs 80 080 mm2 and this huge difference will influence what and how many organisms can colonize the plastic the much larger piece has a marginally lower sa v but it is more likely to develop a fouling community of invertebrates and other multicellular organisms that will make it sink this also means that depending on shape macroplastic films many cm in size have higher sa v ratios than microplastic fragments and are more likely to sink 4 3 density changes due to mixed biofilms of microbes and metazoans in our field experiments the fouling community caused the density of plastic to increase rapidly during the spring bloom and by week 6 most pieces of plastic were sinking as the average density for all three polymers was greater than that of seawater fig 3 the timing and average densities during our experiment are very similar to those reported in the pioneering work by ye and andrady 1991 but in their case the early colonization leading to sinking was dominated by algae while ours was due primarily to bryozoa figs 4 5 several factors affect our results including constraining the plastic strips in a mesh bag as opposed to experimentally tethered or naturally free floating plastic we did this to contain the plastic in this high energy tidal environment with significant wind exposure as well as to exclude macro grazers to keep them from resetting our biofilms the mesh bags undoubtedly change the hydrodynamics and access to the plastic surface by settling propagules the colonization by microbes should not have been strongly affected and in addition to bryozoans we saw bivalves tunicates echinoderms and crustaceans settling on the plastic however we saw very little macroalgae though these have been primary colonizers in other studies mentioned above and our setup in mesh bags as in all experiments undoubtedly exerted some filtering influence on the resulting communities our molecular results fig 5 provided more details on other taxa including microbes that colonized the plastic after two weeks the plastic visually appeared mostly bare but already had a diverse community of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes by four weeks small colonies of bryozoa were already visible and molecular results confirmed they were the dominant colonizer but that other animal groups including annelids arthropods and echinoderms had also started to settle along with numerous bacteria and protists including ciliates fig 5a b the plastisphere community is dynamic and changes seasonally and geographically amaral zettler et al 2020 photosynthetic cyanobacteria were present at all time points fig 5b but the communities at this location during the almost yearlong experiment were dominated by heterotrophs diatoms and other phototrophic protists were present but seldom seen in the sem images and contributed only a small proportion of the sequences analyzed so they were below the cut off of 100 occurrences across all samples we chose for plotting the primary colonizers at different times and in different locations will almost certainly vary but it appears that at least in most coastal areas there are macro organisms that will colonize plastic and cause it to sink including algae ye and andrady 1991 bivalves kaiser et al 2017 and bryozoa this study how commonly fouling causes the sinking of plastic in the oligotrophic open ocean is unknown but the most common taxa reported from pelagic pmd generally include a number of calcifying organisms including barnacles bryozoa and shelled mollusks goldstein et al 2014 gregory 2009 kiessling et al 2015 our samples were held at constant depth and protected from macro grazers by a mesh bag so we did not observe defouling and resurfacing of submerged samples as proposed by ye and andrady 1991 at our experimental site we saw very little algal growth so lack of light as they sank would not affect our pieces as much the primary causes of the density increase in our experiment was encrustation by carbonate producing bryozoa and their ballasting shells would not necessarily be removed even if they are grazed or die as the plastic sinks in our experiment once it became denser than seawater the plastic remained negatively buoyant throughout the year including during winter when growth rates are lower we have also commonly observed in sem images that the lower frustule of diatoms remains attached to plastic after the diatom is grazed so these would continue to ballast the plastic in addition winston et al 1997 in their survey of encrusting organisms on plastic found that some were found only on buoyant plastic some were found only on non buoyant plastic but most were found on both buoyant and non buoyant plastic so sinking alone will not always lead to loss of the ballasting organisms cozar et al 2014 suggested that in the deep sea carbonate ballast may dissolve at depth due to increasing acidity below the ccd but this mechanism does not exist in coastal waters and at least some calcium carbonate encrusting organisms persist when buoyant plastic such as pe sinks gundogdu et al 2017 in shallow freshwaters loading of the biofilm with mineral particles caused the sinking of experimental plastic pieces chen et al 2019 and this may also play a role in shallow turbid coastal marine environments such as the wadden sea kooi et al 2017 predicted vertical oscillations based on photosynthetic algae alone but the plastisphere has many heterotrophs and animals that are not immediately impacted by the loss of light at night or as they sink into the twilight zone in fact if the phototrophs start dying this could lead to an increase in heterotrophs that can utilize the pom and dom released from the dying cells as pointed out by gerritse et al 2020 several studies have remarked on the paucity of floating plastic particles smaller than 1 mm cozar et al 2014 eriksen et al 2014 kooi et al 2017 supporting the hypothesis that smaller particles with higher sa v ratio may be removed more rapidly due to ballasting while in general this is true fig s2 during our experiment smaller sections cut from larger pieces that sank sometimes became buoyant again those plotted below dotted line in fig 3 ye and andrady 1991 mentioned the non uniformity of fouling as did fazey and ryan 2016 and in our experiment the uneven distribution of bryozoa and other larger organisms meant that sometimes a subsample had insufficient ballasting to sink table s5 so although fragmentation increases sa v ratio it will not always increase sinking and may actually lead to pieces of plastic on the bottom rising back to the surface 4 4 suggestion of a sa v tipping point for metazoan vs microbe mediated sinking our results suggest that for microplastic in the mm size range and above fouling by biofilms consisting only of microbes with their associated eps and bacteria alone is seldom sufficient to cause sinking but the diverse community of invertebrates in coastal regions that settle after the microbes are established can cause sinking of microplastic as well as thin plastic films of almost any size during the spring bloom this may lead to a pulse of buoyant plastic to the benthos zhao et al 2020 calculated that the microbial carbon on the floating plastic in the world ocean represents approximately 1 of the total carbon in surface microlayer of the ocean so sinking due to biofouling may be moving a portion of this c to the deep ocean continually representing an important source of c to the benthic community calculations based on our measured diatom densities and dimensions provide additional evidence that pieces of plastic much smaller than those we used may sink from the surface during the spring bloom but this remains to be demonstrated however many of the calcifying invertebrates such as barnacles mollusks and bryozoa that cause most of the density increase cannot mature on fragments of plastic smaller than a couple of hundred micrometers square microbes such as diatoms on the other hand can attach to plastic pieces down to 10 s of micrometers in size kaiser et al 2017 found that even pieces of pe as small as 1 mm could be colonized by multiple mussels that caused them to sink they suggested there is a lower limit to the size of particles that can be sunk by attached invertebrates and point out the lack of data regarding the impact of fouling on sub mm size plastics that are more readily incorporated into food webs limited data on the density of bacterial cells suggest they range from 1 11 1 18 lewis et al 2014 this study did not quantify density changes due to heterotrophic bacteria alone as our objective was primarily to investigate the impact of biofilms on plastic in illuminated surface waters where phototrophs typically flourish however bacteria can attach to plastic particles as small as 5 µm yi et al 2021 and probably play a larger role in altering the density of smaller pieces of plastic especially on those transported below the euphotic zone where biofilms will be dominated by heterotrophs our data support this size sa v tipping point and we suggest it is at a sa v ratio of approximately 100 with sinking of larger pieces of plastic with sa v below this dominated by invertebrates but for smaller pieces of plastic with sa v above 100 including small fibers sinking may be mediated by microbial biofilms or incorporation into aggregates zhao et al 2018 the exact sa v for the proposed tipping point will vary depending on the polymer geographic region and season due to differences in polymer density microbial and larval populations and environmentally constrained growth rates 5 conclusions biofilm formation and fouling organisms will vary from system to system but this work provides a range of experimentally determined results that start to constrain realistic changes in density due to biofouling of plastic in coastal environments these data are critical to help modeling efforts that inform plastic litter budgets predicting the fate of plastic pollution in the environment our results confirm that fouling by multicellular organisms can cause buoyant plastic to sink in coastal environments but that except for pieces with sa v above 100 microbial biofilms alone seldom cause sinking as plastic pieces become smaller at some point they are too small for multicellular organisms to attach therefore future work should quantify the role of bacteria archaea and eukaryotic protists in density changes at these smaller scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16834,sulfonamide antibiotics sas are typical antibiotics and have attracted increasing concerns about their wide occurrence in environment as well as potential risk for human health in this study we applied a novel advanced oxidation process in sas degradation by combining molybdenum sulfide and peracetic acid mos2 paa reactive oxygen species ros including ho ch3c o o ch3c o oo and 1o2 were generated from paa by mos2 activation and contributed to sas degradation the effects of initial ph the dosages of paa and mos2 and humic acid for sas degradation were further evaluated by selecting sulfamethoxazole smx as a target sa in the mos2 paa process results suggested that the optimum ph for smx removal was 3 where the degradation efficiency of smx was higher than 80 after reaction for 15 min increasing paa 0 075 0 45 mm or mos2 0 1 0 4 g l dosages facilitated the smx degradation while the presence of humic acids retarded the smx removal this mos2 paa process also showed good efficiencies in removing other sas including sulfaguanidine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamerazine their possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the products identification and dft calculation showing that apart from the oxidation of amine groups to nitro groups in sas mos2 paa induced so2 extrusion reaction for sas that contained six membered heterocyclic moieties graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid paa molybdenum sulfide mos2 sulfonamide antibiotics sas advanced oxidation process aop 1 introduction antibiotics are mainly used to treat bacterial infections and have become boons for human and animal health zhang et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 but the consumed antibiotics that entered into the environment via human wastes and animal manure are mainly in unchanged and active forms which may pose new threats to the ecosystems and human beings such as the birth of super bacteria duan et al 2017 hirsch et al 1999 zhou et al 2017a as a kind of typical antibiotics sulfonamides sas have been widely used in humans and livestock and thus their release from hospitals and livestock farms made these compounds frequently detected in sediments waters and soils sharma et al 2016 czekalski et al 2015 additionally their antibacterial nature made them hard to be removed by biological methods in wastewater treatment plants causing the accumulation of sas amounts in aquatic systems yang et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops are viewed as effective strategies in removing sas oturan and aaron 2014 clarizia et al 2017 generally these sas were effectively degraded in aops through reacting with reactive radicals such as sulfate and hydroxyl radicals so4 and ho yang et al 2018 these radicals possess relatively high redox potentials e 0 so4 2 6 3 1 v e 0 ho 1 9 2 7 v and thus show good ability in reacting with sas lee et al 2020 due to that these radicals are short lived where the half life period of so4 and ho were reported to be 30 40 and 1 μs respectively hu and long 2016 stable precursors such as persulfates and h2o2 are always required for providing so4 and ho through the breakage of oo bonds by energy or electron transfer reactions lee et al 2020 peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh an emerging oxidant could be also used as precursors for radical generation because it has the same oo bond structure as the commonly used h2o2 or persulfates paa has been drawing more and more attention for water treatment as a disinfectant in recent years due to its high oxidation power e 0 paa 1 0 1 7 v and low potential to form disinfection by products dbps zhang et al 2018 the oxidation ability of paa could be further improved after activation for producing ho and organic radicals ro which could be used as an alternative strategy for sas degradation luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 various methods have been successfully established in activating paa including energy input uv irradiation and heating and reducing paa by metal ions or heterogeneous catalysts kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 using heterogeneous catalysts in paa activation has received great attention with increased concern about the drawbacks of using these homogeneous activation methods for example fe2 paa process may lead to the accumulation of iron containing sludge which is viewed as secondary pollution pignatello et al 2006 while the homogeneous activated co2 paa system increased threats to human health due to the dissolved toxic and carcinogenic cobalt ions hu and long 2016 from this point developing heterogeneous catalysts for paa activation is necessary molybdenum sulfide mos2 is a kind of metal sulfide which has been extensively used in environmental fields for its excellent performance in heavy metal adsorption photochemical processes and co catalysts in aops chang et al 2016 wang and mi 2017 xing et al 2018 due to its low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility mos2 would be used as an environmental safe material in those processes liu et al 2014 it has also been used in direct activating peroxides such as persulfates and h2o2 with producing reactive oxygen species ros li et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and its good performance in peroxides activation motivated us to attempt using mos2 in activating paa ros would be generated from paa by mos2 activation analogous to its performance in other peroxides which would be a novel strategy to treat organic pollutants including sas as no research concerning this process mos2 paa the mechanism for paa activation and its performance in pollutants degradation should be comprehensively studied the first objective of this study was to reveal the mechanisms of paa activation by mos2 accompanied by disclosing the generated ros the second objective of this study is to clarify whether this proposed mos2 paa process could be used for sas degradation here we choose four widely used sas including sulfaguanidine sg sulfamonomethoxine smm sulfamerazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx as target pollutants zhang et al 2015 and their degradation pathways in the mos2 paa process were investigated additionally smx was selected to further study the possible influencing factors such as paa concentration mos2 dose initial ph and humic acids in the mos2 paa process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals with analytical grade at least were used without further purification and the detailed sources of these chemicals are provided in text s1 in the supporting information si all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water generated by a water purification system micropure uv thermo fisher scientific germany paa was prepared by mixing h2o2 and ch3c o oh according to previous works wang et al 2020c chen et al 2018 h2o2 coexisted in the paa solution with the molar ratio of paa h2o2 being 1 2 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments were carried out in a 250 ml glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer stirring at a speed of 300 rpm desired amounts of target compounds and paa were added in the reactor then the solution ph was adjusted by diluted naoh or h2so4 immediately reactions were initiated when the solid mos2 at desired amounts were added in the solution reaction temperature was maintained at 25 c by a thermostat system aliquots were sampled at pre determined time intervals and quickly quenched by adding excess amounts of na2s2o3 these samples were then filtered through 0 22 μm acetate fiber membranes to remove mos2 solids for analysis all the batch experiments were performed at least twice and the errors in figures represent the standard deviation of the experimental data 2 3 analytical methods the stock solution of paa was titrated for calibration and the concentration of paa during experiments was

mos2 it has been reported that peracids decomposition by metal ions via redox reactions and there are two competing pathways of the oo bond cleavage of peracids via eqs 1 and 2 sheldon and kochi 1981 as the presence of mos2 significantly accelerated the paa decomposition fig s1 it is proposed that the paa would undergo activation by mos2 to generate ho and ch3c o o similar to the reactions of eqs 1 and 2 which could be described in eqs 3 and 4 1 r c o o o h m n 1 r c o o m n h o 2 r c o o o h m n 1 r c o o m n o h 3 c h 3 c o o o h m o n 1 c h 3 c o o m o n h o 4 c h 3 c o o o h m o n 1 c h 3 c o o m o n h o in an attempt to check whether paa underwent catalyzation by mos2 via eq 3 we choose nb and pcba as typical ho probes in identifying the existence of ho cai et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020a fig 1 a shows that both of these two compounds were degraded in the mos2 paa process while the addition of 100 mm tba significantly inhibited their degradation as tba can scavenge ho 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but shows negligible reactivities towards other radicals from paa such as ch3c o o and ch3c o oo buxton et al 1988 cai et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020c it is concluded that the inhibition of nb and pcba removal was caused by quenching ho by excess tba in the mos2 paa system additionally the fluorescent probe terephthalic acid ta which can easily react with ho to generate highly fluorescent 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid taoh was used to probe the generated ho burns et al 2012 fig 1b shows that the fluorescence intensity around 450 nm in the mos2 paa process is stronger than that in the mos2 h2o2 process h2o2 0 3 mm indicating that the generated ho through the catalytic reaction of paa by mos2 is much more than that of the coexisted h2o2 0 25 mm esr technique was applied to examine the possible reactive radicals using 100 mm dmpo as trapping agents burns et al 2012 as shown in fig 1c the typical esr signal of dmpooh adduct was observed in mos2 paa system further confirming the existence of ho in the mos2 paa system this dmpooh signal was not originated from the coexisted h2o2 because there was no obvious dmpooh signal in the mos2 h2o2 process as for the reaction of eq 4 proving the existence of ch3c o o is necessary however the effective method in detecting ch3c o o in mos2 paa process is relatively limited recently activation of peroxymonosulfate pms by mos2 has been reported and sulfate radical so4 was confirmed in their experiments through alcohol quenching experiments zhou et al 2020 considering that paa has a similar oo bond structure to pms ch3c o o is proposed to generate in mos2 paa via reactions of eq 4 analogous to that in mos2 pms system to further confirm this deduction we attempted to use tempo which is a stable nitroxyl radical and has been extensively used as a radical probe and trapping agent for identifying ch3c o o barton et al 1998 yang et al 2017 as shown in fig s2 the ch3c o o tempo signal m z 216 1594 and r t at 11 7 min was successfully detected in the lc ms spectrum which was solid evidence for the generation of ch3c o o additionally the product of ch3 tempo m z 172 1696 and r t at 9 7 min was detected fig s3 this product was originated from ch3 generated from the decarboxylation of ch3c o o eq 5 in the mos2 paa system rokhina et al 2010 the discussion above strongly indicated that both ho and ch3c o o existed in the mos2 paa process in which paa was catalyzed by mos2 after contacting with paa mos2 exhibited a signal of sulfur vacancy at g 2 0 fig 2 a which suggested that active mo sites were exposed during the reaction xing et al 2018 to elucidate the interaction between paa and exposed mo raman measurements were carried out to characterize the fresh and used mos2 as shown in fig 2b two raman shifts located at 818 and 991 cm 1 were observed on the used mos2 corresponding to omo2 ag b1g and mo o ag b1g modes respectively suggesting the transformation of mo4 to mo6 according to the reported literatures sheng et al 2019 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the oxidation of mo4 to mo5 e mo cn 8 4 mo cn 8 3 0 725 v and further to mo6 e mo5 mo6 0 2 v by paa e ch3c o ooh 2h ch3c o oh h2o 1 0 1 7 v is thermodynamically favorable where paa acts as an electron acceptor in oxidizing mo sheldon and kochi 1981 zhang et al 2018 speight 2005 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals lumos of paa can be used to predict the electron accepting site in paa fig s4 shows that the lumos of paa are mainly located at the o atoms of the oo bond hence these two o atoms are both potential sites of accepting electrons from mo4 5 and the oo bond will be broken afterward the changes of the valence of mo in mos2 were compared by xps before and after reaction as shown in fig 2c there are two characteristic peaks with binding energy at 232 7 and 229 6 ev in the xps spectra corresponding to mo4 in the orbitals of mo in 3d5 2 and 3d3 2 respectively sheng et al 2019 there are no changes of the xps spectra in mo3d orbitals in the used mos2 and no characteristic peak of mo6 at 235 7 ev similar xps results of the used mos2 were reported in the fe2 pms mos2 system sheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020b a possible reason is that mo6 in the mos2 surface was unstable in the presence of paa and could be reduced by the coexisted h2o2 as proposed previously xing et al 2018 additionally according to the consensus of reducing paa by high valence of metal ions i e co and fe ao et al 2021 reaction of eq 6 was proposed to express the process of reducing mo6 5 ions by paa which was accompanied by the generation of ch3c o oo as both ho and ch3c o o have potential in abstracting h from the ooh bond in paa ch3c o oo is expected to be generated in this mos2 paa system via reactions of eqs 7 and 8 zhang and huang 2020 5 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 6 c h 3 c o o o h m o n c h 3 c o o o m o n 1 h 7 c h 3 c o o o h h o c h 3 c o o o h 2 o 8 c h 3 c o o o h c h 3 c o o c h 3 c

s5 moan and wold 1979 as no signals of tmp 1o2 adducts in mos2 h2o2 system was observed it could exclude the possibility of 1o2 formation via h2o2 activation by mos2 at the given condition noting that it still has tmp 1o2 signal in paa solution without mos2 at ph 3 1o2 could also be generated from paa where the ph value is lower than the pka i e 8 2 of this oxidant wang et al 2020c as shown in fig s5 the intensity of tmp 1o2 adducts in paa solution with mos2 was much stronger than that without mos2 which suggested that most of the 1o2 were originated from the activation of paa by mos2 rather than paa self decomposition eventually the overall reactions of 1o2 production in mos2 paa could be proposed as shown in eq 9 3 2 stability of mos2 as shown in fig s6 the diffraction peaks of mos2 at 2 theta values matched well with the standard pattern of 2h mos2 jcpds no 37 1492 hou et al 2021 after contacting with paa the used mos2 still exhibited a typical hexagonal structure as no obvious change in xrd pattern was observed compared with the fresh mos2 suggesting its stability in crystal structure after reaction the sem photographs of the fresh and used mos2 are shown in fig s7 the multi layered structure of mos2 remained unchanged after reaction showing morphology stability of mos2 after contacting with paa soluble mo ions from the release of mos2 were determined by icp oes analysis as shown in fig s8 soluble mo ions reached 3 0 mg l after reacting with 0 3 mm paa for 15 min meaning that only 1 6 of mo in mos2 would be dissociated in water it is known that the reaction between mos2 and h2o2 solution is spontaneous according to eq 10 the similar manner of mos2 dissolution in the presence of paa can be illustrated in eq 11 ruiz et al 2011 the remained mo in mos2 98 4 would be still highly reactive in activating paa noting that 1 6 mg l mo was detected in mos2 h2o2 process this mo leached from mos2 paa was expected to be partly from the reaction between mos2 and the coexisted h2o2 10 m o s 2 9 h 2 o 2 m o o 2 2 2 s o 4 2 2 h 8 h 2 o 11 m o s 2 9 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o m o o 2 2 2 s o 4 2 9 c h 3 c o o 11 h 3 3 comparison of different processes on the degradation of smx fig 3 compares the removal efficiency of smx in different processes no removal of smx was observed by 0 3 mm paa alone at the given condition while the presence of 0 3 g l mos2 might adsorb a small amount of smx 10 6 on its surface wang and mi 2017 in comparison the mos2 paa process showed the best performance in smx degradation achieving 76 1 loss of smx within 15 min it must be mentioned that the coexisted h2o2 0 25 mm in 0 3 mm paa might contribute to the smx removal in the mos2 paa process however only 18 7 of smx was degraded by mos2 h2o2 when the concentration of h2o2 was fixed at 0 3 mm suggesting that the coexisted mos2 h2o2 in mos2 paa was not the major process for smx removal as discussed in section 3 1 ho ch3c o o ch3c o oo and 1o2 are ros in the mos2 paa process all of these ros could be used for smx degradation as previously reported zhou et al 2017b zhang et al 2016b wang et al 2020c to reveal the contributions of these ros in the smx degradation excess amounts of tba 100 mm was added in the mos2 paa system concerning that tba is an effective quencher for ho but not for ch3c o o ch3c o oo or 1o2 the additional tba could be used to study the role of ho in smx degradation as shown in fig 3 the removal rate of smx decreased from 76 1 to 38 8 in the presence of tba suggesting that the generated ho via the reaction of eq 3 was a critical radical accounting for smx degradation in the mos2 paa system apart from the direct reaction with smx ho would be a dominant source for the generation of ch3c o oo according to the fast reaction between ho and paa eq 7 k ho paa 1 3 109 m 1 s 1 zhang and huang 2020 considering that ch3c o oo was the powerful oxidizing peroxyl radical and has high reactivity towards smx kim et al 2020 wang et al 2021 2020c we believe that the coexisted ch3c o oo also played essential roles in smx degradation in the mos2 paa process thus the excess amounts of tba reduced the concentrations of ch3c o oo as well which results in inhibiting the smx removal however excess amounts of tba cannot completely retard the smx degradation so other ros such as ch3c o o also played roles in the degradation of smx although 1o2 was generated in this system fig s5 its role for the smx degradation can be omitted due to the physical quenching of h2o text s2 additionally the addition of tba cannot inhibit the generation of ch3c o oo via eqs 6 and 8 these parts of ch3c o oo would be used in smx removal in the presence of tba 3 4 effectiveness of the recycled mos2 to evaluate the catalytic efficiencies of the used mos2 the removal efficiency of smx was evaluated by using recycled mos2 the collected mos2 after reaction was washed with ultrapure water and freeze dried however the recycled mos2 did not perform well in activating paa for smx removal as shown in fig s9 only 52 9 degradation of smx was achieved after the second reaction the removal rate of smx further decreased to 27 5 in the third cycle and finally kept around 16 after the fifth reaction similar results of pollutants degradation have been reported in pms based aops using metal sulfides fes2 mos2 as activators sheng et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 2018 xps spectrum fig s10 shows that s2 were the dominant s species of mos2 before and after reaction meaning that most of s in mos2 remained unchanged in valence but this spectrum could not well characterize the edge unsaturated s because the amounts of s atoms in edge sites of mos2 were less than that in other sites theoretically according to the reported mos2 pms process pms was not well activated by mos2 after the coordinatively unsaturated s was depleted sheng et al 2019 similarly the decreased efficiency of mos2 for paa activation might be explained by the loss of the unsaturated s it has reported that sulfides act as electron donor and used in reducing fe3 to fe2 in fes2 pms system we expect that the unsaturated s in mos2 could also be used in reducing mo6 5 to mo5 4 in the mos2 paa process zhou et al 2018 after reaction for several times the completely removed unsaturated s would lower the regeneration rate of mo5 4 leading to low yields of ho and ch3c o o according to eqs 3 and 4 3 5 effects of initial paa concentration and mos2 dose the effect of paa concentration was studied at ph 3 with fixing the mos2 dose at 0 3 g l fig 4 a after reaction for 15 min the removal rate of smx increased from 45 1 to 85 1 when the initial paa concentration increased from 0 075 to 0 45 mm and the observed corresponding rate constant of smx removal k obs increased from 0 040 to 0 125 min 1 as paa acts as a critical source of ros i e ho ch3c o o ch3c o oo and 1o2 it is obvious that increased paa concentration accelerated the smx degradation the coexisted h2o2 concentration also increased with increasing paa concentration which facilitated the smx removal to some extent as mos2 h2o2 also contributed to smx degradation fig 3 fig 4b shows that the removal rate of smx after reaction for 15 min increased from 41 0 to 86 1 with elevating mos2 dosage from 0 1 to 0 4 g l accompanied with the corresponding k obs for smx degradation raising from 0 035 to 0 128 min 1 apart from the roles of the paa activation accelerated by increasing mos2 dosage the increased mos2 would trigger more smx adsorbed on its surface wang and mi 2017 3 6 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph on smx degradation in the mos2 paa system was evaluated with initial paa and mos2 dosages being 0 3 mm and 0 3 g l respectively as shown in fig 5 the removal rate of smx after 15 min decreased from 76 1 to 0 8 with increasing initial ph from 3 to 11 showing an obvious inhibition rate of smx at higher ph values in the selected ph range additionally the variation of ph during the reaction was monitored in this system as shown in fig s11 the ph value gradually decreased when the initial ph varied from 4 to 9 which could be explained by the fact that the unsaturated s atoms could bind with protons to form h2s xing et al 2018 the generated sulfur vacancy exposed reactive mo on the mos2 surface and this process is ph dependent because more hydrogen ions h can be used to bind with s atoms at lower ph values zhou et al 2020 due to the large amount of h the more reactive mo could be exposed at acetic conditions which prompted the paa activation in oxidating smx as for the released h2s it is expected to contain no capability in activating paa for smx degradation as little to no removal of smx was observed in the na2s paa system fig s12a additionally the formed h2s have potential in consuming more ros and peroxides in the mos2 paa process e h2s s 2h 0 142 v which was supported by the inhibiting role of h2s in smx degradation fig s12b as well as the generated insoluble sulfur from the reaction between paa and h2s fig s12c david 2010 thus there are two opposite roles in the mos2 paa process for smx removal at a lower ph value on one hand mos2 could expose more reactive mo for the paa activation on the other hand the released h2s have adverse impacts on the smx degradation but these impacts were minor because the better removal of smx was acquired at a lower solution ph 3 7 effect of ha humic substance a key component in natural waters is one of the most important factors affecting the pollutants degradation in aops in the mos2 paa system we choose humic acid ha as a reference humic substance to investigate the performance of humic substance on smx degradation when the ha concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg l the removal rate of smx decreased by 56 1 fig s13 ha is a scavenger for reactive species such as ho and ro and the reported second order rate constants for ha reacting with ho and ro were 2 5 104 and 5 8 104 mg l respectively chen et al 2018 thus ha was overwhelmingly capable to consume ho and ro in the mos2 paa process and reduced the removal efficiencies of smx besides the scavenging effect ha might be adsorbed on the mos2 surface and inhibited the catalysis reaction wang and mi 2017 3 8 degradation of other sulfonamides by the mos2 paa process to further test the potential of the mos2 paa process for sas degradation the treatment of other three commonly used and detected sas including sg smm and smz was evaluated as shown in fig 6 all of the selected compounds can be effectively degraded by the mos2 paa process within 15 min and the degradation efficiencies among the three sulfonamides and smx shown in fig 3 followed a sequence of sg 60 0 smx 76 1 smz 91 6 smm 92 2 as good degradation efficiencies of all the selected sas 60 were observed it is concluded that the mos2 paa process is suitable for sas degradation similar to the results obtained from the smx 100 mm tba inhibited the removal of all these sas sg smm and smz meaning that ho played essential roles in oxidizing these sas based on the aforementioned discussion other ros such as ch3c o oo ch3c o o and or 1o2 were also expected to contribute to these sas degradation 3 9 possible degradation pathways of sulfonamides in the mos2 paa process to reveal the possible degradation pathways of sas in the mos2 paa process a u hplc q exactive orbitrap hrms system was employed to identify the oxidized products of sas sg smz smx and smm additionally their ms2 fragments are offered in figs s14 s25 errors of m z between the calculated and experimental values were 5 ppm based on the identified oxidation products of sas possible degradation pathways of sas in the mos2 paa process were proposed in fig 7 among all of the selected sas the amine groups on the benzene ring could be oxidized to nitro groups in the mos2 paa system for example the m z of sg is 215 0598 esi and the oxidation product of sg sg 245 m z 245 0336 was observed after oxidation to further disclose the sas degradation pathways in mos2 paa the feasible reactive sites of sas were calculated by density functional theory dft at b3lyp 6 311g basis set frisch et al 2013 the hirshfeld charge distributions of the four sas qn qn 1 and qn 1 were shown in tables s2 s5 see fig s26 for labels and the values of condensed fukui functions of each atom f i f i 0 and f i were obtained accordingly yang and mortier 1986 where f i 0 can be used to locate the most vulnerable sites of sas for radical attack the result revealed that the n atom from the aniline ring of each sas has the highest value of f i 0 indicating that the n atom in the aniline ring was most likely to react with radicals after radical attacking the formed radical cations of sas sas subsequently trapped h2o or o2 and further generated nitro sas via chain reactions interestingly for sas containing a six membered ring smm and smz the intermediates having the loss of so2 group from the parent compounds were observed smz 201 in fig s15 smm 217 in fig s19 previous researches reported that the so2 extrusion reaction occurred in those sas of six membered heterocyclic moiety by strong oxidants such as so4 ho and fevi feng et al 2019 yang et al 2018 these reactions are initiated via generating p substituted aniline radical cations of sas and single electron transfer set reactions are the likeliest reaction inducing these cations generating feng et al 2019 yang et al 2018 as all of the radicals ho ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are electrophilic i e pocessing great potential in abstracting electron from organic compounds set reaction was expected to be the initial step for so2 extrusion in the mos2 paa process which means that the relevant f i values of each atom should be used to locate the most reactive sites of sas in losing electrons as shown in tables s2 s5 the n atom and para c in aniline ring showed the largest values of f i among each sa indicating that aniline radical cations could be easily generated via set reaction after losing electrons at n or para c additionally the nucleophilic attack of n in six membered rings on para c in aniline ring proceeds to result in so2 extrusion as for those sas without six membered rings smx and sg so2 excursion did not occur this would be determined by the c n distances and the so2 n c n angles of radical cations of sas see fig s27 for labels feng et al 2019 as shown in fig s27 the angles of so2 n c n followed a sequence of sg 126 12 smx 122 93 smz 117 51 smm 117 48 the c n distances of sg 3 78 å and smx 3 50 å are longer than that of smm 3 26 å and smz 3 24 å and the longer distances stop the so2 excursion in sg and smx 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the mos2 paa process is a novel and effective method to degrade sas by selecting smm smz smx and sg as typical compounds paa can be effectively activated by mos2 to produce reactive radicals ho ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and 1o2 which led to the sas degradation the removal of the selected sas in the mos2 paa system followed a sequence of sg 60 0 smx 76 1 smz 91 6 smm 92 2 and the good efficiencies of all the selected sas degradation 60 suggested that the proposed mos2 paa process is an alternative method for treating sas containing waters influencing factors analysis by selecting smx as a target compound suggested that increased paa concentration 0 075 0 45 mm or mos2 0 1 0 4 g l dosages accelerated the sas removal and ph 3 was the optimal ph in this process dft calculation results revealed that the n atoms in aniline rings of sas were the most valuable sites in the mos2 paa process followed by the para c atom based on the identified oxidation products the degradation pathways of sas in the mos2 paa process were proposed in addition to the oxidizing amine groups to nitro

16834,sulfonamide antibiotics sas are typical antibiotics and have attracted increasing concerns about their wide occurrence in environment as well as potential risk for human health in this study we applied a novel advanced oxidation process in sas degradation by combining molybdenum sulfide and peracetic acid mos2 paa reactive oxygen species ros including ho ch3c o o ch3c o oo and 1o2 were generated from paa by mos2 activation and contributed to sas degradation the effects of initial ph the dosages of paa and mos2 and humic acid for sas degradation were further evaluated by selecting sulfamethoxazole smx as a target sa in the mos2 paa process results suggested that the optimum ph for smx removal was 3 where the degradation efficiency of smx was higher than 80 after reaction for 15 min increasing paa 0 075 0 45 mm or mos2 0 1 0 4 g l dosages facilitated the smx degradation while the presence of humic acids retarded the smx removal this mos2 paa process also showed good efficiencies in removing other sas including sulfaguanidine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamerazine their possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the products identification and dft calculation showing that apart from the oxidation of amine groups to nitro groups in sas mos2 paa induced so2 extrusion reaction for sas that contained six membered heterocyclic moieties graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid paa molybdenum sulfide mos2 sulfonamide antibiotics sas advanced oxidation process aop 1 introduction antibiotics are mainly used to treat bacterial infections and have become boons for human and animal health zhang et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 but the consumed antibiotics that entered into the environment via human wastes and animal manure are mainly in unchanged and active forms which may pose new threats to the ecosystems and human beings such as the birth of super bacteria duan et al 2017 hirsch et al 1999 zhou et al 2017a as a kind of typical antibiotics sulfonamides sas have been widely used in humans and livestock and thus their release from hospitals and livestock farms made these compounds frequently detected in sediments waters and soils sharma et al 2016 czekalski et al 2015 additionally their antibacterial nature made them hard to be removed by biological methods in wastewater treatment plants causing the accumulation of sas amounts in aquatic systems yang et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops are viewed as effective strategies in removing sas oturan and aaron 2014 clarizia et al 2017 generally these sas were effectively degraded in aops through reacting with reactive radicals such as sulfate and hydroxyl radicals so4 and ho yang et al 2018 these radicals possess relatively high redox potentials e 0 so4 2 6 3 1 v e 0 ho 1 9 2 7 v and thus show good ability in reacting with sas lee et al 2020 due to that these radicals are short lived where the half life period of so4 and ho were reported to be 30 40 and 1 μs respectively hu and long 2016 stable precursors such as persulfates and h2o2 are always required for providing so4 and ho through the breakage of oo bonds by energy or electron transfer reactions lee et al 2020 peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh an emerging oxidant could be also used as precursors for radical generation because it has the same oo bond structure as the commonly used h2o2 or persulfates paa has been drawing more and more attention for water treatment as a disinfectant in recent years due to its high oxidation power e 0 paa 1 0 1 7 v and low potential to form disinfection by products dbps zhang et al 2018 the oxidation ability of paa could be further improved after activation for producing ho and organic radicals ro which could be used as an alternative strategy for sas degradation luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 various methods have been successfully established in activating paa including energy input uv irradiation and heating and reducing paa by metal ions or heterogeneous catalysts kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 using heterogeneous catalysts in paa activation has received great attention with increased concern about the drawbacks of using these homogeneous activation methods for example fe2 paa process may lead to the accumulation of iron containing sludge which is viewed as secondary pollution pignatello et al 2006 while the homogeneous activated co2 paa system increased threats to human health due to the dissolved toxic and carcinogenic cobalt ions hu and long 2016 from this point developing heterogeneous catalysts for paa activation is necessary molybdenum sulfide mos2 is a kind of metal sulfide which has been extensively used in environmental fields for its excellent performance in heavy metal adsorption photochemical processes and co catalysts in aops chang et al 2016 wang and mi 2017 xing et al 2018 due to its low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility mos2 would be used as an environmental safe material in those processes liu et al 2014 it has also been used in direct activating peroxides such as persulfates and h2o2 with producing reactive oxygen species ros li et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and its good performance in peroxides activation motivated us to attempt using mos2 in activating paa ros would be generated from paa by mos2 activation analogous to its performance in other peroxides which would be a novel strategy to treat organic pollutants including sas as no research concerning this process mos2 paa the mechanism for paa activation and its performance in pollutants degradation should be comprehensively studied the first objective of this study was to reveal the mechanisms of paa activation by mos2 accompanied by disclosing the generated ros the second objective of this study is to clarify whether this proposed mos2 paa process could be used for sas degradation here we choose four widely used sas including sulfaguanidine sg sulfamonomethoxine smm sulfamerazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx as target pollutants zhang et al 2015 and their degradation pathways in the mos2 paa process were investigated additionally smx was selected to further study the possible influencing factors such as paa concentration mos2 dose initial ph and humic acids in the mos2 paa process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals with analytical grade at least were used

purification system micropure uv thermo fisher scientific germany paa was prepared by mixing h2o2 and ch3c o oh according to previous works wang et al 2020c chen et al 2018 h2o2 coexisted in the paa solution with the molar ratio of paa h2o2 being 1 2 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments were carried out in a 250 ml glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer stirring at a speed of 300 rpm desired amounts of target compounds and paa were added in the reactor then the solution ph was adjusted by diluted naoh or h2so4 immediately reactions were initiated when the solid mos2 at desired amounts were added in the solution reaction temperature was maintained at 25 c by a thermostat system aliquots were sampled at pre determined time intervals and quickly quenched by adding excess amounts of na2s2o3 these samples were then filtered through 0 22 μm acetate fiber membranes to remove mos2 solids for analysis all the batch experiments were performed at least twice and the errors in figures represent the standard deviation of the experimental data 2 3 analytical methods the stock solution of paa was titrated for calibration and the concentration of paa during experiments was measured spectrophotometrically wang et al 2020c nitrobenzene nb para chlorobenzoic acid pcba smm smz smx and sg were analyzed on an essentia lc 15c high performance liquid chromatography hplc system

mos2 it has been reported that peracids decomposition by metal ions via redox reactions and there are two competing pathways of the oo bond cleavage of peracids via eqs 1 and 2 sheldon and kochi 1981 as the presence of mos2 significantly accelerated the paa decomposition fig s1 it is proposed that the paa would undergo activation by mos2 to generate ho and ch3c o o similar to the reactions of eqs 1 and 2 which could be described in eqs 3 and 4 1 r c o o o h m n 1 r c o o m n h o 2 r c o o o h m n 1 r c o o m n o h 3 c h 3 c o o o h m o n 1 c h 3 c o o m o n h o 4 c h 3 c o o o h m o n 1 c h 3 c o o m o n h o in an attempt to check whether paa underwent catalyzation by mos2 via eq 3 we choose nb and pcba as typical ho probes in identifying the existence of ho cai et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020a fig 1 a shows that both of these two compounds were degraded in the mos2 paa process while the addition of 100 mm tba significantly inhibited their degradation as tba can scavenge ho 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but shows negligible reactivities towards other radicals from paa such as ch3c o o and ch3c o oo buxton et al 1988 cai et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020c it is concluded that the inhibition of nb and pcba removal was caused by quenching ho by excess tba in the mos2 paa system additionally the fluorescent probe terephthalic acid ta which can easily react with ho to generate highly fluorescent 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid taoh was used to probe the generated ho burns et al 2012 fig 1b shows that the fluorescence intensity around 450 nm in the mos2 paa process is stronger than that in the mos2 h2o2 process h2o2 0 3 mm indicating that the generated ho through the catalytic reaction of paa by mos2 is much more than that of the coexisted h2o2 0 25 mm esr technique was applied to examine the possible reactive radicals using 100 mm dmpo as trapping agents burns et al 2012 as shown in fig 1c the typical esr signal of dmpooh adduct was observed in mos2 paa system further confirming the existence of ho in the mos2 paa system this dmpooh signal was not originated from the coexisted h2o2 because there was no obvious dmpooh signal in the mos2 h2o2 process as for the reaction of eq 4 proving the existence of ch3c o o is necessary however the effective method in detecting ch3c o o in mos2 paa process is relatively limited recently activation of peroxymonosulfate pms by mos2 has been reported and sulfate radical so4 was confirmed in their experiments through alcohol quenching experiments zhou et al 2020 considering that paa has a similar oo bond structure to pms ch3c o o is proposed to generate in mos2 paa via reactions of eq 4 analogous to that in mos2 pms system to further confirm this deduction we attempted to use tempo which is a stable nitroxyl radical and has been extensively used as a radical probe and trapping agent for identifying ch3c o o barton et al 1998 yang et al 2017 as shown in fig s2 the ch3c o o tempo signal m z 216 1594 and r t at 11 7 min was successfully detected in the lc ms spectrum which was solid evidence for the generation of ch3c o o additionally the product of ch3 tempo m z 172 1696 and r t at 9 7 min was detected fig s3 this product was originated from ch3 generated from the decarboxylation of ch3c o o eq 5 in the mos2 paa system rokhina et al 2010 the discussion above strongly indicated that both ho and ch3c o o existed in the mos2 paa process in which paa was catalyzed by mos2 after contacting with paa mos2 exhibited a signal of sulfur vacancy at g 2 0 fig 2 a which suggested that active mo sites were exposed during the reaction xing et al 2018 to elucidate the interaction between paa and exposed mo raman measurements were carried out to characterize the fresh and used mos2 as shown in fig 2b two raman shifts located at 818 and 991 cm 1 were observed on the used mos2 corresponding to omo2 ag b1g and mo o ag b1g modes respectively suggesting the transformation of mo4 to mo6 according to the reported literatures sheng et al 2019 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the oxidation of mo4 to mo5 e mo cn 8 4 mo cn 8 3 0 725 v and further to mo6 e mo5 mo6 0 2 v by paa e ch3c o ooh 2h ch3c o oh h2o 1 0 1 7 v is thermodynamically favorable where paa acts as an electron acceptor in oxidizing mo sheldon and kochi 1981 zhang et al 2018 speight 2005 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals lumos of paa can be used to predict the electron accepting site in paa fig s4 shows that the lumos of paa are mainly located at the o atoms of the oo bond hence these two o atoms are both potential sites of accepting electrons from mo4 5 and the oo bond will be broken afterward the changes of the valence of mo in mos2 were compared by xps before and after reaction as shown in fig 2c there are two characteristic peaks with binding energy at 232 7 and 229 6 ev in the xps spectra corresponding to mo4 in the orbitals of mo in 3d5 2 and 3d3 2 respectively sheng et al 2019 there are no changes of the xps spectra in mo3d orbitals in the used mos2 and no characteristic peak of mo6 at 235 7 ev similar xps results of the used mos2 were reported in the fe2 pms mos2 system sheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020b a possible reason is that mo6 in the mos2 surface was unstable in the presence of paa and could be reduced by the coexisted h2o2 as proposed previously xing et al 2018 additionally according to the consensus of reducing paa by high valence of metal ions i e co and fe ao et al 2021 reaction of eq 6 was proposed to express the process of reducing mo6 5 ions by paa which was accompanied by the generation of ch3c o oo as both ho and ch3c o o have potential in abstracting h from the ooh bond in paa ch3c o oo is expected to be generated in this mos2 paa system via reactions of eqs 7 and 8 zhang and huang 2020 5 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 6 c h 3 c o o o h m o n c h 3 c o o o m o n 1 h 7 c h 3 c o o o h h o c h 3 c o o o h 2 o 8 c h 3 c o o o h c h 3 c o o c h 3 c

s5 moan and wold 1979 as no signals of tmp 1o2 adducts in mos2 h2o2 system was observed it could exclude the possibility of 1o2 formation via h2o2 activation by mos2 at the given condition noting that it still has tmp 1o2 signal in paa solution without mos2 at ph 3 1o2 could also be generated from paa where the ph value is lower than the pka i e 8 2 of this oxidant wang et al 2020c as shown in fig s5 the intensity of tmp 1o2 adducts in paa solution with mos2 was much stronger than that without mos2 which suggested that most of the 1o2 were originated from the activation of paa by mos2 rather than paa self decomposition eventually the overall reactions of 1o2 production in mos2 paa could be proposed as shown in eq 9 3 2 stability of mos2 as shown in fig s6 the diffraction peaks of mos2 at 2 theta values matched well with the standard pattern of 2h mos2 jcpds no 37 1492 hou et al 2021 after contacting with paa the used mos2 still exhibited a typical hexagonal structure as no obvious change in xrd pattern was observed compared with the fresh mos2 suggesting its stability in crystal structure after reaction the sem photographs of the fresh and used mos2 are shown in fig s7 the multi layered structure of mos2 remained unchanged after reaction showing morphology stability of mos2 after contacting with paa soluble mo ions from the release of mos2 were determined by icp oes analysis as shown in fig s8 soluble mo ions reached 3 0 mg l after reacting with 0 3 mm paa for 15 min meaning that only 1 6 of mo in mos2 would be dissociated in water it is known that the reaction between mos2 and h2o2 solution is spontaneous according to eq 10 the similar manner of mos2 dissolution in the presence of paa can be illustrated in eq 11 ruiz et al 2011 the remained mo in mos2 98 4 would be still highly reactive in activating paa noting that 1 6 mg l mo was detected in mos2 h2o2 process this mo leached from mos2 paa was expected to be partly from the reaction between mos2 and the coexisted h2o2 10 m o s 2 9 h 2 o 2 m o o 2 2 2 s o 4 2 2 h 8 h 2 o 11 m o s 2 9 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o m o o 2 2 2 s o 4 2 9 c h 3 c o o 11 h 3 3 comparison of different processes on the degradation of smx fig 3 compares the removal efficiency of smx in different processes no removal of smx was observed by 0 3 mm paa alone at the given condition while the presence of 0 3 g l mos2 might adsorb a small amount of smx 10 6 on its surface wang and mi 2017 in comparison the mos2 paa process showed the best performance in smx degradation achieving 76 1 loss of smx within 15 min it must be mentioned that the coexisted h2o2 0 25 mm in 0 3 mm paa might contribute to the smx removal in the mos2 paa process however only 18 7 of smx was degraded by mos2 h2o2 when the concentration of h2o2 was fixed at 0 3 mm suggesting that the coexisted mos2 h2o2 in mos2 paa was not the major process for smx removal as discussed in section 3 1 ho ch3c o o ch3c o oo and 1o2 are ros in the mos2 paa process all of these ros could be used for smx degradation as previously reported zhou et al 2017b zhang et al 2016b wang et al 2020c to reveal the contributions of these ros in the smx degradation excess amounts of tba 100 mm was added in the mos2 paa system concerning that tba is an effective quencher for ho but not for ch3c o o ch3c o oo or 1o2 the additional tba could be used to study the role of ho in smx degradation as shown in fig 3 the removal rate of smx decreased from 76 1 to 38 8 in the presence of tba suggesting that the generated ho via the reaction of eq 3 was a critical radical accounting for smx degradation in the mos2 paa system apart from the direct reaction with smx ho would be a dominant source for the generation of ch3c o oo according to the fast reaction between ho and paa eq 7 k ho paa 1 3 109 m 1 s 1 zhang and huang 2020 considering that ch3c o oo was the powerful oxidizing peroxyl radical and has high reactivity towards smx kim et al 2020 wang et al 2021 2020c we believe that the coexisted ch3c o oo also played essential roles in smx degradation in the mos2 paa process thus the excess amounts of tba reduced the concentrations of ch3c o oo as well which results in inhibiting the smx removal however excess amounts of tba cannot completely retard the smx degradation so other ros such as ch3c o o also played roles in the degradation of smx although 1o2 was generated in this system fig s5 its role for the smx degradation can be omitted due to the physical quenching of h2o text s2 additionally the addition of tba cannot inhibit the generation of ch3c o oo via eqs 6 and 8 these parts of ch3c o oo would be used in smx removal in the presence of tba 3 4 effectiveness of the recycled mos2 to evaluate the catalytic efficiencies of the used mos2 the removal efficiency of smx was evaluated by using recycled mos2 the collected mos2 after reaction was washed with ultrapure water and freeze dried however the recycled mos2 did not perform well in activating paa for smx removal as shown in fig s9 only 52 9 degradation of smx was achieved after the second reaction the removal rate of smx further decreased to 27 5 in the third cycle and finally kept around 16 after the fifth reaction similar results of pollutants degradation have been reported in pms based aops using metal sulfides fes2 mos2 as activators sheng et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 2018 xps spectrum fig s10 shows that s2 were the dominant s species of mos2 before and after reaction meaning that most of s in mos2 remained unchanged in valence but this spectrum could not well characterize the edge unsaturated s because the amounts of s atoms in edge sites of mos2 were less than that in other sites theoretically according to the reported mos2 pms process pms was not well activated by mos2 after the coordinatively unsaturated s was depleted sheng et al 2019 similarly the decreased efficiency of mos2 for paa activation might be explained by the loss of the unsaturated s it has reported that sulfides act as electron donor and used in reducing fe3 to fe2 in fes2 pms system we expect that the unsaturated s in mos2 could also be used in reducing mo6 5 to mo5 4 in the mos2 paa process zhou et al 2018 after reaction for several times the completely removed unsaturated s would lower the regeneration rate of mo5 4 leading to low yields of ho and ch3c o o according to eqs 3 and 4 3 5 effects of initial paa concentration and mos2 dose the effect of paa concentration was studied at ph 3 with fixing the mos2 dose at 0 3 g l fig 4 a after reaction for 15 min the removal rate of smx increased from 45 1 to 85 1 when the initial paa concentration increased from 0 075 to 0 45 mm and the observed corresponding rate constant of smx removal k obs increased from 0 040 to 0 125 min 1 as paa acts as a critical source of ros i e ho ch3c o o ch3c o oo and 1o2 it is obvious that increased paa concentration accelerated the smx degradation the coexisted h2o2 concentration also increased with increasing paa concentration which facilitated the smx removal to some extent as mos2 h2o2 also contributed to smx degradation fig 3 fig 4b shows that the removal rate of smx after reaction for 15 min increased from 41 0 to 86 1 with elevating mos2 dosage from 0 1 to 0 4 g l accompanied with the corresponding k obs for smx degradation raising from 0 035 to 0 128 min 1 apart from the roles of the paa activation accelerated by increasing mos2 dosage the increased mos2 would trigger more smx adsorbed on its surface wang and mi 2017 3 6 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph on smx degradation in the mos2 paa system was evaluated with initial paa and mos2 dosages being 0 3 mm and 0 3 g l respectively as shown in fig 5 the removal rate of smx after 15 min decreased from 76 1 to 0 8 with increasing initial ph from 3 to 11 showing an obvious inhibition rate of smx at higher ph values in the selected ph range additionally the variation of ph during the reaction was monitored in this system as shown in fig s11 the ph value gradually decreased when the initial ph varied from 4 to 9 which could be explained by the fact that the unsaturated s atoms could bind with protons to form h2s xing et al 2018 the generated sulfur vacancy exposed reactive mo on the mos2 surface and this process is ph dependent because more hydrogen ions h can be used to bind with s atoms at lower ph values zhou et al 2020 due to the large amount of h the more reactive mo could be exposed at acetic conditions which prompted the paa activation in oxidating smx as for the released h2s it is expected to contain no capability in activating paa for smx degradation as little to no removal of smx was observed in the na2s paa system fig s12a additionally the formed h2s have potential in consuming more ros and peroxides in the mos2 paa process e h2s s 2h 0 142 v which was supported by the inhibiting role of h2s in smx degradation fig s12b as well as the generated insoluble sulfur from the reaction between paa and h2s fig s12c david 2010 thus there are two opposite roles in the mos2 paa process for smx removal at a lower ph value on one hand mos2 could expose more reactive mo for the paa activation on the other hand the released h2s have adverse impacts on the smx degradation but these impacts were minor because the better removal of smx was acquired at a lower solution ph 3 7 effect of ha humic substance a key component in natural waters is one of the most important factors affecting the pollutants degradation in aops in the mos2 paa system we choose humic acid ha as a reference humic substance to investigate the performance of humic substance on smx degradation when the ha concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg l the removal rate of smx decreased by 56 1 fig s13 ha is a scavenger for reactive species such as ho and ro and the reported second order rate constants for ha reacting with ho and ro were 2 5 104 and 5 8 104 mg l respectively chen et al 2018 thus ha was overwhelmingly capable to consume ho and ro in the mos2 paa process and reduced the removal efficiencies of smx besides the scavenging effect ha might be adsorbed on the mos2 surface and inhibited the catalysis reaction wang and mi 2017 3 8 degradation of other sulfonamides by the mos2 paa process to further test the potential of the mos2 paa process for sas degradation the treatment of other three commonly used and detected sas including sg smm and smz was evaluated as shown in fig 6 all of the selected compounds can be effectively degraded by the mos2 paa process within 15 min and the degradation efficiencies among the three sulfonamides and smx shown in fig 3 followed a sequence of sg 60 0 smx 76 1 smz 91 6 smm 92 2 as good degradation efficiencies of all the selected sas 60 were observed it is concluded that the mos2 paa process is suitable for sas degradation similar to the results obtained from the smx 100 mm tba inhibited the removal of all these sas sg smm and smz meaning that ho played essential roles in oxidizing these sas based on the aforementioned discussion other ros such as ch3c o oo ch3c o o and or 1o2 were also expected to contribute to these sas degradation 3 9 possible degradation pathways of sulfonamides in the mos2 paa process to reveal the possible degradation pathways of sas in the mos2 paa process a u hplc q exactive orbitrap hrms system was employed to identify the oxidized products of sas sg smz smx and smm additionally their ms2 fragments are offered in figs s14 s25 errors of m z between the calculated and experimental values were 5 ppm based on the identified oxidation products of sas possible degradation pathways of sas in the mos2 paa process were proposed in fig 7 among all of the selected sas the amine groups on the benzene ring could be oxidized to nitro groups in the mos2 paa system for example the m z of sg is 215 0598 esi and the oxidation product of sg sg 245 m z 245 0336 was observed after oxidation to further disclose the sas degradation pathways in mos2 paa the feasible reactive sites of sas were calculated by density functional theory dft at b3lyp 6 311g basis set frisch et al 2013 the hirshfeld charge distributions of the four sas qn qn 1 and qn 1 were shown in tables s2 s5 see fig s26 for labels and the values of condensed fukui functions of each atom f i f i 0 and f i were obtained accordingly yang and mortier 1986 where f i 0 can be used to locate the most vulnerable sites of sas for radical attack the result revealed that the n atom from the aniline ring of each sas has the highest value of f i 0 indicating that the n atom in the aniline ring was most likely to react with radicals after radical attacking the formed radical cations of sas sas subsequently trapped h2o or o2 and further generated nitro sas via chain reactions interestingly for sas containing a six membered ring smm and smz the intermediates having the loss of so2 group from the parent compounds were observed smz 201 in fig s15 smm 217 in fig s19 previous researches reported that the so2 extrusion reaction occurred in those sas of six membered heterocyclic moiety by strong oxidants such as so4 ho and fevi feng et al 2019 yang et al 2018 these reactions are initiated via generating p substituted aniline radical cations of sas and single electron transfer set reactions are the likeliest reaction inducing these cations generating feng et al 2019 yang et al 2018 as all of the radicals ho ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are electrophilic i e pocessing great potential in abstracting electron from organic compounds set reaction was expected to be the initial step for so2 extrusion in the mos2 paa process which means that the relevant f i values of each atom should be used to locate the most reactive sites of sas in losing electrons as shown in tables s2 s5 the n atom and para c in aniline ring showed the largest values of f i among each sa indicating that aniline radical cations could be easily generated via set reaction after losing electrons at n or para c additionally the nucleophilic attack of n in six membered rings on para c in aniline ring proceeds to result in so2 extrusion as for those sas without six membered rings smx and sg so2 excursion did not occur this would be determined by the c n distances and the so2 n c n angles of radical cations of sas see fig s27 for labels feng et al 2019 as shown in fig s27 the angles of so2 n c n followed a sequence of sg 126 12 smx 122 93 smz 117 51 smm 117 48 the c n distances of sg 3 78 å and smx 3 50 å are longer than that of smm 3 26 å and smz 3 24 å and the longer distances stop the so2 excursion in sg and smx 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the mos2 paa process is a novel and effective method to degrade sas by selecting smm smz smx and sg as typical compounds paa can be effectively activated by mos2 to produce reactive radicals ho ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and 1o2 which led to the sas degradation the removal of the selected sas in the mos2 paa system followed a sequence of sg 60 0 smx 76 1 smz 91 6 smm 92 2 and the good efficiencies of all the selected sas degradation 60 suggested that the proposed mos2 paa process is an alternative method for treating sas containing waters influencing factors analysis by selecting smx as a target compound suggested that increased paa concentration 0 075 0 45 mm or mos2 0 1 0 4 g l dosages accelerated the sas removal and ph 3 was the optimal ph in this process dft calculation results revealed that the n atoms in aniline rings of sas were the most valuable sites in the mos2 paa process followed by the para c atom based on the identified oxidation products the degradation pathways of sas in the mos2 paa process were proposed in addition to the oxidizing amine groups to nitro groups so2 extrusion reaction was found in smm and smz and was proposed as a unique pathway in the oxidation of sas containing six membered heterocyclic moieties in the mos2 paa process declaration of
