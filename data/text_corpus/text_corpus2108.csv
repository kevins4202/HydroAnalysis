10540,irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer management inm are essential for maize production in northwest china the conventional inm in which irrigation of about 90 120 mm is carried out four or five times with large nitrogen n fertilizer inputs approximately 450 kg n ha 1 generally result in low water use efficiency wue and n use efficiency nue with a series of environmental pollution problems the main objective of this study was to optimize the inm for spring maize using the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 the rzwqm2 was first calibrated and verified based on a two year experiment the nrmses normalized root mean square errors for the simulated grain yield aboveground biomass plant n uptake and grain n uptake were 7 02 6 75 10 73 and 12 40 respectively in the calibration period were 9 73 7 96 12 00 and 15 34 respectively in the validation period the nrmses for the simulated soil water content and soil nitrate n content at different depths ranged from 8 29 to 24 52 and from 13 34 to 32 83 across the calibration and validation period respectively the calibrated model was used to investigate grain yield biomass plant level wue wuep and plant level nue nuep under different transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of maize plants simulation results indicated that the maize plants with high wuep generally have high nuep and reducing transpiration is an effective way to improve either wuep or nuep furthermore the calibrated model was used to evaluate different inm options including n application rates split n strategies and irrigation strategies based on simulation results split n application is not necessary if water drainage is effectively controlled the optimal n fertilizer rate is 200 kg ha 1 n and is encouraged to be applied once as a base fertilizer the irrigation practice in which irrigation is adopted to refill the primary root zone prz 0 60 cm to available water capacity awc when available water in the prz decreases to 15 awc achieved the highest wue 2 23 kg m 3 among all alternative irrigation practice options with a high grain yield 12 6 t ha 1 and so is recommended compared with conventional inm the optimal inm decreased irrigation amount by 14 7 water drainage by 53 7 and n leaching by 80 5 but increased wue by 8 9 with a comparable grain yield keywords rzwqm2 spring maize irrigation nitrogen fertilizer wue grain yield 1 introduction the shiyang river basin in northwest china is a typical inland basin with typical arid to semiarid features hu et al 2016 spring maize is the most widely grown food crop in the region accounting for more than 34 of the total crop planted area liu et al 2018 irrigation water mainly from groundwater is the main source of water consumed by crops for high yield due to little precipitation approximately 160 mm per year hu et al 2016 shi et al 2018 the growing population and shrinking arable land area prompt increased irrigation and nitrogen n application for higher maize production during the growing season conventional irrigation typically as flood irrigation with high irrigation amount 90 120 mm in each irrigation event and large n fertilizer inputs 400 kg ha 1 generally result in nonnegligible water drainage and n leaching and achieve low water and n use efficiencies wue nue li et al 2005 a series of environmental problems associated with excessive water and n application have been reported in the region the groundwater level in the shiyang river basin declined by more than 22 m from 1977 to 2015 hu et al 2016 elevated no3 n concentrations in water particularly groundwater are prevalent and high n application is one contributing factor ma et al 2009 thus conventional irrigation and nitrogen application can hardly ensure sustainable maize production in the study area optimizing irrigation and nitrogen management inm for the enhanced nue and wue of crops is an effective way to achieve a balance among high crop production low resource consumption and environmental protection fang et al 2008 hu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 the application of n synchronizing with spatial and temporal variability in crop demand is considered to be judicious n management and split n application can be one option to decrease the n application rate and n loss without compromised grain yield abrol et al 2012 nitrogen and water are codependent management factors that cannot be completely evaluated as independent factors hu et al 2010 a suitable irrigation strategy is beneficial to save either water or n deficit irrigation di which imposes timely moderate water stress on crops is a widely used water saving strategy fereres 2007 primary root zone irrigation przi as a special type of di in which soil water monitoring and soil water replenishment are restricted to the primary root zone prz top 60 cm soil layer was recommended for surface irrigated maize production by previous studies panda et al 2004 greaves and wang 2017 zhou et al 2019 przi eliminates the monitoring of soil water status in deep soil layers is more convenient and can achieve higher wue with comparable grain yield compared with those of conventional irrigation strategies greaves and wang 2017 zhou et al 2019 hence przi combined with split n application may be an alternative inm practice to achieve enhanced wue and nue with high grain yield of spring maize the keys of which are the suitable irrigation trigger point itp n application rate and split n method the effects of inm on crop yield wue nue water drainage and n leaching are the interactions of n application irrigation and climate factors cameira et al 2014 the long term investigation of the performances of a large number of inm options is necessary to achieve the optimal alternative inm practice liu et al 2011 it is usually time consuming and costly to optimize inm via long term field experiments in addition some observational targets e g water drainage n leaching for assessing inm practices are not accurately obtained under field conditions hu et al 2010 by contrast crop simulation models taking into account weather related risks and seasonal variability are low cost and efficient tools for simulating the effects of inm practices on crop growth and environment fang et al 2008 numerous cropping systems models have been developed including rzwqm2 ma et al 2001 dssat liu et al 2011 epic easterling et al 1997 apsim keating et al 2003 and aquacrop khoshravesh et al 2013 rzwqm2 has advanced features of simulating soil water and n dynamics and shows good performance in simulating the effects of soil water and n deficits on crop growth by coupling with the embedded ceres models fang 2017 ma et al 2012 hence the rzwqm2 was used to assess inm options and analyze water and nitrogen uptake and utilization of spring maize plants in this study optimizing inm has two main approaches one is to minimize the apparent loss of water and n except crop absorption e g soil evaporation water drainage and n leaching and the other is to improve wue and nue at the plant level abrol et al 2012 the objectives of this work were to use the rzwqm2 model to 1 analyze characteristics of transpiration and plant n uptake in maize plants and their effects on grain yield biomass plant level wue wuep and plant level nue nuep providing theoretical support for optimizing inm and to 2 optimize the alternative inm practice claimed by this study including itp n application rate and its distribution between base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer for enhanced wue and high grain yield with less water drainage and n leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region a two year 2016 and 2018 field experiment was established at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university gansu province china 102 50 e 37 52 n the study site has a temperate continental arid climate with mean annual sunshine of about 3000 h the mean annual potential evaporation is more than 1500 mm with mean annual precipitation of 164 mm given the low groundwater table 40 m at the experimental site groundwater cannot affect the water utilization of spring maize qin et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the average air temperature and precipitation during the spring maize growing season april to september were 18 4 c and 84 6 mm in 2016 18 6 c and 182 8 mm in 2018 and 17 8 c and 135 9 mm in the long term 1981 2016 respectively the total reference crop evapotranspiration during the spring maize growing season in 2016 and 2018 were 568 and 507 mm respectively fig 1 physical and chemical parameter values for the soil profile from 0 1 m in the experimental field soil were measured about a week before sowing and are shown in table 1 2 2 field experiments pioneer 335 a widely used maize zea mays l cultivar was used in this study seeds were oversown manually with 0 4 m row spacing on 28 april and 1 may in 2016 and 2018 respectively at the four leaf stage the planting density was decreased to approximately 86 000 plants ha 1 by thinning out redundant seedlings spring maize was harvested on 25 september 2016 and 24 september 2018 in 2016 there were three irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 with different predefined levels of effective rooting depth rd the rds were used to calculate irrigation rate i mm per irrigation event as 1 i 10 r d θ t θ i where the rd cm values were 40 50 and 60 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively θt cm3 cm 3 is the targeted soil water content swc within the rd and was set as field water capacity θfc in the study θi cm3 cm 3 is the swc within the rd before irrigation for the three treatments in 2016 irrigation was applied when the swc in 0 40 cm soil layer decreased to 60 θfc t1 t2 and t3 had similar and high grain yield table 5 in 2016 indicating maize plants in the three treatments were subjected to similar and moderate water stress to investigate the performance of the rzwqm2 model in the simulation of maize responses to different water stress levels two additional irrigation treatments t4 and t5 besides t1 t2 t3 were carried out in 2018 to expand water stress levels under the investigation the preliminary design of t4 was no irrigation treatment however during the field experiment of t4 we found that the swc without the replenishment by irrigation could be fatal for maize at seedling stage and tassel stage and so two irrigations with small irrigation amount were adopted on 31 may and 18 july to prevent deadly soil water deficit t5 was defined as no water deficit treatment in which irrigation was applied when the swc in 0 100 cm soil layer decreased to 70 θfc according to chai et al 2016 maize plants under t5 do not suffer from water stress rd value in t5 was 100 cm and irrigation amount per irrigation event in t5 was calculated as eq 1 border irrigation was applied in the study for each treatment in both years an unscheduled 30 mm irrigation was adopted at dough stage on 15 september 2016 and 13 september 2018 to ensure crop water consumption at later growth stages moreover in 2018 an unscheduled irrigation of 24 mm was adopted on 31 may for the other treatments besides t4 to prevent soil water deficit at the seedling stage the irrigation date and amount per application for all treatments in 2016 and 2018 are shown in table 2 there were 9 plots in 2016 and 15 plots in 2018 the plots each of which was 36 m2 6 m 6 m with a 1 m wide buffer zone were arranged in a randomized block design with three replicates per treatment according to local fertilization management each plot under t1 t2 and t3 received 238 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate 90 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate and 216 kg n ha 1 as urea before sowing and an additional 168 kg n ha 1 as urea at the tassel stage in both years in order to investigate the performance of the rzwqm2 model in the simulation of maize responses to different n application levels the n application rate in t4 and t5 were different from that in t1 t2 and t3 in 2018 t4 and t5 received 90 kg n ha 1 as urea before sowing accompanying the application of 238 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 t4 and t5 did not receive any n fertilizer except for the base n fertilizer in both years all plots were irrigated uniformly before sowing to obtain θfc as a starting value and to provide enough moisture for optimum germination the swc within the 0 1 m soil depth leaf area index lai crop phenology anthesis stage and physiological maturity and grain yield were measured in this study which were described in detail in our previous study zhou et al 2019 soil samples for soil no3 n content snc were taken every 0 1 m depth until 1 m depth in each plot at seedling emergence the tassel stage the silking stage and at physiological maturity soil no3 n in soil samples after air drying was extracted with a 2 mol l 1 kcl solution soil to liquid ratio of 1 10 and the extracts were measured on an auto analyzer iii aa3 bran luebbe germany to determine the sncs in the soil samples at harvest ten plants per plot were sampled randomly to determine aboveground biomass plant n uptake and grain n uptake each plant was cut off at ground surface and was separated into stems including stalk leaf sheaths tassel and husks leaves grains and cobs then these plant parts were dried to constant mass in an air oven at 75 c and weighed the oven dried plant parts were ground finely 1 mm for analysis of n content in each plant part using the kjeldahl method sáez plaza et al 2013 the plant n uptake was the sum of n uptake in each plant part which was calculated as dry matter weight of each plant part multiplied by n content of the corresponding plant part 2 3 rzwqm2 model description and parameterization the rzwqm2 model version 2 70 2014 is a one dimensional and process based cropping systems model running at a daily time step ma et al 2001 the green ampt infiltration equation is used to describe surface soil water infiltration process in the model the model uses poiseuille s equation and richard s equation to simulate macropore flow and redistribution of soil water respectively the potential evapotranspiration rates are calculated by shuttleworth wallace equations shuttleworth and wallace 1985 rzwqm2 supplies multiple choices including generic crop growth models cropgro models ceres models the quick plant and quick turf models or the quick tree models for the simulation of crop growth the ceres maize model supplied rzwqm2 with the simulation of spring maize development and computed daily n and water stress factors in this study the rzwqm2 model requires inputs of daily weather data initial soil conditions soil property data and field management data more details of rzwqm2 have been described by ma et al 2001 according to ma et al 1998 an initialization run of 10 years using historical weather data 2007 2016 based on measured soil organic c levels in table1 was conducted to obtain soil organic c equilibrium in terms of experimental data sets including crop phenology lai aboveground biomass grain yield plant n uptake grain n uptake snc and swc from t1 t2 and t3 in the 2016 season a set of parameters cultivar parameters soil hydraulic parameters and soil n dynamics parameters in rzwqm2 was optimized using parameter estimation software pest embedded in the model pest has been widely used to optimize model parameters in rzwqm2 fang et al 2017 kisekka et al 2017 the cultivar parameters were p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint which were described in detail in table 3 the soil hydraulic parameters included saturated hydraulic conductivity ks θfc and permanent wilting point θwp at different soil depths the soil n dynamics parameters were nitrification rate anit and hydrolysis rate au in pest the weights for various categories of observations which are used to weight the importance of each category of observations need to be set according to malone et al 2010 the model parameter values achieved by pest with improper weights may result in excessive local errors in simulation of a certain category of observations or a certain treatment adopting suitable weights for various categories of observations is crucial for pest to achieve the optimal model parameter values in the study the optimal weights of various categories of observations in pest were determined by the trial and error methods yang et al 2013 additionally the soil root growth factor srgf affecting swc and snc dynamics was also calibrated manually using trial and error methods during calibrations as model inputs the initial swc and snc in the top 1 m soil profile on planting came from the measured results in 2016 shown in table1 the optimized values of cultivar parameters soil hydraulic parameters and soil n dynamics parameters in rzwqm2 are listed in table 3 the other parameters related to processes of nitrogen and carbon cycle were set as default values in rzwqm2 some parameters related to evapotranspiration et were also set based on the measured data from t3 with the highest irrigation amount in 2016 i e maximum plant hmax shoot biomass of plants with 0 5 hmax and residue cover factor qi et al 2016 found that the simulation of plant height may affect the potential et calculations in rzwqm2 plant height is not simulated in ceres maize model in rzwqm2 plant height is calculated by eq 2 and 3 qi et al 2016 2 h e i g h t h max 1 e α s h b i o 2 h max 3 α 2 h max ln 0 5 s t e m h a l f where shbio is shoot biomass simulated in the model height is canopy height cm and α is a constant and stem half is the shbio at 0 5 hmax in this study the measured value of hmax 304 cm was adopted in rzwqm2 and the stem half was set as 56 6 g plant 1 which is the shbio of plants with height of 147 cm the crop residue on the soil surface was negligible in actual production and so the residue cover factor was set as 0 in the model the albedos of wet soil dry soil and crop were set as default values 0 3 for dry soil 0 02 for wet soil and 0 43 for crop at maturity subsequently the calibrated model was validated based on the data pairs from five treatments in the 2018 season in the simulations for model validation the initial swc and snc in the top 1 m soil profile on planting were set according to the measured results in 2018 shown in table1 2 4 scenario simulations with historical weather data daily weather data on minimum air temperature maximum air temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed and sunshine hours were downloaded for the past 36 years 1981 2016 from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn daily sunshine hours were conversed to daily solar radiation using the angstrom equation recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 based on the 36 year weather data this study used the calibrated rzwqm2 to analyze transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of maize plants and to optimize inm practice the calibrated model was run continuously from 1981 to 2016 according to each simulated scenario in the two simulations input data of rzwqm2 on the crop management practices including p and k fertilizer application irrigation method planting date and density and harvest coefficient were determined by reference to the operations used in the field experiment given conventional presowing irrigation was adopted to obtain θfc as a starting swc in actual production of maize the initial swcs along the 1 m soil profile were reset to θfc on planting date at the start of the simulations in each year the initial sncs along the 1 m soil profile were set to the averages of two years of field measurements shown in table 1 in these scenarios itp was expressed as the percentage of available water capacity awc the awc is the difference between θfc and θwp dobarco et al 2019 in the sections below we describe the other details of the two simulation cases 2 5 case 1 analyzing transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of maize plants under these simulation scenarios irrigation was adopted to refill the root zone 0 1 m layer to awc when soil water in the soil profile decreased to itp at the seedling stage from emergence to the 6 leaf stage soil water deficit should be prevented so a high itp of 45 was adopted for all simulation scenarios after the seedling stage nine levels of itp 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 were designed to impose different levels of water stress on maize plants the simulation scenario with lower itp produced more severe water deficit due to the lower swc in top 60 cm layer before irrigation there were ten total n application rates from 0 to 450 kg ha 1 in 50 kg ha 1 increments referring to conventional n fertilizer management total n application rate was divided into base fertilizer and topdressing at ratio of 40 60 the base fertilizer and topdressing were applied at sowing and the silking stage respectively the case was conducted as a 9 itp 10 n fertilizer rate factorial treatment structure and so contained 90 scenarios with all possible combinations the 3240 sets of simulation results including transpiration plant n uptake grain yield and biomass can be obtained by carrying out each scenario using rzwqm2 model for 36 years based on these simulation results this study analyzed the characteristics of transpiration and plant n uptake in maize plants and their effects on grain yield biomass wuep and nuep the wuep kg m 3 and nuep kg kg 1 were calculated as 4 w u e p y 10 t r 5 n u e p y n u p t a k e where y is dry grain yield kg ha 1 tr is seasonal transpiration mm nuptake is plant n uptake kg ha 1 2 6 case 2 optimizing water and nitrogen management practice the przi was optimized as an alternative inm practice irrigation was carried out to bring soil water within the top 60 cm layer to awc when soil water in the layer decreased to itp an itp of 45 was adopted at the seedling stage to prevent soil water deficit after the seedling stage four levels of itp 5 10 15 and 20 were investigated some studies aimed at reducing n fertilizer rate in the study area have been carried out chen et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 according to chen et al 2011 the n rate of 250 kg ha 1 is enough to achieve high grain yield hence in n management options the upper limit of test range of n application rates was set as 250 kg ha 1 and there were five total n application rates 50 100 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 we try to further reduce n application rate by split n application in this study the total n input was divided into base fertilizer and topdressing in a certain proportion which were applied at sowing and the silking stage respectively split n applications between base fertilizer and topdressing were tested under each total n fertilizer rate at six ratios 0 100 20 80 40 60 60 40 80 20 and 100 0 there were 120 scenarios of alternative inm options with a 4 itp 5 n fertilizer rate 6 split n strategy factorial treatment structure additionally the conventional inm was also simulated and evaluated by rzwqm2 using historical weather data in this study the details of the conventional inm were investigated by studying existing literature shi et al 2018 wang et al 2016 and interviewing the local farmers in conventional irrigation practice irrigation typically as flood irrigation of about 90 120 mm is carried out four or five times to prevent water stress the irrigation timing in the conventional irrigation practice is generally determined based on the experience of farmers which can not be achieved in rzwqm2 an alternative irrigation practice similar to the conventional irrigation in which irrigation was adopted to improve swc in 0 1 m soil layer to 100 θfc when swc in 0 1 m soil layer decreased to 65 θfc was adopted in the simulation of conventional inm as a result the irrigation amount per application in the simulation of conventional inm was about 100 mm which approximates the 90 120 mm in the conventional irrigation practice in actual production moreover the simulation results of conventional inm indicated that the alternative irrigation practice had similar irrigation frequency and crop water status no water stress as the conventional irrigation practice therefore it is reasonable to use the alternative irrigation practice in the simulation of conventional inm the conventional n application rate is 450 kg ha 1 which is applied in two splits at sowing 40 of the total n and silking stage 60 of the total n 2 7 statistical analysis in either model calibration or validation the

snc dynamics were simulated well in either the calibration or validation data set the swc simulations in each soil layer resulted in rmses between 0 020 cm3 cm 3 nrmse 8 29 mrd 16 31 d index 0 55 and

while they were smaller than that reported by fang et al 2008 the good performance of rzwqm2 in simulation of swc may be attributed to the calibration of soil hydraulic parameters it is benefit for improving the simulation of swc using rzwqm2 to calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters especially for the laboratory measured ones ma et al 2012 kisekka et al 2017 for simulated snc in each soil layer the rmses ranged between 1 07 and 7 15 mg kg 1 the nrmses were between 13 34 and 32 83 the mrds were between 27 91 and 33 85 and the d index values were between 0 44 and 0 99 table 4 the mean

the study by fang et al 2008 who simulated sns in 1 m soil profile with rmses ranging from 41 1 to 67 7 kg ha 1 similar high accuracy in simulated sns by rzwqm2 with small nrmses 11 9 19 0 was reported by xu et al 2020 the good simulations of snc and sns are closely related to the high accuracy soil water dynamics simulation ma et al 2001 in terms of nrmse the largest error in the simulation of swc and snc occurred in the top 30 cm soil layer similar results were reported by fang et al 2008 and xu et al 2020 who found that the simulated swc and snc in top soil layer had a greater deviation from the measured data than those in deeper layers the surface soil water and no3 n dynamics were caused by many factors irrigation rainfall and soil evaporation to which rzwqm2 was less responsive fang et al 2008 hu et al 2006 3 1 2 crop phenology and lai the lai simulations of spring maize were similar to our observations with rmses between 0 38 nrmse 8 2 mrd 17 55 d index 0 82

5 the observed anthesis and physiological maturity in t4 suffering severe soil water deficit were 4 days later and 5 days earlier than that in t1 in 2018 with sufficient supplies of water and nitrogen respectively edmeades et al 1993 confirmed that water deficits can delay flowering and accelerate senescence of maize to some extent however the model did not show differences in crop phenology among different treatments in either 2016 or 2018 similar results were shown in previous studies li and sun 2016 ma et al 2012 this was because the phenology simulation in the current model was mainly based on meteorological factors such as temperature and photoperiod without consideration of the secondary influences of water and n stress mcmaster et al 2008 it is a challenge to accurately simulate the development stage of corn to water stresses using the ceres maize crop model hybrid in rzwqm2 which has been widely acknowledged in previous studies ma et al 2012 li and sun 2016 3 1 3 biomass grain yield and n uptake good agreement between simulated and observed grain yield was obtained with rmses of 0 97 t ha 1 nrmse 7 02 mrd 6 14 d index 0 62 in 2016 and 1 16 t ha 1 nrmse 9 73 mrd 3 62 d index 0 96 in 2018 table 5 the aboveground biomass was underpredicted slightly compared with that of observations in all treatments in both years table 5 which corresponds with the results of the previous study by xu et al 2020 the rmse nrmse mdr and d index of the aboveground biomass simulations were 1 78 t ha 1 6 75 6 82 and 0 45 in 2016 respectively were 1 86 t ha 1 7 96 6 79 and 0 95 in 2018 respectively the plant n uptake in all treatments of the two growing seasons except for that of t5 with rmses of 35 75 kg ha 1 nrmse 10 73 mrd 10 70 d index 0 62 in 2016 and 32 37 kg ha 1 nrmse 12 00 mrd 7 45 d index 0 92 in 2018 table 5 similar performance of rzwqm in simulation of plant n uptake with rmse from 29 to 37 kg ha 1 was reported by hu et al 2006 as shown in table 5 the grain n uptake in all treatments of the two growing seasons except for that of t4 and t5 was underpredicted with rmses of 29 21 kg ha 1 nrmse 12 40 mrd 12 28 d index 0 37 in 2016 and 28 01 kg ha 1 nrmse 15 34 mrd 0 54 d index 0 88 in 2018 the simulations of plant n uptake and grain n uptake were less accurate than the simulations of grain yield and aboveground biomass in this study which was also reported by fang et al 2008 and ma et al 2007 ma et al 2007 suggested that it is needed for rzwqm2 to further enhance the simulation of n uptake and partitioning in the plant in the study the underpredicted of plant n uptake and grain n uptake could be due to the underpredicted grain yield and aboveground biomass 3 2 transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of high yielding maize plants as shown in fig 4 the high yielding maize zea mays l pioneer 335 had a maximum transpiration of approximately 600 mm which is slightly higher than the maximum transpiration approximately 540 mm reported by zhai et al 2010 in a study in the same area a transpiration of high yielding maize over 600 mm 640 mm was also reported by basso and ritchie 2018 the high yielding spring maize had a similar maximum plant n uptake 400 kg ha 1 to the result by zhang et al 2017 there is an interaction between plant transpiration and n uptake transpiration provides the driving force for plant n uptake von caemmerer and baker 2007 the minimum transpiration to maintain plant n uptake had a nearly linear increase with increasing n uptake from approximately 100 to 400 kg ha 1 ranging from approximately 90 to 380 mm in turn plant n uptake could also affect transpiration by changing the morpho physiological and biochemical attributes of crops ashraf et al 2016 the maximum transpiration at a given plant n uptake increased sharply as the plant n uptake varied from 65 to 90 kg ha 1 and continued to increase as the plant n uptake levels varied from 90 to 240 kg ha 1 and then maintained at a stable level of approximately 600 mm the plant n uptake of 240 kg ha 1 is enough to prevent transpiration from being restricted by plant n uptake the maize variety had the potential to produce up to 17 8 t ha 1 grain yield 34 4 t ha 1 biomass 4 1 kg m 3 wuep and 79 6 kg kg 1 nuep higher transpiration and plant n uptake are more likely to achieve higher grain yield and biomass the transpiration of 350 mm and plant n uptake of 170 kg ha 1 were sufficient to achieve high grain 14 t ha 1 and biomass 27 t ha 1 yields wuep and nuep were limited by low plant n uptake 200 kg ha 1 especially wuep when plant n uptake exceeded 200 kg ha 1 ideal wuep 3 4 kg m 3 and nuep 70 kg kg 1 were achieved hence there was no close relationship between plant n uptake and either wuep or nuep when plant n uptake exceeded a certain threshold 200 kg ha 1 in the study the transpiration determines wuep and nuep to a large extent in this study plants with the lower transpiration achieved higher wuep at a given plant n uptake within 200 400 kg ha 1 additionally the maize plants with high wuep generally have high nuep accordingly a reasonable inm practice should primarily control transpiration reducing transpiration as much as possible on the premise of satisfying the requirements of high yield for transpiration and n uptake it should be noted that the extremely low values of simulated grain yield biomass plant n uptake and transpiration of maize plants may be very different from the real values for example the maize plants with less than 100 mm transpiration can achieve about 1 4 t ha 1 grain yield according to the simulation results while it is impossible to produce grain yield using so little transpiration in actual production these extremely low values of model outputs were generally achieved in the simulations of maize growth under extreme soil water deficit although the applicability of rzwqm2 for the simulation of maize growth under extreme soil water deficit was not tested in the study dokoohaki et al 2017 and saseendran et al 2008 claimed the accuracy of the ceres maize model hybrid in rzwqm2 under extreme soil water deficit is significantly lower that under suitable soil water condition luckily these extremely low values of model outputs did not disturb the exploring of reasonable inm practice 3 3 optimizing water and nitrogen management practice the simulated grain yield transpiration and wue in conventional inm were approximately 12 7 t ha 1 476 mm and 2 04 kg m 3 respectively fig 5 the swc in the prz largely determines the transpiration of crops which in turn correlates with crop yield and wue yu et al 2007 ahmadi et al 2015 in this study grain yield transpiration and wue were effectively regulated by przi via different itp levels the przi with low itp levels ranging from 5 to 20 awc imposed different levels of water stress on crops and thus had smaller transpiration than that of conventional inm regardless of the n rates however the przi with an itp of 15 or 20 awc can achieve comparable grain yield to that of conventional inm cooperating with the n rate of either 200 or 250 kg ha 1 photosynthesis mainly determines grain yield and has less sensitivity to water stress than transpiration liu et al 2005 so transpiration exhibits a greater reduction compared with grain yield under water stress suitable water stress can also have a positive effect on the wue of crops chai et al 2016 under the same n application strategy the przi with an itp of 15 awc had higher wue than the ones with other itp levels in addition the przi with an itp of 15 awc can achieve higher wue than the conventional inm the highest wue under the przi with an itp of 15 awc was 2 23 kg m 3 which is 8 9 more than that in conventional inm geerts and raes 2009 and english 1990 claimed that maximizing wue may be economically more profitable than maximizing grain yield for the farmer therefore this study chose wue as the evaluation criteria to determine the optimal irrigation practice and n application rate as a result the przi with an itp of 15 awc was evaluated as the optimal irrigation practice under przi with any itp the increase in the n application rate varying from 50 to 250 kg ha 1 had positive effect on the wue grain yield and transpiration and the n rate of 250 kg ha 1 achieved the highest wue among all n rate options even so the n rate of 200 kg ha 1 was evaluated as the optimal n application rate considering that the n rate of 200 kg ha 1 had almost equal wue and lower cost of buying n compared with the n rate of 250 kg ha 1 the optimal n application rate is smaller than that reported by chen et al 2011 240 kg ha 1 and slightly higher than that reported by zhang et al 2011 180 kg ha 1 additionally due to lower transpiration and water drainage alternative inm practices for achieving comparable grain yield to that of conventional inm requires less irrigation than that required in conventional inm practices the irrigation amount in the alternative inm practice with an itp of 15 awc and the recommended n rate is less than 406 mm and had a substantial decline compared with the conventional level 466 mm fig 6 measurements of water drainage and n leaching were not made so the performances of the model in the simulation of water drainage and n leaching were not evaluated in this study however since the model predicted soil water and n dynamics quite well one would expect the simulated water drainage and n leaching to be reasonable hu et al 2010 the simulated annual water drainage and n leaching during the growth season under conventional inm were 59 mm and 52 kg ha 1 respectively fig 6 a study by shi et al 2018 in the same area reported comparable water drainage approximately 67 mm and n leaching approximately 54 kg ha 1 during the growth season under conventional inm the large irrigation quota and or unpredictable precipitation especially for heavy rain after irrigation are the main inducements for considerable drainage and n leaching shi et al 2018 the amount of precipitation during growth season were 84 6 mm in 2016 and 182 8 mm in 2018 fig 1 any of the three treatments t1 t2 and t3 had a higher total irrigation amount during growth season in 2016 than in 2018 due to the lower precipitation during growth season in 2016 than in 2018 despite the low total precipitation across growth season there are still heavy rains from time to time in northwestern china wang and zhou 2005 wang et al 2013 the daily precipitation on 2 august in 2018 was up to 41 6 mm moreover both precipitation frequency and intensity are on the rise in northwestern china wang and zhou 2005 wang et al 2013 under przi soil water in the lower soil layers 60 100 cm was not replenished by irrigation so sws in the root zone was often maintained at a lower level the remainder of the soil reservoir capacity can store more precipitation and prevent irrigation water from diffusing beyond the root zone as a result the alternative inm practice had small water drainage of 23 4 mm which is approximately 60 less than that in conventional inm it is important to improve wue to reduce water drainage and increase the utilization of precipitation tolk and howell 2003 wang et al 2011 water drainage is the medium of n leaching so n leaching can be greatly reduced by reducing water drainage hu et al 2010 moreover the alternative inm practices adopted lower n application rates than conventional level some previous studies found that decreasing the n application rate could significantly reduce nitrate leaching abrol et al 2012 fang et al 2008 each alternative inm practice achieved similar n leaching of 10 1 kg ha 1 which was 80 5 less than that in conventional inm wang et al 2016 reported that the suitable ratio of basal n to topdressing n under the same n application rate can improve grain yield and nue especially for low n application rates however there were small differences in grain yield and wue among all split n ratios except for those of 0 100 fig 5 the difference in results may be attributed to irrigation practice due to little water drainage and n leaching under przi basal n can still be used efficiently at the middle and late stages of crop growth this indicates that split n may not be necessary if water drainage is effectively controlled considering that maize has higher n requirements during vegetative growth stage than during reproductive growth stage mueller and vyn 2016 the recommended n input is encouraged to be applied once as a base fertilizer subedi and ma 2005 claimed that adequate n application during the vegetative stage is enough to achieve high yield and the lack of n application during the reproductive growth stage does not significantly reduce grain yield 4 conclusion the rzwqm2 model proved its ability to simulate soil water and n dynamics and crop growth with high accuracy after careful model calibration and validation in the study area we first analyzed characteristics of transpiration and plant n uptake in maize plants using calibrated rzwqm2 the results indicated that the maize plants with high wuep generally have high nuep and reducing transpiration is an effective way to improve either wuep or nuep the conventional inm practices can guarantee a high grain yield 12 7 t ha 1 however it had low water use efficiency 2 04 kg m 3 along with a high amount of irrigation 466 mm water drainage 59 mm and n leaching 52 kg ha 1 an optimal irrigation strategy in which the prz was refilled to awc when available water in the prz decreased to 15 awc is recommended for spring maize production the recommended n application of 200 kg n ha 1 accounting for about 44 of conventional n application rate is encouraged to be applied once as a base fertilizer compared with conventional inm the optimal inm decreased irrigation amount water drainage and n leaching by 14 7 53 7 and 80 5 respectively furthermore the optimal inm increased wue by 8 9 with a comparable grain yield compared with conventional inm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10540,irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer management inm are essential for maize production in northwest china the conventional inm in which irrigation of about 90 120 mm is carried out four or five times with large nitrogen n fertilizer inputs approximately 450 kg n ha 1 generally result in low water use efficiency wue and n use efficiency nue with a series of environmental pollution problems the main objective of this study was to optimize the inm for spring maize using the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 the rzwqm2 was first calibrated and verified based on a two year experiment the nrmses normalized root mean square errors for the simulated grain yield aboveground biomass plant n uptake and grain n uptake were 7 02 6 75 10 73 and 12 40 respectively in the calibration period were 9 73 7 96 12 00 and 15 34 respectively in the validation period the nrmses for the simulated soil water content and soil nitrate n content at different depths ranged from 8 29 to 24 52 and from 13 34 to 32 83 across the calibration and validation period respectively the calibrated model was used to investigate grain yield biomass plant level wue wuep and plant level nue nuep under different transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of maize plants simulation results indicated that the maize plants with high wuep generally have high nuep and reducing transpiration is an effective way to improve either wuep or nuep furthermore the calibrated model was used to evaluate different inm options including n application rates split n strategies and irrigation strategies based on simulation results split n application is not necessary if water drainage is effectively controlled the optimal n fertilizer rate is 200 kg ha 1 n and is encouraged to be applied once as a base fertilizer the irrigation practice in which irrigation is adopted to refill the primary root zone prz 0 60 cm to available water capacity awc when available water in the prz decreases to 15 awc achieved the highest wue 2 23 kg m 3 among all alternative irrigation practice options with a high grain yield 12 6 t ha 1 and so is recommended compared with conventional inm the optimal inm decreased irrigation amount by 14 7 water drainage by 53 7 and n leaching by 80 5 but increased wue by 8 9 with a comparable grain yield keywords rzwqm2 spring maize irrigation nitrogen fertilizer wue grain yield 1 introduction the shiyang river basin in northwest china is a typical inland basin with typical arid to semiarid features hu et al 2016 spring maize is the most widely grown food crop in the region accounting for more than 34 of the total crop planted area liu et al 2018 irrigation water mainly from groundwater is the main source of water consumed by crops for high yield due to little precipitation approximately 160 mm per year hu et al 2016 shi et al 2018 the growing population and shrinking arable land area prompt increased irrigation and nitrogen n application for higher maize production during the growing season conventional irrigation typically as flood irrigation with high irrigation amount 90 120 mm in each irrigation event and large n fertilizer inputs 400 kg ha 1 generally result in nonnegligible water drainage and n leaching and achieve low water and n use efficiencies wue nue li et al 2005 a series of environmental problems associated with excessive water and n application have been reported in the region the groundwater level in the shiyang river basin declined by more than 22 m from 1977 to 2015 hu et al 2016 elevated no3 n concentrations in water particularly groundwater are prevalent and high n application is one contributing factor ma et al 2009 thus conventional irrigation and nitrogen application can hardly ensure sustainable maize production in the study area optimizing irrigation and nitrogen management inm for the enhanced nue and wue of crops is an effective way to achieve a balance among high crop production low resource consumption and environmental protection fang et al 2008 hu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 the application of n synchronizing with spatial and temporal variability in crop demand is considered to be judicious n management and split n application can be one option to decrease the n application rate and n loss without compromised grain yield abrol et al 2012 nitrogen and water are codependent management factors that cannot be completely evaluated as independent factors hu et al 2010 a suitable irrigation strategy is beneficial to save either water or n deficit irrigation di which imposes timely moderate water stress on crops is a widely used water saving strategy fereres 2007 primary root zone irrigation przi as a special type of di in which soil water monitoring and soil water replenishment are restricted to the primary root zone prz top 60 cm soil layer was recommended for surface irrigated maize production by previous studies panda et al 2004 greaves and wang 2017 zhou et al 2019 przi eliminates the monitoring of soil water status in deep soil layers is more convenient and can achieve higher wue with comparable grain yield compared with those of conventional irrigation strategies greaves and wang 2017 zhou et al 2019 hence przi combined with split n application may be an alternative inm practice to achieve enhanced wue and nue with high grain yield of spring maize the keys of which are the suitable irrigation trigger point itp n application rate and split n method the effects of inm on crop yield wue nue water drainage and n leaching are the interactions of n application irrigation and climate factors cameira et al 2014 the long term investigation of the performances of a large number of inm options is necessary to achieve the optimal alternative inm practice liu et al 2011 it is usually time consuming and costly to optimize inm via long term field experiments in addition some observational targets e g water drainage n leaching for assessing inm practices are not accurately obtained under field conditions hu et al 2010 by contrast crop simulation models taking into account weather related risks and seasonal variability are low cost and efficient tools for simulating the effects of inm practices on crop growth and environment fang et al 2008 numerous cropping systems models have been developed including rzwqm2 ma et al 2001 dssat liu et al 2011 epic easterling et al 1997 apsim keating et al 2003 and aquacrop khoshravesh et al 2013 rzwqm2 has advanced features of simulating soil water and n dynamics and shows good performance in simulating the effects of soil water and n deficits on crop growth by coupling with the embedded ceres models fang 2017 ma et al 2012 hence the rzwqm2 was used to assess inm options and analyze water and nitrogen uptake and utilization of spring maize plants in this study optimizing inm has two main approaches one is to minimize the apparent loss of water and n except crop absorption e g soil evaporation water drainage and n leaching and the other is to improve wue and nue at the plant level abrol et al 2012 the objectives of this work were to use the rzwqm2 model to 1 analyze characteristics of transpiration and plant n uptake in maize plants and their effects on grain yield biomass plant level wue wuep and plant level nue nuep providing theoretical support for optimizing inm and to 2 optimize the alternative inm practice claimed by this study including itp n application rate and its distribution between base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer for enhanced wue and

china agricultural university gansu province china 102 50 e 37 52 n the study site has a temperate continental arid climate with mean annual sunshine of about 3000 h the mean annual potential evaporation is more than 1500 mm with mean annual precipitation of 164 mm given the low groundwater table 40 m at the experimental site groundwater cannot affect the water utilization of spring maize qin et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the average air temperature and precipitation during the spring maize growing season april to september were 18 4 c and 84 6 mm in 2016 18 6 c and 182 8 mm in 2018 and 17 8 c and 135 9 mm in the long term 1981 2016 respectively the total reference crop evapotranspiration during the spring maize growing season in 2016 and 2018 were 568 and 507 mm respectively fig 1 physical and chemical parameter values for the soil profile from 0 1 m in the experimental field soil were measured about a week before sowing and are shown in table 1 2 2 field experiments pioneer 335 a widely used maize zea mays l cultivar was used in this study seeds were oversown manually with 0 4 m row spacing on 28 april and 1 may in 2016 and 2018 respectively at the four leaf stage the planting density was decreased to approximately 86 000 plants ha 1 by thinning out redundant seedlings spring maize was harvested on 25 september 2016 and 24 september 2018 in 2016 there were three irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 with different predefined levels of effective rooting depth rd the rds were used to calculate irrigation rate i mm per irrigation event as 1 i 10 r d θ t θ i where the rd cm values were 40 50 and 60 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively θt cm3 cm 3 is the targeted soil water content swc within the rd and was set as field water capacity θfc in the study θi cm3 cm 3 is the swc within the rd before irrigation for the three treatments in 2016 irrigation was applied when the swc in 0 40 cm soil layer decreased to 60 θfc t1 t2 and t3 had similar and high grain yield table 5 in 2016 indicating maize plants in the three treatments were subjected to similar and moderate water stress to investigate the performance of the rzwqm2 model in the simulation of maize responses to different water stress levels two additional irrigation treatments t4 and t5 besides t1 t2 t3 were carried out in 2018 to expand water stress levels under the investigation the preliminary design of t4 was no irrigation treatment however during the field experiment of t4 we found that the swc without the replenishment by irrigation could be fatal for maize at seedling stage and tassel stage and so two irrigations with small irrigation amount were adopted on 31 may and 18 july to prevent deadly soil water deficit t5 was defined as no water deficit treatment in which irrigation was applied when the swc in 0 100 cm soil layer decreased to 70 θfc according to chai et al 2016 maize plants under t5 do not suffer from water stress rd value in t5 was 100 cm and irrigation amount per irrigation event in t5 was calculated as eq 1 border irrigation was applied in the study for each treatment in both years an unscheduled 30 mm irrigation was adopted at dough stage on 15 september 2016 and 13 september 2018 to ensure crop water consumption at later growth stages moreover in 2018 an unscheduled irrigation of 24 mm was adopted on 31 may for the other treatments besides t4 to prevent soil water deficit at the seedling stage the irrigation date and amount per application for all treatments in 2016 and 2018 are shown in table 2 there were 9 plots in 2016 and 15 plots in 2018 the plots each of which was 36 m2 6 m 6 m with a 1 m wide buffer zone were arranged in a randomized block design with three replicates per treatment according to local fertilization management each plot under t1 t2 and t3 received 238 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate 90 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium sulfate and 216 kg n ha 1 as urea before sowing and an additional 168 kg n ha 1 as urea at the tassel stage in both years in order to investigate the performance of the rzwqm2 model in the simulation of maize responses to different n application levels the n application rate in t4 and t5 were different from that in t1 t2 and t3 in 2018 t4 and t5 received 90 kg n ha 1 as urea before sowing accompanying the application of 238 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 t4 and t5 did not receive any n fertilizer except for the base n fertilizer in both years all plots were irrigated uniformly before sowing to obtain θfc as a starting value and to provide enough moisture for optimum germination the swc within the 0 1 m soil depth leaf area index lai crop phenology anthesis stage and physiological maturity and grain yield were measured in this study which were described in detail in our previous study zhou et al 2019 soil samples for soil no3 n content snc were taken every 0 1 m depth until 1 m depth in each plot at seedling emergence the tassel stage the silking stage and at physiological maturity soil no3 n in soil samples after air drying was extracted with a 2 mol l 1 kcl solution soil to liquid ratio of 1 10 and the extracts were measured on an auto analyzer iii aa3 bran luebbe germany to determine the sncs in the soil samples at harvest ten plants per plot were sampled randomly to determine aboveground biomass plant n uptake and grain n uptake each plant was cut off at ground surface and was separated into stems including stalk leaf sheaths tassel and husks leaves grains and cobs then these plant parts were dried to constant mass in an air oven at 75 c and weighed the oven dried plant parts were ground finely 1 mm for analysis of n content in each plant part using the kjeldahl method sáez plaza et al 2013 the plant n uptake was the sum of n uptake in each plant part which was calculated as dry matter weight of each plant part multiplied by n content of the corresponding plant part 2 3 rzwqm2 model description and parameterization the rzwqm2 model version 2 70 2014 is a one dimensional and process based cropping systems model running at a daily time step ma et al 2001 the green ampt infiltration equation is used to describe surface soil water infiltration process in the model the model uses poiseuille s equation and richard s equation to simulate macropore flow and redistribution of soil water respectively the potential evapotranspiration rates are calculated by shuttleworth wallace equations shuttleworth and wallace 1985 rzwqm2 supplies multiple choices including generic crop growth models cropgro models ceres models the quick plant and quick turf models or the quick tree models for the simulation of crop growth the ceres maize model supplied rzwqm2 with the simulation of spring maize development and computed daily n and water stress factors in this study the rzwqm2 model requires inputs of daily weather data initial soil conditions soil property data and field management data more details of rzwqm2 have been described by ma et al 2001 according to ma et al 1998 an initialization run of 10 years using historical weather data 2007 2016 based on measured soil organic c levels in table1 was conducted to obtain soil organic c equilibrium in terms of experimental data sets including crop phenology lai aboveground biomass grain yield plant n uptake grain n uptake snc and swc from t1 t2 and t3 in the 2016 season a set of parameters cultivar parameters soil hydraulic parameters and soil n dynamics parameters in rzwqm2 was optimized using parameter estimation software pest embedded in the model pest has been widely used to optimize model parameters in rzwqm2 fang et al 2017 kisekka et al 2017 the cultivar parameters were p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint which were described in detail in table 3 the soil hydraulic parameters included saturated hydraulic conductivity ks θfc and permanent wilting point θwp at different soil depths the soil n dynamics parameters were nitrification rate anit and hydrolysis rate au in pest the weights for various categories of observations which are used to weight the importance of each category of observations need to be set according to malone et al 2010 the model parameter values achieved by pest with improper weights may result in excessive local errors in simulation of a certain category of observations or a certain treatment adopting suitable weights for various categories of observations is crucial for pest to achieve the optimal model parameter values in the study the optimal weights of various categories of observations in pest were determined by the trial and error methods yang et al 2013 additionally the soil root growth factor srgf affecting swc and snc dynamics was also calibrated manually using trial and error methods during calibrations as model inputs the initial swc and snc in the top 1 m soil profile on planting came from the measured results in 2016 shown in table1 the optimized values of cultivar parameters soil hydraulic parameters and soil n dynamics parameters in rzwqm2 are listed in table 3 the other parameters related to processes of nitrogen and carbon cycle were set as default values in rzwqm2 some parameters related to evapotranspiration et were also set based on the measured data from t3 with the highest irrigation amount in 2016 i e maximum plant hmax shoot biomass of plants with 0 5 hmax and residue cover factor qi et al 2016 found that the simulation of plant height may affect the potential et calculations in rzwqm2 plant height is not simulated in ceres maize model in rzwqm2 plant height is calculated by eq 2 and 3 qi et al 2016 2 h e i g h t h max 1 e α s h b i o 2 h max 3 α 2 h max ln 0 5 s t e m h a l f where shbio is shoot biomass simulated in the model height is canopy height cm and α is a constant and stem half is the shbio at 0 5 hmax in this study the measured value of hmax 304 cm was adopted in rzwqm2 and the stem half was set as 56 6 g plant 1 which is the shbio of plants with height of 147 cm the crop residue on the soil surface was negligible in actual production and so the residue cover factor was set as 0 in the model the albedos of wet soil dry soil and crop were set as default values 0 3 for dry soil 0 02 for wet soil and 0 43 for crop at maturity subsequently the calibrated model was validated based on the data pairs from five treatments in the 2018 season in the simulations for model validation the initial swc and snc in the top 1 m soil profile on planting were set according to the measured results in 2018 shown in table1 2 4 scenario simulations with historical weather data daily weather data on minimum air temperature maximum air temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed and sunshine hours were downloaded for the past 36 years 1981 2016 from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn daily sunshine hours were conversed to daily solar radiation using the angstrom equation recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 based on the 36 year weather data this study used the calibrated rzwqm2 to analyze transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of maize plants and to optimize inm practice the calibrated model was run continuously from 1981 to 2016 according to each simulated scenario in the two simulations input data of rzwqm2 on the crop management practices including p and k fertilizer application irrigation method planting date and density and harvest coefficient were determined by reference to the operations used in the field experiment given conventional presowing irrigation was adopted to obtain θfc as a starting swc in actual production of maize the initial swcs along the 1 m soil profile were reset to θfc on planting date at the start of the simulations in each year the initial sncs along the 1 m soil profile were set to the averages of two years of field measurements shown in table 1 in these scenarios itp was expressed as the percentage of available water capacity awc the awc is the difference between θfc and θwp dobarco et al 2019 in the sections below we describe the other details of the two simulation cases 2 5 case 1 analyzing transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of maize plants under these simulation scenarios irrigation was adopted to refill the root zone 0 1 m layer to awc when soil water in the soil profile decreased to itp at the seedling stage from emergence to the 6 leaf stage soil water deficit should be prevented so a high itp of 45 was adopted for all simulation scenarios after the seedling stage nine levels of itp 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 45 were designed to impose different levels of water stress on maize plants the simulation scenario with lower itp produced more severe water deficit due to the lower swc in top 60 cm layer before irrigation there were ten total n application rates from 0 to 450 kg ha 1 in 50 kg ha 1 increments referring to conventional n fertilizer management total n application rate was divided into base fertilizer and topdressing at ratio of 40 60 the base fertilizer and topdressing were applied at sowing and the silking stage respectively the case was conducted as a 9 itp 10 n fertilizer rate factorial treatment structure and so contained 90 scenarios with all possible combinations the 3240 sets of simulation results including transpiration plant n uptake grain yield and biomass can be obtained by carrying out each scenario using rzwqm2 model for 36 years based on these simulation results this study analyzed the characteristics of transpiration and plant n uptake in maize plants and their effects on grain yield biomass wuep and nuep the wuep kg m 3 and nuep kg kg 1 were calculated as 4 w u e p y 10 t r 5 n u e p y n u p t a k e where y is dry grain yield kg ha 1 tr is seasonal transpiration mm nuptake is plant n uptake kg ha 1 2 6 case 2 optimizing water and nitrogen management practice the przi was optimized as an alternative inm practice irrigation was carried out to bring soil water within the top 60 cm layer to awc when soil water in the layer decreased to itp an itp of 45 was adopted at the seedling stage to prevent soil water deficit after the seedling stage four levels of itp 5 10 15 and 20 were investigated some studies aimed at reducing n fertilizer rate in the study area have been carried out chen et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 according to chen et al 2011 the n rate of 250 kg ha 1 is enough to achieve high grain yield hence in n management options the upper limit of test range of n application rates was set as 250 kg ha 1 and there were five total n application rates 50 100 150 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 we try to further reduce n application rate by split n application in this study the total n input was divided into base fertilizer and topdressing in a certain proportion which were applied at sowing and the silking stage respectively split n applications between base fertilizer and topdressing were tested under each total n fertilizer rate at six ratios 0 100 20 80 40 60 60 40 80 20 and 100 0 there were 120 scenarios of alternative inm options with a 4 itp 5 n fertilizer rate 6 split n strategy factorial treatment structure additionally the conventional inm was also simulated and evaluated by rzwqm2 using historical weather data in this study the details of the conventional inm were investigated by studying existing literature shi et al 2018 wang et al 2016 and interviewing the local farmers in conventional irrigation practice irrigation typically as flood irrigation of about 90 120 mm is carried out four or five times to prevent water stress the irrigation timing in the conventional irrigation practice is generally determined based on the experience of farmers which can not be achieved in rzwqm2 an alternative irrigation practice similar to the conventional irrigation in which irrigation was adopted to improve swc in 0 1 m soil layer to 100 θfc when swc in 0 1 m soil layer decreased to 65 θfc was adopted in the simulation of conventional inm as a result the irrigation amount per application in the simulation of conventional inm was about 100 mm which approximates the 90 120 mm in the conventional irrigation practice in actual production moreover the simulation results of conventional inm indicated that the alternative irrigation practice had similar irrigation frequency and crop water status no water stress as the conventional irrigation practice therefore it is reasonable to use the alternative irrigation practice in the simulation of conventional inm the conventional n application rate is 450 kg ha 1 which is applied in two splits at sowing 40 of the total n and silking stage 60 of the total n 2 7 statistical analysis in either model calibration or validation the

snc dynamics were simulated well in either the calibration or validation data set the swc simulations in each soil layer resulted in rmses between 0 020 cm3 cm 3 nrmse 8 29 mrd 16 31 d index 0 55 and 0 041 cm3 cm 3 nrmse 24 52 mrd 11 61 d index 0 89 the mean rmse nrmse mrd and d index of the swc simulations across the eight treatments of two growing seasons were 0 034 cm3 cm 3 20 81 5 00 and 0 73

soil water storage sws in 1 m soil profile followed similar trends with the measured data from all treatments fig 2 the sws simulations in each treatment resulted in rmses between 15 0 mm nrmse 6 9 mrd 13 19 d index 0 66 and 28 9 mm nrmse 14 1 mrd 1 01 d index 0 85 the statistical results for simulation of swc and sws were comparable to that of previous studies li and sun 2016 xu et al 2020 while they were smaller than that reported by fang et al 2008 the good performance of rzwqm2 in simulation of swc may be attributed to the calibration of soil hydraulic parameters it is benefit for improving the simulation of swc using rzwqm2 to calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters especially for the laboratory measured ones ma et al 2012 kisekka et al 2017 for simulated snc in each soil layer the rmses ranged between 1 07 and 7 15 mg kg 1 the nrmses were between 13 34 and 32 83 the mrds were between 27 91 and 33 85 and the d index values were between 0 44 and 0 99 table 4 the mean rmse nrmse mrd and d index of the snc simulations across the eight treatments of two growing seasons were 4 65 mg kg 1 25 89 9 55 and 0 96 in the 0 30 cm layer respectively were 3 64 mg kg 1 19 67 6

rmses between 22 6 kg ha 1 nrmse 7 5 mrd 21 20 d index 0 86 and 44 8 kg ha 1 nrmse 19 4 mrd 10 45 d index 0 96 fig 2 the present study showed higher accurate simulations of sns by rzwqm2 compared with the study by fang et al 2008 who simulated sns in 1 m soil profile with rmses ranging from 41 1 to 67 7 kg ha 1 similar high accuracy in simulated sns by rzwqm2 with small nrmses 11 9 19 0 was reported by xu et al 2020 the good simulations of snc and sns are closely related to the high accuracy soil water dynamics simulation ma et al 2001 in terms of nrmse the largest error in the simulation of swc and snc occurred in the top 30 cm soil layer similar results were reported by fang et al 2008 and xu et al 2020 who found that the simulated swc and snc in top soil layer had a greater deviation from the measured data than those in deeper layers the surface soil water and no3 n dynamics were caused by many factors irrigation rainfall and soil evaporation to which rzwqm2 was less responsive fang et al 2008 hu et al 2006 3 1 2 crop phenology and lai the lai simulations of spring maize were similar to our observations with rmses between 0 38 nrmse 8 2 mrd 17 55 d index 0 82 and 0 96 nrmse 21 3 mrd 3 15 d index 0 99 fig 3 for all treatments the deviations between simulated crop phenology anthesis and physiological maturity and observed ones were no more than 6 days table 5 the observed anthesis and physiological maturity in t4 suffering severe soil water deficit were 4 days later and 5 days earlier than that in t1 in 2018 with sufficient supplies of water and nitrogen respectively edmeades et al 1993 confirmed that water deficits can delay flowering and accelerate senescence of maize to some extent however the model did not show differences in crop phenology among different treatments in either 2016 or 2018 similar results were shown in previous studies li and sun 2016 ma et al 2012 this was because the phenology simulation in the current model was mainly based on meteorological factors such as temperature and photoperiod without consideration of the secondary influences of water and n stress mcmaster et al 2008 it is a challenge to accurately simulate the development stage of corn to water stresses using the ceres maize crop model hybrid in rzwqm2 which has been widely acknowledged in previous studies ma et al 2012 li and sun 2016 3 1 3 biomass grain yield and n uptake good agreement between simulated and observed grain yield was obtained with rmses of 0 97 t ha 1 nrmse 7 02 mrd 6 14 d index 0 62 in 2016 and 1 16 t ha 1 nrmse 9 73 mrd 3 62 d index 0 96 in 2018 table 5 the aboveground biomass was underpredicted slightly compared with that of observations in all treatments in both years table 5 which corresponds with the results of the previous study by xu et al 2020 the rmse nrmse mdr and d index of the aboveground biomass simulations were 1 78 t ha 1 6 75 6 82 and 0 45 in 2016 respectively were 1 86 t ha 1 7 96 6 79 and 0 95 in 2018 respectively the plant n uptake in all treatments of the two growing seasons except for that of t5 with rmses of 35 75 kg ha 1 nrmse 10 73 mrd 10 70 d index 0 62 in 2016 and 32 37 kg ha 1 nrmse 12 00 mrd 7 45 d index 0 92 in 2018 table 5 similar performance of rzwqm in simulation of plant n uptake with rmse from 29 to 37 kg ha 1 was reported by hu et al 2006 as shown in table 5 the grain n uptake in all treatments of the two growing seasons except for that of t4 and t5 was underpredicted with rmses of 29 21 kg ha 1 nrmse 12 40 mrd 12 28 d index 0 37 in 2016 and 28 01 kg ha 1 nrmse 15 34 mrd 0 54 d index 0 88 in 2018 the simulations of plant n uptake and grain n uptake were less accurate than the simulations of grain yield and aboveground biomass in this study which was also reported by fang et al 2008 and ma et al 2007 ma et al 2007 suggested that it is needed for rzwqm2 to further enhance the simulation of n uptake and partitioning in the plant in the study the underpredicted of plant n uptake and grain n uptake could be due to the underpredicted grain yield and aboveground biomass 3 2 transpiration and plant n uptake characteristics of high yielding maize plants as shown in fig 4 the high yielding maize zea mays l pioneer 335 had a maximum transpiration of approximately 600 mm which is slightly higher than the maximum transpiration approximately 540 mm reported by zhai et al 2010 in a study in the same area a transpiration of high yielding maize over 600 mm 640 mm was also reported by basso and ritchie 2018 the high yielding spring maize had a similar maximum plant n uptake 400 kg ha 1 to the result by zhang et al 2017 there is an interaction between plant transpiration and n uptake transpiration provides the driving force for plant n uptake von caemmerer and baker 2007 the minimum transpiration to maintain plant n uptake had a nearly linear increase with increasing n uptake from approximately 100 to 400 kg ha 1 ranging from approximately 90 to 380 mm in turn plant n uptake could also affect transpiration by changing the morpho physiological and biochemical attributes of crops ashraf et al 2016 the maximum transpiration at a given plant n uptake increased sharply as the plant n uptake varied from 65 to 90 kg ha 1 and continued to increase as the plant n uptake levels varied from 90 to 240 kg ha 1 and then maintained at a stable level of approximately 600 mm the plant n uptake of 240 kg ha 1 is enough to prevent transpiration from being restricted by plant n uptake the maize variety had the potential to produce up to 17 8 t ha 1 grain yield 34 4 t ha 1 biomass 4 1 kg m 3 wuep and 79 6 kg kg 1 nuep higher transpiration and plant n uptake are more likely to achieve higher grain yield and biomass the transpiration of 350 mm and plant n uptake of 170 kg ha 1 were sufficient to achieve high grain 14 t ha 1 and biomass 27 t ha 1 yields wuep and nuep were limited by low plant n uptake 200 kg ha 1 especially wuep when plant n uptake exceeded 200 kg ha 1 ideal wuep 3 4 kg m 3 and nuep 70 kg kg 1 were achieved hence there was no close relationship between plant n uptake and either wuep or nuep when plant n uptake exceeded a certain threshold 200 kg ha 1 in the study the transpiration determines wuep and nuep to a large extent in this study plants with the lower transpiration achieved higher wuep at a given plant n uptake within 200 400 kg ha 1 additionally the maize plants with high wuep generally have high nuep accordingly a reasonable inm practice should primarily control transpiration reducing transpiration as much as possible on the premise of satisfying the requirements of high yield for transpiration and n uptake it should be noted that the extremely low values of simulated grain yield biomass plant n uptake and transpiration of maize plants may be very different from the real values for example the maize plants with less than 100 mm transpiration can achieve about 1 4 t ha 1 grain yield according to the simulation results while it is impossible to produce grain yield using so little transpiration in actual production these extremely low values of model outputs were generally achieved in the simulations of maize growth under extreme soil water deficit although the applicability of rzwqm2 for the simulation of maize growth under extreme soil water deficit was not tested in the study dokoohaki et al 2017 and saseendran et al 2008 claimed the accuracy of the ceres maize model hybrid in rzwqm2 under extreme soil water deficit is significantly lower that under suitable soil water condition luckily these extremely low values of model outputs did not disturb the exploring of reasonable inm practice 3 3 optimizing water and nitrogen management practice the simulated grain yield transpiration and wue in conventional inm were approximately 12 7 t ha 1 476 mm and 2 04 kg m 3 respectively fig 5 the swc in the prz largely determines the transpiration of crops which in turn correlates with crop yield and wue yu et al 2007 ahmadi et al 2015 in this study grain yield transpiration and wue were effectively regulated by przi via different itp levels the przi with low itp levels ranging from 5 to 20 awc imposed different levels of water stress on crops and thus had smaller transpiration than that of conventional inm regardless of the n rates however the przi with an itp of 15 or 20 awc can achieve comparable grain yield to that of conventional inm cooperating with the n rate of either 200 or 250 kg ha 1 photosynthesis mainly determines grain yield and has less sensitivity to water stress than transpiration liu et al 2005 so transpiration exhibits a greater reduction compared with grain yield under water stress suitable water stress can also have a positive effect on the wue of crops chai et al 2016 under the same n application strategy the przi with an itp of 15 awc had higher wue than the ones with other itp levels in addition the przi with an itp of 15 awc can achieve higher wue than the conventional inm the highest wue under the przi with an itp of 15 awc was 2 23 kg m 3 which is 8 9 more than that in conventional inm geerts and raes 2009 and english 1990 claimed that maximizing wue may be economically more profitable than maximizing grain yield for the farmer therefore this study chose wue as the evaluation criteria to determine the optimal irrigation practice and n application rate as a result the przi with an itp of 15 awc was evaluated as the optimal irrigation practice under przi with any itp the increase in the n application rate varying from 50 to 250 kg ha 1 had positive effect on the wue grain yield and transpiration and the n rate of 250 kg ha 1 achieved the highest wue among all n rate options even so the n rate of 200 kg ha 1 was evaluated as the optimal n application rate considering that the n rate of 200 kg ha 1 had almost equal wue and lower cost of buying n compared with the n rate of 250 kg ha 1 the optimal n application rate is smaller than that reported by chen et al 2011 240 kg ha 1 and slightly higher than that reported by zhang et al 2011 180 kg ha 1 additionally due to lower transpiration and water drainage alternative inm practices for achieving comparable grain yield to that of conventional inm requires less irrigation than that required in conventional inm practices the irrigation amount in the alternative inm practice with an itp of 15 awc and the recommended n rate is less than 406 mm and had a substantial decline compared with the conventional level 466 mm fig 6 measurements of water drainage and n leaching were not made so the performances of the model in the simulation of water drainage and n leaching were not evaluated in this study however since the model predicted soil water and n dynamics quite well one would expect the simulated water drainage and n leaching to be reasonable hu et al 2010 the simulated annual water drainage and n leaching during the growth season under conventional inm were 59 mm and 52 kg ha 1 respectively fig 6 a study by shi et al 2018 in the same area reported comparable water drainage approximately 67 mm and n leaching approximately 54 kg ha 1 during the growth season under conventional inm the large irrigation quota and or unpredictable precipitation especially for heavy rain after irrigation are the main inducements for considerable drainage and n leaching shi et al 2018 the amount of precipitation during growth season were 84 6 mm in 2016 and 182 8 mm in 2018 fig 1 any of the three treatments t1 t2 and t3 had a higher total irrigation amount during growth season in 2016 than in 2018 due to the lower precipitation during growth season in 2016 than in 2018 despite the low total precipitation across growth season there are still heavy rains from time to time in northwestern china wang and zhou 2005 wang et al 2013 the daily precipitation on 2 august in 2018 was up to 41 6 mm moreover both precipitation frequency and intensity are on the rise in northwestern china wang and zhou 2005 wang et al 2013 under przi soil water in the lower soil layers 60 100 cm was not replenished by irrigation so sws in the root zone was often maintained at a lower level the remainder of the soil reservoir capacity can store more precipitation and prevent irrigation water from diffusing beyond the root zone as a result the alternative inm practice had small water drainage of 23 4 mm which is approximately 60 less than that in conventional inm it is important to improve wue to reduce water drainage and increase the utilization of precipitation tolk and howell 2003 wang et al 2011 water drainage is the medium of n leaching so n leaching can be greatly reduced by reducing water drainage hu et al 2010 moreover the alternative inm practices adopted lower n application rates than conventional level some previous studies found that decreasing the n application rate could significantly reduce nitrate leaching abrol et al 2012 fang et al 2008 each alternative inm practice achieved similar n leaching of 10 1 kg ha 1 which was 80 5 less than that in conventional inm wang et al 2016 reported that the suitable ratio of basal n to topdressing n under the same n application rate can improve grain yield and nue especially for low n application rates however there were small differences in grain yield and wue among all split n ratios except for those of 0 100 fig 5 the difference in results may be attributed to irrigation practice due to little water drainage and n leaching under przi basal n can still be used efficiently at the middle and late stages of crop growth this indicates that split n may not be necessary if water drainage is effectively controlled considering that maize has higher n requirements during vegetative growth stage than during reproductive growth stage mueller and vyn 2016 the recommended n input is encouraged to be applied once as a base fertilizer subedi and ma 2005 claimed that adequate n application during the vegetative stage is enough to achieve high yield and the lack of n application during the reproductive growth stage does not significantly reduce grain yield 4 conclusion the rzwqm2 model proved its ability to simulate soil water and n dynamics and crop growth with high accuracy after careful model calibration and validation in the study area we first analyzed characteristics of transpiration and plant n uptake in maize plants using calibrated rzwqm2 the results indicated that the maize plants with high wuep generally have high nuep and reducing transpiration is an effective way to improve either wuep or nuep the conventional inm practices can guarantee a high grain yield 12 7 t ha 1 however it had low water use efficiency 2 04 kg m 3 along with a high amount of irrigation 466 mm water drainage 59 mm and n leaching 52 kg ha 1 an optimal irrigation strategy in which the prz was refilled to awc when available water in the prz decreased to 15 awc is recommended for spring maize production the recommended n application of 200 kg n ha 1 accounting for about 44 of conventional n application rate is encouraged to be applied once as a base fertilizer compared with conventional inm the optimal inm decreased irrigation amount water drainage and n leaching by 14 7 53 7 and 80 5 respectively furthermore the optimal inm increased wue by 8 9 with a comparable grain yield compared with conventional inm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10541,although soil water and nutrients are two of the most important factors affecting growth and production of winter wheat genetic improvement for wheat responses to water and nitrogen n levels has been rarely studied in this paper five dryland winter wheat cultivars representative of widely cultivated varieties released from the 1940s to the 2010s in shaanxi province china were grown in an open rainout shelter which could be closed when rain threatened under four contrasting water n treatment combinations yield related parameters biomass accumulation crop water productivity wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue were determined the results indicated that water deficit and low n treatment caused a significant reduction in grain yield and flag leaf photosynthesis in the five wheat cultivars studied however nue grain protein content and partial factor nitrogen productivity were significantly improved by n application under water deficit our results confirm the genetic improvement for plant growth n accumulation and grain yield in wheat cultivars released from the 1940s to the 2010s newergenotypes showed the highest nue under water deficit combined with n limited conditions additionally based on principal component analysis we found that the newer genotypes i e those from the 2000s and the 2010s are more sensitive to low nitrogen and water stress compared with the older genotypes from the 1980s which are more sensitive to the combined effect of water and n limitations our findings provide a theoretical support for further improvement of the wheat yield potential

changes are already impacting food production by influencing the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens which in turn reduce crop yield and quality insufficient rainfall and excess use of fertilizers have become major causes of concern as they pose a direct threat to crop productivity worldwide osakabe et al 2014 the large dryland farming area 16 million ha on the loess plateau is a major grain producing area in china but the region is constrained by water deficiency and insuﬃcient soil water storage for crop production zhang et al 2011 water availability affects plant requirements and responses to nitrogen n a high crop water productivity wue is critical for high plant productivity in arid and semi arid regions however a low n content in plant tissues can limit soil water absorption and thereby wue nitrogen is often considered a most important factor affecting crop productivity in arid areas where n application can improve wue and thus reduce the negative impacts of drought stress on plant growth the significant interactions between n fertilization and irrigation reportedly affect grain protein formation zhang et al 2017 root traits elazab et al 2016 photosynthesis wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 nitrogen content sanchez bragado et al 2017 and wue kunrath et al 2018 liu and wang 2018 among other processes photosynthesis is an important process whereby plants absorb light energy and assimilate co2 to produce dry matter the process can be inhibited by reducing transpiration rate stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis rate under conditions of water deficit yordanov et al 2000 in contrast n application has been shown to improve the acclimation of plant photosynthesis to water deficit in many crops including rice zhong et al 2019 and wheat gao et al 2019 however apparent n recovery efficiency i e the percentage of n fertilizer recovered in aboveground plant biomass at the end of the cropping season by crops is approximately 33 the remaining n is lost as surface runoff leached as nitrate into groundwater volatilized into the atmosphere or removed by microbial denitrification ju et al 2009 the current intensified use of fertilizers not only increases the waste and pollution of living resources but also decreases crop quality due to increased nitrate accumulation causing soil degradation therefore it is most urgent to reduce the environmental impacts of n fertilizers while increasing water and nitrogen use efficiency in crops wheat triticum aestivum l is the most extensively cultivated cereal crop worldwide accounting for 20 of the calories consumed by the global population fao 2016 wheat plays an important role in ensuring food security and breeding high yielding wheat cultivars is critical to meet the needs of the ever increasing world population duan et al 2019 agami et al 2018 the genetic gain in wheat yield and changes in crop phenotypes have been quantified over many years of wheat variety replacement in many countries including the united states donmez et al 2001 australia siddique et al 1989 sadras and lawson 2011 france brancourt hulmel et al 2003 uk austin et al 1980 shearman et al 2005 and china zhou et al 2007 tian et al 2011 xiao et al 2012 sun et al 2014 shaanxi province is the most important area of winter wheat production in china and at least six wheat cultivars have been cultivated in this area since the 1940s zhuang 2003 newer cultivars normally show higher yield compared with older cultivars around the world subira et al 2014 sun et al 2014 de santis et al 2017 similarly through genetic improvement wheat yield in the shaanxi province increased by 22 8 kg ha yr 1 from the 1940s to the 2010s sun et al 2014 tian et al 2016 increases in grain yield have been mainly associated with increased harvest index and number of kernels per square meter xiao et al 2012 sadras and lawson 2013 crop yield may be further improved through the combined implementation of genetically improved cultivars and increased availability of n and water resources sinclair and rufty 2012 many studies have focused on the interaction between genetic improvement in wheat and fertilizer rates the results show that modern varieties are higher yielding at all n levels because of higher n absorption ortiz monasterio et al 1997 le gouis et al 2000 guarda et al 2004 sadras et al 2016 in france old varieties achieved a higher yield at relatively low n rates while modern cultivars achieve higher yields at relatively high n rates brancourt hulmel et al 2003 a similar crossover interaction was found in wheat varieties released between 1950 and 1985 in mexico ortiz monasterio et al 1997 furthermore wheat varieties released in australia between 1958 and 2007 increased their n uptake by progressively increasing root efficiency in capturing n aziz et al 2017 in contrast sun et al 2014 showed that newer cultivars with higher yield do not necessarily display improved adaptability to water deficit however some studies have shown that modern wheat cultivars have higher wue compared with that of older cultivars in dry areas siddique et al 1990 fang et al 2011 the full potential of genetically improved wheat cultivars cannot be realized without exploring their n use efficiency nue and their wue therefore to reduce the environmental impact of fertilizer application and to increase wue and nue in wheat the possible interaction between water and n and their effect on wheat cultivars need to be investigated the present study aimed to quantify the genetic variability for grain yield nue and wue in five dryland wheat cultivars developed between the 1940s and 2010s and to investigate the physiological basis of such variability the study focused on dry matter accumulation and leaf gas exchange under two water and nitrogen conditions we hypothesised that in a synergistic environment of four water nitrogen treatment combinations newly developed varieties with stronger adaptability potential would show greater wue nue and yield compared with older genotypes principal component analysis pca was used to evaluate the potential for high yield and to identify the parameters affected by water deficit or low n conditions the results presented in our study will help to identify the optimal combination of yield nue and wue under different n and water conditions during the wheat variety replacement process the analysis of dynamic monitoring of the growth flag leaf photosynthesis characteristics and dry matter accumulation during the growth period of different wheat varieties was conducted to explain the variations in wheat yield and the improved nue and wue as well as to provide theoretical basis for subsequent breeding projects and crop production 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions five dryland winter wheat cultivars were selected among varieties that were widely cultivated in shaanxi province in china between the 1940s and the 2010s table 1 a planter experiment was conducted in an open rainout shelter which could be closed when rain threatened at the state laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china from late october 2017 to early june 2018 seeds of the five winter wheat genotypes were surface sterilized with 3 h2o2 for 20 min and then washed three times with deionized water the seeds were germinated in a plastic box for two weeks seedlings of uniform morphology were selected and transplanted into planters on october 23 2017 the planters

plant morphology and dry matter accumulation plant height was significantly affected p 0 01 by water n treatment and genotype at flowering stage fig 1 a plant height was particularly enhanced by ww although nn and ln treatments also increased plant height significantly adequate n supply resulted in a significant increase in plant height in both ww and ws plants furthermore a significant interaction was detected between genotype and water p 0 01 fig 1a similarly leaf area was affected significantly p 0 01 by water n genotype and by the interactions w n p 0 01 and w g p 0 01 fig 1b leaf area was particularly enhanced by ww although nn and ln treatments also increased it significantly fig 1b adequate n supply resulted in a significant increase in leaf area in both ww and ws treatments relative to ww root dry weight increased by 0 6 in ws treatments with different genotype and n rate although this increase was not significant p 0 05 conversely shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights decreased by 20 6 44 39 and 75 13 respectively fig 2 however application of nn significantly p 0 01 increased root shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights by 20 39 17 40 22 03 and 33 28 respectively additionally shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights were significantly affected by genotype p 0 01 in contrast only the w n g interaction had a significant effect p 0 001 on root dry weight among all genotypes the greatest shoot dry weight was measured in changwu 134 and the largest leaf and leaf sheath dry weights were detected in chang han 58 3 2 gas exchange parameters and scmr in the flag leaf both water and n regimes had significant effects on all flag leaf gas exchange parameters fig 3 the ww regime significantly increased p n tr and scmr compared with the ws regime at both filling and flowering stages moreover p n tr and scmr were significantly affected by water p 0 01 n treatment p 0 01 and genotype p 0 01 fig 3 p n of the flag leaves at filling and flowering stages did not increase consistently with cultivar replacement between the 1940s and 2010s compared with the other four genotypes chang han 58 showed lower tr in the ww treatments and in the ws nn treatment at filling and flowering stages at the filling stage the lowest scmr value among all tested genotypes was measured in mazha in the ww treatments and in the ws nn treatment however the highest scmr value was observed in changwu 134 under the ww treatments a significant two way interaction w n for scmr was recorded at filling and flowering the only significant interaction p 0 001 was recorded for w n g on tr at filling 3 3 nitrogen absorption and utilization the overall mean n content averaged across genotypes and n treatments decreased significantly in the root 11 81 aboveground parts 2 05 and seeds 34 3 under ws similarly in general mean n content decreased significantly in roots 55 01 and seeds 97 under ln regardless of genotype or water regime but increased by 12 96 in aboveground plant parts thus root aboveground parts and seed n contents were strongly affected by water n and genotype changwu 134 accumulated more n in the seeds under ww in both ln and nn treatments than under ws treatments in contrast seed n content in chang han 58 was greater under ws treatments table 3 as for nue the overall mean obtained when genotypes and n treatments were pooled together decreased significantly 8 83 under ws further seed protein content and pfpn decreased by 52 63 and 30 58 respectively however wue increased by 13 3 under ws averaging across genotypes and water treatments nue and pfpn increased by 20 36 and 78 36 under ln treatment respectively although wue was reduced by 29 23 and seed protein concentration by 45 99 nue gpy and pfpn were significantly affected by n application rate p 0 01 and genotype p 0 01 the interaction w n g had a highly significant effect p 0 001 on nue fig 4 more importantly wue was significantly affected by water p 0 01 n p 0 01 g p 0 01 and by w n p 0 05 w g p 0 01 n g p 0 01 and w n g p 0 01 interactions 3 4 yield and yield related components the overall means for grain yield tgw spike number grain yield per spike and hi for all genotypes and water treatments increased significantly by 66 38 10 5 37 49 12 58 and 16 45 respectively under the nn treatment the overall mean gy spike number and hi across genotypes and n treatments decreased by 29 49 31 94 and 1 8 respectively under ws however tgw and grain yield per spike increased by 5 24 and 6 01 respectively under ws all yield related parameters and yield components were affected significantly p 0 01 by genotype the highest grain number per spike was recorded for chang han 58 across treatments in turn changwu 134 showed higher grain yield and hi in ww than in the corresponding ws treatments conversely chang han 58 showed higher grain yield and hi in ws than in ww treatments table 2 3 5 principal component analysis of growth and physiological parameters to reveal the key parameters responsible for the response patterns of both nn treated and ln treated plants to water deficit pca was conducted using morphological and physiological data aiming to highlight possible differences and similarities between treatments in the ln treatment under water deficit the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 accounted for 56 1 and 15 5 of the total variation respectively fig 5 pc1 clearly separated the effects of the water deficit treatment the parameters that contributed to pc1 included p n t r scmr aboveground n accumulation grain n accumulation leaf dry weight leaf sheath dry weight number of spikes gy wue gpy and pfpn in contrast plant height root n content leaf sheath dry weight hi and nue contributed to pc2 table 4 in the water deficit treatment under ln pc1 and pc2 accounted for 49 and 25 5 of the total variation respectively fig 5 pc1 clearly separated the effects of water deficit treatment the parameters contributing to pc1 were leaf area p n scmr aboveground n accumulation grain n accumulation leaf sheath dry weight stem dry weight number of spikes gy nue and gpy whereas plant height leaf area tr root n content root dry weight grain number number of spikes gy tgw wue and hi were important factors for pc2 4 discussion 4 1 effects of nitrogen and water on plant morphology and dry matter accumulation plant growth and dry matter accumulation were inhibited by drought regardless of n treatment although inhibition was more significant under ln it has been widely reported that plant height and flag leaf area are tightly associated with crop productivity under drought song et al 2019 in the present study wheat plants grown under water stress were shorter and had smaller flag leaf area at flowering inhibition of flag leaf expansion due to reduced cell hydraulic conductivity under water stress reduces water transport and hinders cell division and enlargement zhang et al 2016 nitrogen application may facilitate the maintenance of dry matter accumulation in water stressed plants li et al 2018 xue et al 2018 our results confirmed the decline in root shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights in wheat plants exposed to drought further the application of adequate n amounts helped to reduce adverse drought effects in five varieties of wheat subjected to water deficit similar results were previously reported for other crop plants such as jujube dai et al 2019 4 2 effects of nitrogen and water on gas exchange parameters and scmr of the flag leaf in this study photosynthesis and transpiration rates decreased under drought regardless of n treatment at both filling and flowering stages as a result of stomata closing to reduce water loss although presumably at the expense of a reduction in co2 influx ouyang et al 2017 however an adequate n supply may promote wue whereas a n deficiency may impair the ability of the plant to regulate stomatal movement in accordance with soil moisture availability yang et al 2012 in this study an adequate n application rate improved gas exchange and wue under ww and ws indicating that adequate levels of n may benefit the regulation of gas exchange and improve wue in wheat plants under drought stress concomitantly scmr measurements offer a good strategy to synchronize the impact of the environment growth stage diurnal variation and different leaf features of crop species and genotypes xiong et al 2015 guiducci et al 2018 nitrogen is an important component in the synthesis of plant pigments and photosynthetic enzymes an adequate n application rate may regulate photosynthetic efficiency and guard the leaf from photoinhibition under drought stress wang et al 2016 our results showed that lower scmr readings in the flag leaf were recorded from wheat plants grown under water stress combined with low n 4 3 the effect of n rate and water supply on n absorption and utilization the accumulation distribution and transport of n are significantly affected by n fertilizer and soil moisture dordas 2012 water stress may reduce n content significantly in plant roots aboveground parts and seeds due to reduced available water and n solubility chen et al 2015 consistently our results revealed that root aboveground parts and seed n content in wheat plants was inhibited by drought during flowering variations in nue among different wheat genotypes and n related traits were evaluated for their accuracy in reflecting the interaction between water and n level on wheat cultivars developed and used from the 1940s to the 2010s drought alone reduced nue gpy and pfpn in wheat plants the application of n in sufficient amounts resulted in reduced nue and pfpn under both ww and ws conditions this result indicates a negative relationship between fertilizer rate and nue which contributes to rapid n losses when n input surpasses crop assimilation capacity zhu et al 2016 however adequate n application may enhance grain protein yield 4 4 the effect of nitrogen and water supply on yield and yield related components nitrogen is an essential nutrient involved in different biochemical processes such as enzyme activities dna replication and transcription whereby it is very important for improving the productivity of wheat perchlik and tegeder 2017 in the present study the number of spikes per plant the number of grains per spike and spike 1000 kernel weight were the main factors determining final grain yield per plant different water and n treatments and genotypes affected final grain yield by altering yield parameters nitrogen supply played the most crucial role in determining grain yield table 4 by increasing the number of spikes per plant overall an adequate n application rate increased grain yield and the number of spikes per plant as compared with ln application the importance of n fertilization in increasing grain yield through increasing leaf area index canopy photosynthesis and ultimately the number of tillers spikes per plant has been previously highlighted lópez bellido and lópez bellido 2001 kim and lieth 2003 otteson et al 2007 however when n rate was increased from low to optimal the response of grain yield was highly dependent on available water and genotype in a ww environment the nn treatment produced the highest grain yield from all the different genotypes tested this differential response in grain yield is due to the combined effect of increased number of spikes per plant spike or 1000 kernel weight and number of grains per spike many significant interactions between n and water have been reported for yield and yield parameters srivastava et al 2018 suggesting that a combined optimization of n and water levels is required to improve wheat productivity 4 5 variability among winter wheat genotypes cultivated from the 1940s to the 2010s in shaanxi province multivariate statistical analysis pca of the datasets revealed possible differences and similarities between genotypes subjected to different water and n treatments the effects of the ln treatment under drought conditions and the effect of water deficit under ln conditions were clearly separated by the first component pc1 fig 5 pc1 in fig 5a was wider than pc1 in fig 5b indicating that ln treatment had a greater effect on morphological and physiological parameters than the ws treatment did the key factors in pc1 under ln were leaf area p n scmr aboveground n content grain n content leaf sheath dry weight stem dry weight number of spikes gy nue and gpy indicating that ln largely impacted plant growth photosynthesis dry matter accumulation and n accumulation and utilization rate in contrast the key factors in pc1 under water stress were p n t r scmr aboveground n content grain n content leaf dry weight leaf sheath dry weight number of spikes gy wue gpy and pfpn indicating that water deficit influenced plant growth photosynthesis wue and dry matter accumulation our results also indicated that xiaoyan 6 and chang han 58 are more sensitive to ln than the other genotypes evaluated whereas xiaoyan 6 and changwu 134 are more sensitive to water stress than the rest of the genotypes the yields of chang han 58 and changwu 134 were as large as or higher than those of other genotypes under dry field conditions and under water stress in a greenhouse pot study sun et al 2014 significant genetic improvement in grain yield has always been attributed to increased grain number improved tgw and hi and reduced plant height aisawi et al 2010 increasing grain number per spike and tgw are considered the most likely approach to improve yield potential plants of cultivar chang han 58 showed higher grain yield hi tgw and grain number per spike compared with the other four genotypes under ws ln and nn than under ww conditions among the tested genotypes xiaoyan 6 developed in the 1980s had the shortest stem among all treatments due to the introduction of dwarf or semi dwarf genes according to the records collected between the 1970s and the 2010s the optimum plant height that will result in the highest yield is approximately 80 cm therefore chang han 58 and to a lesser extent changwu 134 both having shorter stems compared with the other two genotypes in the combined water n treatments tested might have altered dry matter partitioning to the root system thereby affecting root growth and plant water use a previous study showed that older genotypes tend to produce deeper root systems while newer genotypes produce shallower root systems mac key 1973 this was corroborated by our results which revealed a higher root biomass in the older genotype mazha than in the newer genotypes under either n treatment combined with ww conditions in addition changwu 134 and to a lesser extent chang han 58 had a higher pn value in the flag leaf compared with that of the other genotypes in all treatments implying that delayed senescence of the flag leaf is a valuable trait for increasing photosynthesis over the entire life cycle of newer wheat cultivars reynolds et al 2000 in addition scmr values for chang han 58 were improved by nn under ws our results have also shown that newer varieties such as changwu 134 and to a lesser extent chang han 58 are characterized by significantly higher nue and pfpn at nn than at ln under ww conditions 5 conclusions previous studies on the interaction between water and n availability in wheat have rarely considered varietal differences in this study an adequate n rate increased yield related parameters and biomass and enhanced wue and photosynthesis by relieving photoinhibition in water stressed plants we identified newer cultivars with higher yield that could be regulated by increased n rates moreover newer wheat cultivars were better adapted to improve flag leaf expansion and photosynthesis rate and to accumulate more dry matter when treated with more optimal levels of n in contrast the relative importance of root biomass decreased in newer cultivars compared with older genotypes nitrogen content in all tested organs nue and pfpn were greater in the newer than in the older genotypes these results suggest that adequate n fertilization positively affects wheat crops developed between the 1940s and the 2010s when cultivated under conditions of water deficit better crop productivity under dryland field conditions requires a thorough understanding of how plants respond to the combined impact of variable water and n supply declarations of competing interest

10541,although soil water and nutrients are two of the most important factors affecting growth and production of winter wheat genetic improvement for wheat responses to water and nitrogen n levels has been rarely studied in this paper five dryland winter wheat cultivars representative of widely cultivated varieties released from the 1940s to the 2010s in shaanxi province china were grown in an open rainout shelter which could be closed when rain threatened under four contrasting water n treatment combinations yield related parameters biomass accumulation crop water productivity wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue were determined the results indicated that water deficit and low n treatment caused a significant reduction in grain yield and flag leaf photosynthesis in the five wheat cultivars studied however nue grain protein content and partial factor nitrogen productivity were significantly improved by n application under water deficit our results confirm the genetic improvement for plant growth n accumulation and grain yield in wheat cultivars released from the 1940s to the 2010s newergenotypes showed the highest nue under water deficit combined with n limited conditions additionally based on principal component analysis we found that the newer genotypes i e those from the 2000s and the 2010s are more sensitive to low nitrogen and water stress compared with the older genotypes from the 1980s which are more sensitive to the combined effect of water and n limitations our findings provide a theoretical support for further improvement of the wheat yield potential

changes are already impacting food production by influencing the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens which in turn reduce crop yield and quality insufficient rainfall and excess use of fertilizers have become major causes of concern as they pose a direct threat to crop productivity worldwide osakabe et al 2014 the large dryland farming area 16 million ha on the loess plateau is a major grain producing area in china but the region is constrained by water deficiency and insuﬃcient soil water storage for crop production zhang et al 2011 water availability affects plant requirements and responses to nitrogen n a high crop water productivity wue is critical for high plant productivity in arid and semi arid regions however a low n content in plant tissues can limit soil water absorption and thereby wue nitrogen is often considered a most important factor affecting crop productivity in arid areas where n application can improve wue and thus reduce the negative impacts of drought stress on plant growth the significant interactions between n fertilization and irrigation reportedly affect grain protein formation zhang et al 2017 root traits elazab et al 2016 photosynthesis wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 nitrogen content sanchez bragado et al 2017 and wue kunrath et al 2018 liu and wang 2018 among other processes photosynthesis is an important process whereby plants absorb light energy and assimilate co2 to produce dry matter the process can be inhibited by reducing transpiration rate stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis rate under conditions of water deficit yordanov et al 2000 in contrast n application has been shown to improve the acclimation of plant photosynthesis to water deficit in many crops including rice zhong et al 2019 and wheat gao et al 2019 however apparent n recovery efficiency i e the percentage of n fertilizer recovered in aboveground plant biomass at the end of the cropping season by crops is approximately 33 the remaining n is lost as surface runoff leached as nitrate into groundwater volatilized into the atmosphere or removed by microbial denitrification ju et al 2009 the current intensified use of fertilizers not only increases the waste and pollution of living resources but also decreases crop quality due to increased nitrate accumulation causing soil degradation therefore it is most urgent to reduce the environmental impacts of n fertilizers while increasing water and nitrogen use efficiency in crops wheat triticum aestivum l is the most extensively cultivated cereal crop worldwide accounting for 20 of the calories consumed by the global population fao 2016 wheat plays an important role in ensuring food security and breeding high yielding wheat cultivars is critical to meet the needs of the ever increasing world population duan et al 2019 agami et al 2018 the genetic gain in wheat yield and changes in crop phenotypes have been quantified over many years of wheat variety replacement in many countries including the united states donmez et al 2001 australia siddique et al 1989 sadras and lawson 2011 france brancourt hulmel et al 2003 uk austin et al 1980 shearman et al 2005 and china zhou et al 2007 tian et al 2011 xiao et al 2012 sun et al 2014 shaanxi province is the most important area of winter wheat production in china and at least six wheat cultivars have been cultivated in this area since the 1940s zhuang 2003 newer cultivars normally show higher yield compared with older cultivars around the world subira et al 2014 sun et al 2014 de santis et al 2017 similarly through genetic improvement wheat yield in the shaanxi province increased by 22 8 kg ha yr 1 from the 1940s to the 2010s sun et al 2014 tian et al 2016 increases in grain yield have been mainly associated with increased harvest index and number of kernels per square meter xiao et al 2012 sadras and lawson 2013 crop yield may be further improved through the combined implementation of genetically improved cultivars and increased availability of n and water resources sinclair and rufty 2012 many studies have focused on the interaction between genetic improvement in wheat and fertilizer rates the results show that modern varieties are higher yielding at all n levels because of higher n absorption ortiz monasterio et al 1997 le gouis et al 2000 guarda et al 2004 sadras et al 2016 in france old varieties achieved a higher yield at relatively low n rates while modern cultivars achieve higher yields at relatively high n rates brancourt hulmel et al 2003 a similar crossover interaction was found in wheat varieties released between 1950 and 1985 in mexico ortiz monasterio et al 1997 furthermore wheat varieties released in australia between 1958 and 2007 increased their n uptake by progressively increasing root efficiency in capturing n aziz et al 2017 in contrast sun et al 2014 showed that newer cultivars with higher yield do not necessarily display improved adaptability to water deficit however some studies have shown that modern wheat cultivars have higher wue compared with that of older cultivars in dry areas siddique et al 1990 fang et al 2011 the full potential of genetically improved wheat cultivars cannot be realized without exploring their n use efficiency nue and their wue therefore to reduce the environmental impact of fertilizer application and to increase wue and nue in wheat the possible interaction between water and n and their effect on wheat cultivars need to be investigated the present study aimed to quantify the genetic variability for grain yield nue and wue in five dryland wheat cultivars developed between the 1940s and 2010s and to investigate the physiological basis of such variability the study focused on dry matter accumulation and leaf gas exchange under two water and nitrogen conditions we hypothesised that in a synergistic environment of four water nitrogen treatment combinations newly developed varieties with stronger adaptability potential would show greater wue nue and yield compared with older genotypes principal component analysis pca was used to evaluate the potential for high yield and to identify the parameters affected by water deficit or low n conditions the results presented in our study will help to identify the optimal combination of yield nue and wue under different n and water conditions during the wheat variety replacement process the analysis of dynamic monitoring of the growth flag leaf photosynthesis characteristics and dry matter accumulation during the growth period of different wheat varieties was conducted to explain the variations in wheat yield and the improved nue and wue as well as to provide theoretical basis for subsequent breeding projects and crop production 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions five dryland winter wheat cultivars were selected among varieties that were widely cultivated in shaanxi province in china between the 1940s and the 2010s table 1 a planter experiment was conducted in an open rainout shelter which could be closed when rain threatened at the state laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china from late october 2017 to early june 2018 seeds of the five winter wheat genotypes were surface sterilized with 3 h2o2 for 20 min and then washed three times with deionized water the seeds were germinated in a plastic box for two weeks seedlings of uniform morphology were selected and transplanted into planters on october 23 2017 the planters

treatments included low nitrogen ln 140 mg kg 1 and control n treatment 450 mg kg 1 seedlings were thinned to 12 plants per planter for subsequent studies water treatments were initiated at the late elongation stage by a weighing method planters were irrigated once a day in the afternoon plant age was recorded at the onset of specific growth stages the following four treatment combinations were included well watered normal n ww nn well watered low n ww ln water deficit normal n ws nn and water deficit low n ws ln planters were weighed and watered every day to maintain the soil moisture at 75 5 and 35 5 in ww and ws treatments respectively until maturity during the drying cycle the amount of water used was determined by the reduction in pot weight in the ww treatment water use was determined from the water added all experimental planters were randomly assigned a place in the greenhouse to control edge effects 2 2 plant morphology and dry matter accumulation measurement plant height and leaf area were measured at flowering and maturity entire wheat plants were washed to remove the soil and then separated into roots stem leaf and leaf sheath the dry matter weight was determined after oven drying at 70 c to a constant weight 2 3 measurement of leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll in the flag leaf leaf gas exchange measurements on the flag leaf were conducted at

plant morphology and dry matter accumulation plant height was significantly affected p 0 01 by water n treatment and genotype at flowering stage fig 1 a plant height was particularly enhanced by ww although nn and ln treatments also increased plant height significantly adequate n supply resulted in a significant increase in plant height in both ww and ws plants furthermore a significant interaction was detected between genotype and water p 0 01 fig 1a similarly leaf area was affected significantly p 0 01 by water n genotype and by the interactions w n p 0 01 and w g p 0 01 fig 1b leaf area was particularly enhanced by ww although nn and ln treatments also increased it significantly fig 1b adequate n supply resulted in a significant increase in leaf area in both ww and ws treatments relative to ww root dry weight increased by 0 6 in ws treatments with different genotype and n rate although this increase was not significant p 0 05 conversely shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights decreased by 20 6 44 39 and 75 13 respectively fig 2 however application of nn significantly p 0 01 increased root shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights by 20 39 17 40 22 03 and 33 28 respectively additionally shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights were significantly affected by genotype p 0 01 in contrast only the w n g interaction had a significant effect p 0 001 on root dry weight among all genotypes the greatest shoot dry weight was measured in changwu 134 and the largest leaf and leaf sheath dry weights were detected in chang han 58 3 2 gas exchange parameters and scmr in the flag leaf both water and n regimes had significant effects on all flag leaf gas exchange parameters fig 3 the ww regime significantly increased p n tr and scmr compared with the ws regime at

stages did not increase consistently with cultivar replacement between the 1940s and 2010s compared with the other four genotypes chang han 58 showed lower tr in the ww treatments and in the ws nn treatment at filling and flowering stages at the filling stage the lowest scmr value among all tested genotypes was measured in mazha in the ww treatments and in the ws nn treatment however the highest scmr value was observed in changwu 134 under the ww treatments a significant two way interaction w n for scmr was recorded at filling and flowering the only significant interaction p 0 001 was recorded for w n g on tr at filling 3 3 nitrogen absorption and utilization the overall mean n content averaged across genotypes and n treatments decreased significantly in the root 11 81 aboveground parts 2 05 and seeds 34 3 under ws similarly in general mean n content decreased significantly in roots 55 01 and seeds 97 under ln regardless of genotype or water regime but increased by 12 96 in aboveground plant parts thus root aboveground parts and seed n contents were strongly affected by water n and genotype changwu 134 accumulated more n in the seeds under ww in both ln and nn treatments than under ws treatments in contrast seed n content in chang han 58 was greater under ws treatments table 3 as for nue the overall mean obtained when genotypes and n treatments were pooled together decreased significantly 8 83 under ws further seed protein content and pfpn decreased by 52 63 and 30 58 respectively however wue increased by 13 3 under ws averaging across genotypes and water treatments nue and pfpn increased by 20 36 and 78 36 under ln treatment respectively although wue was reduced by 29 23 and seed protein concentration by 45 99 nue gpy and pfpn were significantly affected by n application rate p 0 01 and genotype p 0 01 the interaction w n g had a highly significant effect p 0 001 on nue fig 4 more importantly wue was significantly affected by water p 0 01 n p 0 01 g p 0 01 and by w n p 0 05 w g p 0 01 n g p 0 01 and w n g p 0 01 interactions 3 4 yield and yield related components the overall means for grain yield tgw spike number grain yield per spike and hi for all genotypes and water treatments increased significantly by 66 38 10 5 37 49 12 58 and 16 45 respectively under the nn treatment the overall mean gy spike number and hi across genotypes and n treatments decreased by 29 49 31 94 and 1 8 respectively under ws however tgw and grain yield per spike increased by 5 24 and 6 01 respectively under ws all yield related parameters and yield components were affected significantly p 0 01 by genotype the highest grain number per spike was recorded for chang han 58 across treatments in turn changwu 134 showed higher grain yield and hi in ww than in the corresponding ws treatments conversely chang han 58 showed higher grain yield and hi in ws than in ww treatments table 2 3 5 principal component analysis of growth and physiological parameters to reveal the key parameters responsible for the response patterns of both nn treated and ln treated plants to water deficit pca was conducted using morphological and physiological data aiming to highlight possible differences and similarities between treatments in the ln treatment under water deficit the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 accounted for 56 1 and 15 5 of the total variation respectively fig 5 pc1 clearly separated the effects of the water deficit treatment the parameters that contributed to pc1 included p n t r scmr aboveground n accumulation grain n accumulation leaf dry weight leaf sheath dry weight number of spikes gy wue gpy and pfpn in contrast plant height root n content leaf sheath dry weight hi and nue contributed to pc2 table 4 in the water deficit treatment under ln pc1 and pc2 accounted for 49 and 25 5 of the total variation respectively fig 5 pc1 clearly separated the effects of water deficit treatment the parameters contributing to pc1 were leaf area p n scmr aboveground n accumulation grain n accumulation leaf sheath dry weight stem dry weight number of spikes gy nue and gpy whereas plant height leaf area tr root n content root dry weight grain number number of spikes gy tgw wue and hi were important factors for pc2 4 discussion 4 1 effects of nitrogen and water on plant morphology and dry matter accumulation plant growth and dry matter accumulation were inhibited by drought regardless of n treatment although inhibition was more significant under ln it has been widely reported that plant height and flag leaf area are tightly associated with crop productivity under drought song et al 2019 in the present study wheat plants grown under water stress were shorter and had smaller flag leaf area at flowering inhibition of flag leaf expansion due to reduced cell hydraulic conductivity under water stress reduces water transport and hinders cell division and enlargement zhang et al 2016 nitrogen application may facilitate the maintenance of dry matter accumulation in water stressed plants li et al 2018 xue et al 2018 our results confirmed the decline in root shoot leaf and leaf sheath dry weights in wheat plants exposed to drought further the application of adequate n amounts helped to reduce adverse drought effects in five varieties of wheat subjected to water deficit similar results were previously reported for other crop plants such as jujube dai et al 2019 4 2 effects of nitrogen and water on gas exchange parameters and scmr of the flag leaf in this study photosynthesis and transpiration rates decreased under drought regardless of n treatment at both filling and flowering stages as a result of stomata closing to reduce water loss although presumably at the expense of a reduction in co2 influx ouyang et al 2017 however an adequate n supply may promote wue whereas a n deficiency may impair the ability of the plant to regulate stomatal movement in accordance with soil moisture availability yang et al 2012 in this study an adequate n application rate improved gas exchange and wue under ww and ws indicating that adequate levels of n may benefit the regulation of gas exchange and improve wue in wheat plants under drought stress concomitantly scmr measurements offer a good strategy to synchronize the impact of the environment growth stage diurnal variation and different leaf features of crop species and genotypes xiong et al 2015 guiducci et al 2018 nitrogen is an important component in the synthesis of plant pigments and photosynthetic enzymes an adequate n application rate may regulate photosynthetic efficiency and guard the leaf from photoinhibition under drought stress wang et al 2016 our results showed that lower scmr readings in the flag leaf were recorded from wheat plants grown under water stress combined with low n 4 3 the effect of n rate and water supply on n absorption and utilization the accumulation distribution and transport of n are significantly affected by n fertilizer and soil moisture dordas 2012 water stress may reduce n content significantly in plant roots aboveground parts and seeds due to reduced available water and n solubility chen et al 2015 consistently our results revealed that root aboveground parts and seed n content in wheat plants was inhibited by drought during flowering variations in nue among different wheat genotypes and n related traits were evaluated for their accuracy in reflecting the interaction between water and n level on wheat cultivars developed and used from the 1940s to the 2010s drought alone reduced nue gpy and pfpn in wheat plants the application of n in sufficient amounts resulted in reduced nue and pfpn under both ww and ws conditions this result indicates a negative relationship between fertilizer rate and nue which contributes to rapid n losses when n input surpasses crop assimilation capacity zhu et al 2016 however adequate n application may enhance grain protein yield 4 4 the effect of nitrogen and water supply on yield and yield related components nitrogen is an essential nutrient involved in different biochemical processes such as enzyme activities dna replication and transcription whereby it is very important for improving the productivity of wheat perchlik and tegeder 2017 in the present study the number of spikes per plant the number of grains per spike and spike 1000 kernel weight were the main factors determining final grain yield per plant different water and n treatments and genotypes affected final grain yield by altering yield parameters nitrogen supply played the most crucial role in determining grain yield table 4 by increasing the number of spikes per plant overall an adequate n application rate increased grain yield and the number of spikes per plant as compared with ln application the importance of n fertilization in increasing grain yield through increasing leaf area index canopy photosynthesis and ultimately the number of tillers spikes per plant has been previously highlighted lópez bellido and lópez bellido 2001 kim and lieth 2003 otteson et al 2007 however when n rate was increased from low to optimal the response of grain yield was highly dependent on available water and genotype in a ww environment the nn treatment produced the highest grain yield from all the different genotypes tested this differential response in grain yield is due to the combined effect of increased number of spikes per plant spike or 1000 kernel weight and number of grains per spike many significant interactions between n and water have been reported for yield and yield parameters srivastava et al 2018 suggesting that a combined optimization of n and water levels is required to improve wheat productivity 4 5 variability among winter wheat genotypes cultivated from the 1940s to the 2010s in shaanxi province multivariate statistical analysis pca of the datasets revealed possible differences and similarities between genotypes subjected to different water and n treatments the effects of the ln treatment under drought conditions and the effect of water deficit under ln conditions were clearly separated by the first component pc1 fig 5 pc1 in fig 5a was wider than pc1 in fig 5b indicating that ln treatment had a greater effect on morphological and physiological parameters than the ws treatment did the key factors in pc1 under ln were leaf area p n scmr aboveground n content grain n content leaf sheath dry weight stem dry weight number of spikes gy nue and gpy indicating that ln largely impacted plant growth photosynthesis dry matter accumulation and n accumulation and utilization rate in contrast the key factors in pc1 under water stress were p n t r scmr aboveground n content grain n content leaf dry weight leaf sheath dry weight number of spikes gy wue gpy and pfpn indicating that water deficit influenced plant growth photosynthesis wue and dry matter accumulation our results also indicated that xiaoyan 6 and chang han 58 are more sensitive to ln than the other genotypes evaluated whereas xiaoyan 6 and changwu 134 are more sensitive to water stress than the rest of the genotypes the yields of chang han 58 and changwu 134 were as large as or higher than those of other genotypes under dry field conditions and under water stress in a greenhouse pot study sun et al 2014 significant genetic improvement in grain yield has always been attributed to increased grain number improved tgw and hi and reduced plant height aisawi et al 2010 increasing grain number per spike and tgw are considered the most likely approach to improve yield potential plants of cultivar chang han 58 showed higher grain yield hi tgw and grain number per spike compared with the other four genotypes under ws ln and nn than under ww conditions among the tested genotypes xiaoyan 6 developed in the 1980s had the shortest stem among all treatments due to the introduction of dwarf or semi dwarf genes according to the records collected between the 1970s and the 2010s the optimum plant height that will result in the highest yield is approximately 80 cm therefore chang han 58 and to a lesser extent changwu 134 both having shorter stems compared with the other two genotypes in the combined water n treatments tested might have altered dry matter partitioning to the root system thereby affecting root growth and plant water use a previous study showed that older genotypes tend to produce deeper root systems while newer genotypes produce shallower root systems mac key 1973 this was corroborated by our results which revealed a higher root biomass in the older genotype mazha than in the newer genotypes under either n treatment combined with ww conditions in addition changwu 134 and to a lesser extent chang han 58 had a higher pn value in the flag leaf compared with that of the other genotypes in all treatments implying that delayed senescence of the flag leaf is a valuable trait for increasing photosynthesis over the entire life cycle of newer wheat cultivars reynolds et al 2000 in addition scmr values for chang han 58 were improved by nn under ws our results have also shown that newer varieties such as changwu 134 and to a lesser extent chang han 58 are characterized by significantly higher nue and pfpn at nn than at ln under ww conditions 5 conclusions previous studies on the interaction between water and n availability in wheat have rarely considered varietal differences in this study an adequate n rate increased yield related parameters and biomass and enhanced wue and photosynthesis by relieving photoinhibition in water stressed plants we identified newer cultivars with higher yield that could be regulated by increased n rates moreover newer wheat cultivars were better adapted to improve flag leaf expansion and photosynthesis rate and to accumulate more dry matter when treated with more optimal levels of n in contrast the relative importance of root biomass decreased in newer cultivars compared with older genotypes nitrogen content in all tested organs nue and pfpn were greater in the newer than in the older genotypes these results suggest that adequate n fertilization positively affects wheat crops developed between the 1940s and the 2010s when cultivated under conditions of water deficit better crop productivity under dryland field conditions requires a thorough understanding of how plants respond to the combined impact of variable water and n supply declarations of competing interest

10542,the lack of natural resources especially good quality cropland and renewable water resources is threatening food production potential in marginal agricultural ecosystems which are already negatively affected by climate change since the world s major crops are proving inadequate to supply the calories and nutrients for people in these areas new crops are sought that can withstand harsh ecological environmental conditions in the current trial we assessed the growth and productivity of tetragonia tetragonioides pallas kuntz in a floating hydroponic system supplied with different seawater proportions i e 15 and 30 seawater ec 9 8 and 18 0 ds m 1 moreover the effects of different salinity levels on mineral elements accumulation production of osmotic solutes and secondary metabolites were determined along with the salt removal capacity of the crop the results indicated that plant growth was not affected by either of the seawater treatments used in this study the increased leaf succulence and the reduction of both leaf area and specific leaf area with increasing salinity might represent an essential feature of this salt tolerant species associated to the plants need of limiting transpiration low seawater treated plants showed a significantly higher biomass yield per liter of sea water used 117 than the control under these conditions plants accumulated the highest amount of mg 31 and 48 in medium and high seawater treated plants compared with the control and cu 14 and 30 respectively along with increasing proline and decreasing nitrate concentrations by contrast we found that seawater supply resulted in a na enriched leaf biomass that may represent an issue for human health we concluded that tetragonia tetragonioides can be grown in saline agriculture up to a salinity level characterized by an ec of 18 ds m 1 but further investigation is required to address na accumulation in leaves keywords new zealand spinach saline agriculture hydroponics seawater irrigation salt tolerant crop salt removing crop seawater footprint 1 introduction increasing population likely will result in an increase of the global food demand for at least another 40 years godfray et al 2010 lack of natural resources especially high quality cropland and renewable water resources will reduce the food production potential in several regions fao 2013 moreover the effects of climate change represent a further threat godfray et al 2010 especially in marginal already stressed agroecosystems cheeseman 2016 today more than 34 mha are salt affected fao 2011 either because they are coastal or because inappropriate irrigation practices have degraded soil and depleted or salinized groundwater cheeseman 2016 although significant advances have been made in the last 25 years in reducing hunger worldwide fao 2013 the situation seems to be less optimistic in areas affected by both drought and salinity cheeseman 2016 given that the world s major crops have proven inadequate to supply people in these areas with sufficient amount of calories proteins fats and nutrients new crops are needed that can specifically withstand such harsh ecological conditions cheeseman 2016 new crops tolerant to saline conditions are likely to be found among edible halophytes halophytes are plants that can grow at salinity levels higher than 200 mm nacl flowers and colmer 2008 roughly corresponding to half strength seawater several morphological physiological and biochemical adaptations are adopted by halophytes to withstand or even to benefit from saline environments panta et al 2014 furthermore favorable effects on yield and its quality can even be related to saline conditions flowers and muscolo 2015 shannon and grieve 1998 the idea of growing salt tolerant plants in agricultural systems irrigated with brackish and saline water is not new glenn et al 1999 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema and schat 2013 however advances in this direction have been slow and in only a few cases has there been the goal of developing new crops cheeseman 2016 according to cheeseman 2016 this is due to the fact that there is little urgency for plant biologists crop scientists and politicians of the developed world in the context of saline agriculture the water requirements of salt tolerant crops are met through brackish water and or seawater thus relieving pressure on fresh water resources however large scale sustainable agriculture involving pure seawater irrigation seems to be impractical for reasons mainly connected to the deterioration of soil structure breckle 2009 irrigating with seawater on fertile and well structured soils would lead to a salt contamination through ca2 na exchange and resulting clay dispersion ventura et al 2015 with additional significant impacts on soil microbial properties chaudhary et al 2016 on the other hand there is growing interest in the possibility of recovering lost coastal soils while minimizing inputs i e freshwater fedoroff et al 2010 an ecologically acceptable compromise to the using of saline waters for food production and the preservation of soil is represented by soilless cultivation atzori et al 2019b another benefit of complementary seawater irrigation relies on the fact that moderate saline stress has been often associated with an increase in plant based compounds that demonstrate healthy properties for humans di baccio et al 2004 sgherri et al 2008 plants cope with salinity by means of several strategies including selective accumulation or exclusion of ions synthesis of osmotic solutes induction of antioxidant compounds parida and das 2005 and secondary metabolite production ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 most of which show positive effects on human health thus halophytes under salinity condition could also become sources of biochemical compounds with the potential of additional nutritive value flowers and muscolo 2015 tetragonia tetragonioides pallas kuntze aizoaceae caryophyllales the common new zealand spinach and hereafter referred to as simply tetragonia is an annual herbaceous plant native to cool sandy and rocky seacoasts notably in new zealand japan argentina and chile now widely distributed throughout the world taylor 1994 it is used as a vegetable an ornamental ground and for medicinal purposes due to its anti ulcerogenic and anti inflammatory characteristics yousif et al 2010a tetragonia is a salt tolerant plant and several trials have shown that it may withstand an electrical conductivity ec of the growing medium as high as 10 ds m 1 neves et al 2008 wilson et al 2000 one study identified a salt induced growth response at salinity levels of 50 100 mm nacl ec 5 10 ds m 1 yousif et al 2010b though this salt stimulated growth appeared to depend greatly on the age of the plant which was further able to tolerate up to 17 4 ds m 1 in late salinization treatments wilson et al 2000 similarly in hydroponics conditions ahmed and johnson 2000 set a salinity tolerance threshold for this species at an ec value around 12 5 ds m 1 literature data on salinity tolerance refer solely to saline irrigation using nacl solutions whereas no information is available on the salinity tolerance of tetragonia tetragonioides using seawater interestingly for most species salt stress tolerance seems to be higher when treated with seawater than with nacl solutions treatments with the same ec boyko and boyko 1966 further research is still needed to confirm such a statement yet sakamoto et al 2014 suggest a similar assumption in addition this plant has been proposed as a salt removing species because of its high na and cl uptake neves et al 2014 salt removing species include grasses shrubs and trees that can extract salts from contaminated soils in contrast to costly desalination technologies such as thermal distillation processes membrane based processes electro dialysis and reverse osmosis islam et al 2019 phytodesalination is a cost effective green technology for the remediation of salt impacted sites hasanuzzaman et al 2014 the same principle can also be tested in hydroponics to assess a salt removing species capability of desalinating saline water islam et al 2019 however the salt removal potential of this plant has not been assessed in seawater fed hydroponic systems the current study thus had the aims of i evaluating the effects of seawater irrigation on growth productivity of tetragonia tetragonioides in hydroponic culture ii assessing the accumulation of ions and the production of osmotic solutes along with secondary metabolites related to physiological adaptation and to the nutritive value of the crop in response to different salinity levels and iii assessing the salt removal capability at increasing seawater concentrations in hydroponic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design plant material and growth conditions the trial was carried out in 2018

analyzed through one way anova using graphpad prism 5 for windows graphpad software inc california usa posthoc comparisons tukey hsd were made to contrast the levels of the independent variables and differences were deemed significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 growth as reported in fig 1 no significant differences in growth were assessed throughout the trial between salt treated plants and the control even if a decreasing trend was observable for high seawater treated plants during the last three weeks of the experiment similar results were found for the rgr where control plants showed a rate of 1 4 0 4 g g 1 day 1 and medium and high seawater treated plants a rate of 1 2 0 1 and 1 2 0 2 g g 1 day 1 respectively no significant differences among treated and control plants were observed regarding the morphological screening of leaves both leaf water content and leaf dry matter content were not affected by salinity table 2 by contrast leaf succulence did significantly increase compared with the control with increasing salinity whereas the leaf area and the specific leaf area decreased in high seawater treated plants compared with both the medium salinity treatment and the control 3 2 water consumptions wue wp wf fig 2 shows the water related parameters both seawater treatments showed a significant decrease in terms of plant water use compared with the control fig 2a with a decrease in medium and high seawater treated plants of 30 and 31 respectively compared with the control by contrast seawater increased the wue in both medium and high seawater treated plants compared with the control fig 2b similarly wp increased in both seawater treatments even if significantly only in medium seawater treated plants fig 2c lastly the wf fig 2d significantly dropped for both seawater treatments 76 in medium seawater and 71 in high seawater treatment compared with the control 3 3 leaf gas exchange parameters fig 3 shows the results of the photosynthetic rate fig 3a and stomatal conductance rate fig 3b measurements under different growing conditions at the very beginning of the trial both seawater treatments negatively affected the net assimilation rate an in particular the medium seawater treatment initially lead to a decrease of the an but began to recover starting from the 4th measurement such that by the end of the trial it had reached the level of the control on the other hand in the high seawater treatment an decreased starting from the 3rd measurement onwards the stomatal conductance rate showed a decreasing trend compared with the control in both treatments starting from week 4 for both seawater treatments and onwards for the high salinity treatment medium seawater treatment did not negatively affect the cha and carotenoid concentrations but decreased the chb concentration in leaves table 3 by contrast high seawater treatment reduced the concentration of all pigments compared with the control 3 4 root respiration as reported in table

mineral elements accumulated in leaves stems and roots seawater treatments led to a significantly higher accumulation of mg 31 and 48 in medium and high seawater treatments compared with the control cu 14 and 30 respectively and na 79 and 82 respectively in the three tissues with roots also accumulating higher amounts of p and zn compared with control plants however seawater led to a significant decrease in p k ca and fe in leaves of k and ca in stems of ca in roots fig 4 reports absence and presence of sodium in the bladders cells of tetragonia in control a and saline b conditions

leaves surface 3 6 nutritional characterization of edible leaves total phenolics fig 5 a and nitrates fig 5b did significantly decrease in seawater treated plants compared with the control the concentration of proline instead increased accordingly with increasing salinity fig 5c of 43 and 61 in medium and high seawater treated plants compared with control conditions respectively 3 7 phytodesalination capacity as reported in fig 6 the relative phytodesalination rate was significantly higher in seawater treated plants compared with the control however despite the difference in ec of the two seawater treatments i e 9 8 and 18 04 ds m 1 respectively no significant differences in the salt removing capacity were assessed between the two groups of plants grown with seawater 4 discussion 4 1 growth and morphological responses to increased salinity the current trial shows that plant growth was not negatively affected by any seawater treatments even if a decreasing trend is observable in the last weeks of the experiment in 30 seawater treated plants the results obtained in medium seawater treatment ec 9 8 ds m 1 are in agreement with those found by other scientists neves et al 2008 and wilson et al 2000 who reported a salinity tolerance for tetragonia at ec approx 10 ds m 1 similarly ahmed and johnson 2000 found in hydroponic conditions a salinity tolerance threshold at ec 12 5 ds m 1 by contrast in the current trial the results for high seawater treatments 18 0 ds m 1 suggest a remarkably higher tolerance threshold comparable only to the results obtained by wilson et al 2000 on well developed plants nevertheless even if not significantly high seawater treated plants showed a growth reduction in the last two weeks of the trial this could be due to the significant reduction in the net assimilation rate at the end the experiment however this drop occurred at the very end of the crop cycle and the final biomass did not suffer a significant reduction regarding the morphological adaptations the increasing in leaf succulence with increasing salinity represents a common response to salt stress halophytes are known for maintaining their growth rate in saline conditions through osmotic adjustment flowers and yeo 1986 the increase in leaf succulence i e the water content per unit area is one of the mechanisms plants use to respond to a low external water potential induced by salinity flowers and colmer 2008 moreover in accordance with dicotyledonous halophyte behaviors such morphological changes allow high carbon assimilation rates per unit area ensuring high growth rates despite decreased sla atzori et al 2017 ayala and o leary 1995 de vos et al 2013 2010 geissler et al 2009 rozema et al 2015 which is another strategy used by plants to reduce transpiration water loss flowers and flowers 2005 4 2 water saving the decrease of water use observed in this trial with increasing salinity can be explained to a certain extent by the limited water uptake and translocation in salt stressed plants due to decreased transpiration rates expressed by the stomatal conductance under saline conditions in addition decreasing la sla and increasing leaf succulence in seawater treated plants also limited the transpiration the higher wue of seawater treated plants led to biomass yields comparable to the control this was particularly true for medium seawater treated plants where the biomass produced per liter of sea water used was significantly higher than the control similar results have been observed on other species for instance plantago coronopus l grown at different levels of salinity showed an increase in wue with increasing salt concentrations koyro 2006 by contrast salt sensitive species are generally characterized by a decrease of wue in saline conditions katerji et al 2003 the increased wp observed in medium seawater treatment sets the optimum salinity for the tested crop even if further studies should be made on the salinity range between 15 and 30 seawater in line with other parameters wf for both seawater treated plants was significantly lower compared with the control interestingly both seawater treatments showed the same wf values thereby suggesting that the medium seawater treatment reducing crop water use and increasing water productivity is likely the most justified 4 3 leaf and root physiological adaptations both chlorophyll a in high seawater treatment and b in both seawater treatments decreased with increasing salinity of the growing medium such a decrease however seemed to affect the plants photosynthetic apparatus only by the end of the cycle suggesting that also pigments reduction occurred at the same time these findings are consistent with other studies on halophytes showing a decrease in chlorophyll pigments under saline conditions aghaleh et al 2009 ayala and o leary 1995 koyro et al 2013 parida et al 2002 the accumulation of mineral elements in shoots and roots represents another crucial physiological adaptation to salinity in our trial plants exposed to seawater showed higher mg cu and na concentration in both shoot and root tissues and a decrease of p k ca and fe in leaves and of ca in roots compared with control the high amount of na represents one of the most common responses of halophytes to salinity it has been shown that tetragonia as many salt tolerant includer species neves et al 2008 yousif et al 2010b may accumulate sodium in its vacuoles and use it as an osmoticum glenn et al 1999 the different accumulation patterns of the other elements in tissues might also play a role in osmotic adjustment if they were efficiently compartmentalized at the cell level ghoulam et al 2002 root respiration rates did not change among treatments a study on the grey mangrove avicennia marina forssk vierh 1907 found that a concentration of 25 seawater led to an increased respiration compared with both control and higher salinity conditions following the same pattern of the growth responses of the plant burchett et al 1984 moreover another trial found a rather small increase in root respiration for s physophora pall that was correlated with its high salt tolerance capacity liangpeng et al 2007 our results might be explained by the fact that the seawater treatments used in the present trial neither increased nor reduced the plants growth compared with the control 4 4 nutritional properties of tetragonia with increased salinity since leaves are the edible parts of tetragonia the accumulation of mg and cu following seawater exposure might represent an interesting improvement of nutritional value achievable in salinity conditions magnesium and copper are in fact among the mineral elements most frequently lacking in human diets white and broadley 2009 with deficiencies common in both developed and developing countries it is noteworthy that agricultural products are the primary source of all nutrients agricultural systems cannot fail in providing enough products containing adequate quantities of nutrients otherwise dysfunctional food systems would result in not supporting healthy lives welch and graham 2004 to address this issue agronomic approaches to increase the concentrations of mineral elements in agricultural products i e biofortification are of interest lynch 2007 seawater irrigation seems to be a feasible option for the biofortification of crops interestingly species from families within the caryophyllales tend to accumulate very high mg and zn amounts in leaves white and broadley 2009 broadley et al 2004 white 2001 in contrast the increase of na concentration in leaves could represent a severe concern for the healthy characterization of the crop in fact sodium excesses in the human diet are related to cardiovascular disease risk o donnell et al 2015 nevertheless the new zealand spinach is a species requiring cooking before consumption in a recent study on the common spinach caparrotta et al 2019 assessed a significant reduction in the sodium content of leaves after processing by boiling and steaming the total phenolics decrease under saline conditions suggests that tetragonia enhanced the production of other compounds to act as compatible solutes for osmotic adjustment i e proline in accordance to previous studies yousif et al 2010a proline is known to have a positive effect on enzyme and membrane integrity and to show adaptive roles in mediating osmotic adjustment in plants exposed to abiotic stress ashraf and foolad 2007 interestingly proline plays an essential role in protein synthesis and structure metabolism and nutrition therefore physiological needs for proline are particularly high during animal and human life cycles wu et al 2011 likewise the decrease in nitrates in seawater treated plants represents another important achievement from a nutritional standpoint our results are in line with a study on another halophyte portulaca oleracea l that showed a decrease of nitrate levels accordingly to salinity franco et al 2011 some authors relate this reduction to an increase in chloride concentrations within the plant roussos et al 2007 however this aspect needs further investigation on the tested crop 4 5 salt removal potential and prospective of tetragonia crop in saline agriculture although a complete and holistic approach on plant and associated rhizosphere microorganisms impacts in the salt affected soil system or liquid nutritive solution is not fully explored in the literature the main mechanisms are well established jesus et al 2015 in particular there are two main mechanisms to explain the role of halophyte plants in the remediation of salt affected soils the first one is ph reduction which increases the dissolution of caco3 and therefore the available ca2 for cation exchange with na walker et al 2014 the second mechanism is plant uptake of dissolved salts in general sodium in particular rabhi et al 2015 our results confirmed this latter strategy in accordance with previous studies assessing this species as the best salt removing crop among many others neves et al 2008 although none of the tested salt concentrations has resulted in biomass loss focusing on the concerns raised on water use and the nutritional value of the edible parts the best salinity conditions for the tetragonia seem to be between the 15 and 30 seawater concentrations the already appreciated taste of saline agriculture vegetables in different countries rozema and schat 2013 and of the new zealand spinach in particular also encourage such a possibility according to our results only the na concentration in the edible leaves could constitute a concern for the healthy characterization of the crop yet the cooking processes can help in remarkably reducing its content 5 conclusions this species ability to achieve remarkable growth rates under saline conditions validates its potential in saline environments the results of this study show that the production of the new zealand spinach as a food can be obtained in hydroponic conditions characterized by salinity as high as 18 ds m 1 plant water use dropped in saline conditions yet thanks to an increased wue the biomass production was not negatively affected again validating the seawater irrigation of this species up to the tested ec seawater introduction in the hydroponics solutions also led to the enhancement of nutritional value such characteristics along with the increased leaf succulence provide the edible leaves with a taste and consistency that could be particularly appreciated by consumers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10542,the lack of natural resources especially good quality cropland and renewable water resources is threatening food production potential in marginal agricultural ecosystems which are already negatively affected by climate change since the world s major crops are proving inadequate to supply the calories and nutrients for people in these areas new crops are sought that can withstand harsh ecological environmental conditions in the current trial we assessed the growth and productivity of tetragonia tetragonioides pallas kuntz in a floating hydroponic system supplied with different seawater proportions i e 15 and 30 seawater ec 9 8 and 18 0 ds m 1 moreover the effects of different salinity levels on mineral elements accumulation production of osmotic solutes and secondary metabolites were determined along with the salt removal capacity of the crop the results indicated that plant growth was not affected by either of the seawater treatments used in this study the increased leaf succulence and the reduction of both leaf area and specific leaf area with increasing salinity might represent an essential feature of this salt tolerant species associated to the plants need of limiting transpiration low seawater treated plants showed a significantly higher biomass yield per liter of sea water used 117 than the control under these conditions plants accumulated the highest amount of mg 31 and 48 in medium and high seawater treated plants compared with the control and cu 14 and 30 respectively along with increasing proline and decreasing nitrate concentrations by contrast we found that seawater supply resulted in a na enriched leaf biomass that may represent an issue for human health we concluded that tetragonia tetragonioides can be grown in saline agriculture up to a salinity level characterized by an ec of 18 ds m 1 but further investigation is required to address na accumulation in leaves keywords new zealand spinach saline agriculture hydroponics seawater irrigation salt tolerant crop salt removing crop seawater footprint 1 introduction increasing population likely will result in an increase of the global food demand for at least another 40 years godfray et al 2010 lack of natural resources especially high quality cropland and renewable water resources will reduce the food production potential in several regions fao 2013 moreover the effects of climate change represent a further threat godfray et al 2010 especially in marginal already stressed agroecosystems cheeseman 2016 today more than 34 mha are salt affected fao 2011 either because they are coastal or because inappropriate irrigation practices have degraded soil and depleted or salinized groundwater cheeseman 2016 although significant advances have been made in the last 25 years in reducing hunger worldwide fao 2013 the situation seems to be less optimistic in areas affected by both drought and salinity cheeseman 2016 given that the world s major crops have proven inadequate to supply people in these areas with sufficient amount of calories proteins fats and nutrients new crops are needed that can specifically withstand such harsh ecological conditions cheeseman 2016 new crops tolerant to saline conditions are likely to be found among edible halophytes halophytes are plants that can grow at salinity levels higher than 200 mm nacl flowers and colmer 2008 roughly corresponding to half strength seawater several morphological physiological and biochemical adaptations are adopted by halophytes to withstand or even to benefit from saline environments panta et al 2014 furthermore favorable effects on yield and its quality can even be related to saline conditions flowers and muscolo 2015 shannon and grieve 1998 the idea of growing salt tolerant plants in agricultural systems irrigated with brackish and saline water is not new glenn et al 1999 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema and schat 2013 however advances in this direction have been slow and in only a few cases has there been the goal of developing new crops cheeseman 2016 according to cheeseman 2016 this is due to the fact that there is little urgency for plant biologists crop scientists and politicians of the developed world in the context of saline agriculture the water requirements of salt tolerant crops are met through brackish water and or seawater thus relieving pressure on fresh water resources however large scale sustainable agriculture involving pure seawater irrigation seems to be impractical for reasons mainly connected to the deterioration of soil structure breckle 2009 irrigating with seawater on fertile and well structured soils would lead to a salt contamination through ca2 na exchange and resulting clay dispersion ventura et al 2015 with additional significant impacts on soil microbial properties chaudhary et al 2016 on the other hand there is growing interest in the possibility of recovering lost coastal soils while minimizing inputs i e freshwater fedoroff et al 2010 an ecologically acceptable compromise to the using of saline waters for food production and the preservation of soil is represented by soilless cultivation atzori et al 2019b another benefit of complementary seawater irrigation relies on the fact that moderate saline stress has been often associated with an increase in plant based compounds that demonstrate healthy properties for humans di baccio et al 2004 sgherri et al 2008 plants cope with salinity by means of several strategies including selective accumulation or exclusion of ions synthesis of osmotic solutes induction of antioxidant compounds parida and das 2005 and secondary metabolite production ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 most of which show positive effects on human health thus halophytes under salinity condition could also become sources of biochemical compounds with the potential of additional nutritive value flowers and muscolo 2015 tetragonia tetragonioides pallas kuntze aizoaceae caryophyllales the common new zealand spinach and hereafter referred to as simply tetragonia is an annual herbaceous plant native to cool sandy and rocky seacoasts notably in new zealand japan argentina and chile now widely distributed throughout the world taylor 1994 it is used as a vegetable an ornamental ground and for medicinal purposes due to its anti ulcerogenic and anti inflammatory characteristics yousif et al 2010a tetragonia is a salt tolerant plant and several trials have shown that it may withstand an electrical conductivity ec of the growing medium as high as 10 ds m 1 neves et al 2008 wilson et al 2000 one study identified a salt induced growth response at salinity levels of 50 100 mm nacl ec 5 10 ds m 1 yousif et al 2010b though this salt stimulated growth appeared to depend greatly on the age of the plant which was further able to tolerate up to 17 4 ds m 1 in late salinization treatments wilson et al 2000 similarly in hydroponics conditions ahmed and johnson 2000 set a salinity tolerance threshold for this species at an ec value around 12 5 ds m 1 literature data on salinity tolerance refer solely to saline irrigation using nacl solutions whereas no information is available on the salinity tolerance of tetragonia tetragonioides using seawater interestingly for most species salt stress tolerance seems to be higher when treated with seawater than with nacl solutions treatments with the same ec boyko and boyko 1966 further research is still needed to confirm such a statement yet sakamoto et al 2014 suggest a similar assumption in addition this plant has been proposed as a salt removing species because of its high na and cl uptake neves et al 2014 salt removing species include grasses shrubs and trees that can extract salts from contaminated soils in contrast to costly desalination technologies such as thermal distillation processes membrane based processes electro dialysis and reverse osmosis islam et al 2019 phytodesalination is a cost effective green technology for the remediation of salt impacted sites hasanuzzaman et al 2014 the same principle can also be tested in hydroponics to assess a salt removing species capability of desalinating saline water islam et al 2019 however the salt removal potential of this plant has not been assessed in seawater fed hydroponic systems the current study thus had the aims of i evaluating the effects of seawater irrigation on growth productivity of tetragonia tetragonioides in hydroponic culture ii assessing the accumulation of ions and the production of osmotic solutes along with secondary metabolites related to physiological adaptation and to the nutritive value of the crop in response to different salinity levels and iii assessing the salt removal capability at increasing seawater concentrations in hydroponic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design plant material and growth conditions the trial was carried out in 2018 at the greenhouse facilities of the department of agricultural food environmental and forestry sciences and technologies dagri at the university of florence italy a hydroponic system was set up with

week before the beginning of the experiment and stored at 4 c seawater chemical and physical characteristics are reported in table 1 starting from october 8th for 2 weeks plants were gradually acclimatized to salinity by increasing the seawater concentration by 5 every 2 3 days until reaching the final concentration on october 22nd which represents the starting day of the experiment samples

analyses subsequently plants were divided into leaves stems and roots and weighed separately pictures of all leaves from 6 plants per treatment were obtained to calculate the leaf area la using imagej software afterwards all samples were oven dried 70 c to constant weight and dry leaf stem and root biomass was determined moreover the specific leaf area sla leaf succulence leaf dry matter content

analyzed through one way anova using graphpad prism 5 for windows graphpad software inc california usa posthoc comparisons tukey hsd were made to contrast the levels of the independent variables and differences were deemed significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 growth as reported in fig 1 no significant differences in growth were assessed throughout the trial between salt treated plants and the control even if a decreasing trend was observable for high seawater treated plants during the last three weeks of the experiment similar results were found for the rgr where control plants showed a rate of 1 4 0 4 g g 1 day 1 and medium and high seawater treated plants a rate of 1 2 0 1 and 1 2 0 2 g g 1 day 1 respectively no significant differences among treated and control plants were observed regarding the morphological screening of leaves both leaf water content and leaf dry matter content were not affected by salinity table 2 by contrast leaf succulence did significantly increase compared with the control with increasing salinity whereas the leaf area and the specific leaf area decreased in high seawater treated plants compared with both the medium salinity treatment and the control 3 2 water consumptions wue wp wf fig 2 shows the water related parameters both seawater treatments showed a significant decrease in terms of plant water use compared with the control fig 2a with a decrease in medium and high seawater treated plants of 30 and 31 respectively compared with the control by contrast seawater increased the wue in both medium and high seawater treated plants compared with the control fig 2b similarly wp increased in both seawater treatments even if significantly only in medium seawater treated plants fig 2c lastly the wf fig 2d significantly dropped for both seawater treatments 76 in medium seawater and 71 in high seawater treatment compared with the control 3 3 leaf gas exchange parameters fig 3 shows the results of the photosynthetic rate fig 3a and stomatal conductance rate fig 3b measurements under different growing conditions at the very beginning of the trial both seawater treatments negatively affected the net assimilation rate an in particular the medium seawater treatment initially lead to a decrease of the an but began to recover starting from the 4th measurement such that by the end of the trial it had reached the level of the control on the other hand in the high seawater treatment an decreased starting from the 3rd measurement onwards the stomatal conductance rate showed a decreasing trend compared with the control in both treatments starting from week 4 for both seawater treatments and onwards for the high salinity treatment medium seawater treatment did not negatively affect the cha and carotenoid concentrations but decreased the chb concentration in leaves table 3 by contrast high seawater treatment reduced the concentration of all pigments compared with the control 3 4 root respiration as reported in table

mineral elements accumulated in leaves stems and roots seawater treatments led to a significantly higher accumulation of mg 31 and 48 in medium and high seawater treatments compared with the control cu 14 and 30 respectively and na 79 and 82 respectively in the three tissues with roots also accumulating higher amounts of p and zn compared with control plants however seawater led to a significant decrease in p k ca and fe in leaves of k and ca in stems of ca in roots fig 4 reports absence and presence of sodium in the bladders cells of tetragonia in control a and saline b conditions respectively images assessed a qualitative increase of sodium in seawater treated leaves compared with control ones in particular sodium accumulation occurred in the bladder cells located on the leaves surface 3 6 nutritional characterization of edible leaves total phenolics fig 5 a and nitrates fig 5b did significantly decrease in seawater treated plants compared with the control the concentration of proline instead increased accordingly with increasing salinity fig 5c of 43 and 61 in medium and high seawater treated plants compared with control conditions respectively 3 7 phytodesalination capacity as reported in fig 6 the relative phytodesalination rate was significantly higher in seawater treated plants compared with the control however despite the difference in ec of the two seawater treatments i e 9 8 and 18 04 ds m 1 respectively no significant differences in the salt removing capacity were assessed between the two groups of plants grown with seawater 4 discussion 4 1 growth and morphological responses to increased salinity the current trial shows that plant growth was not negatively affected by any seawater treatments even if a decreasing trend is observable in the last weeks of the experiment in 30 seawater treated plants the results obtained in medium seawater treatment ec 9 8 ds m 1 are in agreement with those found by other scientists neves et al 2008 and wilson et al 2000 who reported a salinity tolerance for tetragonia at ec approx 10 ds m 1 similarly ahmed and johnson 2000 found in hydroponic conditions a salinity tolerance threshold at ec 12 5 ds m 1 by contrast in the current trial the results for high seawater treatments 18 0 ds m 1 suggest a remarkably higher tolerance threshold comparable only to the results obtained by wilson et al 2000 on well developed plants nevertheless even if not significantly high seawater treated plants showed a growth reduction in the last two weeks of the trial this could be due to the significant reduction in the net assimilation rate at the end the experiment however this drop occurred at the very end of the crop cycle and the final biomass did not suffer a significant reduction regarding the morphological adaptations the increasing in leaf succulence with increasing salinity represents a common response to salt stress halophytes are known for maintaining their growth rate in saline conditions through osmotic adjustment flowers and yeo 1986 the increase in leaf succulence i e the water content per unit area is one of the mechanisms plants use to respond to a low external water potential induced by salinity flowers and colmer 2008 moreover in accordance with dicotyledonous halophyte behaviors such morphological changes allow high carbon assimilation rates per unit area ensuring high growth rates despite decreased sla atzori et al 2017 ayala and o leary 1995 de vos et al 2013 2010 geissler et al 2009 rozema et al 2015 which is another strategy used by plants to reduce transpiration water loss flowers and flowers 2005 4 2 water saving the decrease of water use observed in this trial with increasing salinity can be explained to a certain extent by the limited water uptake and translocation in salt stressed plants due to decreased transpiration rates expressed by the stomatal conductance under saline conditions in addition decreasing la sla and increasing leaf succulence in seawater treated plants also limited the transpiration the higher wue of seawater treated plants led to biomass yields comparable to the control this was particularly true for medium seawater treated plants where the biomass produced per liter of sea water used was significantly higher than the control similar results have been observed on other species for instance plantago coronopus l grown at different levels of salinity showed an increase in wue with increasing salt concentrations koyro 2006 by contrast salt sensitive species are generally characterized by a decrease of wue in saline conditions katerji et al 2003 the increased wp observed in medium seawater treatment sets the optimum salinity for the tested crop even if further studies should be made on the salinity range between 15 and 30 seawater in line with other parameters wf for both seawater treated plants was significantly lower compared with the control interestingly both seawater treatments showed the same wf values thereby suggesting that the medium seawater treatment reducing crop water use and increasing water productivity is likely the most justified 4 3 leaf and root physiological adaptations both chlorophyll a in high seawater treatment and b in both seawater treatments decreased with increasing salinity of the growing medium such a decrease however seemed to affect the plants photosynthetic apparatus only by the end of the cycle suggesting that also pigments reduction occurred at the same time these findings are consistent with other studies on halophytes showing a decrease in chlorophyll pigments under saline conditions aghaleh et al 2009 ayala and o leary 1995 koyro et al 2013 parida et al 2002 the accumulation of mineral elements in shoots and roots represents another crucial physiological adaptation to salinity in our trial plants exposed to seawater showed higher mg cu and na concentration in both shoot and root tissues and a decrease of p k ca and fe in leaves and of ca in roots compared with control the high amount of na represents one of the most common responses of halophytes to salinity it has been shown that tetragonia as many salt tolerant includer species neves et al 2008 yousif et al 2010b may accumulate sodium in its vacuoles and use it as an osmoticum glenn et al 1999 the different accumulation patterns of the other elements in tissues might also play a role in osmotic adjustment if they were efficiently compartmentalized at the cell level ghoulam et al 2002 root respiration rates did not change among treatments a study on the grey mangrove avicennia marina forssk vierh 1907 found that a concentration of 25 seawater led to an increased respiration compared with both control and higher salinity conditions following the same pattern of the growth responses of the plant burchett et al 1984 moreover another trial found a rather small increase in root respiration for s physophora pall that was correlated with its high salt tolerance capacity liangpeng et al 2007 our results might be explained by the fact that the seawater treatments used in the present trial neither increased nor reduced the plants growth compared with the control 4 4 nutritional properties of tetragonia with increased salinity since leaves are the edible parts of tetragonia the accumulation of mg and cu following seawater exposure might represent an interesting improvement of nutritional value achievable in salinity conditions magnesium and copper are in fact among the mineral elements most frequently lacking in human diets white and broadley 2009 with deficiencies common in both developed and developing countries it is noteworthy that agricultural products are the primary source of all nutrients agricultural systems cannot fail in providing enough products containing adequate quantities of nutrients otherwise dysfunctional food systems would result in not supporting healthy lives welch and graham 2004 to address this issue agronomic approaches to increase the concentrations of mineral elements in agricultural products i e biofortification are of interest lynch 2007 seawater irrigation seems to be a feasible option for the biofortification of crops interestingly species from families within the caryophyllales tend to accumulate very high mg and zn amounts in leaves white and broadley 2009 broadley et al 2004 white 2001 in contrast the increase of na concentration in leaves could represent a severe concern for the healthy characterization of the crop in fact sodium excesses in the human diet are related to cardiovascular disease risk o donnell et al 2015 nevertheless the new zealand spinach is a species requiring cooking before consumption in a recent study on the common spinach caparrotta et al 2019 assessed a significant reduction in the sodium content of leaves after processing by boiling and steaming the total phenolics decrease under saline conditions suggests that tetragonia enhanced the production of other compounds to act as compatible solutes for osmotic adjustment i e proline in accordance to previous studies yousif et al 2010a proline is known to have a positive effect on enzyme and membrane integrity and to show adaptive roles in mediating osmotic adjustment in plants exposed to abiotic stress ashraf and foolad 2007 interestingly proline plays an essential role in protein synthesis and structure metabolism and nutrition therefore physiological needs for proline are particularly high during animal and human life cycles wu et al 2011 likewise the decrease in nitrates in seawater treated plants represents another important achievement from a nutritional standpoint our results are in line with a study on another halophyte portulaca oleracea l that showed a decrease of nitrate levels accordingly to salinity franco et al 2011 some authors relate this reduction to an increase in chloride concentrations within the plant roussos et al 2007 however this aspect needs further investigation on the tested crop 4 5 salt removal potential and prospective of tetragonia crop in saline agriculture although a complete and holistic approach on plant and associated rhizosphere microorganisms impacts in the salt affected soil system or liquid nutritive solution is not fully explored in the literature the main mechanisms are well established jesus et al 2015 in particular there are two main mechanisms to explain the role of halophyte plants in the remediation of salt affected soils the first one is ph reduction which increases the dissolution of caco3 and therefore the available ca2 for cation exchange with na walker et al 2014 the second mechanism is plant uptake of dissolved salts in general sodium in particular rabhi et al 2015 our results confirmed this latter strategy in accordance with previous studies assessing this species as the best salt removing crop among many others neves et al 2008 although none of the tested salt concentrations has resulted in biomass loss focusing on the concerns raised on water use and the nutritional value of the edible parts the best salinity conditions for the tetragonia seem to be between the 15 and 30 seawater concentrations the already appreciated taste of saline agriculture vegetables in different countries rozema and schat 2013 and of the new zealand spinach in particular also encourage such a possibility according to our results only the na concentration in the edible leaves could constitute a concern for the healthy characterization of the crop yet the cooking processes can help in remarkably reducing its content 5 conclusions this species ability to achieve remarkable growth rates under saline conditions validates its potential in saline environments the results of this study show that the production of the new zealand spinach as a food can be obtained in hydroponic conditions characterized by salinity as high as 18 ds m 1 plant water use dropped in saline conditions yet thanks to an increased wue the biomass production was not negatively affected again validating the seawater irrigation of this species up to the tested ec seawater introduction in the hydroponics solutions also led to the enhancement of nutritional value such characteristics along with the increased leaf succulence provide the edible leaves with a taste and consistency that could be particularly appreciated by consumers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10543,quinoa is a very versatile crop amenable to the hot agronomical conditions of the middle east where it is cultivated under irrigation frequently using saline water this study aims to compare different approaches for early detection of the effect of salinity on the agronomic performance of this crop a set of 20 genotypes was grown under drip irrigation in sandy soil at the international center for biosaline agriculture uae the crop was established using fresh water 0 3 ds m 1 for two weeks after which half of the trial was submitted to irrigation with saline water 15 ds m 1 and this was continued until crop maturity after eight weeks of applying each specific irrigation pigment contents were evaluated in fully expanded leaves the same leaves were then harvested dried and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions δ13c and δ15n and the total nitrogen and carbon content of the dry matter analyzed together with the total content of k na mg2 and ca2 ions genotypic and treatment effects existed for yield and biomass as well as for the analytical traits above the best traits in terms of correlation with biomass and yield within each irrigation regime were the mg2 and k contents and the δ15n a stepwise model using different traits mainly mg2 k and δ15n explained 33 1 of the variability in biomass and 56 0 in seed yield under saline irrigation 52 4 and 34 9 under fresh water and 42 4 and 38 6 under the combination of both irrigation regimes respectively regardless of irrigation conditions the results also showed that manure application causes salinity that is associated with high magnesium content the combined analysis of ion concentrations and δ15n allows early evaluation of the effect of irrigation salinity and identification of the best performing genotypes under each irrigation condition keywords irrigation isotopic composition leaf pigments manuring mineral content quinoa seed yield 1 introduction the arid mediterranean region and the middle east are predicted to suffer from increasingly severe droughts and temperatures in the future as a direct consequence of climate change in addition to increased problems of salinity jacobsen et al 2012 thus growing competition for freshwater resources among different socioeconomic sectors is challenging arab agriculture araus 2004 while climate change predictions for the region ipcc 2014 will make the application of irrigation even more critical in the future in that context the use of salt tolerant crop species is being considered as a strategy to sustain agricultural production under irrigation with saline water the facultative halophytic plant quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd is not only adapted to soil salinity but is also tolerant to conditions where high temperature and salinity occur in combination regarding the semiarid and arid middle east and north africa mena and even parts of central asia soil and water salinity is increasingly becoming a constraint on agricultural production and quinoa is seen as an alternative crop with significant potential for sustaining farm productivity choukr allah et al 2016 bazile et al 2016 particularly under irrigation rao and shahid 2012 geert et al 2008 geert and raes 2009 hirich et al 2013 eisa et al 2017 the large genetic variability of quinoa is considered an immense resource for selecting and breeding for improved stress tolerance during growth in different climatic zones christiansen et al 2010 bendevis et al 2014a 2014b jacobsen 2014 zurita silva et al 2014 specifically there is a large genetic variability in quinoa related to salinity tolerance bazile et al 2016 therefore developing approaches for early monitoring of irrigation salinity effects may be doubly useful in crop management for assessing potential negative effects of irrigation with saline water while predicting yield in phenotyping as a quick selection trait to select the best adapted genotypes well in advance of maturity the key traits associated with the capacity of quinoa to cope with salt stress seem to comprise an efficient control of na sequestration in leaf vacuoles xylem na loading better k retention higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and efficient control over stomatal development and aperture adolf et al 2013 genotypic differences in salinity tolerance in quinoa have been reported as being subject to differential control of xylem na loading shabala et al 2013 although these results were achieved in a greenhouse in fact salinity has been shown to induce a significant increase in sodium na and chloride cl while it reduced magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 in stems leaves seed coats and seeds maleki et al 2018 in that context plant ion analysis is a widely known approach to assess the performance of crops including quinoa under salinity conditions hariadi et al 2011 eisa et al 2012 2017 in fact the accumulation of inorganic ions is considered as the main contributor of osmotic adjustment hariadi et al 2011 orsini et al 2011 eisa et al 2012 however to date the pattern of ion accumulation i e as an indicator of genotypic performance for phenotyping of salinity tolerance has had much less attention particularly for field grown plants for example different authors e g adolf et al 2012 shabala et al 2013 have reported analysis of pot plants and leaf sap na rather than total the concentration of these ions in the dry matter of field plants in fact analyzing k and na concentrations in the leaf sap requires specific sampling and is more time consuming than just collecting leaves or other plant parts and then drying them analysis of the stable isotope composition of carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n has been proposed as an approach to assess the genotypic variability of quinoa to drought gonzález et al 2011 this is based on the fact that one of the first stress symptoms associated with salinity is an osmotically mediated water stress effect in that sense the effect of water stress on stomatal conductance see razzaghi et al 2011 for quinoa and salinity and subsequently on the ratio of the intercellular versus atmospheric concentrations of co2 will be translated into an increase in δ13c or a decrease in the carbon isotope discrimination from the surrounding air expressed as δ13c farquhar et al 1989 thus under drought conditions δ13c was positively correlated across genotypes with the seed yield in quinoa indicating that cultivars that maintained higher levels of photosynthesis and conductance were more productive gonzález et al 2011 the same trend has been shown for plant growth across durum wheat genotypes submitted to salinity yousfi et al 2009 more recently the effect of salinity on the δ13c of quinoa leaves has been evaluated in a set of six different accessions hussain et al 2018 like drought stress salinity also increased δ13c but genotypic variability for δ13c under salinity was not found concerning δ15n the available literature is diverse although obtained from crops other than quinoa but in general terms it concludes that a decrease in δ15n occurs as a consequence of water stress raimanová and haberle 2010 araus et al 2013 and the same occurs for salinity yousfi et al 2009 2012 2013 such trends can be explained for example by a reduced stomatal conductance through a reduction in the loss of ammonia and nitrous oxide which reduces 15n enrichment farquhar et al 1980 yousfi et al 2012 however the only study available for quinoa reports that salinity increases δ15n and that genetic variability for this signature exists hussain et al 2018 however no significant relationships across genotypes within growing conditions were reported between δ13c and δ15n against yield biomass or any other agronomic component hussain et al 2018 therefore the suitability of the stable carbon and nitrogen signatures as indicators of growing conditions in quinoa has been not fully proven particularly with regard to δ15n however the usefulness of δ13c and δ15n as phenotyping traits remains to be elucidated leaf chlorophyll content may provide valuable information about the physiological status of plants because it is directly linked to photosynthetic potential and the effect of nutrient status filella et al 1995 and stresses such as salinity sudhir and murthy 2004 adolf et al 2012 eisa et al 2012 on primary production in fact nondestructive evaluation of chlorophyll content has been proposed as a way to phenotype quinoa genotypes gonzález et al 2011 riccardi et al 2014 however studies in crop species other than quinoa have not proved whether leaf chlorophyll content is a proper indicator of primary productivity particularly when used as a phenotyping approach yousfi et al 2009 2010 in the case of quinoa there are no reports in the literature on the use of chlorophyll as a phenotyping trait for salinity tolerance anthocyanins and flavonoids are reported to have protective functions in response to the oxidative stresses caused by very diverse abiotic constraints bahler et al 1991 chalker scott 1999 winkel shirley 2001 ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 anthocyanins have been demonstrated to increase in response to salt stress parida and das 2005 and the response appears to be positively associated with the level of tolerance to this stress parvaiz and satyavati 2008 daneshmand et al 2010 flavonoids also seem to increase in response to salt stress ali and abbas 2003 in the case of quinoa it was observed that irrigation with 25 of full water restitution with and without the addition of salt was associated with increases in free phenolic compounds gómez caravaca et al 2012 concerning salinity rutin which is a flavonoid with antioxidant activity improves plant salinity tolerance by regulating k retention and na exclusion from leaf mesophyll in quinoa and there are known genotypic differences for this trait ismail et al 2016 in the sandy soils typical of the desert areas of the arabian peninsula and the mena region organic matter is very scarce which necessitates the use of organic amendments usually consisting of animal compost manure a 40 mg ha 1 quantity of manure is the recommended dose rao and shahid 2012 choukr allah et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 in the uae while manure is an additional source of salinity that may affect cultivation its use continues because it promotes the soil s capacity to retain water and nutrients and it also represents an important source of nitrogen indeed hirich et al 2014 concluded that amendment of quinoa crops with organic compost was more favorable for improving yield and biomass production under deficit irrigation than under full irrigation ramzani et al 2017 also concluded that organic compost improved yield biomass leaf photosynthesis and transpiration rates and chlorophyll content of quinoa exposed to salinity however the reports on the positive effect of organic compost on salinity refer to situations where compost has been formulated mainly using plant residues ahmad et al 2006 hirich et al 2014 rather than manure the purpose of this study was to compare different approaches for an early i e before harvest assessment of yield and biomass of irrigated quinoa growing on sandy desert soils this work addresses the potential of using such approaches for crop management to assess the effect of irrigation under different levels of salinity and during phenotyping for selecting the best genotypes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions the experiment was carried out at the field facilities of the international center for biosaline agriculture icba dubai the united arab emirates 25 05 49 n and 55 23 25 e the soils at icba experimental fields are sandy in texture that is fine sand sand 98 silt 1 and clay 1 calcareous 50 60 caco3 equivalents porous 45 porosity and moderately alkaline ph 8 22 with very low organic matter 0 5 the saturation percentage of the soil was 26 with very high drainage capacity while the electrical conductivity of its saturated extract ece was 1 2 ds m 1 according to american soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2010 the soil is classified as typic torripsamments carbonatic and hyperthermic shahid et al 2009 a set of 20 accessions of quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd were tested icba q1 icba q2 icba q3 icba q4 icba q5 giza 1 giza 2 nsl 86649 ames 13749 ames 13757 ames 22155 inia 415 pasankalla salcedo inia amarilla marangani amarilla sacaca kancolla puno ticota titicaca co 407 and ru 5 the first five varieties which have been developed at icba are suitable for sandy soils and high temperatures they are also tolerant to salinity the other quinoa cultivars developed in other parts of the world were included in the experiment to assess their performance in the uae and compare them with the locally produced accessions the nsl 86649 ames 13749 ames 13757 and ames 22155 accessions were provided by the usda co 407 is a cultivar developed at the university of columbia ru 5 is a cultivar from the uk inia 415 pasankalla salcedo inia amarilla marangani amarilla sacaca and kancolla are peruvian accessions and the puno ticota and titicaca cultivars were developed in denmark table 1 therefore accessions from different quinoa ecotypes were tested in this study besides some of the accessions being derived from germplasm provided by the usda or being selected in countries like denmark the united kingdom uae or egypt where the ecotype provenance is difficult to determine accessions from at least three different ecotypes were tested these included quinoas from the andean valleys of central and northern peru from the andean high plateau of peru and bolivia and from the coastal lowland areas of central chile gomez and eguiluz 2011 estrada and gonza 2011 bazile et al 2014 moreover the commercial variety ru 5 apparently derives to some extent from the salar i e salt flats ecotype of bolivia and northern chile and argentina before sowing the fertility of the soil was improved by incorporating organic fertilizer cow and chicken manure at the rate of 40 mg ha 1 side fertilization consisted of urea 60 at 30 kg ha 1 applied 4 weeks after sowing and npk 20 20 20 applied at 40 kg ha 1 8 weeks after sowing sowing took place on november 19 2016 the seeds were sown by hand and after planting the field was covered by acryl sheeting to stop birds eating the seed for the following two weeks the trial was drip irrigated with fresh water 1 ds m 1 to avoid hindering germination koyro and eisa 2008 then two different treatments were imposed for the rest of the growing period a irrigation with fresh water and b irrigation with saline water 15 ds m 1 for each treatment the experimental design was a randomized complete block with 3 replicates per genotype plot size was 2 2 m with a plant to plant distance of 25 cm and 50 cm between rows totaling 45 plants per plot 5 9 at the time of flowering the whole experiment field was covered with a net to protect the plants from hares and later from bird damage to the panicles drip irrigation was used for the experiment with drippers at 25 cm distance irrigation occurred twice a day for 5 min each time water release from each dripper was 4 l h 1 per plant the same amount of water was used for both freshwater and saline irrigation in addition about 28 3 mm of accumulated precipitation was received during the growing period data in brief fig 1 during the whole crop season hand weeding was carried out when needed without applying any herbicide maturity was reached during the first half of march 2017 in the third week of march seed yield and plant biomass were assessed by manual harvesting the five plants from the middle row of each plot dry biomass was determined by drying the samples initially under the sun for two days and then in a forced air oven at 80 c for 48 h in addition plant height along with the number of branches and inflorescences per plant and the inflorescence length were measured as detailed elsewhere hussain et al 2018 2 2 leaf pigments leaf pigments were measured using a portable leaf clip sensor dualex dualex force a orsay france which takes non destructive measurements of chlorophyll chl unitless index flavonoid fla unitless index and anthocyanin anth unitless index contents based on the chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra cerovic et al 2012 in addition it calculates the nitrogen balance index nbi which is the ratio of chl flav related to the nitrogen and carbon allocation cerovic et al 2015 the dualex sensor operates with a uv excitation beam at 357 nm which corresponds to the maximum absorption for flavonoids and a red reference beam at 650 nm which corresponds to the maximum absorption for chlorophyll for each plot 10 recently fully expanded i e non senescent leaves were selected from the central rows measurements took place on jan 29 2017 around 8 weeks after the two irrigation treatments were imposed measurements were performed on the adaxial part of the leaves no marked differences in plant phenology were registered with all the genotypes already exhibiting floral panicles 2 3 ion analyses the same leaves that were used to measure the pigment content were washed with tap and distilled water dried in an oven at 60 c for two days and ground to a fine powder from each leaf sample 100 mg of the ground dry material was subsampled and digested with 3 ml of concentrated hno3 and 2 ml of h2o2 then heated overnight at 90 c afterwards 30 ml of pure water was added to each sample and then transferred to analytic tubes the amount of na k p ca2 and mg2 in each sample was determined using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer l3200rl perkin elmer uberlingen germany at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona ion concentrations were expressed in mmol g 1 of dry weight further the same elements were also analyzed in the organic compost and npk fertilizer using the same protocol as above 2 4 stable isotope analyses a second subsample of the dry leaf powder was used for the measurement of the total nitrogen concentration and the stable carbon 13c 12c ratio and nitrogen 15n 14n ratio isotope signatures analyses were performed at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona samples of 1 mg were weighed into tin capsules and analyses were performed using an elemental analyzer flash 1112 ea thermofinnigan schwerte germany coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta c irms thermofinnigan operating in continuous flow mode the 13c 12c ratios r of plant material were expressed in δ notation coplen 2008 as carbon isotope composition δ13c δ 13 c r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 x 1000 where sample refers to plant material and standard to pee dee belemnite pdb calcium carbonate international isotope secondary standards of known 13c 12c ratios iaea ch7 3 polyethylene foil iaea ch6 sucrose usgs 40 l glutamic acid were used with an analytical precision of 0 1 the same δ notation was used for the 15n 14n ratio expression but with the standard referring to n2 in air for nitrogen the international isotope secondary standards iaea n1 iaean2 iaeano3 and usgs40 were used with a precision of 0 3 the soluble fraction of the same samples was analyzed after yousfi et al 2013 50 mg of each ground leaf sample was suspended with 1 ml of milli q water in an eppendorf tube eppendorf scientific hamburg germany for 20 min at about 5 c the sample was then centrifuged at 12 000g for 5 min and at 5 c afterwards the supernatant containing the water soluble fraction was pipetted into a new eppendorf and heated at 100 c for 3 min to denature the proteins samples were centrifuged again 12 000g for 5 min at 5 c and 100 μl of the resulting aliquot was placed in tin capsules and dried at 70 c for 2 h the soluble fraction of carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions was then determined at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona as described in the previous paragraph 2 5 statistical analyses analysis of variance anova was performed using the statistical package spss spss inc to test the effects of the irrigation treatment genotypes and their interaction a bivariate correlation was carried out also using spss software to calculate pearson correlation coefficients between the analytic traits and yield components a multiple linear regression using the stepwise procedure was conducted to extract the significant traits that explain biomass and yield variations across treatments a principal components analysis was deployed using the statistical software r rstudio inc to analyze the data on a bi dimensional plan graphs were created using the sigmaplot program 10 0 spss inc 3 results 3 1 effect of irrigation with saline water and genotype on seed yield biomass and agronomic components irrigation with saline water significantly decreased seed yield biomass plant height fig 1 and all the agronomic yield components studied table 2 saline water reduced seed yield by about 27 and the rest of the traits by less than 20 genotypic variability was also significant table 2 within each irrigation regime fig 1 and data in brief table 1 for seed yield biomass and the other agronomical traits the varieties inia 415 pasankalla 10 and titicaca 18 were not included in the analyses of yield biomass and the other agronomical traits given their poor emergence the accession that produced the highest biomass under irrigation with fresh water was amarilla sacaca number 13 at table 1 followed by amarilla marangani salcedo inia puno ticota and icba q3 12 11 17 and 3 while the accessions with the least biomass were icba q5 ames 22155 giza 2 and ru 5 5 9 16 and 20 under irrigation with saline water the top accession was salcedo inia 11 followed by giza 2 and amarilla sacaca 16 13 while the accessions with the least biomass were co 407 and ru 5 19 20 the cultivar puno ticota 17 was the top genotype in terms of seed yield under fresh water fig 1 while icba q1 icba q2 ames 13749 ames 13757 amarilla maragani amarilla sacaca and co 407 1 2 7 8 12 13 19 achieved somewhat lower yields but the differences were not statistically significant the lowest seed yield was observed in giza 2 2 under saline irrigation top and least seed yielders were clearly nsl 86649xx 6 and amarilla marangani 12 respectively the genotypic effect and its interaction with irrigation conditions were also significant for all these traits table 2 for example while irrigation with saline water in general decreased seed yield and biomass across the set of accessions some accessions produced similar biomass icba q5 ames 22155 and kancolla or even more salcedo inia and giza 2 under saline irrigation compared with fresh water in the case of seed yield some varieties yielded similarly nsl 86649 salcedo inia and kancolla or even more giza under irrigation with saline water 3 2 short term irrigation effect with saline water on ion concentrations pigment contents and stable isotopes after eight weeks of irrigation with saline water the sodium content in the leaf dry matter doubled increased by 2 4 the potassium and phosphorous decreased slightly but significantly about 10 and magnesium increased slightly 10 whereas calcium was unaffected table 3 as a consequence the k na ca2 na and mg2 na ratios decreased by more than half relative to the freshwater treatment the genotypic effect was significant for all the parameters considered in the table the genotype by irrigation interaction was not significant for any of the parameters even when sodium and calcium were close to significance however there were no genotypic differences in na and k across accessions when irrigated with fresh water whereas irrigation with saline water resulted in genotypic differences data in brief table 2 however for other elements such as p and particularly ca2 and mg2 genotypic differences existed within each irrigation treatment ca2 na and mg2 na did not show significant differences across accessions within the fresh water irrigation treatment but differences existed under saline irrigation by contrast the k na ratio showed genotypic differences within the fresh water treatment but not under saline irrigation data in brief table 2 eight weeks of irrigation with saline water slightly ca 10 but significantly increased the per area leaf contents of chlorophyll and flavonoids as well as the nitrogen balance index nbi whereas the anthocyanin content did not change table 4 the genotype effect was significant for all the traits displayed in the table the interaction between genotype and irrigation was significant for all the traits except flavonoids the content of the three pigments as well as the nbi index showed significant differences across genotypes under both irrigation treatments data in brief table 3 the same irrigation period with saline water significantly decreased the nitrogen isotope composition δ15n of the leaves both in terms of total dry matter as well as the soluble fraction table 5 the total carbon and nitrogen contents of the leaf dry matter were also significantly decreased even though it was slight at approx 5 by the application of saline water concerning carbon isotope composition δ13c a small but significant increase in the leaf dry matter was recorded while differences in the δ13c of the soluble fraction did not reach significance the genotype effect was significant for all the traits included in the table except the δ13c of the soluble fraction whereas no significant genotype by irrigation interaction was recorded for any trait however there were no differences across genotypes within each of the irrigation treatments for total carbon and n content as well as the δ13c and δ15n of the dry matter and the soluble fraction data in brief table 4 3 3 relationships between crop performance and different morphophysiological traits in fact under freshwater conditions plant height was positively correlated across the set of genotypes with seed yield 0 677 p 0 01 and biomass 0 402 p 0 05 while under saline irrigation the relationships followed a similar trend as in the fresh water irrigation but they did not reach significance data not shown inflorescence length and branches per plant also followed similar trends in their relationships with biomass and seed yield but significance were not achieved therefore for the set of accessions of different provenance plant growth evaluated in terms of plant height appears as a good genotypic indicator of biomass and yield at least under fresh water irrigation the overall relationships of the two main agronomical traits seed yield and biomass along with the mineral concentrations pigment contents and stable isotopes were analyzed using a principal component analysis pca when the whole set of genotypes and the two growing conditions were considered the first two axes of the pca explained around 45 of the all variability fig 2 seed yield and biomass appeared on the right of the horizontal axis together with the δ15n of the dry matter and the total carbon content while sodium calcium and to a greater degree magnesium were placed on the left side of the horizontal axis with δ13c also being on the left but closer to the vertex the potassium and nitrogen concentrations in dry matter were placed on the right side of the pca but nearly equidistant from both the horizontal and vertical axes and the anthocyanin content was placed in the left side of the pca opposite the nitrogen concentration finally the phosphorous concentration and to a lesser extent the flavonoid content were placed in the upper part of the vertical axis almost directly opposite the chlorophyll content and all of them perpendicular to the seed yield and biomass pearson correlations of the different ion concentrations and their ratios against seed yield total biomass plant height and several agronomical yield components were analyzed table 6 correlations were assessed by combining the two growing conditions the 20 accessions and the three replicates per accession n 120 or within each irrigation condition n 60 interestingly the pattern of correlations was very similar within fresh water compared to the saline irrigated conditions alone or when both growing conditions were combined in general plant height was the best correlated while seed yield biomass and inflorescence length were slightly but consistently less correlated and the numbers of branches and inflorescences per plant were the least correlated traits for each of the growing conditions alone or in combination the parameter with the best correlation was the magnesium concentration followed by the sodium concentration and the k na ratio potassium and calcium as well as the other two ratios correlated less well apart from potassium in all cases all the other ions always correlated negatively while the ratios correlated positively regarding the stable isotopes the trait that best correlated with yield biomass was the δ15n of the dry matter table 7 where it correlated positively in the three scenarios both irrigation regimes combined n 120 and each irrigation regime independently n 60 however δ15n only correlated positively against seed yield and branches per plant when the irrigation regimes were combined the δ13c in the dry matter only correlated against inflorescence length and plant height in the former negative correlations were found within the freshwater trial n 60 as well as when freshwater and saline treatments were combined n 120 in the case of plant height a negative correlation was found only when the growing conditions were combined the only other case where δ13c correlated was with plant height when the two irrigation regimes were combined total carbon content on dry matter basis correlated positively with plant and inflorescence height within each irrigation condition and with biomass and seed yield under fresh water irrigation in addition carbon content correlated positively with all the agronomic traits of the study when plants from both growing conditions were combined table 7 in the case of leaf pigments on an area basis chlorophyll content only correlated negatively with total biomass within the saline irrigation n 60 treatment and positively with seed yield within the freshwater irrigation n 60 treatment table 8 anthocyanin content correlated negatively against plant height and inflorescence length when the treatments were combined n 120 as well as within the saline irrigation treatment where it also correlated against seed yield finally the flavonoid content was only positively correlated against plant height in the freshwater treatment and the nbi index was correlated negatively against total biomass globally all these correlations were weak when the phenotypic correlations were assessed using the accession values instead of the single plot values magnesium content was again the parameter that best correlated with both biomass and seed yield fig 3 moreover the relationships across genotypes in the freshwater treatment were much stronger than within the saline water irrigation but both categories of values showed quite similar patterns multilinear stepwise models using the different set of parameters evaluated were tested against biomass table 9 and seed yield table 10 on an area basis within each trial irrigated with fresh water and with saline water as well as combining plots from both trials for biomass and seed yield traits and the three different scenarios fresh water saline water and the two growing conditions together the first trait chosen by the model was always magnesium content in the case of the biomass magnesium alone explained nearly 40 of biomass variability in the freshwater treatment and nearly 30 when the treatments were combined but only explained around 15 of variability in biomass within the saline water irrigation where chlorophyll content was the second parameter chosen by the model and 26 of variability in seed yield potassium was the only other parameter chosen by the model in the three cases while δ15n was chosen in two cases freshwater and both irrigation regimes anthocyanin only marginally contributed to explaining variability in biomass under freshwater irrigation interestingly sodium content only contributed very marginally to the model when both irrigation treatments were combined concerning seed yield magnesium was the first trait chosen by the model explaining nearly 30 of the variability in seed yield within the freshwater treatment and both growing conditions combined and only around 20 in the saline water treatment the nbi ratio contributed explaining seed yield variability in the freshwater and the saline irrigation while potassium was chosen as an additional trait in two of the scenarios saline water and both irrigation regimes together the nitrogen concentration and the nitrogen content were also included in the model for saline water while calcium was included in the model when the two irrigation treatments were combined 4 discussion 4 1 growth and yield the seed yield and biomass values achieved under irrigation with fresh water are in the same range as reported for the region previously rao and shahid 2012 hirich et al 2014 choukr allah et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 significant decreases not only in dry biomass seed yield and plant height but also in the number of branches number of panicles panicle weight and harvest index in response to irrigation with saline water have also been reported before hussain et al 2018 however in our study the magnitude of the decrease in yield biomass and a number of different agronomic components corresponded to moderate salinity stress the reduction in seed yield was related with a decrease in the number of seeds which indicates that a reduction in the number and size of the inflorescences per plant is the main factor accounting for the yield decrease genotypic variability in seed yield and biomass has been reported before for quinoa plants growing under comparable agroecological conditions hirich et al 2014 choukr allah et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 moreover the significant interaction between genotype and irrigation conditions for seed yield biomass and different agronomical traits highlights not only the genotypic plasticity available in the species but also the need to assess genotypic performance within each growing condition shabala et al 2013 4 2 genotypic provenance with regard to biomass under fresh water irrigation the top accession amarilla sacara together with three of the next four best accessions salcedo inia amarilla marangani puno ticota were of peruvian origin even though they were of different ecotype origins among the poorest performers the two ecotypes that were clearly identified ames 22155 and ru 5 were of chilean origin under saline irrigation the top accession in terms of biomass was peruvian from the andean high plateau provenance of peru salcedo inia while the two lowest producers in terms of biomass were of chilean origin co 407 and ru 5 and also apparently from the two ecotypes existing in the country the varieties from the andean valleys amarilla marangani and amarilla sacaca were the two accessions that exhibited the highest biomass and number of branches per plant under fresh water irrigation and were also placed among the accessions with the greatest seed yield and plant height however their agronomical performance under saline irrigation was less remarkable the combination of greater plant height larger number of branches per plant and longer growth cycle gomez and eguiluz 2011 may be the reason that these two accessions exhibit the greatest biomass among the tested panel however their long growth cycles may result in the seed yield of these accessions being impacted by heat stress during flowering when grown in the conditions of the uae thus concerning seed yield under fresh water irrigation conditions and besides the two accessions from the andean valleys performance was closer to accessions derived from germplasm provided by the usda icba q1 icba q2 ames 13749 and ames 13757 and with peruvian accessions from the andean high plateau puno ticota and the lowland coastal chilean area co 407 which were the best yielders under saline irrigation the best performers were one accession from the usda nsl 86649 followed by the peruvian high plateau cultivar salcedo inia while the peruvian cultivar amarilla marangani from the andean valleys had the lowest yields nevertheless apart from the commercial variety titicaca which exhibited poor crop establishment in general this study supports the good agronomical performance of germplasm from the peruvian high plateau in terms of seed yield regarding the two ecotypes grown in chile there are recognized differences related to salinity altitude adaptation tolerance to drought and sensitivity to photoperiod fuentes et al 2009 quinoas ascribed to the salar ecotype are traditionally cultivated in conditions of saline soils and rainfall that varies between 100 and 200 mm per year fuentes et al 2009 however while the ecotype provenance of accessions from the salar may justify their inclusion in a testing panel targeted towards desert areas exposed to salinity these accessions have been reported to yield poorly when grown at similar latitude under lowland desert conditions probably due to the negative effects of the high temperature stress around flowering fuentes and bhargava 2011 in our study ru 5 which is the only accession that potentially integrates germplasm from the salar had similar or lower yields than accessions derived predominantly from lowland chilean genotypes icba q4 icba q5 ames 22155 and co 407 in general terms and regardless of the irrigation conditions the taller genotypes were associated with higher biomass and seed yield inflorescence length and branches per plant were also correlated with biomass and seed yield but the relationships were not as strong plant height together with inflorescence length has been recognized as a good genotypic indicator of the yield performance of quinoa under saline conditions gómez pando et al 2010 and drought spehar and santos 2005 nevertheless within the panel of accessions tested the differences in plant height between the ecotypes were not so evident thus even though the accession that exhibited the greatest plant height under fresh irrigation was from the andean valleys of peru amarilla sacaca under saline irrigation the greatest height was achieved by icba q4 which is of chilean provenance the other three categories of ecotypes namely the peruvian high plateau the bolivian and chilean salar and the chilean coastal lowlands are broadly characterized by comparable plant heights and inflorescence structures gomez and eguiluz 2011 4 3 stable isotope signature and nitrogen and carbon content irrigation regime had a significant effect on the carbon isotope composition δ13c thus irrigating with saline water increased the δ13c of the leaf dry matter compared with control plants this kind of response to salinity has been ascribed to an osmotic effect similar to that of water stress closing stomata munns and tester 2008 indeed an increase in δ13c following irrigation with saline water has been recently reported in quinoa hussain et al 2018 and was associated with a decrease in the intercellular versus atmospheric co2 ratio however in our study the actual values of δ13c were more negative and the increase in the δ13c of the leaf dry matter in response to salinity was much smaller than the values reported in the leaves of mature plants i e at the end of the crop cycle by hussain et al 2018 this was despite the fact that the growing conditions of the control and saline irrigated plants were comparable to those of our study while the samples we analyzed i e fully expanded leaves in the current work were grown for several weeks under different irrigation conditions leaves at harvest integrate the growing conditions of the entire crop cycle and this may explain the observational differences between the two studies genotypic variability in δ13c has been reported before for quinoa seeds under well watered and water stressed conditions gonzález et al 2011 however the only previous study analyzing δ13c in quinoa under saline conditions failed to identify genotypic variability hussain et al 2018 interestingly in our study genotypic differences were found only for the δ13c of the dry matter while in the δ13c of the soluble fraction no genotypic variability was observed these results suggest that genotypic variability for δ13c is evidenced under mild to moderate saline conditions caused by a relatively short exposure to salinity irrigation conditions significantly affected the nitrogen isotope composition δ15n and the total nitrogen content of the leaves thus salinity decreased δ15n and slightly but significantly decreased the total nitrogen content while genotypic variability for both traits was found genotypic variability for δ15n and total nitrogen content has been reported recently for quinoa under saline conditions hussain et al 2018 but contrary to our results both δ15n and nitrogen content increased in response to salinity it has been reported for different species that salinity besides inducing stomatal closure and therefore increasing δ13c affects processes related to n uptake assimilation release and internal recycling consequently decreasing plant δ15n and nitrogen content cernusak et al 2009 yousfi et al 2009 2012 2013 and explaining genotypic variability in the response to salinity gonzález et al 2011 working on quinoa under water stress conditions reported a negative correlation between δ13c and seed yield but there were no significant correlations for δ15n the negative correlation of δ13c with growth traits indicated that the plants maintained higher photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance and had stronger growth and yield gonzález et al 2011 in our study δ13c correlated negatively with inflorescence length under freshwater irrigation and with plant height when combining both irrigation regimes but there was no correlation with biomass or seed yield and no correlation at all was found under saline irrigation however δ15n correlated positively with plant biomass within each of the two irrigation treatments indeed positive correlations between δ15n and biomass across genotypes have been reported in durum wheat under control and saline conditions yousfi et al 2009 2012 in the study of hussain et al 2018 as a consequence of the effect of salinity increasing δ15n a negative correlation of δ15n with seed yield and plant biomass was reported when all growing conditions were combined however no correlations across genotypes within a given salinity level were established concerning the positive relationships of total carbon content and the agronomical traits morpho anatomical adaptations of quinoa to salinity include the development of thick epidermis and sclerenchyma tissues prado et al 2017 therefore salinity stress reduces plant growth while enhancing the production of sclerenchyma tissues this may decrease the relative content of carbon in the dry matter because the presence of more oxygen atoms in the molecules by contrast lack of stress and or plants having a constitutive higher relative content of cellulose are characterized by higher growth and eventually biomass while the relative carbon content increases 4 4 leaf pigments concerning leaf pigments both the chlorophyll and flavonoid contents on an area basis were significantly affected by irrigation conditions while genotypic differences were found for the different pigments analyzed including anthocyanins however both chlorophyll and flavonoids increased in response to salinity in addition the nitrogen balance index nbi which is the ratio between the chlorophyll and epidermal flavonoids also increased and this suggested a higher n content under saline conditions cerovic et al 2015 however the increase in total chlorophyll and even in nbi may be related to an effect of salinity inducing thicker more compact leaves which in fact may be considered a negative response to stress increases or no changes in chlorophyll content on an area basis as measured with a portable device have been reported before during saline treatments e g yousfi et al 2009 2010 in fact eisa et al 2012 have reported in quinoa that salinity strongly increases the leaf mass to area ratio the so called leaf specific mass which may counteract to a large extent the negative effect of salinity decreasing chlorophyll concentration e g inducing senescence when measuring the pigment content on an area basis as is the case with portable leaf meters in our study chlorophyll was only positively albeit weakly correlated with seed yield in the freshwater treatment moreover it correlated negatively with biomass within the saline water treatment meaning that the plants exhibiting higher chlorophyll content on an area basis were those growing the least therefore leaf pigment content assessed via portable devices is not an appropriate way to phenotype salinity tolerance and even their suitability for crop monitoring remains skeptical a similar lack of a relationship between chlorophyll content and biomass has been reported before in other crops yousfi et al 2009 2010 the main reason is the fact that portable chlorophyll leaf meters work as spectroradiometers by detecting the visible and near infrared radiation transmitted through the leaf and therefore the values of the vegetation index derived depend on the leaf thickness and or density in the case of flavonoids their increase which was greater than the changes in leaf anatomy might have suggested limited to some increases in epidermal cell thickness may be the consequence of adaptive responses to abiotic stresses such as drought heat or salinity moreover in addition to their role in filtering uv light to prevent photooxidative stress flavonoids improve salinity tolerance in quinoa by regulating k retention and na exclusion from leaf mesophyll ismail et al 2016 however in our study flavonoid content was not correlated with seed yield biomass or any of the other agronomic growth traits except for plant height under well irrigated conditions the total content of anthocyanins did not change under irrigation with saline water and this may be associated with plant tolerance to salinity daneshmand et al 2010 even though anthocyanin accumulation has been widely accepted as a response to stress eryılmaz 2006 in support of the lack of change in their concentration anthocyanins were negatively correlated with seed yield plant height and inflorescence length in the saline irrigation treatment but not in the freshwater treatment however a methodological drawback of measuring plant polyphenolics such as flavonoids and anthocyanins in intact leaves with the portable meter is the indirect nature of the approach whereby the measurement uses uv absorbance of the leaf epidermis via double excitation of chlorophyll fluorescence goulas et al 2004 4 5 mineral content irrigation regime and genotype effects significantly affected the leaf mineral content on a dry matter basis genotypic variability in the mineral content of quinoa leaves has been reported before bhargava et al 2008 the 2 4 times increase in na concentration following irrigation with saline water relative to fresh water may be considered moderate in comparison to previous reports in quinoa orsini et al 2011 eisa et al 2012 razzaghi et al 2015 and other herbaceous plant species such as wheat yousfi et al 2009 2010 wang et al 2018 exposed to similar salinity levels and with similar growing period duration however most of these and other studies have reported on controlled conditions and hydroponics or if grown in the field the salinity was soil based rather than irrigation based or the soil was not sandy in fact the sandy soil conditions present during our study prevented rapid increases in salinity from saline water irrigation shahid et al 2009 el sebai et al 2016 compared to other plant species the k concentration decreased only slightly in response to irrigation with saline water which agrees with results on the importance of inorganic ions for osmotic adjustment in quinoa and the ability of quinoa to maintain k levels under highly saline conditions orsini et al 2011 razzaghi et al 2015 reported in field grown quinoa that salinity imposed from flowering increased not only the na but also the k uptake by shoots in the same sense under controlled conditions increased k concentration in the leaf sap has been reported shabala et al 2013 however as in our results a large decrease in the k na ratio in response to increasing salinity has been reported in quinoa previously eisa et al 2012 genotypic tolerance to salinity has been reported to be associated with a lower xylem na content while under freshwater irrigation conditions a positive correlation was shown to exist between salinity tolerance and the plant s ability to accumulate na in the shoot shabala et al 2013 in agreement with the first part of the above statement we found a negative correlation between na concentration in leaf dry matter and biomass within the saline irrigation trial as well as across both irrigation conditions however under freshwater irrigation the correlations between leaf na concentration and biomass were also negative but stronger than under saline irrigation conditions and na concentration which also correlated negatively with seed yield which was not the case for the saline irrigated trial these results suggest that plants in the freshwater treatment were experiencing some degree of salinity regardless of the irrigation conditions moreover the δ13c of the soluble fraction of the leaves which reflects the recently produced photosynthates cabrera bosquet et al 2011 yousfi et al 2013 was not significantly different between freshwater and saline irrigation conditions which suggests that both irrigation regimes were associated with comparable photosynthetic gas exchange conditions moreover no interaction occurred between growing conditions and genotype for either δ13c or δ15n which supports the moderate differences in growing conditions between control and saline irrigation in our study the concentration of other ions accumulated in the leaves gave some insights about how salinity manifests inside the plant in fact both the mg2 and ca2 concentrations in quinoa leaves were higher than those reported in leaves and shoots of other plants species irrigated with fresh water or stressed by irrigation with saline by nacl water lutts et al 1996 lavon et al 1999 yousfi et al 2009 it is widely reported that quinoa has a high content of calcium and magnesium in the seeds vega gálvez et al 2010 which also corresponds to a relatively high content of mg2 and ca2 in leaves orsini et al 2011 riccardi et al 2014 and these ions alongside potassium may play a role in the osmotic function of the vacuole it has been reported for quinoa that nacl application influences the accumulation of bivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 but at nacl doses well above those tested in our study orsini et al 2011 moreover ca2 has a positive function in salt tolerance reducing the toxic effects of nacl while magnesium also seems to have a positive role because it is a constituent of chlorophyll and atp as well as a cofactor for many enzymes shabala et al 2006 orsini et al 2011 thus orsini et al 2011 reported that mg2 levels changed only slightly from control through a wide range of salinities that clearly exceeded the growing conditions of our study 150 750 mm nacl however the mg2 levels and even more significantly the ca2 levels of leaves grown with fresh water were higher than those reported in quinoa previously orsini 2011 moreover and in contrast with k and na genotypic differences existed for both mg2 and ca2 levels not only under saline irrigation but also under fresh water conditions data in brief table 2 while the ion content of the fresh water and even the saline water used for irrigation table 11 does not explain the high levels of these ions in the leaf dry matter other sources need to be considered in fact both the mg2 and ca2 content in the dry leaf matter correlated negatively and better than na with biomass and seed yield and not only under saline irrigation but also under irrigation with fresh water moreover inia 415 pasankalla and titicaca the two cultivars that performed very poorly also accumulated the highest mg2 levels under fresh water irrigation on the other hand k correlated positively with biomass under both saline and fresh water in fact the pca analysis clearly placed mg2 and ca2 a greater distance than na on the same axis alongside δ13c but opposite to seed yield and biomass moreover mg2 was the first trait chosen in all the stepwise models predicting biomass and seed yield these results further support the occurrence of salinity even under irrigation with fresh water with the mg2 and ca2 having a major role in inducing such stress the main source of the mg2 and the ca2 as well as an additional source of na was the manure table 11 4 6 manure application quinoa is known to grow on poor soils although the yield is compromised adding composted organic matter together with irrigation is particularly recommended for growing quinoa in arid zone soils martínez et al 2009 incorporation of green manure from legumes llama and sheep manures has been proposed as a way to increase or maintain soil fertility and preserving soil humidity during quinoa cultivation jacobsen 2011 2012 indeed hirich et al 2014 have reported a positive effect following organic amendment of quinoa however the amount of organic compost in their study was 10 mg ha 1 a quarter of the amount used in the present experiment and was of plant rather than animal origins although the amount of organic material used was four times greater in our study the organic content of the soil was 0 5 which is very low compared to the 1 6 organic matter in the moderately rich soil studied by hirich et al 2014 compost may also ameliorate the adverse effects of salinity in quinoa as suggested from a study under pot conditions el sebai et al 2016 however this study used compost made from crop wheat residues due to the huge amount 40 mg ha 1 of manure applied in our study it can be assumed that this was the main source of nitrogen available to the plants probably exceeding by an order of magnitude i e more than 10 times higher the 26 kg ha 1 of nitrogen provided in the form of npk the very high values for δ15n beyond 10 in the leaf dry matter in our study clearly indicate manure as the main source for the nitrogen used by the crop serret et al 2008 it is well known that urea and other chemical nitrogen fertilizers are characterized by δ15n values close to zero while manure exhibits δ15n values surpassing 10 therefore heavy applications of manure or compost from animal provenance may add to the negative effects of salinity on plant yield in the case of irrigation with saline water or be the primary cause of salinity when irrigation occurs with fresh water in our study the animal manure which was characterized by high ion content particularly mg2 ca2 and na seems to have been the main cause of salinization the inherent characteristic of quinoa accumulating ions for osmotic adjustment may also have contributed to the high concentration of ions present in the crop in this study 4 7 concluding remarks irrigation with saline water significantly decreased growth and yield compared to control conditions with genotypic variability existing for most of these traits besides the water used for irrigation salinity caused by the high amount of manure applied negatively affected growth and productivity regardless of the irrigation regime all the different diagnostic approaches assayed pigment content stable isotope signatures and mineral content in leaves from plants grown for 8 weeks were able to separate between irrigation treatments and even to exhibit genotypic differences however their performance in terms of predicting seed yield and final biomass and other growth characteristics under a given irrigation regime was very variable whereas pigment content on a leaf area basis as measured with a portable device mostly failed to correlate with yield and growth characteristics stable isotope signature particularly δ15n performed better in terms of correlation with biomass nevertheless only mineral content in leaves showed a consistent relationship with crop growth and seed yield and moreover enabled identification of unexpected sources of salinity thus the content of individual ions specifically mg2 ca2 and na and their ratios including k na were the traits best correlated with seed yield and biomass not only within growing conditions which may be useful for phenotyping but also across growing conditions which also makes these traits amenable for crop management the only other trait showing correlation across and within growing conditions was δ15n moreover in spite of the fact that mg2 was the first variable chosen in the multilinear stepwise model predicting biomass and seed yield different pigment content traits and δ15n contributed to improving the strength of the models therefore the analysis of ion concentration in dry matter alone or combined with other traits allows an early evaluation of the contribution of irrigation and manuring towards saline stress and to identify the best performing genotypes within each of the irrigation conditions declaration of competing interest i declare there are not conflict

10543,quinoa is a very versatile crop amenable to the hot agronomical conditions of the middle east where it is cultivated under irrigation frequently using saline water this study aims to compare different approaches for early detection of the effect of salinity on the agronomic performance of this crop a set of 20 genotypes was grown under drip irrigation in sandy soil at the international center for biosaline agriculture uae the crop was established using fresh water 0 3 ds m 1 for two weeks after which half of the trial was submitted to irrigation with saline water 15 ds m 1 and this was continued until crop maturity after eight weeks of applying each specific irrigation pigment contents were evaluated in fully expanded leaves the same leaves were then harvested dried and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions δ13c and δ15n and the total nitrogen and carbon content of the dry matter analyzed together with the total content of k na mg2 and ca2 ions genotypic and treatment effects existed for yield and biomass as well as for the analytical traits above the best traits in terms of correlation with biomass and yield within each irrigation regime were the mg2 and k contents and the δ15n a stepwise model using different traits mainly mg2 k and δ15n explained 33 1 of the variability in biomass and 56 0 in seed yield under saline irrigation 52 4 and 34 9 under fresh water and 42 4 and 38 6 under the combination of both irrigation regimes respectively regardless of irrigation conditions the results also showed that manure application causes salinity that is associated with high magnesium content the combined analysis of ion concentrations and δ15n allows early evaluation of the effect of irrigation salinity and identification of the best performing genotypes under each irrigation condition keywords irrigation isotopic composition leaf pigments manuring mineral content quinoa seed yield 1 introduction the arid mediterranean region and the middle east are predicted to suffer from increasingly severe droughts and temperatures in the future as a direct consequence of climate change in addition to increased problems of salinity jacobsen et al 2012 thus growing competition for freshwater resources among different socioeconomic sectors is challenging arab agriculture araus 2004 while climate change predictions for the region ipcc 2014 will make the application of irrigation even more critical in the future in that context the use of salt tolerant crop species is being considered as a strategy to sustain agricultural production under irrigation with saline water the facultative halophytic plant quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd is not only adapted to soil salinity but is also tolerant to conditions where high temperature and salinity occur in combination regarding the semiarid and arid middle east and north africa mena and even parts of central asia soil and water salinity is increasingly becoming a constraint on agricultural production and quinoa is seen as an alternative crop with significant potential for sustaining farm productivity choukr allah et al 2016 bazile et al 2016 particularly under irrigation rao and shahid 2012 geert et al 2008 geert and raes 2009 hirich et al 2013 eisa et al 2017 the large genetic variability of quinoa is considered an immense resource for selecting and breeding for improved stress tolerance during growth in different climatic zones christiansen et al 2010 bendevis et al 2014a 2014b jacobsen 2014 zurita silva et al 2014 specifically there is a large genetic variability in quinoa related to salinity tolerance bazile et al 2016 therefore developing approaches for early monitoring of irrigation salinity effects may be doubly useful in crop management for assessing potential negative effects of irrigation with saline water while predicting yield in phenotyping as a quick selection trait to select the best adapted genotypes well in advance of maturity the key traits associated with the capacity of quinoa to cope with salt stress seem to comprise an efficient control of na sequestration in leaf vacuoles xylem na loading better k retention higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and efficient control over stomatal development and aperture adolf et al 2013 genotypic differences in salinity tolerance in quinoa have been reported as being subject to differential control of xylem na loading shabala et al 2013 although these results were achieved in a greenhouse in fact salinity has been shown to induce a significant increase in sodium na and chloride cl while it reduced magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 in stems leaves seed coats and seeds maleki et al 2018 in that context plant ion analysis is a widely known approach to assess the performance of crops including quinoa under salinity conditions hariadi et al 2011 eisa et al 2012 2017 in fact the accumulation of inorganic ions is considered as the main contributor of osmotic adjustment hariadi et al 2011 orsini et al 2011 eisa et al 2012 however to date the pattern of ion accumulation i e as an indicator of genotypic performance for phenotyping of salinity tolerance has had much less attention particularly for field grown plants for example different authors e g adolf et al 2012 shabala et al 2013 have reported analysis of pot plants and leaf sap na rather than total the concentration of these ions in the dry matter of field plants in fact analyzing k and na concentrations in the leaf sap requires specific sampling and is more time consuming than just collecting leaves or other plant parts and then drying them analysis of the stable isotope composition of carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n has been proposed as an approach to assess the genotypic variability of quinoa to drought gonzález et al 2011 this is based on the fact that one of the first stress symptoms associated with salinity is an osmotically mediated water stress effect in that sense the effect of water stress on stomatal conductance see razzaghi et al 2011 for quinoa and salinity and subsequently on the ratio of the intercellular versus atmospheric concentrations of co2 will be translated into an increase in δ13c or a decrease in the carbon isotope discrimination from the surrounding air expressed as δ13c farquhar et al 1989 thus under drought conditions δ13c was positively correlated across genotypes with the seed yield in quinoa indicating that cultivars that maintained higher levels of photosynthesis and conductance were more productive gonzález et al 2011 the same trend has been shown for plant growth across durum wheat genotypes submitted to salinity yousfi et al 2009 more recently the effect of salinity on the δ13c of quinoa leaves has been evaluated in a set of six different accessions hussain et al 2018 like drought stress salinity also increased δ13c but genotypic variability for δ13c under salinity was not found concerning δ15n the available literature is diverse although obtained from crops other than quinoa but in general terms it concludes that a decrease in δ15n occurs as a consequence of water stress raimanová and haberle 2010 araus et al 2013 and the same occurs for salinity yousfi et al 2009 2012 2013 such trends can be explained for example by a reduced stomatal conductance through a reduction in the loss of ammonia and nitrous oxide which reduces 15n enrichment farquhar et al 1980 yousfi et al 2012 however the only study available for quinoa reports that salinity increases δ15n and that genetic variability for this signature exists hussain et al 2018 however no significant relationships across genotypes within growing conditions were reported between δ13c and δ15n against yield biomass or any other agronomic component hussain et al 2018 therefore the suitability of the stable carbon and nitrogen signatures as indicators of growing conditions in quinoa has been not fully proven particularly with regard to δ15n however the usefulness of δ13c and δ15n as phenotyping traits remains to be elucidated leaf chlorophyll content may provide valuable information about the physiological status of plants because it is directly linked to photosynthetic potential and the effect of nutrient status filella et al 1995 and stresses such as salinity sudhir and murthy 2004 adolf et al 2012 eisa et al 2012 on primary production in fact nondestructive evaluation of chlorophyll content has been proposed as a way to phenotype quinoa genotypes gonzález et al 2011 riccardi et al 2014 however studies in crop species other than quinoa have not proved whether leaf chlorophyll content is a proper indicator of primary productivity particularly when used as a phenotyping approach yousfi et al 2009 2010 in the case of quinoa there are no reports in the literature on the use of chlorophyll as a phenotyping trait for salinity tolerance anthocyanins and flavonoids are reported to have protective functions in response to the oxidative stresses caused by very diverse abiotic constraints bahler et al 1991 chalker scott 1999 winkel shirley 2001 ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 anthocyanins have been demonstrated to increase in response to salt stress parida and das 2005 and the response appears to be positively associated with the level of tolerance to this stress parvaiz and satyavati 2008 daneshmand et al 2010 flavonoids also seem to increase in response to salt stress ali and abbas 2003 in the case of quinoa it was observed that irrigation with 25 of full water restitution with and without the addition of salt was associated with increases in free phenolic compounds gómez caravaca et al 2012 concerning salinity rutin which is a flavonoid with antioxidant activity improves plant salinity tolerance by regulating k retention and na exclusion from leaf mesophyll in quinoa and there are known genotypic differences for this trait ismail et al 2016 in the sandy soils typical of the desert areas of the arabian peninsula and the mena region organic matter is very scarce which necessitates the use of organic amendments usually consisting of animal compost manure a 40 mg ha 1 quantity of manure is the recommended dose rao and shahid 2012 choukr allah et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 in the uae while manure is an additional source of salinity that may affect cultivation its use continues because it promotes the soil s capacity to retain water and nutrients and it also represents an important source of nitrogen indeed hirich et al 2014 concluded that amendment of quinoa crops with organic compost was more favorable for improving yield and biomass production under deficit irrigation than under full irrigation ramzani et al 2017 also concluded that organic compost improved yield biomass leaf photosynthesis and transpiration rates and chlorophyll content of quinoa exposed to salinity however the reports on the positive effect of organic compost on salinity refer to situations where compost has been formulated mainly using plant residues ahmad et al 2006 hirich et al 2014 rather than manure the purpose of this study was to compare different approaches for an early i e before harvest assessment of yield and biomass of irrigated quinoa growing on sandy desert soils this work addresses the potential of using such approaches for crop management to assess the effect of irrigation under different levels of salinity and during phenotyping for selecting the best genotypes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions the experiment was carried out at the field facilities of the international center for biosaline agriculture icba dubai the united arab emirates 25 05 49 n and 55 23 25 e the soils at icba experimental fields are sandy in texture that is fine sand sand 98 silt 1 and clay 1 calcareous 50 60 caco3 equivalents porous 45 porosity and moderately alkaline ph 8 22 with very low organic matter 0 5 the saturation percentage of the soil was 26 with very high drainage capacity while the electrical conductivity of its saturated extract ece was 1 2 ds m 1 according to american soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2010 the soil is classified as typic torripsamments carbonatic and hyperthermic shahid et al 2009 a set of 20 accessions of quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd were tested icba q1 icba q2 icba q3 icba q4 icba q5 giza 1 giza 2 nsl 86649 ames 13749 ames 13757 ames 22155 inia 415 pasankalla salcedo inia amarilla marangani amarilla sacaca kancolla puno ticota titicaca co 407 and ru 5 the first five varieties which have been developed at icba are suitable for sandy soils and high temperatures they are also tolerant to salinity the other quinoa cultivars developed in other parts of the world were included in the experiment to assess their performance in the uae and compare them with the locally produced accessions the nsl 86649 ames 13749 ames 13757 and ames 22155 accessions were provided by the usda co 407 is a cultivar developed at the university of columbia ru 5 is a cultivar from the uk inia 415 pasankalla salcedo inia amarilla marangani amarilla sacaca and kancolla are peruvian accessions and the puno ticota and titicaca cultivars were developed in denmark table 1 therefore accessions from different quinoa ecotypes were tested in this study besides some of the accessions being derived from germplasm provided by the usda or being selected in countries like denmark the united kingdom uae or egypt where the ecotype provenance is difficult to determine accessions from at least three different ecotypes were tested these included quinoas from the andean valleys of central and northern peru from the andean high plateau of peru and bolivia and from the coastal lowland areas of central chile gomez and eguiluz 2011 estrada and gonza 2011 bazile et al 2014 moreover the commercial variety ru 5 apparently derives to some extent from the salar i e salt flats ecotype of bolivia and northern chile and argentina before sowing the fertility of the soil was improved by incorporating organic fertilizer cow and chicken manure at the rate of 40 mg ha 1 side fertilization consisted of urea 60 at 30 kg ha 1 applied 4 weeks after sowing and npk 20 20 20 applied at 40 kg ha 1 8 weeks after sowing sowing took place on november 19 2016 the seeds were sown by hand and after planting the field was covered by acryl sheeting to stop birds eating the seed for the following two weeks the trial was drip irrigated with fresh water 1 ds m 1 to avoid hindering germination koyro and eisa 2008 then two different treatments were imposed for the rest of the growing period a irrigation with fresh water and b irrigation with saline water 15 ds m 1 for each treatment the experimental design was a randomized complete block with 3 replicates per genotype plot size was 2 2 m with a plant to plant distance of 25 cm and 50 cm between rows totaling 45 plants per plot 5 9 at the time of flowering the whole experiment field was covered with a net to protect the plants from hares and later from bird damage to the panicles drip irrigation was used for the experiment with drippers at 25 cm distance irrigation occurred twice a day for 5 min each time water release from each dripper was 4 l h 1 per plant the same amount of water was used for both freshwater and saline irrigation in addition about 28 3 mm of accumulated precipitation was received during the growing period data in brief fig 1 during the whole crop season hand weeding was carried out when needed without applying any herbicide maturity was reached during the first half of march 2017 in the third week of march seed yield and plant biomass were assessed by manual harvesting the five plants from the middle row of each plot dry biomass was determined by drying the samples initially under the sun for two days and then in a forced air oven at 80 c for 48 h in addition plant height along with the number of branches and inflorescences per plant and the inflorescence length were measured as detailed elsewhere hussain et al 2018 2 2 leaf pigments leaf pigments were measured using a portable leaf clip sensor dualex dualex force a orsay france which takes non destructive measurements of chlorophyll chl unitless index flavonoid fla unitless index and anthocyanin anth unitless index contents based on the chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra cerovic et al 2012 in addition it calculates the nitrogen balance index nbi which is the ratio of chl flav related to the nitrogen and carbon allocation cerovic et al 2015 the dualex sensor operates with a uv excitation beam at 357 nm which corresponds to the maximum absorption for flavonoids and a red reference beam at 650 nm which corresponds to the maximum absorption for chlorophyll for each plot 10 recently fully expanded i e non senescent leaves were selected from the central rows measurements took place on jan 29 2017 around 8 weeks after the two irrigation treatments were imposed measurements were performed on the adaxial part of the leaves no marked differences in plant phenology were registered with all the genotypes already exhibiting floral panicles 2 3 ion analyses the same leaves that were used to measure the pigment content were washed with tap and distilled water dried in an oven at 60 c for two days and ground to a fine powder from each leaf sample 100 mg of the ground dry material was subsampled and digested with 3 ml of concentrated hno3 and 2 ml of h2o2 then heated overnight at 90 c afterwards 30 ml of pure water was added to each sample and then transferred to analytic tubes the amount of na k p ca2 and mg2 in each sample was determined using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer l3200rl perkin elmer uberlingen germany at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona ion concentrations were expressed in mmol g 1 of dry weight further the same elements were also analyzed in the organic compost and npk fertilizer using the same protocol as above 2 4 stable isotope analyses a second subsample of the dry leaf powder was used for the measurement of the total nitrogen concentration and the stable carbon 13c 12c ratio and nitrogen 15n 14n ratio isotope signatures analyses were performed at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona samples of 1 mg were weighed into tin capsules and analyses were performed using an elemental analyzer flash 1112 ea thermofinnigan schwerte germany coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta c irms thermofinnigan operating in continuous flow mode the 13c 12c ratios r of plant material were expressed in δ notation coplen 2008 as carbon isotope composition δ13c δ 13 c r s

iaea ch7 3 polyethylene foil iaea ch6 sucrose usgs 40 l glutamic acid were used with an analytical precision of 0 1 the same δ notation was used for the 15n 14n ratio expression but with the standard referring to n2 in air for nitrogen the international isotope secondary standards iaea n1 iaean2 iaeano3 and usgs40 were used with a precision of 0 3 the soluble fraction of the same samples was analyzed after yousfi et al 2013 50 mg of each ground leaf sample was suspended with 1 ml of milli q water in an eppendorf tube eppendorf scientific hamburg germany for 20 min at about 5 c the sample was then centrifuged at 12 000g for 5 min and at 5 c afterwards the supernatant containing the water soluble fraction was pipetted into a new eppendorf and heated at 100 c for 3 min to denature the proteins samples were centrifuged again 12 000g for 5 min at 5 c and 100 μl of the resulting aliquot was placed in tin capsules and dried at 70 c for 2 h the soluble fraction of carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions was then determined at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona as described in the previous paragraph 2 5 statistical analyses analysis of variance anova was performed using the statistical package spss spss inc to test the effects of the irrigation treatment genotypes and their interaction a bivariate correlation was carried out also using spss software to calculate pearson correlation coefficients between the analytic traits and yield components a multiple linear regression using the stepwise procedure was conducted to extract the significant traits that explain biomass and yield variations across treatments a principal components analysis was deployed using the statistical software r rstudio inc to analyze the data on a bi dimensional plan graphs were created using the sigmaplot program 10 0 spss inc 3 results 3 1 effect of irrigation with saline water and genotype on seed yield biomass and agronomic components irrigation with saline water significantly decreased seed yield biomass plant height fig 1 and all the agronomic yield components studied table 2 saline water reduced seed yield by about 27 and the rest of the traits by less than 20 genotypic variability was also significant table 2 within each irrigation regime fig 1 and data in brief table 1 for seed yield biomass and the other agronomical traits the varieties inia 415 pasankalla 10 and titicaca 18 were not included in the analyses of yield biomass and the other agronomical traits given their poor emergence the accession that produced the highest biomass under irrigation with fresh water was amarilla sacaca number 13 at table 1 followed by amarilla marangani salcedo inia puno ticota and icba q3 12 11 17 and 3 while the accessions with the least biomass were icba q5 ames 22155 giza 2 and ru 5 5 9 16 and 20 under irrigation with saline water the top accession was salcedo inia 11 followed by giza 2 and amarilla sacaca 16 13 while the accessions with the least biomass were co 407 and ru 5 19 20 the cultivar puno ticota 17 was the top genotype in terms of seed yield under fresh water fig 1 while icba q1 icba q2 ames 13749 ames 13757 amarilla maragani amarilla sacaca and co 407 1 2 7 8 12 13 19 achieved somewhat lower yields but the differences were not statistically significant the lowest seed yield was observed in giza 2 2 under saline irrigation top and least seed yielders were clearly nsl 86649xx 6 and amarilla marangani 12 respectively the genotypic effect and its interaction with irrigation conditions were also significant for all these traits table 2 for example while irrigation with saline water in general decreased seed yield and biomass across the set of accessions some accessions produced similar biomass icba q5 ames 22155 and kancolla or even more salcedo inia and giza 2 under saline irrigation compared with fresh water in the case of seed yield some varieties yielded similarly nsl 86649 salcedo inia and kancolla or even more giza under irrigation with saline water 3 2 short term irrigation effect with saline water on ion concentrations pigment contents and stable isotopes after eight weeks of irrigation with saline water the sodium content in the leaf dry matter doubled increased by 2 4 the potassium and phosphorous decreased slightly but significantly about 10 and magnesium increased slightly 10 whereas calcium was unaffected table 3 as a consequence the k na ca2 na and mg2 na ratios decreased by more than half relative to the freshwater treatment the genotypic effect was significant for all the parameters considered in the table the genotype by irrigation interaction was not significant for any of the parameters even when sodium and calcium were close to significance however there were no genotypic differences in na and k across accessions when irrigated with fresh water whereas irrigation with saline water resulted in genotypic differences data in brief table 2 however for other elements such as p and particularly ca2 and mg2 genotypic differences existed within each irrigation treatment ca2 na and mg2 na did not show significant differences across accessions within the fresh water irrigation treatment but differences existed under saline irrigation by contrast the k na ratio showed genotypic differences within the fresh water treatment but not under saline irrigation data in brief table 2 eight weeks of irrigation with saline water slightly ca 10 but significantly increased the per area leaf contents of chlorophyll and flavonoids as well as the nitrogen balance index nbi whereas the anthocyanin content did not change table 4 the genotype effect was significant for all the traits displayed in the table the interaction between genotype and irrigation was significant for all the traits except flavonoids the content of the three pigments as well as the nbi index showed significant differences across genotypes under both irrigation treatments data in brief table 3 the same irrigation period with saline water significantly decreased the nitrogen isotope composition δ15n of the leaves both in terms of total dry matter as well as the soluble fraction table 5 the total carbon and nitrogen contents of the leaf dry matter were also significantly decreased even though it was slight at approx 5 by the application of saline water concerning carbon isotope composition δ13c a small but significant increase in the leaf dry matter was recorded while differences in the δ13c of the soluble fraction did not reach significance the genotype effect was significant for all the traits included in the table except the δ13c of the soluble fraction whereas no significant genotype by irrigation interaction was recorded for any trait however there were no differences across genotypes within each of the irrigation treatments for total carbon and n content as well as the δ13c and δ15n of the dry matter and the soluble fraction data in brief table 4 3 3 relationships between crop performance and different morphophysiological traits in fact under freshwater conditions plant height was positively correlated across the set of genotypes with seed yield 0 677 p 0 01 and biomass 0 402 p 0 05 while under saline irrigation the relationships followed a similar trend as in the fresh water irrigation but they did not reach significance data not shown inflorescence length and branches per plant also followed similar trends in their relationships with biomass and seed yield but significance were not achieved therefore for the set of accessions of different provenance plant growth evaluated in terms of plant height appears as a good genotypic indicator of biomass and yield at least under fresh water irrigation the overall relationships of the two main agronomical traits seed yield and biomass along with the mineral concentrations pigment contents and stable isotopes were analyzed using a principal component analysis pca when the whole set of genotypes and the two growing conditions were considered the first two axes of the pca explained around 45 of the all variability fig 2 seed yield and biomass appeared on the right of the horizontal axis together with the δ15n of the dry matter and the total carbon content while sodium calcium and to a greater degree magnesium were placed on the left side of the horizontal axis with δ13c also being on the left but closer to the vertex the potassium and nitrogen concentrations in dry matter were placed on the right side of the pca but nearly equidistant from both the horizontal and vertical axes and the anthocyanin content was placed in the left side of the pca opposite the nitrogen concentration finally the phosphorous concentration and to a lesser extent the flavonoid content were placed in the upper part of the vertical axis almost directly opposite the chlorophyll content and all of them perpendicular to the seed yield and biomass pearson correlations of the different ion concentrations and their ratios against seed yield total biomass plant height and several agronomical yield components were analyzed table 6 correlations were assessed by combining the two growing conditions the 20 accessions and the three replicates per accession n 120 or within each irrigation condition n 60 interestingly the pattern of correlations was very similar within fresh water compared to the saline irrigated conditions alone or when both growing conditions were combined in general plant height was the best correlated while seed yield biomass and inflorescence length were slightly but consistently less correlated and the numbers of branches and inflorescences per plant were the least correlated traits for each of the growing conditions alone or in combination the parameter with the best correlation was the magnesium concentration followed by the sodium concentration and the k na ratio potassium and calcium as well as the other two ratios correlated less well apart from potassium in all cases all the other ions always correlated negatively while the ratios correlated positively regarding the stable isotopes the trait that best correlated with yield biomass was the δ15n of the dry matter table 7 where it correlated positively in the three scenarios both irrigation regimes combined n 120 and each irrigation regime independently n 60 however δ15n only correlated positively against seed yield and branches per plant when the irrigation regimes were combined the δ13c in the dry matter only correlated against inflorescence length and plant height in the former negative correlations were found within the freshwater trial n 60 as well as when freshwater and saline treatments were combined n 120 in the case of plant height a negative correlation was found only when the growing conditions were combined the only other case where δ13c correlated was with plant height when the two irrigation regimes were combined total carbon content on dry matter basis correlated positively with plant and inflorescence height within each irrigation condition and with biomass and seed yield under fresh water irrigation in addition carbon content correlated positively with all the agronomic traits of the study when plants from both growing conditions were combined table 7 in the case of leaf pigments on an area basis chlorophyll content only correlated negatively with total biomass within the saline irrigation n 60 treatment and positively with seed yield within the freshwater irrigation n 60 treatment table 8 anthocyanin content correlated negatively against plant height and inflorescence length when the treatments were combined n 120 as well as within the saline irrigation treatment where it also correlated against seed yield finally the flavonoid content was only positively correlated against plant height in the freshwater treatment and the nbi index was correlated negatively against total biomass globally all these correlations were weak when the phenotypic correlations were assessed using the accession values instead of the single plot values magnesium content was again the parameter that best correlated with both biomass and seed yield fig 3 moreover the relationships across genotypes in the freshwater treatment were much stronger than within the saline water irrigation but both categories of values showed quite similar patterns multilinear stepwise models using the different set of parameters evaluated were tested against biomass table 9 and seed yield table 10 on an area basis within each trial irrigated with fresh water and with saline water as well as combining plots from both trials for biomass and seed yield traits and the three different scenarios fresh water saline water and the two growing conditions together the first trait chosen by the model was always magnesium content in the case of the biomass magnesium alone explained nearly 40 of biomass variability in the freshwater treatment and nearly 30 when the treatments were combined but only explained around 15 of variability in biomass within the saline water irrigation where chlorophyll content was the second parameter chosen by the model and 26 of variability in seed yield potassium was the only other parameter chosen by the model in the three cases while δ15n was chosen in two cases freshwater and both irrigation regimes anthocyanin only marginally contributed to explaining variability in biomass under freshwater irrigation interestingly sodium content only contributed very marginally to the model when both irrigation treatments were combined concerning seed yield magnesium was the first trait chosen by the model explaining nearly 30 of the variability in seed yield within the freshwater treatment and both growing conditions combined and only around 20 in the saline water treatment the nbi ratio contributed explaining seed yield variability in the freshwater and the saline irrigation while potassium was chosen as an additional trait in two of the scenarios saline water and both irrigation regimes together the nitrogen concentration and the nitrogen content were also included in the model for saline water while calcium was included in the model when the two irrigation treatments were combined 4 discussion 4 1 growth and yield the seed yield and biomass values achieved under irrigation with fresh water are in the same range as reported for the region previously rao and shahid 2012 hirich et al 2014 choukr allah et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 significant decreases not only in dry biomass seed yield and plant height but also in the number of branches number of panicles panicle weight and harvest index in response to irrigation with saline water have also been reported before hussain et al 2018 however in our study the magnitude of the decrease in yield biomass and a number of different agronomic components corresponded to moderate salinity stress the reduction in seed yield was related with a decrease in the number of seeds which indicates that a reduction in the number and size of the inflorescences per plant is the main factor accounting for the yield decrease genotypic variability in seed yield and biomass has been reported before for quinoa plants growing under comparable agroecological conditions hirich et al 2014 choukr allah et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 moreover the significant interaction between genotype and irrigation conditions for seed yield biomass and different agronomical traits highlights not only the genotypic plasticity available in the species but also the need to assess genotypic performance within each growing condition shabala et al 2013 4 2 genotypic provenance with regard to biomass under fresh water irrigation the top accession amarilla sacara together with three of the next four best accessions salcedo inia amarilla marangani puno ticota were of peruvian origin even though they were of different ecotype origins among the poorest performers the two ecotypes that were clearly identified ames 22155 and ru 5 were of chilean origin under saline irrigation the top accession in terms of biomass was peruvian from the andean high plateau provenance of peru salcedo inia while the two lowest producers in terms of biomass were of chilean origin co 407 and ru 5 and also apparently from the two ecotypes existing in the country the varieties from the andean valleys amarilla marangani and amarilla sacaca were the two accessions that exhibited the highest biomass and number of branches per plant under fresh water irrigation and were also placed among the accessions with the greatest seed yield and plant height however their agronomical performance under saline irrigation was less remarkable the combination of greater plant height larger number of branches per plant and longer growth cycle gomez and eguiluz 2011 may be the reason that these two accessions exhibit the greatest biomass among the tested panel however their long growth cycles may result in the seed yield of these accessions being impacted by heat stress during flowering when grown in the conditions of the uae thus concerning seed yield under fresh water irrigation conditions and besides the two accessions from the andean valleys performance was closer to accessions derived from germplasm provided by the usda icba q1 icba q2 ames 13749 and ames 13757 and with peruvian accessions from the andean high plateau puno ticota and the lowland coastal chilean area co 407 which were the best yielders under saline irrigation the best performers were one accession from the usda nsl 86649 followed by the peruvian high plateau cultivar salcedo inia while the peruvian cultivar amarilla marangani from the andean valleys had the lowest yields nevertheless apart from the commercial variety titicaca which exhibited poor crop establishment in general this study supports the good agronomical performance of germplasm from the peruvian high plateau in terms of seed yield regarding the two ecotypes grown in chile there are recognized differences related to salinity altitude adaptation tolerance to drought and sensitivity to photoperiod fuentes et al 2009 quinoas ascribed to the salar ecotype are traditionally cultivated in conditions of saline soils and rainfall that varies between 100 and 200 mm per year fuentes et al 2009 however while the ecotype provenance of accessions from the salar may justify their inclusion in a testing panel targeted towards desert areas exposed to salinity these accessions have been reported to yield poorly when grown at similar latitude under lowland desert conditions probably due to the negative effects of the high temperature stress around flowering fuentes and bhargava 2011 in our study ru 5 which is the only accession that potentially integrates germplasm from the salar had similar or lower yields than accessions derived predominantly from lowland chilean genotypes icba q4 icba q5 ames 22155 and co 407 in general terms and regardless of the irrigation conditions the taller genotypes were associated with higher biomass and seed yield inflorescence length and branches per plant were also correlated with biomass and seed yield but the relationships were not as strong plant height together with inflorescence length has been recognized as a good genotypic indicator of the yield performance of quinoa under saline conditions gómez pando et al 2010 and drought spehar and santos 2005 nevertheless within the panel of accessions tested the differences in plant height between the ecotypes were not so evident thus even though the accession that exhibited the greatest plant height under fresh irrigation was from the andean valleys of peru amarilla sacaca under saline irrigation the greatest height was achieved by icba q4 which is of chilean provenance the other three categories of ecotypes namely the peruvian high plateau the bolivian and chilean salar and the chilean coastal lowlands are broadly characterized by comparable plant heights and inflorescence structures gomez and eguiluz 2011 4 3 stable isotope signature and nitrogen and carbon content irrigation regime had a significant effect on the carbon isotope composition δ13c thus irrigating with saline water increased the δ13c of the leaf dry matter compared with control plants this kind of response to salinity has been ascribed to an osmotic effect similar to that of water stress closing stomata munns and tester 2008 indeed an increase in δ13c following irrigation with saline water has been recently reported in quinoa hussain et al 2018 and was associated with a decrease in the intercellular versus atmospheric co2 ratio however in our study the actual values of δ13c were more negative and the increase in the δ13c of the leaf dry matter in response to salinity was much smaller than the values reported in the leaves of mature plants i e at the end of the crop cycle by hussain et al 2018 this was despite the fact that the growing conditions of the control and saline irrigated plants were comparable to those of our study while the samples we analyzed i e fully expanded leaves in the current work were grown for several weeks under different irrigation conditions leaves at harvest integrate the growing conditions of the entire crop cycle and this may explain the observational differences between the two studies genotypic variability in δ13c has been reported before for quinoa seeds under well watered and water stressed conditions gonzález et al 2011 however the only previous study analyzing δ13c in quinoa under saline conditions failed to identify genotypic variability hussain et al 2018 interestingly in our study genotypic differences were found only for the δ13c of the dry matter while in the δ13c of the soluble fraction no genotypic variability was observed these results suggest that genotypic variability for δ13c is evidenced under mild to moderate saline conditions caused by a relatively short exposure to salinity irrigation conditions significantly affected the nitrogen isotope composition δ15n and the total nitrogen content of the leaves thus salinity decreased δ15n and slightly but significantly decreased the total nitrogen content while genotypic variability for both traits was found genotypic variability for δ15n and total nitrogen content has been reported recently for quinoa under saline conditions hussain et al 2018 but contrary to our results both δ15n and nitrogen content increased in response to salinity it has been reported for different species that salinity besides inducing stomatal closure and therefore increasing δ13c affects processes related to n uptake assimilation release and internal recycling consequently decreasing plant δ15n and nitrogen content cernusak et al 2009 yousfi et al 2009 2012 2013 and explaining genotypic variability in the response to salinity gonzález et al 2011 working on quinoa under water stress conditions reported a negative correlation between δ13c and seed yield but there were no significant correlations for δ15n the negative correlation of δ13c with growth traits indicated that the plants maintained higher photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance and had stronger growth and yield gonzález et al 2011 in our study δ13c correlated negatively with inflorescence length under freshwater irrigation and with plant height when combining both irrigation regimes but there was no correlation with biomass or seed yield and no correlation at all was found under saline irrigation however δ15n correlated positively with plant biomass within each of the two irrigation treatments indeed positive correlations between δ15n and biomass across genotypes have been reported in durum wheat under control and saline conditions yousfi et al 2009 2012 in the study of hussain et al 2018 as a consequence of the effect of salinity increasing δ15n a negative correlation of δ15n with seed yield and plant biomass was reported when all growing conditions were combined however no correlations across genotypes within a given salinity level were established concerning the positive relationships of total carbon content and the agronomical traits morpho anatomical adaptations of quinoa to salinity include the development of thick epidermis and sclerenchyma tissues prado et al 2017 therefore salinity stress reduces plant growth while enhancing the production of sclerenchyma tissues this may decrease the relative content of carbon in the dry matter because the presence of more oxygen atoms in the molecules by contrast lack of stress and or plants having a constitutive higher relative content of cellulose are characterized by higher growth and eventually biomass while the relative carbon content increases 4 4 leaf pigments concerning leaf pigments both the chlorophyll and flavonoid contents on an area basis were significantly affected by irrigation conditions while genotypic differences were found for the different pigments analyzed including anthocyanins however both chlorophyll and flavonoids increased in response to salinity in addition the nitrogen balance index nbi which is the ratio between the chlorophyll and epidermal flavonoids also increased and this suggested a higher n content under saline conditions cerovic et al 2015 however the increase in total chlorophyll and even in nbi may be related to an effect of salinity inducing thicker more compact leaves which in fact may be considered a negative response to stress increases or no changes in chlorophyll content on an area basis as measured with a portable device have been reported before during saline treatments e g yousfi et al 2009 2010 in fact eisa et al 2012 have reported in quinoa that salinity strongly increases the leaf mass to area ratio the so called leaf specific mass which may counteract to a large extent the negative effect of salinity decreasing chlorophyll concentration e g inducing senescence when measuring the pigment content on an area basis as is the case with portable leaf meters in our study chlorophyll was only positively albeit weakly correlated with seed yield in the freshwater treatment moreover it correlated negatively with biomass within the saline water treatment meaning that the plants exhibiting higher chlorophyll content on an area basis were those growing the least therefore leaf pigment content assessed via portable devices is not an appropriate way to phenotype salinity tolerance and even their suitability for crop monitoring remains skeptical a similar lack of a relationship between chlorophyll content and biomass has been reported before in other crops yousfi et al 2009 2010 the main reason is the fact that portable chlorophyll leaf meters work as spectroradiometers by detecting the visible and near infrared radiation transmitted through the leaf and therefore the values of the vegetation index derived depend on the leaf thickness and or density in the case of flavonoids their increase which was greater than the changes in leaf anatomy might have suggested limited to some increases in epidermal cell thickness may be the consequence of adaptive responses to abiotic stresses such as drought heat or salinity moreover in addition to their role in filtering uv light to prevent photooxidative stress flavonoids improve salinity tolerance in quinoa by regulating k retention and na exclusion from leaf mesophyll ismail et al 2016 however in our study flavonoid content was not correlated with seed yield biomass or any of the other agronomic growth traits except for plant height under well irrigated conditions the total content of anthocyanins did not change under irrigation with saline water and this may be associated with plant tolerance to salinity daneshmand et al 2010 even though anthocyanin accumulation has been widely accepted as a response to stress eryılmaz 2006 in support of the lack of change in their concentration anthocyanins were negatively correlated with seed yield plant height and inflorescence length in the saline irrigation treatment but not in the freshwater treatment however a methodological drawback of measuring plant polyphenolics such as flavonoids and anthocyanins in intact leaves with the portable meter is the indirect nature of the approach whereby the measurement uses uv absorbance of the leaf epidermis via double excitation of chlorophyll fluorescence goulas et al 2004 4 5 mineral content irrigation regime and genotype effects significantly affected the leaf mineral content on a dry matter basis genotypic variability in the mineral content of quinoa leaves has been reported before bhargava et al 2008 the 2 4 times increase in na concentration following irrigation with saline water relative to fresh water may be considered moderate in comparison to previous reports in quinoa orsini et al 2011 eisa et al 2012 razzaghi et al 2015 and other herbaceous plant species such as wheat yousfi et al 2009 2010 wang et al 2018 exposed to similar salinity levels and with similar growing period duration however most of these and other studies have reported on controlled conditions and hydroponics or if grown in the field the salinity was soil based rather than irrigation based or the soil was not sandy in fact the sandy soil conditions present during our study prevented rapid increases in salinity from saline water irrigation shahid et al 2009 el sebai et al 2016 compared to other plant species the k concentration decreased only slightly in response to irrigation with saline water which agrees with results on the importance of inorganic ions for osmotic adjustment in quinoa and the ability of quinoa to maintain k levels under highly saline conditions orsini et al 2011 razzaghi et al 2015 reported in field grown quinoa that salinity imposed from flowering increased not only the na but also the k uptake by shoots in the same sense under controlled conditions increased k concentration in the leaf sap has been reported shabala et al 2013 however as in our results a large decrease in the k na ratio in response to increasing salinity has been reported in quinoa previously eisa et al 2012 genotypic tolerance to salinity has been reported to be associated with a lower xylem na content while under freshwater irrigation conditions a positive correlation was shown to exist between salinity tolerance and the plant s ability to accumulate na in the shoot shabala et al 2013 in agreement with the first part of the above statement we found a negative correlation between na concentration in leaf dry matter and biomass within the saline irrigation trial as well as across both irrigation conditions however under freshwater irrigation the correlations between leaf na concentration and biomass were also negative but stronger than under saline irrigation conditions and na concentration which also correlated negatively with seed yield which was not the case for the saline irrigated trial these results suggest that plants in the freshwater treatment were experiencing some degree of salinity regardless of the irrigation conditions moreover the δ13c of the soluble fraction of the leaves which reflects the recently produced photosynthates cabrera bosquet et al 2011 yousfi et al 2013 was not significantly different between freshwater and saline irrigation conditions which suggests that both irrigation regimes were associated with comparable photosynthetic gas exchange conditions moreover no interaction occurred between growing conditions and genotype for either δ13c or δ15n which supports the moderate differences in growing conditions between control and saline irrigation in our study the concentration of other ions accumulated in the leaves gave some insights about how salinity manifests inside the plant in fact both the mg2 and ca2 concentrations in quinoa leaves were higher than those reported in leaves and shoots of other plants species irrigated with fresh water or stressed by irrigation with saline by nacl water lutts et al 1996 lavon et al 1999 yousfi et al 2009 it is widely reported that quinoa has a high content of calcium and magnesium in the seeds vega gálvez et al 2010 which also corresponds to a relatively high content of mg2 and ca2 in leaves orsini et al 2011 riccardi et al 2014 and these ions alongside potassium may play a role in the osmotic function of the vacuole it has been reported for quinoa that nacl application influences the accumulation of bivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 but at nacl doses well above those tested in our study orsini et al 2011 moreover ca2 has a positive function in salt tolerance reducing the toxic effects of nacl while magnesium also seems to have a positive role because it is a constituent of chlorophyll and atp as well as a cofactor for many enzymes shabala et al 2006 orsini et al 2011 thus orsini et al 2011 reported that mg2 levels changed only slightly from control through a wide range of salinities that clearly exceeded the growing conditions of our study 150 750 mm nacl however the mg2 levels and even more significantly the ca2 levels of leaves grown with fresh water were higher than those reported in quinoa previously orsini 2011 moreover and in contrast with k and na genotypic differences existed for both mg2 and ca2 levels not only under saline irrigation but also under fresh water conditions data in brief table 2 while the ion content of the fresh water and even the saline water used for irrigation table 11 does not explain the high levels of these ions in the leaf dry matter other sources need to be considered in fact both the mg2 and ca2 content in the dry leaf matter correlated negatively and better than na with biomass and seed yield and not only under saline irrigation but also under irrigation with fresh water moreover inia 415 pasankalla and titicaca the two cultivars that performed very poorly also accumulated the highest mg2 levels under fresh water irrigation on the other hand k correlated positively with biomass under both saline and fresh water in fact the pca analysis clearly placed mg2 and ca2 a greater distance than na on the same axis alongside δ13c but opposite to seed yield and biomass moreover mg2 was the first trait chosen in all the stepwise models predicting biomass and seed yield these results further support the occurrence of salinity even under irrigation with fresh water with the mg2 and ca2 having a major role in inducing such stress the main source of the mg2 and the ca2 as well as an additional source of na was the manure table 11 4 6 manure application quinoa is known to grow on poor soils although the yield is compromised adding composted organic matter together with irrigation is particularly recommended for growing quinoa in arid zone soils martínez et al 2009 incorporation of green manure from legumes llama and sheep manures has been proposed as a way to increase or maintain soil fertility and preserving soil humidity during quinoa cultivation jacobsen 2011 2012 indeed hirich et al 2014 have reported a positive effect following organic amendment of quinoa however the amount of organic compost in their study was 10 mg ha 1 a quarter of the amount used in the present experiment and was of plant rather than animal origins although the amount of organic material used was four times greater in our study the organic content of the soil was 0 5 which is very low compared to the 1 6 organic matter in the moderately rich soil studied by hirich et al 2014 compost may also ameliorate the adverse effects of salinity in quinoa as suggested from a study under pot conditions el sebai et al 2016 however this study used compost made from crop wheat residues due to the huge amount 40 mg ha 1 of manure applied in our study it can be assumed that this was the main source of nitrogen available to the plants probably exceeding by an order of magnitude i e more than 10 times higher the 26 kg ha 1 of nitrogen provided in the form of npk the very high values for δ15n beyond 10 in the leaf dry matter in our study clearly indicate manure as the main source for the nitrogen used by the crop serret et al 2008 it is well known that urea and other chemical nitrogen fertilizers are characterized by δ15n values close to zero while manure exhibits δ15n values surpassing 10 therefore heavy applications of manure or compost from animal provenance may add to the negative effects of salinity on plant yield in the case of irrigation with saline water or be the primary cause of salinity when irrigation occurs with fresh water in our study the animal manure which was characterized by high ion content particularly mg2 ca2 and na seems to have been the main cause of salinization the inherent characteristic of quinoa accumulating ions for osmotic adjustment may also have contributed to the high concentration of ions present in the crop in this study 4 7 concluding remarks irrigation with saline water significantly decreased growth and yield compared to control conditions with genotypic variability existing for most of these traits besides the water used for irrigation salinity caused by the high amount of manure applied negatively affected growth and productivity regardless of the irrigation regime all the different diagnostic approaches assayed pigment content stable isotope signatures and mineral content in leaves from plants grown for 8 weeks were able to separate between irrigation treatments and even to exhibit genotypic differences however their performance in terms of predicting seed yield and final biomass and other growth characteristics under a given irrigation regime was very variable whereas pigment content on a leaf area basis as measured with a portable device mostly failed to correlate with yield and growth characteristics stable isotope signature particularly δ15n performed better in terms of correlation with biomass nevertheless only mineral content in leaves showed a consistent relationship with crop growth and seed yield and moreover enabled identification of unexpected sources of salinity thus the content of individual ions specifically mg2 ca2 and na and their ratios including k na were the traits best correlated with seed yield and biomass not only within growing conditions which may be useful for phenotyping but also across growing conditions which also makes these traits amenable for crop management the only other trait showing correlation across and within growing conditions was δ15n moreover in spite of the fact that mg2 was the first variable chosen in the multilinear stepwise model predicting biomass and seed yield different pigment content traits and δ15n contributed to improving the strength of the models therefore the analysis of ion concentration in dry matter alone or combined with other traits allows an early evaluation of the contribution of irrigation and manuring towards saline stress and to identify the best performing genotypes within each of the irrigation conditions declaration of competing interest i declare there are not conflict

10544,extensive field research for data collection to conduct economic comparisons of variable rate irrigation vri with fixed uniform rate irrigation fri and no irrigation ni in combination with three nitrogen application strategies of fixed uniform rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp management for maize zea mays l were conducted research was conducted in three soil types i crete silt loam s1 ii hastings silty clay loam s2 and iii hastings silt loam s3 for three growing seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 in nebraska usa for the economic analyses the average initial investment of the irrigation system and necessary vri technology salvage value of the system total capital investment total fixed cost net present value npv and internal rate of return irr were quantified by considering numerous factors variables including interest rate production input cost longevity of the system insurance cost ownership cost and salvage value soil types and irrigation management strategies treatments had significant impact on grain yield and thus on profitability npv irr and irrigation system payback period net income from fri management was significantly higher than vri management in all soil types the nitrogen treatments did not affect net income in any of the growing seasons the fri management strategy had a positive npv in all soil types whereas vri management in s2 and s3 had negative npvs the negative npv indicates that the present value of the costs exceeds the present value of future profits at the assumed discount rate 5 averaging all three years and three soils fri had a substantially higher net income than vri in most cases the maximum npv of 4 882 07 per ha and maximum irr of 18 was observed in fri frf treatment a payback period of 10 years was determined for all fri management treatments while the payback period for vri management in most cases was more than 27 years while the pay back period in vri irrigation system was less than ten years in s1 it was still longer than the corresponding fri management treatments results suggest that the vri and vrf strategies are not economically feasible in current conditions for these variable irrigation and fertilizer technologies to be competitive with the fri and frf the cost of the vri and vrf technology will need to be significantly lower than the current investment costs while there could be some environmental benefits of vri and vrf technology with the current high investment cost of vri technology and the fact that the grain yields are not improved sufficiently to offset the investment cost it is not possible for vri technology to be an economically viable technology for profitable economic net return this may explain in part extremely limited adoption of these technologies by producers currently in large scale production fields keywords economics of irrigation fertilizer management net present value internal rate of revenue payback period variable rate technology 1 introduction irrigated agriculture has abetted in stabilizing many communities of the world by permitting human habitation and providing opportunities for economic advancements evans and sadler 2008 irmak and mutiibwa 2009a out of the world s total cultivated lands approximately 20 are irrigated farmlands which produce approximately 40 of world s food and fiber fereres and connor 2004 evans et al 2013 irmak and mutiibwa 2009a 2009b despite its vitality irrigated agriculture is facing important challenges due to meeting the food and fiber demand of rapidly increasing human population and competition for freshwater resources according to the united nations estimation to meet the increasing population s food demands land under cultivation must increase by 40 and the amount of water allocated to irrigation must increase by 14 by 2030 however land area under irrigated agriculture and water needed for irrigation are being depleted or reallocated which is creating a dire and unbalanced situation for crop production therefore there is a pressing need for some significant changes and novel approaches in agricultural water management to address the issue of water shortages in agriculture one of the solutions to this problem is the effective irrigation management strategies that use water and other inputs i e fertilizers efficiently and increase crop productivity at the same time irmak and mutiibwa 2009a 2009b the invention of the center pivot irrigation systems in the 1950s was one of the most significant mechanical innovations in agriculture after 70 years of its innovation the center pivot or linear move sprinkler irrigation systems and associated management practices have advanced substantially and is continuously being evolved to better meet the current requirements of effective agricultural crop production in terms of irrigation needs with an overall goal of uniform and economic irrigation across the field with a specific application depth in addition to irrigation center pivot and linear move systems have also been used for fertilizer applications fertigation over the years with the advent of precision agriculture pa technology the knowledge and understanding about the variability that may exists within a field has increased now the challenge is how to address this variability in terms of irrigation water and fertilizer applications to improve crop productivity the pa technology has been adapted to a variety of field practices including planting fertilizer application pest management herbicide application with a basic characteristic of site specific treatment to separate portions of a field through the advent and merging of several technologies including global positioning systems gps geographical information systems gis automatic controls proximal and remote sensing telecommunications and advanced computer knowledge zhang et al 2002 these innovations have facilitated the implementation of variable water application methods with sprinkler irrigation systems for site specific management the interest in the concept of variable rate management especially variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf sharma and irmak 2020a to manage spatial and temporal variabilities within an agricultural field has increased due to its expected and or assumed potential of improving the crop water productivity most of this interest however remain within the research community and private industry as adoption of vri technology by farmers in production fields is extremely limited adoption of vrf technology is even less than vri for any new technology to be adopted by the producers the benefits including management and environmental benefits as well as costs and profit associated with the technology requirements must be investigated and presented and covered from the incremental revenue from crop yields extremely limited research has been carried out to investigate the cost effectiveness of vri and vrf as compared with traditional fixed uniform rate irrigation fri and fixed uniform rate fertilizer management frf and pre plant pp nitrogen management using measured field data most of the currently available limited studies focused on using modeling approach for such analyses which may not provide reasonable or realistic estimates as models may not be able to account for real world challenges involved in investigating the economics and relationships between vri vrf fri frf and pp nitrogen management practices furthermore how such economic analyses may exhibit variations for different soil types is essentially unknown nijbroek et al 2003 used a crop model to compare gross margin of spatially variable irrigation management and uniform irrigation management for a soybean field 9 94 ha in the coastal plain area the simulation process was applied to 25 years of weather data to determine the feasibility of spatially variable irrigation management they reported that spatially variable irrigation resulted in the best management option with 16 ha 1 greater gross margin however they did not include the cost of equipment associated with spatially variable irrigation in computing the gross margin which could be much greater than 16 ha 1 resulting in more economic returns from uniform irrigation king et al 2006 studied the potential of site specific irrigation management ssim to increase crop yield quality and economic returns in potatoes in a two year field study it was found that the gross income was 159 ha 1 greater for ssim than in conventional uniform irrigation management cuim potato tuber yield was also 4 and 6 greater under ssim in 2001 and 2002 respectively than in cuim dejonge et al 2007 simulated three irrigation scenarios no irrigation uniform irrigation and precision irrigation to determine the potential yield improvements with irrigation method and to compare the economic benefits of improved yield with capital costs of irrigation systems in iowa their results showed lower yields and lower economic benefits with precision irrigation as compared with uniform irrigation in addition to irrigation studies reported profits ranging from none to marginal and substantial when site specific nitrogen management is practiced yang et al 2001 examined the differences in yield and economic returns between uniform and variable rate fertilizer applications the variable rate treatment resulted in significantly higher yields than the uniform nitrogen n and phosphorus p treatment for both years 400 kg ha higher in 1997 and 338 kg ha higher in 1998 also variable rate treatment had positive relative economic returns over the uniform n and p treatment 27 ha in 1997 and 23 ha in 1998 however they did not take into consideration the equipment control units management soil sampling and other costs associated with variable rate treatment the returns would be much lower or even negative if all these costs including soil sampling and soil analyses equipment and data analysis associated with variable rate application were considered bronson et al 2006 conducted a 3 year experiment on a 14 ha area within a 48 ha center pivot irrigated field in a terminated rye conservation tillage cotton system to assess lint yield response to irrigation levels and to compare the effects of variable rate n blanket rate n and zero n on lint yields at varying irrigation levels and landscape positions their results indicated more consistent lint yield response in variable rate n than blanket rate n in all years however when considering the costs of implementing variable rate n management the dollar returns to n fertilizer were not favorable for variable rate fertilization in 2 out of 3 years thus while in some of the studies variable management was proven to increase the yield the variable management was unable to produce greater economic returns than uniform management babcock and pautsch 1998 developed a model based on the yield potential of various soil types in 12 iowa counties and estimated the potential value of switching from uniform to variable fertilizer rates for maize production results indicated only modest increases in the gross returns over fertilizer costs ranging from 7 43 to 1 52 per 0 404 ha they found that the net profitability of variable rate technology is sensitive to the per area costs of moving to a variable rate technology under the assumptions of the model applying variable rates increased yield only by 3 31 kg per 0 404 ha and would reduce fertilizer costs by 1 19 to 6 83 per 0 404 ha when the variable rate technology systems initial cost and other associated application and maintenance costs are considered these increases in grain yield and minimal reduction in fertilizer application would not result in any financial benefit to the farm net income from variable rate technology in midwestern states extensive nitrogen management and irrigation is practiced in a very large land area in nebraska around 90 of total land area 77 421 mi² or 200 520 km2 is under agriculture of which 44 is under irrigation usda nass 2014 or approximately 3 5 million ha with such a large area dedicated to agriculture and irrigation crop production is a critical part of nebraska s economy thompson et al 2012 reported an economic impact of agriculture as high as 42 of nebraska s economy with irrigated crops contributing more than 50 of that percentage in addition to water crops substantially rely on n fertilizers for higher yields thus heavily influencing the economic results for most crops including maize thompson et al 2000 about 80 85 of the irrigated land area in nebraska is irrigated with center pivot systems which should make this area suitable for the development and adoption of vri technology because of already existing platforms extensive irrigated land area four major center pivot manuscfatures being located in nebraska as well as the existence of all other irrigation related industry such as irrigation pump motor well pipe control automation etc however adoption of site specific irrigation and nitrogen management technologies and strategies requires quantification analysees and undrstanding of such technologies and strategies economic feasibility which is a significant knowledge gap in irrigation science and engineering discpline it is very important and necessary to understand the economics of variable rate management of water and nitrogen fertilizer application in comparison with currently dominant conventional fixed uniform water and fertilizer application thus carefully designed and carried out field research is critical to more accurately determine the economics of these management practices the specific objectives of this research were to conduct economic comparisons of maize production under fixed uniform rate irrigation fri with variable rate irrigation vri and no irrigation ni settings with fixed uniform rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant pp fertilizer management in different soil types 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site description experimental design and general crop management practices this project is part of a larger and ongoing long term field research project in the irmak research laboratory advanced field research facilities at the university of nebraska lincoln unl that has been investigating the effect of vri and fri with vrf frf and pp n management on soil water dynamics in different soils sharma and irmak 2020a crop evapotranspiration

conducted in the irmak research laboratory at unl s south central agricultural laboratory scal located near clay center nebraska in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons fig 1 the research laboratory is located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 8 w with an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level the research site is in the transition zone between the sub humid and semi arid zones irmak et al 2012 the long term average annual precipitation at the research site is 680 mm the long term annual maximum and minimum air temperatures at the research site are 25 c and 5 c respectively the growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively the research was conducted on a 2 3 ha field with a west to east elevation gradient in the field ranging from 550 9 m to 552 1 m above mean sea level fig 1 three soil types exist in the research field 1 crete silt loam 0 1 slopes s1 2 hastings silty clay loam 3 7 slopes s2 and 3 hastings silt loam 1 3 slopes s3 the primary production systems in the area are continuous maize and maize soybean rotation primarily under center pivot irrigation 80 85 of the state s total irrigated land and some surface irrigation furrow 15 20 of the state s total irrigated land fixed and variable rate water and nitrogen applications were achieved using a two span 75 m long 7000sl variable rate linear move sprinkler irrigation system t l irrigation co hasting nebraska three levels of irrigation fri vri and ni and three levels of nitrogen n fertilizer frf vrf and pp and their interactions were studied on three soil types the treatment combination of no irrigation ni and pre plant n application pp was not included instead no irrigation and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated therefore there are total 9 treatments irrigation and nitrogen combination treatments which are replicated 3 times in each soil type making 27 plots in each soil type fig 1 each plot was 6m 6m in size with 6m 6m buffer plot in all four sides of each plot maize was planted on may 27 with population densities of 84 500 plants ha 1 and was harvested after 146 of planting on october 19 in 2015 in 2016 and 2017 earlier planting occurred due to warmer temperature in the month of may as compared to 2015 the maize was planted on may 6 and may 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively with population densities of 84 500 plants ha 1 maize was harvested on october 13 161 days after planting dap and october 25 174 dap in 2016 and 2017 respectively herbicides insecticides and fungicides were applied uniformly to all plots as required table 1 to determine the soil properties and nitrogen amount of all soil properties for each plot extensive soil sampling was conducted from 42 locations within the 2 3 ha experimental field in april before planting of each year to create spatially interpolated maps for various soil properties in arcgis extract by mask tool was used to extract the soil physical properties i e field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp organic matter content omc soil texture and soil nitrate n for each plot was determined based on which irrigation and nitrogen amounts should be applied were determined sharma and irmak 2020a 2 2 irrigation and nitrogen management the watermark granular matrix sensors wgms irrometer co riverside ca installed at four depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m in 20 plots two replications of each treatment in each soil type were used for irrigation management wgms were used to monitor smp kpa on an hourly basis and hourly data were then converted to volumetric soil water content vswc using pre determined soil water retention curves for each soil type by accounting for vertical variability in soil layers for all soil types for the research site that were developed by irmak 2019 when horizontal and vertical soil variability is considered in total there were six soil types in the research field silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam thus the experimental field provided a unique opportunity to truly investigate vri and vrf management impacts on crop productivity and associated economic implications many of the vri studies reported in the literature were not carried out in fields that have spatial variability which may result in incomplete analyses and conclusions in terms of crops productivity and economic response to vri the vswc was then multiplied by the representative depth intervals to determine the total soil water stored in each depth and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 2 m soil profile for each plot soil water holding capacity swhc was calculated by subtracting soil water at pwp from soil water at fc for each plot management allowable depletion mad for all plots was taken as 40 of swhc irrigation for both fri and vri treatments was triggered whenever total soil water stored in the 0 0 90 m profile as measured by watermark sensors fell below this 40 threshold however the amount of irrigation per irrigation event for fri plots was fixed to be 25 4 mm each time any of the fri plots needed irrigation based on soil moisture sensor information all fri plots were irrigated with 25 4 mm of irrigation depth considering no variability in the field and assuming that crops in fri plots respond in the same manner at all locations in the field this is the most common operation that producers practice in nebraska and other midwestern states in the united states a total of 1 7 and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the total seasonal irrigation amounts for all growing seasons are presented in table 2 for vri plots irrigation amounts were applied to bring the soil water to maintain approximately 90 of swhc only those plots which needed irrigation calculated according to the measured soil moisture readings from wmgs were irrigated for vri plots by considering each soil layer s physical properties for each soil type thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot differed substantially sharma and irmak 2020a such vri practice is extensive but it is important to account for soil s vertical variability in irrigation requirements calculations to ensure proper practice of vri management most studies reported in the literature did not account for this critical aspect of vri three n fertilizer treatments were imposed under each irrigation management in each soil type i frf vrf and iii pp n fertilizer management for the pp treatment a total of 246 kg ha of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 was applied in 2015 2016 and 2017 before planting in season fertilizer was applied to vrf and frf treatments using a linear move sprinkler irrigation system that is equipped with advanced variable rate irrigation and fertilizer management technologies the n fertilizer rate requirement for each vrf plot was calculated every growing season from soil samples data using n recommendation procedure proposed by shapiro et al 2008 these fertilizer requirements for maize were based on the expected targeted yield organic matter content and current soil nitrate n levels based on this procedure for vrf treatment on average 217 234 and 221 kg ha 1 n fertilizer were applied in fri vri and ni treatments respectively in 2015 in 2016 these values were 205 kg ha 1 206 kg ha 1 and 202 kg ha 1 respectively in 2017 they were 172 kg ha 1 161 kg ha 1 and 168 kg ha 1 respectively a constant rate of 246 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied to all frf plots the n fertilizer application was divided in two applications in 2016 and 2017 growing season half of the required n was applied at the vegetative growth stage of v2 and the other half was applied at v8 stage shapiro et al 2008 for both vrf and frf plots 2 3 economic analyses economic analyses of different irrigation and fertilizer management treatments were conducted based on net present value npv internal rate of return irr gross income and net farm return income on a per hectare ha basis a full scale 7 span center pivot irrigation system generally used in a 65 ha field was considered for calculating the fixed cost per ha of the irrigation system calculations were based mainly on the final grain yield the market price for maize irrigation and fertilizer application management costs other management and product such as herbicides pesticides fuel type and amount for irrigation water withdrawal etc application costs economic analyses were conducted for each year separately gross income and net income for all irrigation and nitrogen combination treatments in three soil types for three growing seasons were calculated gross income was calculated using the market maize grain price for each growing season in the research area table 3 net income was calculated by subtracting the operational costs from the gross income operational costs for each treatment was calculated by considering the individual cost of each product that was applied to each treatment plots replications table 1 throughout each growing season plus the application equipment and machinery cost averaged over the research period assuming diesel price of 0 57 per liter table 4 an irrigation cost of 4 96 per ha cm was used which was calculated using the nebraska pumping plant performance criteria npppc martin et al 2011 with an outlet pressure of 138 kpa a lift depth to groundwater of 32 m and repair and maintenance cost of 2 11 per ha cm the electricity cost used for the calculations was taken as 0 123 per kwh the net income analysis did not consider the hauling and drying costs of the grain due to substantial variability in these processes the costs of irrigation systems were them compared with the net incomes from each of the irrigation treatment fri and vri under different nitrogen management treatments frf vrf and pp nitrogen all costs and profits were compared on a us dollar per ha basis another financial analysis was carried out in which capital costs of linear move irrigation systems with and without vri technology was compared in terms of the payback period the calculated net income for each irrigation management was further utilized to calculate the pay back period for two irrigation systems especially if the investment could be recovered within the lifespan of the irrigation system since vrf in fri treatment is not feasible with a typical center pivot or linear move irrigation system that is not equipped with a vri technology the fri vrf combination was not considered in the economic analyses for the economic analysis several assumptions that were made and considered in the calculations are shown in table 5 to determine the net income per ha a moving average approach of actual net income for three experimental years was considered this was also done to accommodate the seasonality throughout the assumed lifespan of the equipment and irrigation system for the economic analyses the average initial investment of the irrigation system and necessary vri technology salvage value of the system total capital investment total fixed cost and net present value were calculated by considering numerous factors variables including interest rate production input cost longevity life of the system insurance cost ownership cost salvage value etc the input variables include planting harvesting irrigation and nitrogen management cultivation pesticide applications etc the average initial investment cost of the irrigation system per ha was calculated by dividing the total initial investment by average farm size it was assumed that the equipment would salvage for 10 its value at the end of its longevity the total capital cost per ha for each equipment table 6 was calculated by subtracting per ha average salvage value from the initial investment using the following steps i average initial investment per ha initial investment average farm size ii salvage value 10 x initial investment iii total capital investment per ha average initial investment per ha salvage value iv total fixed cost total capital cost total ownership cost the annual ownership cost was calculated by including interest and equipment insurance cost which were calculated by assuming an annual compound interest and insurance rate at 5 and 0 5 respectively table 6 sum of the total capital cost and total cost of ownership provided the total fixed cost for respective equipment table 6 the npv discounted at 5 annual compound rate of the respective equipment was calculated for each soil type under different treatments net present value was then determined as the difference between the present values of cash inflows and outflows of the operation a positive npv indicates that the investment in equipment proved profitable within the life span of the equipment a negative npv indicates that the investment will result in a net loss npv was calculated using the standard financial formula 2 n p v c o c 1 1 r c 2 1 r 2 c t 1 r t where co is initial investment c is cash flow r is discount rate and t is time in general increase in grain prices can increase the probability of npv being positive for irrigation investment regardless whether the irrigation system has a vri technology or not due to substantial increase in grain yield as a result of irrigation as compared with rainfed crop production while irrigation in most cases can result in substantial grain yield increase this increase can vary substantially depending on numerous factors including soil and crop management climatic conditions especially in season precipitation timing and amount nitrogen management and other factors which can all influence the economic benefits of investment in irrigation technology both vri and fri to complement the npv values irr was calculated for various treatments the irr represents the rate of return at which npv of the investment would become zero a higher irr helps identifying best investments out of all the investments with positive npv 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on maize grain yield the grain yield responses to irrigation and nitrogen management strategies under different soil types were used as critical components of the economic analyses maize grain yields for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons for each treatment are presented in table 7 and were discussed in sharma and irmak 2020b briefly sharma and irmak 2020b reported that maize grain yield adjusted to 15 5 grain moisture content ranged from 5 8 tons ha 1 to 11 6 tons ha 1 in 2015 5 6 ton ha 1 to 14 8 ton ha 1 in 2016 and 7 1 ton ha 1 to 15 4 ton ha 1 in 2017 grain yields were significantly different p 0 05 between soil types in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and vri had greater variability in grain yield crop water use and crop water productivity as compared with fri soil type s1 had the highest grain p 0 05 yield followed by s2 and s3 there was no significant yield difference among irrigation treatments in 2015 in any of the soil type in 2016 fri in s1 had the highest grain yield 14 1 tons ha 1 and the lowest yield occurred in s2 the ni treatment 6 2 ton ha 1 a significant effect p 0 05 of soil type was observed in 2016 growing season yield in s1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than s2 and s3 in 2016 comparing irrigation levels in each soil type yield in fri was not significantly different p 0 05 from vri in s1 however significantly higher than vri and ni in s2 and s3 table 7 similar results were obtained in 2017 where fri treatment had the highest grain yield 14 3 ton ha 1 followed by vri 10 6 ton ha 1 and ni 9 4 ton ha 1 averaged over three soil types grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri treatment in s1 however in s2 and s3 yield in fri was 43 and 55 higher than vri p 0 05 respectively all these different responses of grain yield to treatments within a growing season as well as their inter annual variations were accounted for when determining the economics of different irrigation and nitrogen management practices as all analyses were done on a growing season basis 3 2 economics of irrigation and nitrogen management treatments the operational cost gross income and net income for each irrigation and fertilizer management treatment are presented in tables 8 9 10 and 11 for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons and for the pooled data for all years respectively since gross income was calculated from maize grain yield the effect of various treatments on gross income would be the same as the effect on grain yield therefore nitrogen treatment had no significant effect on gross income however there was an interacting effect of irrigation and soil type on gross income in 2015 the gross income ranged from 802 ha 1 in s3 vri vrf treatment to 1601 ha 1 in s1 vri vrf treatment table 8 the lowest and highest values were observed in the same irrigation and nitrogen management combination treatment vri vrf which was due to soil type having a significant impact on grain yield and this effect influenced the gross income moreover variability in grain yield was highest in vri sharma and irmak 2020b and this resulted in considerable variation in gross income in vri treatment within and among soil types as compared with gross income for fri treatments in 2016 the gross income varied from 675 ha 1 in s2 ni no nitrogen treatment to 1772 ha 1 in s1 fri frf treatment table 9 whereas in 2017 the range was 683 ha 1 in s3 vri vrf to 1936 ha 1 s2 fri pp table 10 the lower gross income in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 was due to the lower grain yields in that growing season than in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the operational and soil crop irrigation and nitrogen management costs also varied year to year due to differences in the product costs as well as the amount of the products applied due to different insect and disease pressure the 2017 growing season had the greatest operational cost ranging from 734 ha 1 in s2 ni no nitrogen treatment to 1092 ha 1 in s2 fri pp treatment the highest operational cost in 2017 can be attributed to higher irrigation amounts applied as well as the aerial application of insecticide and fungicide the lower operational cost in all ni treatment in all three years was due to the reduction in cost of pumping of irrigation water from the groundwater source since the grain yield and productivity response to different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies varied and they also exhibited different response in different soil types the net income from these management practices treatments also varied between the years treatments and soil types similar to gross income nitrogen treatments had no significant impact p 0 05 on net income however there was a soil type and irrigation interaction effect on net income in 2015 due to similar grain yields in all treatments as well as no to very little amount of irrigation applications in both vri and fri treatments the effect of any treatment on net income was not significant p 0 05 however the effect of soil type on on net income was significant p 0 05 with greatest net income being observed in s1 silty clay loam soil table 8 in 2016 significant impact of irrigation and soil type was observed on net income the greatest net income was observed in fri which was significantly higher p 0 05 than vri and ni however ni and vri were not significantly different similar results of net income were obtained in 2017 growing season the net income ranged from 19 ha 1 to 886 ha 1 in 2015 from 148 ha 1 to 810 ha 1 in 2016 and from 151 ha 1 to 847 ha 1 in 2017 on average of three growing seasons net income was significantly higher in fri as compared with vri and ni in all soil types although the results of grain yield revealed that grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri in s1 the net income was significantly lower in vri in s1 as compared to fri overall averaging all three years all treatments had a positive net income at the end of the growing season with fri having substantially higher income than vri in most cases the net income values from fri frf fri pp vri frf vri vrf and vri pp treatments were then compared to the fixed capital cost of the irrigation system table 6 the npv for each treatment was evaluated in economics the net present value is the measurement of profit calculated by subtracting the present value of cash outflows from the irrigation and nitrogen management as well as other inputs related to crop production which also includes the initial cost of investment from the present value of all the cash inflows over a period in addition to npv irr is another indicator of the profitability of the investment the irr is a discount rate at which the npv of all cash flows from a particular investment becomes equal to zero in this research the average age of the irrigation system was assumed to be 20 years for which the npv and irr were calculated the other assumptions for this analysis are already presented in table 5 the npv and irr for each treatment in all soil types are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively these values were calculated using the separate total fixed costs of fri and vri systems table 6 since the fri vrf combination includes both systems fixed rate and variable rate technologies this combination fri vrf was excluded from npv calculations in fig 2 in real world operations in most if not all cases under irrigated conditions there is no reason to practice variable rate fertilizer management if fixed uniform rate irrigation management is practiced and most if not all fixed rate center pivot and other irrigation methods do not have the vrf capability to solely practice vrf management the maximum npv of 4 882 07 per ha was observed in fri frf treatment in s1 a similar npv of 4 821 5 per ha was observed in vri vrf in s1 however an irr of 18 in fri frf in s1 makes it a better investment compared to vri vrf in s1 in s2 and s3 the vri treatments had negative npv except for vri pp in s2 the negative npv indicates that the present value of the costs exceeds the present value of future profits at the assumed discount rate 5 following boyer et al 2015 the discount rate used in this analysis reflects the current common discount rate but this rate can vary between the regions if the discount rate increases the profitability of investment in irrigation for maize production will decrease also energy prices are not likely to decrease in the future and can impact the amount of water pumped by producers pfeiffer and lin 2014 boyer et al 2015 the aforementioned results suggest that maize grain prices will need to remain high and the discount rate will need to remain low for extended periods of time and grain yields for vri and vrf management will need to produce substantially greater yield with reduced inputs with respect to fri and frf for vri and vrf management practices to be competitive with fri and frf management under these experimental conditions furthermore for the vri and vrf strategies to be competitive with the fri and frf the cost of the vri and vrf technology will need to be significantly lower than the current investment costs comparing the soil types s1 had the highest npv followed by s2 and s3 the profitability of vri was limited by the high capital cost of the irrigation system with vri technology as well as lower grain yields obtained with vri treatments a decrease in the capital cost of the vri system could possibly help in improving the economic viability of vri management if vri technology and management results in increased yields with reduced input costs otherwise while there could be some environmental benefits of vri technology with the current high investment and operational cost of vri technology and the fact that the grain yields are not improved sufficiently in relation to fri management to offset the investment cost it is almost impossible for vri technology to be an economically viable technology or management practice for profitable economic net return which may explain extremely limited adoption of these technologies by producers in large scale production fields as it is the case with all other farm machinery and investment in large equipment the payback period of any irrigation system is also an important economic consideration for any farm operation the payback period when investment cost breaks even was estimated for each irrigation and nitrogen treatment for all soils and years fig 4 a payback period of less than or equal to 10 years was evaluated for fri management there were substantial differences in payback period between the irrigation methods fri and vri in the same soil type and for the same irrigation and or fertilizer management method between the soil types for example the payback period for fri frf is 6 years in s1 whereas it is 9 years in vri frf and 10 years in vri pp management for fri frf management the payback period was 6 years in s1 and this increased to 10 years in s3 indicating substantial impact of soil type through its impact on irrigation requirement and grain yield production on economics and payback period of the irrigation and fertilizer management strategy for the vri management the payback period was in most cases more than 27 years which is more than the assumed lifespan of the irrigation system 20 years in s3 none of the vri treatments at any fertilizer management resulted in a reasonable payback period the pay back period in vri irrigation system was less than 10 years for s1 however it was longer than the corresponding fri management it should be noted that npv of the equipment and the payback period could vary depending upon the field size under consideration to the best of the authors knowledge these are the first information and data from extensive research comprehensively investigated the soil type impact on economics and payback period of fri and vri under different fertilizer management strategies under different soil types for three years the results clearly suggest that soil type impact on grain yield and in turn its impact on economic feasibility of vri technology should be taken into account when considering investment into vri technology to be able to make more comprehensive farm economy net return analyses and for long and short term planning of investment vs return analyses other researchers reported similar findings in terms of lower or no profitability of vri technology as compared with traditional fixed uniform rate irrigation and nitrogen management in other states for different crop management climatic and soil conditions and management practices for example yao chi et al 2005 evaluated the economic feasibility of variable rate applications vra of irrigation water in maize production using data collected through field experiments in florence sc the net returns from vra applications were compared with fixed uniform rate irrigation applications their results indicated that the vra applications yielded larger net returns than the uniform applications however the variable rate technologies vrt applications require additional equipment and control they reported that the benefits of reduced irrigation water costs plus the value of increased yields must be greater than the additional costs associated with the vrt applications for vrt to be a viable option for the commercial vra system the additional costs of vrt are more than the benefits of using vrt they concluded that at present the vrt application of irrigation water is not profitable as compared with uniform applications for south carolina they further suggested that the costs of these equipment and controls are declining over time furthermore the costs would be much smaller when vrt is widely adopted by producers and these equipment and controls are mass produced king et al 2006 evaluated the potential for site specific irrigation management ssim in terms of increasing yield and quality of potatoes relative to conventional uniform irrigation management cuim for two years in idaho tuber yield distributions trended 4 greater under site specific irrigation management but were not significantly different p 0 05 total tuber yield per unit of water applied from irrigation and precipitation was 4 greater in 2001 and 6 greater in 2002 under ssim based on a local tuber quality adjusted potato processing contract price structure the trend in gross income averaged across the field site was 159 ha 65 acre greater with ssim however they reported that this increase in gross income is likely about half the actual cost of commercial site specific irrigation technology they concluded that the economic benefit of ssim needs to be increased or realized for other crops in the rotation for it to be an economically viable technology in potato production systems the economic analyses presented in this research and others can vary between the years cropping systems region climatic conditions field size fuel source used for irrigation water withdrawal and other factors for example in a comprehensive research boyer et al 2015 investigated the npv of investing in a center pivot irrigation system for maize production in western tennessee using experimental data and input variables as well as cost from field research conducted near milan tennessee while the authors did not compare fri and vri practices and did not study soil type impact they comprehensively accounted for three different field sizes and two energy sources diesel and electric for irrigation water withdrawal and evaluated how change in maize prices impact the profitability of irrigated maize as compared with rainfed production for long term 2006 2013 they estimated yield response functions to n for rainfed and irrigated maize and used the estimated optimal yields and n fertilization rates for rainfed and irrigated maize to estimate the economic returns from investing in irrigation they observed that maize yield increased and stabilized with irrigation in their experimental conditions on average irrigation increased maize yield by 4 14 ton ha 1 prior to 2006 the expected npv for irrigating maize was negative across all field sizes and energy sources however post 2006 the expected npv was positive for fields of 50 ha or larger that used either diesel or electric power the probability of npv being positive for fields of 50 ha or larger which used either diesel or electric power ranged between 3 and 31 for prices prevailing before 2006 and increased to between 87 and 100 for prices prevailing from 2006 to 2013 the expected npv for using electric power was higher than for diesel power for all fields of 50 ha or larger they suggested that if the maize grain price follows food and agricultural policy research institute fapri 2012 projections in tennessee and other humid regions of the united states producers will likely continue investing in irrigation systems for maize production however they also suggested that maize prices will need to stay high for extended periods of time for irrigated production to remain profitable after investment in center pivot irrigation under tennessee growing conditions thus investment in center pivot irrigation may be a risky proposition for tennessee producers if maize prices do not remain high 4 summary and conclusions economic analyses of fri and vri under different nitrogen management practices were conducted using field research measured data input cost grain price and other variables and factors overall both irrigation treatments vri and fri increased the grain yield as compared with no irrigation significant differences in the grain yield between vri and fri management were observed in s2 and s3 soil types with fri being greater than vri however in s1 grain yield between vri and fri management was not significantly different in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons net income from fri management was significantly greater than vri management in all soil types also pooled data for three growing seasons showed significantly greater net income in fri management than vri nitrogen treatments had no effect on net income in any of the growing seasons comparing the soil types s1 create silt loam resulted in maximum net income for all treatments as compared with s2 hastings silty clay loam and s3 hastings silt loam in terms of npv and irr the maximum values of 4 882 07 per ha and 18 respectively were observed for fri frf treatment in s1 the vri treatments had negative npv in s2 and s3 except for vri pp in s2 which means that the present value of the costs under these treatments exceeded the present value of profits at the assumed discount rate 5 a payback period of less than or equal to 10 years was determined for all fri management treatments whereas for vri management payback period was in most cases more than 27 years which is more than the assumed lifespan of an irrigation system 20 years while the pay back period for the vri irrigation system was less than 10 years for s1 it was still much longer than the corresponding fri management treatments in the same soil in conclusion the results of this research indicate that soil types as well as irrigation and nitrogen management practices play a critical role in overall farm economics with no evidence of increased grain yield and reduction in input variables coupled with high capital costs associated with vri technology may constitute impediments of its economic feasibility and profitability as well as its adoptability in production fields for maize production under these experimental conditions our results suggest that maize grain prices will need to remain high and the discount rate will need to remain low throughout the lifespan of the irrigation system and grain yields for vri and vrf management will need to produce substantially greater yield with reduced inputs with respect to fri and frf for vri and vrf management practices to be competitive with fri and frf management the research results can be beneficial in aiding growers and their advisors managers and other agricultural and irrigation professionals in terms of assessing evaluating and even forecasting the profitability and economic viability of different irrigation management practices especially for variable rate irrigation management under different nitrogen management conditions in different soil

significantly higher than vri management in all soil types the nitrogen treatments did not affect net income in any of the growing seasons the fri management strategy had a positive npv in all soil

averaging all three years and three soils fri had a substantially higher net income than vri in most cases the maximum npv of 4 882 07 per ha and maximum irr of 18 was observed in fri frf treatment a payback period of 10 years was determined for all fri management treatments while the payback period for vri management in most cases was more than 27 years while the pay back period in vri irrigation

variable rate technology 1 introduction irrigated agriculture has abetted in stabilizing many communities of the world by permitting human habitation and providing opportunities for economic advancements evans and sadler 2008 irmak and mutiibwa 2009a out of the world s total cultivated lands approximately 20 are irrigated farmlands which produce approximately 40 of world s food and fiber fereres and connor 2004 evans et al 2013 irmak and mutiibwa 2009a 2009b despite its vitality irrigated agriculture is facing important challenges due to meeting the food and fiber demand of rapidly increasing human population and competition for freshwater resources according to the united nations estimation to meet the increasing population s food demands land under cultivation must increase by 40 and the amount of water allocated to irrigation must increase by 14 by 2030 however land area under irrigated agriculture and water needed for irrigation are being depleted or reallocated which is creating a dire and unbalanced situation for crop production therefore there is a pressing need for some significant changes and novel approaches in agricultural water management to address the issue of water shortages in agriculture one of the solutions to this problem is the effective irrigation management strategies that use water and other inputs i e fertilizers efficiently and increase crop productivity at the same time irmak and mutiibwa 2009a 2009b the invention of the center pivot irrigation systems in the 1950s was one of the most significant mechanical innovations in agriculture after 70 years of its innovation the center pivot or linear move sprinkler irrigation systems and associated management practices have advanced substantially and is continuously being evolved to better meet the current requirements of effective agricultural crop production in terms of irrigation needs with an overall goal of uniform and economic irrigation across the field with a specific application depth in addition to irrigation center pivot and linear move systems have also been used for fertilizer applications fertigation over the years with the advent of precision agriculture pa technology the knowledge and understanding about the variability that may exists within a field has increased now the challenge is how to address this variability in terms of irrigation water and fertilizer applications to improve crop productivity the pa technology has been adapted to a variety of field practices including planting fertilizer application pest management herbicide application with a basic characteristic of site specific treatment to separate portions of a field through the advent and merging of several technologies including global positioning systems gps geographical information systems gis automatic controls proximal and remote sensing telecommunications and advanced computer knowledge zhang et al 2002 these innovations have facilitated the implementation of variable water application methods with sprinkler irrigation systems for site specific management the interest in the concept of variable rate management especially variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf sharma and irmak 2020a to manage spatial and temporal variabilities within an agricultural field has increased due to its expected and or assumed potential of improving the crop water productivity most of this interest however remain within the research community and private industry as adoption of vri technology by farmers in production fields is extremely limited adoption of vrf technology is even less than vri for any new technology to be adopted by the producers the benefits including management and environmental benefits as well as costs and profit associated with the technology requirements must be investigated and presented and covered from the incremental revenue from crop yields extremely limited research has been carried out to investigate the cost effectiveness of vri and vrf as compared with traditional fixed uniform rate irrigation fri and fixed uniform rate fertilizer management frf and pre plant pp nitrogen management using measured field data most of the currently available limited studies focused on using modeling approach for such analyses which may not provide reasonable or realistic estimates as models may not be able to account for real world challenges involved in investigating the economics and relationships between vri vrf fri frf and pp nitrogen management practices furthermore how such economic analyses may exhibit variations for different soil types is essentially unknown nijbroek et al 2003 used a crop model to compare gross margin of spatially variable irrigation management and uniform irrigation management for a soybean field 9 94 ha in the coastal plain area the simulation process was applied to 25 years of weather data to determine the feasibility of spatially variable irrigation management they reported that spatially variable irrigation resulted in the best management option with 16 ha 1 greater gross margin however they did not include the cost of equipment associated with spatially variable irrigation in computing the gross margin which could be much greater than 16 ha 1 resulting in more economic returns from uniform irrigation king et al 2006 studied the potential of site specific irrigation management ssim to increase crop yield quality and economic returns in potatoes in a two year field study it was found that the gross income was 159 ha 1 greater for ssim than in conventional uniform irrigation management cuim potato tuber yield was also 4 and 6 greater under ssim in 2001 and 2002 respectively than in cuim dejonge et al 2007 simulated three irrigation scenarios no irrigation uniform irrigation and precision irrigation to determine the potential yield improvements with irrigation method and to compare the economic benefits of improved yield with capital costs of irrigation systems in iowa their results showed lower yields and lower economic benefits with precision irrigation as compared with uniform irrigation in addition to irrigation studies reported profits ranging from none to marginal and substantial when site specific nitrogen management is practiced yang et al 2001 examined the differences in yield and economic returns between uniform and variable rate fertilizer applications the variable rate treatment resulted in significantly higher yields than the uniform nitrogen n and phosphorus p treatment for both years 400 kg ha higher in 1997 and 338 kg ha higher in 1998 also variable rate treatment had positive relative economic returns over the uniform n and p treatment 27 ha in 1997 and 23 ha in 1998 however they did not take into consideration the equipment control units management soil sampling and other costs associated with variable rate treatment the returns would be much lower or even negative if all these costs including soil sampling and soil analyses equipment and data analysis associated with variable rate application were considered bronson et al 2006 conducted a 3 year experiment on a 14 ha area within a 48 ha center pivot irrigated field in a terminated rye conservation tillage cotton system to assess lint yield response to irrigation levels and to compare the effects of variable rate n blanket rate n and zero n on lint yields at varying irrigation levels and landscape positions their results indicated more consistent lint yield response in variable rate n than blanket rate n in all years however when considering the costs of implementing variable rate n management the dollar returns to n fertilizer were not favorable for variable rate fertilization in 2 out of 3 years thus while in some of the studies variable management was proven to increase the yield the variable management was unable to produce greater economic returns than uniform management babcock and pautsch 1998 developed a model based on the yield potential of various soil types in 12 iowa counties and estimated the potential value of switching from uniform to variable fertilizer rates for maize production results indicated only modest increases in the gross returns over fertilizer costs ranging from 7 43 to 1 52 per 0 404 ha they found that the net profitability of variable rate technology is sensitive to the per area costs of moving to a variable rate technology under the assumptions of the model applying variable rates increased yield only by 3 31 kg per 0 404 ha and would reduce fertilizer costs by 1 19 to 6 83 per 0 404 ha when the variable rate technology systems initial cost and other associated application and maintenance costs are considered these increases in grain yield and minimal reduction in fertilizer application would not result in any financial benefit to the farm net income from variable rate technology in midwestern states extensive nitrogen management and irrigation is practiced in a very large land area in nebraska around 90 of total land area 77 421 mi² or 200 520 km2 is under agriculture of which 44 is under irrigation usda nass 2014 or approximately 3 5 million ha with such a large area dedicated to agriculture and irrigation crop production is a critical part of nebraska s economy thompson et al 2012 reported an economic impact of agriculture as high as 42 of nebraska s economy with irrigated crops contributing more than 50 of that percentage in addition to water crops substantially rely on n fertilizers for higher yields thus heavily influencing the economic results for most crops including maize thompson et al 2000 about 80 85 of the irrigated land area in nebraska is irrigated with center pivot systems which should make this area suitable for the development and adoption of vri technology because of already existing platforms extensive irrigated land area four major center pivot manuscfatures being located in nebraska as well as the existence of all other irrigation related industry such as irrigation pump motor well pipe control automation etc however adoption of site specific irrigation and nitrogen management technologies and strategies requires quantification analysees and undrstanding of such technologies and strategies economic feasibility which is a significant knowledge gap in irrigation science and engineering discpline it is very important and necessary to understand the economics of variable rate management of water and nitrogen fertilizer application in comparison with currently dominant conventional fixed uniform water and fertilizer application thus carefully designed and carried out field research is critical to more accurately determine the economics of these management practices the specific objectives of this research were to conduct economic comparisons of maize production under fixed uniform rate irrigation fri with variable rate irrigation vri and no irrigation ni settings with fixed

table 1 to determine the soil properties and nitrogen amount of all soil properties for each plot extensive soil sampling was conducted from 42 locations within the 2 3 ha experimental field in april before planting of each year to create spatially interpolated maps for various soil properties in arcgis extract by mask tool was used to extract the soil physical properties i e field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp organic matter content omc soil texture and soil nitrate n for each plot was determined based on which irrigation and nitrogen amounts should be applied were determined sharma and irmak 2020a 2 2 irrigation and nitrogen management the watermark granular matrix sensors wgms irrometer co riverside ca installed at four depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m in 20 plots two replications of each treatment in each soil type were used for irrigation management wgms were used to monitor smp kpa on an hourly basis and hourly data were then converted to volumetric soil water content vswc using pre determined soil water retention curves for each soil type by accounting for vertical variability in soil layers for all soil types for the research site that were developed by irmak 2019 when horizontal and vertical soil variability is considered in total there were six soil types in the research field silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam thus the experimental field provided a unique opportunity to truly investigate vri and vrf management impacts on crop productivity and associated economic implications many of the vri studies reported in the literature were not carried out in fields that have spatial variability which may result in incomplete analyses and conclusions in terms of crops productivity and economic response to vri the vswc was then multiplied by the representative depth intervals to determine the total soil water stored in each depth and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 2 m soil profile for each plot soil water holding capacity swhc was calculated by subtracting soil water at pwp from soil water at fc for each plot management allowable depletion mad for all plots was taken as 40 of swhc irrigation for both fri and vri treatments was triggered whenever total soil water stored in the 0 0 90 m profile as measured by watermark sensors fell below this 40 threshold however the amount of irrigation per irrigation event for fri plots was fixed to be 25 4 mm each time any of the fri plots needed irrigation based on soil moisture sensor information all fri plots were irrigated with 25 4 mm of irrigation depth considering no variability in the field and assuming that crops in fri plots respond in the same manner at all locations in the field this is the most common operation that producers practice in nebraska and other midwestern states in the united states a total of 1 7 and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the total seasonal irrigation amounts for all growing seasons are presented in table 2 for vri plots irrigation amounts were applied to bring the soil water to maintain approximately 90 of swhc only those plots which needed irrigation calculated according to the measured soil moisture readings from wmgs were irrigated for vri plots by considering each soil layer s physical properties for each soil type thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot differed substantially sharma and irmak 2020a such vri practice is extensive but it is important to account for soil s vertical variability in irrigation requirements calculations to ensure proper practice of vri management most studies reported in the literature did not account for this critical aspect of vri three n fertilizer treatments were imposed under each irrigation management in each soil type i frf vrf and iii pp n fertilizer management for the pp treatment a total of 246 kg ha of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 was applied in 2015 2016 and 2017 before planting in season fertilizer was applied to vrf and frf treatments using a linear move sprinkler irrigation system that is equipped with advanced variable rate irrigation and fertilizer management technologies the n fertilizer rate requirement for each vrf plot was calculated every growing season from soil samples data using n recommendation procedure proposed by shapiro et al 2008 these fertilizer requirements for maize were based on the expected targeted yield organic matter content and current soil nitrate n levels based on this procedure for vrf treatment on average 217 234 and 221 kg ha 1 n fertilizer were applied in fri vri and ni treatments respectively in 2015 in 2016 these values were 205 kg ha 1 206 kg ha 1 and 202 kg ha 1 respectively in 2017 they were 172 kg ha 1 161 kg ha 1 and 168 kg ha 1 respectively a constant rate of 246 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied to all frf plots the n fertilizer application was divided in two applications in 2016 and 2017 growing season half of the required n was applied at the vegetative growth stage of v2 and the other half was applied at v8 stage shapiro et al 2008 for both vrf and frf plots 2 3 economic analyses economic analyses of different irrigation and fertilizer management treatments were conducted based on net present value npv internal rate of return irr gross income and net farm return income on a per hectare ha basis a full scale 7 span center pivot irrigation system generally used in a 65 ha field was considered for calculating the fixed cost per ha of the irrigation system calculations were based mainly on the final grain yield the market price for maize irrigation and fertilizer application management costs other management and product such as herbicides pesticides fuel type and amount for irrigation water withdrawal etc application costs economic analyses were conducted for each year separately gross income and net income for all irrigation and nitrogen combination treatments in three soil types for three growing seasons were calculated gross income was calculated using the market maize grain price for each growing season in the research area table 3 net income was calculated by subtracting the operational costs from the gross income operational costs for each treatment was calculated by considering the individual cost of each product that was applied to each treatment plots replications table 1 throughout each growing season plus the application equipment and machinery cost averaged over the research period assuming diesel price of 0 57 per liter table 4 an irrigation cost of 4 96 per ha cm was used which was calculated using the nebraska pumping plant performance criteria npppc martin et al 2011 with an outlet pressure of 138 kpa a lift depth to groundwater of 32 m and repair and maintenance cost of 2 11 per ha cm the electricity cost used for the calculations was taken as 0 123 per kwh the net income analysis did not consider the hauling and drying costs of the grain due to substantial variability in these processes the costs of irrigation systems were them compared with the net incomes from each of the irrigation treatment fri and vri under different nitrogen management treatments frf vrf and pp nitrogen all costs and profits were compared on a us dollar per ha basis another financial analysis was carried out in which capital costs of linear move irrigation systems with and without vri technology was compared in terms of the payback period the calculated net income for each irrigation management was further utilized to calculate the pay back period for two irrigation systems especially if the investment could be recovered within the lifespan of the irrigation system since vrf in fri treatment is not feasible with a typical center pivot or linear move irrigation system that is not equipped with a vri technology the fri vrf combination was not considered in the economic analyses for the economic analysis several assumptions that were made and considered in the calculations are shown in table 5 to determine the net income per ha a moving average approach of actual net income for three experimental years was considered this was also done to accommodate the seasonality throughout the assumed lifespan of the equipment and irrigation system for the economic analyses the average initial investment of the irrigation system and necessary vri technology salvage value of the system total capital investment total fixed cost and net present value were calculated by considering numerous factors variables including interest rate production input cost longevity life of the system insurance cost ownership cost salvage value etc the input variables include planting harvesting irrigation and nitrogen management cultivation pesticide applications etc the average initial investment cost of the irrigation system per ha was calculated by dividing the total initial investment by average farm size it was assumed that the equipment would salvage for 10 its value at the end of its longevity the total capital cost per ha for each equipment table 6 was calculated by subtracting per ha average salvage value from the initial investment using the following steps i average initial investment per ha initial investment average farm size ii salvage value 10 x initial investment iii total capital investment per ha average initial investment per ha salvage value iv total fixed cost total capital cost total ownership cost the annual ownership cost was calculated by including interest and equipment insurance cost which were calculated by assuming an annual compound interest and insurance rate at 5 and 0 5 respectively table 6 sum of the total capital cost and total cost of ownership provided the total fixed cost for respective equipment table 6 the npv discounted at 5 annual compound rate of the respective equipment was calculated for each soil type under different treatments net present value was then determined as the difference between the present values of cash inflows and outflows of the operation a positive npv indicates that the investment in equipment proved profitable within the life span of the equipment a negative npv indicates that the investment will result in a net loss npv was calculated using the standard financial formula 2 n p v c o c 1 1 r c 2 1 r 2 c t 1 r t where co is initial investment c is cash flow r is discount rate and t is time in general increase in grain prices can increase the probability of npv being positive for irrigation investment regardless whether the irrigation system has a vri technology or not due to substantial increase in grain yield as a result of irrigation as compared with rainfed crop production while irrigation in most cases can result in substantial grain yield increase this increase can vary substantially depending on numerous factors including soil and crop management climatic conditions especially in season precipitation timing and amount nitrogen management and other factors which can all influence the economic benefits of investment in irrigation technology both vri and fri to complement the npv values irr was calculated for various treatments the irr represents the rate of return at which npv of the investment would become zero a higher irr helps identifying best investments out of all the investments with positive npv 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on maize grain yield the grain yield responses to irrigation and nitrogen management strategies under different soil types were used as critical components of the economic analyses maize grain yields for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons for each treatment are presented in table 7 and were discussed in sharma and irmak 2020b briefly sharma and irmak 2020b reported that maize grain yield adjusted to 15 5 grain moisture content ranged from 5 8 tons ha 1 to 11 6 tons ha 1 in 2015 5 6 ton ha 1 to 14 8 ton ha 1 in 2016 and 7 1 ton ha 1 to 15 4 ton ha 1 in 2017 grain yields were significantly different p 0 05 between soil types in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and vri had greater variability in grain yield crop water use and crop water productivity as compared with fri soil type s1 had the highest grain p 0 05 yield followed by s2 and s3 there was no significant yield difference among irrigation treatments in 2015 in any of the soil type in 2016 fri in s1 had the highest grain yield 14 1 tons ha 1 and the lowest yield occurred in s2 the ni treatment 6 2 ton ha 1 a significant effect p 0 05 of soil type was observed in 2016 growing season yield in s1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than s2 and s3 in 2016 comparing irrigation levels in each soil type yield in fri was not significantly different p 0 05 from vri in s1 however significantly higher than vri and ni in s2 and s3 table 7 similar results were obtained in 2017 where fri treatment had the highest grain yield 14 3 ton ha 1 followed by vri 10 6 ton ha 1 and ni 9 4 ton ha 1 averaged over three soil types grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri treatment in s1 however in s2 and s3 yield in fri was 43 and 55 higher than vri p 0 05 respectively all these different responses of grain yield to treatments within a growing season as well as their inter annual variations were accounted for when determining the economics of different irrigation and nitrogen management practices as all analyses were done on a growing season basis 3 2 economics of irrigation and nitrogen management treatments the operational cost gross income and net income for each irrigation and fertilizer management treatment are presented in tables 8 9 10 and 11 for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons and for the pooled data for all years respectively since gross income was calculated from maize grain yield the effect of various treatments on gross income would be the same as the effect on grain yield therefore nitrogen treatment had no significant effect on gross income however there was an interacting effect of irrigation and soil type on gross income in 2015 the gross income ranged from 802 ha 1 in s3 vri vrf treatment to 1601 ha 1 in s1 vri vrf treatment table 8 the lowest and highest values were observed in the same irrigation and nitrogen management combination treatment vri vrf which was due to soil type having a significant impact on grain yield and this effect influenced the gross income moreover variability in grain yield was highest in vri sharma and irmak 2020b and this resulted in considerable variation in gross income in vri treatment within and among soil types as compared with gross income for fri treatments in 2016 the gross income varied from 675 ha 1 in s2 ni no nitrogen treatment to 1772 ha 1 in s1 fri frf treatment table 9 whereas in 2017 the range was 683 ha 1 in s3 vri vrf to 1936 ha 1 s2 fri pp table 10 the lower gross income in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 was due to the lower grain yields in that growing season than in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the operational and soil crop irrigation and nitrogen management costs also varied year to year due to differences in the product costs as well as the amount of the products applied due to different insect and disease pressure the 2017 growing season had the greatest operational cost ranging from 734 ha 1 in s2 ni no nitrogen treatment to 1092 ha 1 in s2 fri pp treatment the highest operational cost in 2017 can be attributed to higher irrigation amounts applied as well as the aerial application of insecticide and fungicide the lower operational cost in all ni treatment in all three years was due to the reduction in cost of pumping of irrigation water from the groundwater source since the grain yield and productivity response to different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies varied and they also exhibited different response in different soil types the net income from these management practices treatments also varied between the years treatments and soil types similar to gross income nitrogen treatments had no significant impact p 0 05 on net income however there was a soil type and irrigation interaction effect on net income in 2015 due to similar grain yields in all treatments as well as no to very little amount of irrigation applications in both vri and fri treatments the effect of any treatment on net income was not significant p 0 05 however the effect of soil type on on net income was significant p 0 05 with greatest net income being observed in s1 silty clay loam soil table 8 in 2016 significant impact of irrigation and soil type was observed on net income the greatest net income was observed in fri which was significantly higher p 0 05 than vri and ni however ni and vri were not significantly different similar results of net income were obtained in 2017 growing season the net income ranged from 19 ha 1 to 886 ha 1 in 2015 from 148 ha 1 to 810 ha 1 in 2016 and from 151 ha 1 to 847 ha 1 in 2017 on average of three growing seasons net income was significantly higher in fri as compared with vri and ni in all soil types although the results of grain yield revealed that grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri in s1 the net income was significantly lower in vri in s1 as compared to fri overall averaging all three years all treatments had a positive net income at the end of the growing season with fri having substantially higher income than vri in most cases the net income values from fri frf fri pp vri frf vri vrf and vri pp treatments were then compared to the fixed capital cost of the irrigation system table 6 the npv for each treatment was evaluated in economics the net present value is the measurement of profit calculated by subtracting the present value of cash outflows from the irrigation and nitrogen management as well as other inputs related to crop production which also includes the initial cost of investment from the present value of all the cash inflows over a period in addition to npv irr is another indicator of the profitability of the investment the irr is a discount rate at which the npv of all cash flows from a particular investment becomes equal to zero in this research the average age of the irrigation system was assumed to be 20 years for which the npv and irr were calculated the other assumptions for this analysis are already presented in table 5 the npv and irr for each treatment in all soil types are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively these values were calculated using the separate total fixed costs of fri and vri systems table 6 since the fri vrf combination includes both systems fixed rate and variable rate technologies this combination fri vrf was excluded from npv calculations in fig 2 in real world operations in most if not all cases under irrigated conditions there is no reason to practice variable rate fertilizer management if fixed uniform rate irrigation management is practiced and most if not all fixed rate center pivot and other irrigation methods do not have the vrf capability to solely practice vrf management the maximum npv of 4 882 07 per ha was observed in fri frf treatment in s1 a similar npv of 4 821 5 per ha was observed in vri vrf in s1 however an irr of 18 in fri frf in s1 makes it a better investment compared to vri vrf in s1 in s2 and s3 the vri treatments had negative npv except for vri pp in s2 the negative npv indicates that the present value of the costs exceeds the present value of future profits at the assumed discount rate 5 following boyer et al 2015 the discount rate used in this analysis reflects the current common discount rate but this rate can vary between the regions if the discount rate increases the profitability of investment in irrigation for maize production will decrease also energy prices are not likely to decrease in the future and can impact the amount of water pumped by producers pfeiffer and lin 2014 boyer et al 2015 the aforementioned results suggest that maize grain prices will need to remain high and the discount rate will need to remain low for extended periods of time and grain yields for vri and vrf management will need to produce substantially greater yield with reduced inputs with respect to fri and frf for vri and vrf management practices to be competitive with fri and frf management under these experimental conditions furthermore for the vri and vrf strategies to be competitive with the fri and frf the cost of the vri and vrf technology will need to be significantly lower than the current investment costs comparing the soil types s1 had the highest npv followed by s2 and s3 the profitability of vri was limited by the high capital cost of the irrigation system with vri technology as well as lower grain yields obtained with vri treatments a decrease in the capital cost of the vri system could possibly help in improving the economic viability of vri management if vri technology and management results in increased yields with reduced input costs otherwise while there could be some environmental benefits of vri technology with the current high investment and operational cost of vri technology and the fact that the grain yields are not improved sufficiently in relation to fri management to offset the investment cost it is almost impossible for vri technology to be an economically viable technology or management practice for profitable economic net return which may explain extremely limited adoption of these technologies by producers in large scale production fields as it is the case with all other farm machinery and investment in large equipment the payback period of any irrigation system is also an important economic consideration for any farm operation the payback period when investment cost breaks even was estimated for each irrigation and nitrogen treatment for all soils and years fig 4 a payback period of less than or equal to 10 years was evaluated for fri management there were substantial differences in payback period between the irrigation methods fri and vri in the same soil type and for the same irrigation and or fertilizer management method between the soil types for example the payback period for fri frf is 6 years in s1 whereas it is 9 years in vri frf and 10 years in vri pp management for fri frf management the payback period was 6 years in s1 and this increased to 10 years in s3 indicating substantial impact of soil type through its impact on irrigation requirement and grain yield production on economics and payback period of the irrigation and fertilizer management strategy for the vri management the payback period was in most cases more than 27 years which is more than the assumed lifespan of the irrigation system 20 years in s3 none of the vri treatments at any fertilizer management resulted in a reasonable payback period the pay back period in vri irrigation system was less than 10 years for s1 however it was longer than the corresponding fri management it should be noted that npv of the equipment and the payback period could vary depending upon the field size under consideration to the best of the authors knowledge these are the first information and data from extensive research comprehensively investigated the soil type impact on economics and payback period of fri and vri under different fertilizer management strategies under different soil types for three years the results clearly suggest that soil type impact on grain yield and in turn its impact on economic feasibility of vri technology should be taken into account when considering investment into vri technology to be able to make more comprehensive farm economy net return analyses and for long and short term planning of investment vs return analyses other researchers reported similar findings in terms of lower or no profitability of vri technology as compared with traditional fixed uniform rate irrigation and nitrogen management in other states for different crop management climatic and soil conditions and management practices for example yao chi et al 2005 evaluated the economic feasibility of variable rate applications vra of irrigation water in maize production using data collected through field experiments in florence sc the net returns from vra applications were compared with fixed uniform rate irrigation applications their results indicated that the vra applications yielded larger net returns than the uniform applications however the variable rate technologies vrt applications require additional equipment and control they reported that the benefits of reduced irrigation water costs plus the value of increased yields must be greater than the additional costs associated with the vrt applications for vrt to be a viable option for the commercial vra system the additional costs of vrt are more than the benefits of using vrt they concluded that at present the vrt application of irrigation water is not profitable as compared with uniform applications for south carolina they further suggested that the costs of these equipment and controls are declining over time furthermore the costs would be much smaller when vrt is widely adopted by producers and these equipment and controls are mass produced king et al 2006 evaluated the potential for site specific irrigation management ssim in terms of increasing yield and quality of potatoes relative to conventional uniform irrigation management cuim for two years in idaho tuber yield distributions trended 4 greater under site specific irrigation management but were not significantly different p 0 05 total tuber yield per unit of water applied from irrigation and precipitation was 4 greater in 2001 and 6 greater in 2002 under ssim based on a local tuber quality adjusted potato processing contract price structure the trend in gross income averaged across the field site was 159 ha 65 acre greater with ssim however they reported that this increase in gross income is likely about half the actual cost of commercial site specific irrigation technology they concluded that the economic benefit of ssim needs to be increased or realized for other crops in the rotation for it to be an economically viable technology in potato production systems the economic analyses presented in this research and others can vary between the years cropping systems region climatic conditions field size fuel source used for irrigation water withdrawal and other factors for example in a comprehensive research boyer et al 2015 investigated the npv of investing in a center pivot irrigation system for maize production in western tennessee using experimental data and input variables as well as cost from field research conducted near milan tennessee while the authors did not compare fri and vri practices and did not study soil type impact they comprehensively accounted for three different field sizes and two energy sources diesel and electric for irrigation water withdrawal and evaluated how change in maize prices impact the profitability of irrigated maize as compared with rainfed production for long term 2006 2013 they estimated yield response functions to n for rainfed and irrigated maize and used the estimated optimal yields and n fertilization rates for rainfed and irrigated maize to estimate the economic returns from investing in irrigation they observed that maize yield increased and stabilized with irrigation in their experimental conditions on average irrigation increased maize yield by 4 14 ton ha 1 prior to 2006 the expected npv for irrigating maize was negative across all field sizes and energy sources however post 2006 the expected npv was positive for fields of 50 ha or larger that used either diesel or electric power the probability of npv being positive for fields of 50 ha or larger which used either diesel or electric power ranged between 3 and 31 for prices prevailing before 2006 and increased to between 87 and 100 for prices prevailing from 2006 to 2013 the expected npv for using electric power was higher than for diesel power for all fields of 50 ha or larger they suggested that if the maize grain price follows food and agricultural policy research institute fapri 2012 projections in tennessee and other humid regions of the united states producers will likely continue investing in irrigation systems for maize production however they also suggested that maize prices will need to stay high for extended periods of time for irrigated production to remain profitable after investment in center pivot irrigation under tennessee growing conditions thus investment in center pivot irrigation may be a risky proposition for tennessee producers if maize prices do not remain high 4 summary and conclusions economic analyses of fri and vri under different nitrogen management practices were conducted using field research measured data input cost grain price and other variables and factors overall both irrigation treatments vri and fri increased the grain yield as compared with no irrigation significant differences in the grain yield between vri and fri management were observed in s2 and s3 soil types with fri being greater than vri however in s1 grain yield between vri and fri management was not significantly different in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons net income from fri management was significantly greater than vri management in all soil types also pooled data for three growing seasons showed significantly greater net income in fri management than vri nitrogen treatments had no effect on net income in any of the growing seasons comparing the soil types s1 create silt loam resulted in maximum net income for all treatments as compared with s2 hastings silty clay loam and s3 hastings silt loam in terms of npv and irr the maximum values of 4 882 07 per ha and 18 respectively were observed for fri frf treatment in s1 the vri treatments had negative npv in s2 and s3 except for vri pp in s2 which means that the present value of the costs under these treatments exceeded the present value of profits at the assumed discount rate 5 a payback period of less than or equal to 10 years was determined for all fri management treatments whereas for vri management payback period was in most cases more than 27 years which is more than the assumed lifespan of an irrigation system 20 years while the pay back period for the vri irrigation system was less than 10 years for s1 it was still much longer than the corresponding fri management treatments in the same soil in conclusion the results of this research indicate that soil types as well as irrigation and nitrogen management practices play a critical role in overall farm economics with no evidence of increased grain yield and reduction in input variables coupled with high capital costs associated with vri technology may constitute impediments of its economic feasibility and profitability as well as its adoptability in production fields for maize production under these experimental conditions our results suggest that maize grain prices will need to remain high and the discount rate will need to remain low throughout the lifespan of the irrigation system and grain yields for vri and vrf management will need to produce substantially greater yield with reduced inputs with respect to fri and frf for vri and vrf management practices to be competitive with fri and frf management the research results can be beneficial in aiding growers and their advisors managers and other agricultural and irrigation professionals in terms of assessing evaluating and even forecasting the profitability and economic viability of different irrigation management practices especially for variable rate irrigation management under different nitrogen management conditions in different soil
