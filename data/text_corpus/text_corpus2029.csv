10145,the water footprint theory has provided an effective approach for evaluating the utilization of freshwater resources in agricultural production however there are few studies have explored the dynamic coupling relationship between water footprint and socioeconomic factors especially from the perspective of regional ecological features therefore the water footprint method was used to investigate the dynamic evolution of agricultural water consumption from 2005 to 2015 in zhangjiakou an extremely water scarce city which is divided into six ecological zones i ii iii iv v and vi then mathematical models such as the gini coefficient were first employed to evaluate the spatiotemporal matching characteristics of agricultural water footprint and socioeconomic factors the results show that 1 the agricultural water footprint increased by 1 69 109 m3 in zhangjiakou of which the animal products water footprint increased by 1 59 109 m3 accounting for 94 2 cereals had always been the major contributors to crop water footprint with an increasing contribution rate from 49 to 54 milk and egg products were the main drivers for the increasing water footprint of animal products with a total contribution rate increased from 46 to 55 meanwhile the spatial differentiation was significant the contribution rate of the cereal water footprint was less than 50 in counties of high altitude ecological zones i ii and iv in 2015 while it was higher than 50 in counties of low altitude ecological zones iii v and vi 3 the per unit area water footprint in counties of the ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level while per capita water footprint and per unit output value water footprint were far below it indicating agricultural structure optimization requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple socioeconomic factors this study is expected to provide policy makers with scientific guidance that is conducive to agricultural water conservation and ecological zone planning keywords water footprint socioeconomic factors ecological functional zone gini coefficient zhangjiakou city 1 introduction water resources are one of the most indispensable natural resources and an important basis for the healthy and sustainable development of the regional human and natural systems zhang et al 2020 with the rapid development of the global economy the explosive population growth and the acceleration of urbanization the scale and intensity of human activities continue to increase leading to an unprecedented increase of water demand in socioeconomic systems chouchane et al 2018 more and more countries and regions are facing severe challenges of water shortage in all water consumption sectors agriculture production is the major responsible for water use and water stress which accounts for more than 70 of total freshwater consumption worldwide lovarelli et al 2016 therefore with the impact of climate change on the distribution of water resources and the growth cycle of crops bhave et al 2018 how to achieve the conservation of agricultural water use based on ensuring food security has become a major issue that needs to be solved globally in the 21st century li et al 2019 piao et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 especially in countries and regions where water resources are severely lacking and agriculture is highly dependent on irrigation to measure the actual consumption of water condensed in products and services in human activities virtual water was first introduced by allan et al 1998 on this basis for a better understanding of the appropriation of natural capital in terms of the water volumes consumed by various human activities the concept of water footprint wf was proposed by hoekstra hoekstra and chapagain 2003 due to the combination of physical water and virtual water the water footprint provides a comprehensive and effective approach for evaluating the utilization of freshwater resources especially in agriculture production bazrafshan et al 2019 chu et al 2017 tuninetti et al 2015 according to the meaning and role of the water footprint it contains three components blue green and gray water footprint hoekstra and zhuo 2017 zeng et al 2012 blue water footprint refers to the consumption of surface and groundwater during the entire production process green water footprint refers to the consumption of rainwater that does not form runoff gray water footprint refers to the amount of water used to dilute the concentration of pollutants for achieving the natural concentration of pollutants in the water body or the maximum pollutant discharge concentration specified by local governments chapagain and hoekstra 2011 however studies on agricultural water footprint focus more on blue and green water footprint than on gray water footprint because of the differences in definition and nature cao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in general there are two main methods of water footprint research lovarelli et al 2016 the first one is the water footprint network wfn which is the original approach developed and employed by hoekstra and hung 2002 the second one is the life cycle approach lca which is similar to other lca studies ma et al 2020a the most significant difference between them is that the lca method focuses more on products while the wfn method focuses more on water resources management vanham 2016 however according to some scholars research manzardo et al 2016 pfister et al 2017 the water footprint of a product producer consumer or nation estimated based on two methods has coherent results in the past two decades research on agricultural water footprint has experienced changes from global and national scales bulsink et al 2010 chapagain et al 2006 hoekstra and hung 2002 huang et al 2019 mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 to regional and watershed scales chu et al 2017 zeng et al 2012 zhuo et al 2014 most studies focused too much on virtual water transfer that is reducing the consumption of local water resources by importing agricultural products zhang et al 2017 however in the context of food security also facing severe challenges globally it is impossible for all regions to solve water scarcity through food imports especially in areas where agricultural production plays a great role in economic growth and rural residents income is heavily dependent on agriculture su et al 2020 the optimization of water resources management should be closely integrated with the resources and environmental conditions of regional natural ecosystems and implement targeted strategies that are suitable for regional characteristics this is why the ecological function zoning theory is constantly being accepted worldwide chen et al 2016 faheem et al 2019 ibidhi and ben salem 2018 the ecological function zoning is a way to divide a region into areas with different ecological characteristics according to the pattern of the ecological system ecological environment sensitivity and the spatial differentiation of ecosystem service functions zhai et al 2016 its purpose is to identify the types and functions of different ecosystems in the region and the driving factors that cause such differences which is a prerequisite for the formulation of specific development plans and ecological environmental protection measures suitable for each type of ecological zone chen et al 2016 however few studies have considered local ecological function planning when analyzing agricultural water footprint and its spatial distribution characteristics especially in combination with socioeconomic factors which is a key to achieving sustainable development of regional social ecosystems ibidhi and ben salem 2018 langarudi et al 2019 therefore the research purpose of this study is to take zhangjiakou city as an example to make up for this gap zhangjiakou city located in hebei province northwestern china is a vital water resource and ecological function area in the beijing tianjin hebei region with the development of beijing tianjin hebei integration the deterioration of the ecological environment and the decline of water conservation functions in the region have become increasingly significant especially the shortage of water resources which has seriously restricted the sustainable development of the socioeconomic system ma et al 2020b based on natural resources and geographic characteristics all of the counties districts are classified into six ecological zones in zhangjiakou city the objectives of this study are 1 to estimate and evaluate the agricultural water footprint of each county district in zhangjiakou city in 2005 and 2015 2 to analyze the distribution and matching characteristics of agricultural water footprint and socioeconomic factors planting area population and agricultural gdp in each county district using mathematical models i e gini coefficient and imbalance index firstly 3 to propose suitable measures and policies for sustainable agricultural development in counties districts based on the ecological zone to which they belong 2 methods 2 1 agricultural water footprint 2 1 1 crop water footprint because the gray water footprint has no effect on crop growth only blue and green water was taken into consideration for calculation water requirements for crop growth are mainly related to the meteorological environment crop types soil conditions crop types and harvest times and are usually estimated using the cropwat 8 0 model recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations zeng et al 2012 in cropwat 8 0 first of all the required information of climate rainfall and crop growth need to be entered in the climate rain and crop modules and then the evapotranspiration etc of crop growth can be obtained in the cwr crop water requirements module with every ten days as a unit in this study when the effective rainfall is larger than etc it is assumed that the crop growth only consumes rainwater i e green water when the effective rainfall is less than etc it is assumed that all the effective rainfall is consumed 1 blue water footprint zhangjiakou city is an arid region and crops are generally under irrigated which means blue water consumption is less than the blue water demand therefore the blue water footprint was calculated based on actual irrigation water use taking the loss of water resources during transportation and other processes into account the blue water footprint bwf is calculated as follows 1 bwf w i η where w i is the actual amount of irrigation water and η is the effective utilization coefficient 2 green water footprint 2 et g min et c p e 3 gwf 10 a et g where etg mm is the green water evaporation which is calculated every 10 days during the growth period etc mm and pe mm are the 10 day crop water evaporation and effective precipitation respectively a represents the planting area of crop factor 10 is the coefficient that converts water depth mm to water volume m3 hm 2 2 1 2 animal products water footprint the water footprint of animal products includes two parts the water consumption in the animal breeding stage and in the post processing of animal products it is related to many factors such as animal types breeding methods and breeding areas and the calculation process is complicated here we refer to the results of hoekstra and chapagain 2003 table 1 and the water footprint of animal products is calculated as follows 4 wf ani uwf y where n is the type of animal products uwf is the virtual water content per kilogram of the animal products and y is the weight of animal products 2 2 spatial heterogeneity analysis of water footprint and socioeconomic factors 2 2 1 gini coefficient the gini coefficient was proposed by the italian economist gini 1912 based on the concept of the lorenz curve according to the definition of the gini coefficient we introduce the gini coefficient of water footprint and socioeconomic factors to identify the spatial difference between the regional agricultural water footprint and various socioeconomic factors it is calculated as follows 5 gini i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i 1 v i 1 where n represents the number of ecological zones or counties x i and y i represent the percentage of socioeconomic factors planting area population and agricultural gdp and the water footprint of ecological zone or county i in zhangjiakou city respectively v i represents the cumulative percentage of the water footprint 2 2 2 water footprint and socioeconomic factors imbalance index the gini coefficient can only reflect the overall spatial matching degree of the water footprint and socioeconomic factors therefore for figuring out the specific imbalance in each county of zhangjiakou city we introduce the water footprint and socioeconomic factors imbalance index which is calculated as follows 6 i i y i x i where i i represents the imbalance index of county i when i i 1 it means that water footprint consumption of per unit planting area per capita or per unit gdp is higher than the average level of zhangjiakou city when i i 1 it means that per unit of planting per capita or per unit of gdp water footprint consumption is less than the average level of zhangjiakou city the closer i i is to 1 the higher the matching degree between the water footprint and the socioeconomic factors 3 case study and data sources 3 1 case study zhangjiakou city is located in the northwest of hebei province in the north china plain fig 1 around 180 km from the center of the capital beijing with a total area of 37 000 km2 it belongs to the transition zone of the north china plain and the inner mongolia plateau with elevations increasing from southeast to northwest which divides zhangjiakou city into two parts with different geographical features bashang plateau and baxia basin the altitude of bashang area is 1300 1600 m while that of baxia area is 500 800 m zhangjiakou city belongs to arid and semi arid regions with an annual rainfall of only 300 500 mm while the annual evaporation is about five times higher in 2015 the population of zhangjiakou city was 4 69 million of which 1 71 million were living in urban areas or towns and 2 98 million were living in rural areas the per capita water resources are 347 m3 per year less than one fifth of the national average level and far below the internationally recognized extreme water shortage standard of 500 m3 per capita in 2018 the total water consumption was 880 million m3 of which agricultural water accounted for more than 74 which is much higher than the national average of 62 therefore the agricultural sector is the top priority for water conservation in zhangjiakou city meanwhile zhangjiakou s economic development level is lagging behind twelve of the sixteen counties belong to poverty stricken counties at the national or provincial level there is a lack of diversification of industries that increase farmers income and relying on agriculture is still unavoidable in the foreseeable future the contradiction between water resources and agricultural development will become increasingly prominent in addition beijing is located downstream of zhangjiakou and belongs to the same natural ecosystem the shortage of water resources not only affects the sustainable development of zhangjiakou city but also poses a great threat to beijing s security of water resources and ecological environment according to the characteristics of terrain landforms and the type of land use zhangjiakou was classified into six ecological function zones in the city s 13th five year plan 2016 2020 in 2015 which are represented by i ii iii iv v and vi for simplicity fig 1 as shown in table 2 there were great spatial heterogeneities in these six ecological zones regardless of irrigation rate the percentage of agricultural water use or socioeconomic factors therefore it is of great significance to analyze the spatial difference of the dynamic evolution of the agricultural water footprint from the perspective of the ecological zone 3 2 data sources cropwat 8 0 was used to calculate evaporation and effective rainfall during crop growth the data required mainly includes meteorological and crop parameters meteorological data such as relative humidity sunshine duration wind velocity and precipitation were obtained from zhangjiakou economic yearbooks the people s government of zhangjiakou city 2006 2016 average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature were obtained from the weather website http www tianqi com qiwen city zhangjiakou the parameters of crops such as sowing and harvesting date root depth crop coefficient growth period crop height were modified based on the data provided by fao according to the actual situation in zhangjiakou allan et al 1998 in addition socioeconomic factors such as the crops planted area the output of animal products gdp were derived from the zhangjiakou economic yearbooks 2006 2016 the data of actual water consumption of irrigation and utilization efficiency were derived from the zhangjiakou city water resources bulletin zhangjiakou water resource bureau 2006 2016 and other related government reports 4 results 4 1 general characteristics of the agricultural water footprint the total agricultural water footprint of zhangjiakou city increased from 3 61 109 m3 in 2005 to 5 30 109 m3 in 2015 an increase of 1 69 109 m3 of which the crop water footprint increased from 1 42 109 m3 to 1 52 109 m3 an increase of only 9 80 107 m3 and the water footprint of animal products increased from 2 19 109 m3 to 3 78 109 m3 an increase of 1 59 109 m3 fig 2 as a result the contribution rate of crop water footprint dropped from 39 in 2005 to 29 in 2015 the main reason for the slow growth of the crop water footprint is that the planting area has increased by only 3 7 from 5 53 105 ha to 5 65 105 ha due to the limited cultivated area however with the transformation of residents dietary structure during the process of urbanization and economic development the animal husbandry industry has developed rapidly and the output of animal products has increased by 102 2 from 9 40 105 tons to 1 90 106 tons resulting in a rapid increase of animal products water footprint in terms of spatial differences the agricultural water footprint was always the largest in zhangbei county increased from 5 99 108 m3 to 6 88 108 m3 and the smallest in chongli county increased from 1 55 108 m3 to 2 03 108 m3 fig 2 the contribution rate of crops to the total agricultural water footprint declined in each county while it increased from 40 to 47 in districts area regarding ecological zones the agricultural water footprint was the largest in ecological zone v 1 73 109 m3 and the smallest in ecological zone iv 4 05 108 m3 in 2015 accounting for 48 and 11 of zhangjiakou city respectively the contribution rate of crop water footprint was the highest 34 in ecological zone iv and the lowest 21 in ecological zone i in 2015 4 2 spatiotemporal changes of the crop water footprint 4 2 1 crop water footprint composition from 2005 to 2015 the structure of the crop water footprint was in a relatively stable state among them the water footprint of cereals was always the largest slowly increasing from 6 99 108 m3 to 8 29 108 m3 and the contribution rate increased from 49 to 54 which means cereals were the main contributor to crop water footprint in zhangjiakou city the water footprint of beans was the smallest slowly decreasing from 1 12 108 m3 to 6 40 107 m3 and the contribution rate dropped from 8 to 4 in terms of spatial differences from 2005 to 2015 the crop water footprint increased in ten counties districts and declined in the other four counties without showing obvious characteristics associated with the ecological zone fig 3 the largest region of crop water footprint thus has changed from zhangbei county 1 80 108 m3 in the ecological zone i to huailai county 1 85 108 m3 in the ecological zone v regarding ecological zones the crop water footprint in ecological zone v was always the largest and the contribution rate has increased from 30 to 36 the crop water footprints in ecological zone ii and v were the smallest and the contribution rates were only 9 in 2015 in terms of water footprint structure the contribution rates of cereal in all counties of ecological zone iii v and vi were always higher than 50 and they increased from 72 57 and 58 to 80 66 and 61 in these ecological zones respectively fig 4 while the contribution rates of cereal in most counties of ecological zone i ii and iv were always less than 50 and they were getting smaller and smaller in these ecological zones from 27 40 and 48 decreased to 25 34 and 46 respectively the decline of contribution rates of the cereal water footprint was mainly due to the continuous increase of the water footprint of potatoes 4 2 2 blue and green water footprint the irrigated area of the major crops increased from 1 41 105 ha in 2005 to 1 83 105 ha in 2015 which accounted for 26 and 32 of the total planting area respectively therefore as shown in fig 5 the contribution rate of green water footprint was always about four times higher than the blue water footprint in terms of spatial difference the ecological zone v had the largest share of green water footprint which increased from 29 to 35 while the ecological zone iii had the smallest share which has been maintained at 6 7 the ecological zone v had the largest share of blue water footprint which increased from 32 to 39 while the ecological zone ii had the smallest share of blue water footprint which was always below 5 in 2015 the share of blue water consumption in the ecological zones iii v and vi totaled 76 this is because these three ecological zones were the main irrigation areas and the proportion of irrigated farmland is higher than in other ecological zones 4 3 water footprint of animal products as shown in fig 6a the water footprint of each type of animal products has been rising from 2005 to 2015 milks products had the largest water footprint and the fastest growth rate increasing from 5 35 108 m3 to 1 26 109 m3 fish products had the smallest water footprint increasing from 2 2 107 m3 to 4 1 107 m3 it is obvious that the water footprint of animal products has increased in every county district but the growth rates were significantly different fig 6b the water footprint of animal products was always the largest in zhangbei county increased from 4 20 108 m3 to 5 81 108 m3 while it was always the smallest in chongli county increased from 3 10 107 m3 to 6 70 107 m3 in general the water footprint of animal products in counties of ecological zone i v and vi was higher than in the other counties and the total contribution rate of these three ecological zones has increased from 73 to 75 in addition the structure of the water footprint of the eight major animal products varies significantly in each area fig 7 the total water footprint of beef pork and mutton in the ecological zone iv has been declining but it was still higher than 64 while it was less than 35 in the ecological zones ii and iii the water footprint of equine was the largest in the ecological zone iv but only accounted for 6 7 the proportions of the milks water footprint in the ecological zones i and ii have been expanding from 35 and 60 to 55 and 72 respectively the water footprints of poultry related products such as poultry meat and eggs were very small in the ecological zones i and ii accounting for less than 7 the proportions of fish water footprint were very small in all ecological zones 4 4 the spatial relationship of water footprint and socioeconomic factors 4 4 1 gini coefficient 1 crop water footprint and planting area as shown in fig 8a and b from 2005 to 2015 the gini coefficient of crop water footprint and planting area increased from 0 12 to 0 14 indicating a high balance distribution pattern of the crop water footprint on the county scale regarding blue water and green water the gini coefficient of blue water footprint and planting area slightly increased from 0 33 to 0 34 indicating that the blue water footprint of crops was in a relatively reasonable spatial distribution pattern meanwhile the gini coefficient of green water footprint and planting area increased from 0 09 to 0 11 which means that the spatial distribution of green water footprint always remained in a high balance state therefore in general the spatial distribution of the green water footprint was more balanced than the blue water footprint during the research period 2 agricultural water footprint and population as shown in fig 8c and d the gini coefficient of agricultural water footprint and population increased from 0 12 in 2005 to 0 16 in 2015 which means the spatial distribution of agricultural water footprint and the population was in a high balance state the gini coefficient of the crop water footprint and the population increased from 0 23 to 0 26 indicating that the spatial distribution of the crop water footprint and the population was in a relative balance state the gini coefficient of the water footprint of animal products and population increased from 0 30 to 0 32 which indicates that the distribution of water footprint of animal products and the population was always in a relatively reasonable state in general the spatial balance degree of agricultural water footprint and the population was moving towards a more unbalanced trend 3 agricultural water footprint and gdp as shown in fig 8e and f the gini coefficient of agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp rose from 0 08 in 2005 to 0 15 in 2015 indicating that the spatial relationship between agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp was always in a high balance state in county scale in terms of crops the gini coefficient of crop water footprint and crops gdp increased from 0 15 to 0 27 indicating that the spatial distribution of crop water footprint and crops gdp dropped from a high balance state to a relative balance state in terms of animal products the gini coefficient of the water footprint and gdp of animal products increased from 0 14 to 0 21 which indicates that the spatial relationship of them changed from high balance to relative balance in general the spatial matching degree of the water footprint and animal products gdp was higher than that of the water footprint and crops gdp 4 4 2 imbalance index 1 water footprint and planting area as shown in fig 9a from 2005 to 2015 the imbalance index of the blue water footprint and planting area were always less than 1 in the counties of ecological zones i ii and iv indicating the amount of blue water per unit area of cultivated land in these counties was lower than the average level meanwhile the imbalance index of the blue water footprint and planting area were always greater than 1 in most counties of ecological zones iii v and vi which means the amount of blue water per unit area of cultivated land in these counties was higher than the average level regarding green water as shown in fig 9b the imbalance index of green water footprint and planting area was less than 1 only in four counties kangbao shangyi zhangbei and yu in 2005 while it was less than 1 in half of the counties in 2015 in general the imbalance index of green water footprint and planting area was more concentrated near the absolute balance line which also confirms that the spatial distribution of green water was more balanced 2 agricultural water footprint and population as shown in fig 9c it is obvious that the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and population was far less than 1 in districts area indicating that per capita agricultural water footprint was far below the average level during research period this is due to the high population density in the city center the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and population decreased in all counties of ecological zones i ii iii and iv indicating that per capita agricultural water footprint decreased in these counties while it increased in most counties of ecological zones v and vi indicating that per capita agricultural water footprint increased in these counties 3 agricultural water footprint and gdp as shown in fig 9d the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp was more concentrated around the absolute balance line in 2005 than in 2015 indicating that the differences in the consumption of water footprint per unit of gdp were increasing among counties the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp decreased in almost all counties except zhangbei of ecological zones i ii iii and iv indicating that the consumption of water footprint per unit of gdp was decreasing in these counties while it increased in all counties of ecological zones v and vi indicating that the consumption of water footprint per unit of gdp was increasing in these counties 5 discussion 5 1 recommendations for sustainable development cultivated land and grassland are the main types of land use in counties of ecological zone i which account for 42 and 47 in total in zhangjiakou city respectively from 2005 to 2015 the water footprint of crops decreased from 3 40 108 m3 to 2 50 108 m3 this is because the government has vigorously implemented conversation measures to return farmland to forests and grasslands to restore the ecological environment the planting area has been reduced from 1 74 105 ha to 1 50 105 ha meanwhile the area of irrigated land was reduced by planting drought resistant potatoes instead of water consuming vegetables and the water saving technology of dropper was actively promoted however the water footprint of animal products has increased from 6 50 108 m3 to 9 46 108 m3 especially dairy products have increased from 2 30 108 m3 to 5 20 108 m3 therefore in addition to continuing to optimize the planting structure implement efficient water saving irrigation measures and control the water footprint of crops the government needs to strictly prohibit overload grazing and develop modern animal husbandry from the perspective of water resources carrying capacity in guyuan county the ecological zone ii the crop water footprint increased from 1 25 108 m3 to 1 36 108 m3 compared with ecological zone i the government needs to strengthen the implementation of measures to return farmland to forests and grasslands to save water in addition due to the rapid increase in the milks water footprint the water footprint of animal products in this area increased from 1 70 108 m3 to 3 28 108 m3 therefore the government should accelerate the adoption of measures such as prohibiting grazing rotation grazing and captives to strictly control overgrazing of grasslands and prevent grassland degradation it should also limit the scale of animal husbandry development from the perspective of water conservation the ecological zone iii is the political economic and cultural center of zhangjiakou with the largest population density and a high level of economic development it is also the main area of high quality cultivated land the crop water footprint decreased from 1 41 108 m3 to 1 26 108 m3 of which the proportion of cereal water footprint increased from 72 to 80 while the water footprint of animal products increased from 2 20 108 m3 to 3 10 108 m3 the government thus needs to use the technological advantages of this region to explore effective ways to increase the irrigation coefficient of crops improve the agricultural ecological environment establish green ecological agriculture and improve the efficiency of water resource utilization in chongli county and chicheng county the ecological zone iv woodland and grassland are the main types of land use accounting for 54 in total there are three rivers heihe baihe and honghe which are important water supply sources for beijing from 2005 to 2015 the crop water footprint remained around 1 37 108 m3 and the water footprint of animal products increased from 1 96 108 m3 to 2 68 108 m3 in addition to the protection of natural ecosystems and enhancement of water conservation functions the government needs to control the cultivated area of crops optimize the production and management methods of animal husbandry and strictly control the number of animals based on water resources carrying capacity the counties of ecological zone v are the main area for agricultural development accounting for 25 of the total arable land in zhangjiakou city from 2005 to 2015 the water footprint of crops increased from 4 20 108 m3 to 5 45 108 m3 and the water footprint of animal products increased from 5 42 108 m3 to 1 18 109 m3 which made the ecological zone v has the largest agricultural water footprint and the fastest growth rate among the six ecological zones therefore these counties needs to actively develop ecological agriculture promote the development of water saving and efficient agriculture and build high tech agriculture with the goal of saving water around key industries such as vegetables animal husbandry and fruit processing yu county and zhuolu county are located in the south of zhangjiakou city the ecological services such as natural forest water conservation and soil and water conservation have weakened because of the impact of human activities from 2005 to 2015 the crops water footprint increased from 2 61 108 m3 to 3 27 108 m3 and the animal products water footprint increased from 4 10 108 m3 to 7 25 108 m3 therefore these two counties need to continue to strengthen forest construction prohibit land reclamation on slope land and improve water conservation capacity meanwhile the government should actively implement water saving irrigation technologies to control the increase of the water consumption of the plantation industry and optimize the structure of animal husbandry based on the virtual water content of the feed 5 2 relationships of water footprint and socioeconomic factors in terms of planting area the crop water footprint and the planting area were always in a high balance state indicating that the water consumption per unit of cultivated land in all counties was relatively close the spatial distribution of green water and planting area always remained in a stable state of high balance it only means that the green water consumption per unit area was quite close in all counties it is still vital to optimize the structure of the planting industry to improve the use of precipitation meanwhile the balance between the blue water footprint and the planting area declined slightly this is mainly due to the reduction of irrigated land in counties of bashang area and the increase in the proportion of rainfed and dripper farmland which has led to the reduction of irrigation water in the area through the analysis of the imbalance index the crop water footprint per unit area in counties of ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level of zhangjiakou city especially the blue water footprint therefore it is necessary to use various water saving measures and technologies to focus on improving the efficiency of the water footprint in these counties in terms of population the agricultural water footprint and the gini coefficient of the population remained stable and were always in a high balance state according to the analysis of imbalance degree the per capita agricultural water footprint was larger than the average level in most counties of ecological zones i ii v and vi while it was lower than the average level in counties of ecological zones iii and iv therefore it is necessary to actively reduce the agricultural water footprint in areas of ecological zones i ii v and vi from the perspective of population especially in ecological zones i and ii in terms of gdp the gini coefficient of water footprint and gdp of animal products was always smaller than the gini coefficient of water footprint and gdp of crops indicating that the distribution of water footprint of animal products was more balanced than crop water footprint in terms of gdp this is mainly due to the difference in planting structure and price of crops which led to a poor balance of the water footprint of the crops per unit of gdp in these counties through the analysis of imbalance degree the agricultural water footprint per unit of gdp in most counties of ecological zones i ii and iv was lower than the average level in zhangjiakou while the agricultural water footprint per unit of gdp in most counties of ecological zone vi was higher than the average level in 2015 therefore from the perspective of economic development it is vital to give priority to optimizing the structure of planting and animal husbandry in counties of ecological zone vi to maximize the economic benefits of water footprint however it needs to be emphasized that the adjustment of the agricultural structure in each county requires comprehensive consideration of multiple socioeconomic factors which is similar to the research result of fernández et al 2020 that the market value and local environmental conditions should be considered at the same time in irrigation management for example the water footprint consumption per unit planting area in counties of ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level but the per capita water footprint and per unit gdp water footprint were far below the average level 5 3 limitations and future work from 2005 to 2015 the water footprint of major crops in zhangjiakou increased slightly from 1 42 109 m3 to 1 52 109 m3 and the yield of crops rose from 4 29 106 tons to 7 79 106 tons resulting in a significant decrease of the virtual water content from 0 33 m3 kg to 0 20 m3 kg therefore the virtual water contained in animal feed should also be continuously decreasing however a constant virtual water coefficient was used to calculate the water footprint of animal products in this study which is the common way in the current water footprint research of animal products in addition due to improper management of animal manure animal husbandry can easily cause pollution and eutrophication of surface water groundwater and coastal ecosystems which can indirectly cause loss of water resources however the current research on water resources and agricultural development planning largely ignores the relationship between animal husbandry and water resources therefore the relationship between animal husbandry water resources and the environment will be the focus of further research especially regarding the gray water footprint 6 conclusions zhangjiakou city is in a critical period of economic transformation and development the shortage of water resources has become a serious factor restricting the sustainable development of society and the economy the agricultural water footprint of zhangjiakou city increased from 3 61 109 m3 to 5 30 109 m3 an increase of 1 69 109 m3 of which the water footprint of crops increased by only 9 80 107 m3 while the water footprint of animal products increased by 1 59 109 m3 therefore in addition to continuing to optimize the planting structure implement efficient water saving irrigation measures and control the water footprint of crops the government needs to strictly prohibit overload grazing and develop modern animal husbandry to reduce the water footprint of animal products especially in counties of high altitude ecological zones i ii and iv the gini coefficient and imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and socioeconomic factors indicate that the spatial distribution of agricultural water footprint and planting area population agricultural gdp was relatively balanced but there were still some significant differences for example the water footprint consumption per unit planting area in counties of ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level but the per capita water footprint and per unit gdp water footprint were far below the average level which indicates that adjustment of the agricultural structure in each county requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple socioeconomic factors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10145,the water footprint theory has provided an effective approach for evaluating the utilization of freshwater resources in agricultural production however there are few studies have explored the dynamic coupling relationship between water footprint and socioeconomic factors especially from the perspective of regional ecological features therefore the water footprint method was used to investigate the dynamic evolution of agricultural water consumption from 2005 to 2015 in zhangjiakou an extremely water scarce city which is divided into six ecological zones i ii iii iv v and vi then mathematical models such as the gini coefficient were first employed to evaluate the spatiotemporal matching characteristics of agricultural water footprint and socioeconomic factors the results show that 1 the agricultural water footprint increased by 1 69 109 m3 in zhangjiakou of which the animal products water footprint increased by 1 59 109 m3 accounting for 94 2 cereals had always been the major contributors to crop water footprint with an increasing contribution rate from 49 to 54 milk and egg products were the main drivers for the increasing water footprint of animal products with a total contribution rate increased from 46 to 55 meanwhile the spatial differentiation was significant the contribution rate of the cereal water footprint was less than 50 in counties of high altitude ecological zones i ii and iv in 2015 while it was higher than 50 in counties of low altitude ecological zones iii v and vi 3 the per unit area water footprint in counties of the ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level while per capita water footprint and per unit output value water footprint were far below it indicating agricultural structure optimization requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple socioeconomic factors this study is expected to provide policy makers with scientific guidance that is conducive to agricultural water conservation and ecological zone planning keywords water footprint socioeconomic factors ecological functional zone gini coefficient zhangjiakou city 1 introduction water resources are one of the most indispensable natural resources and an important basis for the healthy and sustainable development of the regional human and natural systems zhang et al 2020 with the rapid development of the global economy the explosive population growth and the acceleration of urbanization the scale and intensity of human activities continue to increase leading to an unprecedented increase of water demand in socioeconomic systems chouchane et al 2018 more and more countries and regions are facing severe challenges of water shortage in all water consumption sectors agriculture production is the major responsible for water use and water stress which accounts for more than 70 of total freshwater consumption worldwide lovarelli et al 2016 therefore with the impact of climate change on the distribution of water resources and the growth cycle of crops bhave et al 2018 how to achieve the conservation of agricultural water use based on ensuring food security has become a major issue that needs to be solved globally in the 21st century li et al 2019 piao et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 especially in countries and regions where water resources are severely lacking and agriculture is highly dependent on irrigation to measure the actual consumption of water condensed in products and services in human activities virtual water was first introduced by allan et al 1998 on this basis for a better understanding of the appropriation of natural capital in terms of the water volumes consumed by various human activities the concept of water footprint wf was proposed by hoekstra hoekstra and chapagain 2003 due to the combination of physical water and virtual water the water footprint provides a comprehensive and effective approach for evaluating the utilization of freshwater resources especially in agriculture production bazrafshan et al 2019 chu et al 2017 tuninetti et al 2015 according to the meaning and role of the water footprint it contains three components blue green and gray water footprint hoekstra and zhuo 2017 zeng et al 2012 blue water footprint refers to the consumption of surface and groundwater during the entire production process green water footprint refers to the consumption of rainwater that does not form runoff gray water footprint refers to the amount of water used to dilute the concentration of pollutants for achieving the natural concentration of pollutants in the water body or the maximum pollutant discharge concentration specified by local governments chapagain and hoekstra 2011 however studies on agricultural water footprint focus more on blue and green water footprint than on gray water footprint because of the differences in definition and nature cao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in general there are two main methods of water footprint research lovarelli et al 2016 the first one is the water footprint network wfn which is the original approach developed and employed by hoekstra and hung 2002 the second one is the life cycle approach lca which is similar to other lca studies ma et al 2020a the most significant difference between them is that the lca method focuses more on products while the wfn method focuses more on water resources management vanham 2016 however according to some scholars research manzardo et al 2016 pfister et al 2017 the water footprint of a product producer consumer or nation estimated based on two methods has coherent results in the past two decades research on agricultural water footprint has experienced changes from global and national scales bulsink et al 2010 chapagain et al 2006 hoekstra and hung 2002 huang et al 2019 mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 to regional and watershed scales chu et al 2017 zeng et al 2012 zhuo et al 2014 most studies focused too much on virtual water transfer that is reducing the consumption of local water resources by importing agricultural products zhang et al 2017 however in the context of food security also facing severe challenges globally it is impossible for all regions to solve water scarcity through food imports especially in areas where agricultural production plays a great role in economic growth and rural residents income is heavily dependent on agriculture su et al 2020 the optimization of water resources management should be closely integrated with the resources and environmental conditions of regional natural ecosystems and implement targeted strategies that are suitable for regional characteristics this is why the ecological function zoning theory is constantly being accepted worldwide chen et al 2016 faheem et al 2019 ibidhi and ben salem 2018 the ecological function zoning is a way to divide a region into areas with different ecological characteristics according to the pattern of the ecological system ecological environment sensitivity and the spatial differentiation of ecosystem service functions zhai et al 2016 its purpose is to identify the types and functions of different ecosystems in the region and the driving factors that cause such differences which is a prerequisite for the formulation of specific development plans and ecological environmental protection measures suitable for each type of ecological zone chen et al 2016 however few studies have considered local ecological function planning when analyzing agricultural water footprint and its spatial distribution characteristics especially in combination with socioeconomic factors which is a key to achieving sustainable development of regional social ecosystems ibidhi and ben salem 2018 langarudi et al 2019 therefore the research purpose of this study is to take zhangjiakou city as an example to make up for this gap zhangjiakou city located in hebei province northwestern china is a vital water resource and ecological function area in the beijing tianjin hebei region with the development of beijing tianjin hebei integration the deterioration of the ecological environment and the decline of water conservation functions in the region have become increasingly significant especially the shortage of water resources which has seriously restricted the sustainable development of the socioeconomic system ma et al 2020b based on natural resources and geographic characteristics all of the counties districts are classified into six ecological zones in zhangjiakou city the objectives of this study are 1 to estimate and evaluate the agricultural water footprint of each county district in zhangjiakou city in 2005 and 2015 2 to analyze the distribution and matching characteristics of agricultural water footprint and socioeconomic factors planting area population and agricultural gdp in each county district using mathematical models i e gini coefficient and imbalance index firstly 3 to propose suitable measures and policies for sustainable agricultural development in counties districts based on the ecological zone to which they belong 2 methods 2 1 agricultural water footprint 2 1 1 crop water footprint because the gray water footprint has no effect on crop growth only blue and green water was taken into consideration for calculation water requirements for crop growth are mainly related to the meteorological environment crop types soil conditions crop types and harvest times and are usually estimated using the cropwat 8 0 model recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations zeng et al 2012 in cropwat 8 0 first of all the required information of climate rainfall and crop growth need to be entered in the climate rain and crop modules and then the evapotranspiration etc of crop growth can be obtained in the cwr crop water requirements module with every ten days as a unit in this study when the effective rainfall is larger than etc it is assumed that the crop growth only consumes rainwater i e green water when the effective rainfall is less than etc it is assumed that all the effective rainfall is consumed 1 blue water footprint zhangjiakou city is an arid region and crops are generally under irrigated which means blue water consumption is less than the blue water demand therefore the blue water footprint was calculated based on actual irrigation water use taking the loss of water resources during transportation and other processes into account the blue water footprint bwf is calculated as follows 1 bwf w i η where w i is the actual amount of irrigation water and η is the effective utilization coefficient 2 green water footprint 2 et g min et c p e 3 gwf 10 a et g where etg mm is the green water evaporation which is calculated every 10 days during the growth period etc mm and pe mm are the 10 day crop water evaporation and effective precipitation respectively a represents the planting area of crop factor 10 is the coefficient that converts water depth mm to water volume m3 hm 2 2 1 2 animal products water footprint the water footprint of animal products includes two parts the water consumption in the animal breeding stage and in the post processing of animal products it is related to many factors such as animal types breeding methods and breeding areas and the calculation process is complicated here we refer to the results of hoekstra and chapagain 2003 table 1 and the water footprint of animal products is calculated as follows 4 wf ani uwf y where n is the type of animal products uwf is the virtual water content per kilogram of the animal products and y is the weight of animal products 2 2 spatial heterogeneity analysis of water footprint and socioeconomic factors 2 2 1 gini coefficient the gini coefficient was proposed by the italian economist gini 1912 based on the concept of the lorenz curve according to the definition of the gini coefficient we introduce the gini coefficient of water footprint and socioeconomic factors to identify the spatial difference between the regional agricultural water footprint and various socioeconomic factors it is calculated as follows 5 gini i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i 1 v i 1 where n represents the number of ecological zones or counties x i and y i represent the percentage of socioeconomic factors planting area population and agricultural gdp and the water footprint of ecological zone or county i in zhangjiakou city respectively v i represents the cumulative percentage of the water footprint 2 2 2 water footprint and socioeconomic factors imbalance index the gini coefficient can only reflect the overall spatial matching degree of the water footprint and socioeconomic factors therefore for figuring out the specific imbalance in each county of zhangjiakou city we introduce the water footprint and socioeconomic factors imbalance index which is calculated as follows 6 i i y i x i where i i represents the imbalance index of county i when i i 1 it means that water footprint consumption of per unit planting area per capita or per unit gdp is higher than the average level of zhangjiakou city when i i 1 it means that per unit of planting per capita or per unit of gdp water footprint consumption is less than the average level of zhangjiakou city the closer i i is to 1 the higher the matching degree between the water footprint and the socioeconomic factors 3 case study and data sources 3 1 case study zhangjiakou city is located in the northwest of hebei province in the north china plain fig 1 around 180 km from the center of the capital beijing with a total area of 37 000 km2 it belongs to the transition zone of the north china plain and the inner mongolia plateau with elevations increasing from southeast to northwest which divides zhangjiakou city into two parts with different geographical features bashang plateau and baxia basin the altitude of bashang area is 1300 1600 m while that of baxia area is 500 800 m zhangjiakou city belongs to arid and semi arid regions with an annual rainfall of only 300 500 mm while the annual evaporation is about five times higher in 2015 the population of zhangjiakou city was 4 69 million of which 1 71 million were living in urban areas or towns and 2 98 million were living in rural areas the per capita water resources are 347 m3 per year less than one fifth of the national average level and far below the internationally recognized extreme water shortage standard of 500 m3 per capita in 2018 the total water consumption was 880 million m3 of which agricultural water accounted for more than 74 which is much higher than the national average of 62 therefore the agricultural sector is the top priority for water conservation in zhangjiakou city meanwhile zhangjiakou s economic development level is lagging behind twelve of the sixteen counties belong to poverty stricken counties at the national or provincial level there is a lack of diversification of industries that increase farmers income and relying on agriculture is still unavoidable in the foreseeable future the contradiction between water resources and agricultural development will become increasingly prominent in addition beijing is located downstream of zhangjiakou and belongs to the same natural ecosystem the shortage of water resources not only affects the sustainable development of zhangjiakou city but also poses a great threat to beijing s security of water resources and ecological environment according to the characteristics of terrain landforms and the type of land use zhangjiakou was classified into six ecological function zones in the city s 13th five year plan 2016 2020 in 2015 which are represented by i ii iii iv v and vi for simplicity fig 1 as shown in table 2 there were great spatial heterogeneities in these six ecological zones regardless of irrigation rate the percentage of agricultural water use or socioeconomic factors therefore it is of great significance to analyze the spatial difference of the dynamic evolution of the agricultural water footprint from the perspective of the ecological zone 3 2 data sources cropwat 8 0 was used to calculate evaporation and effective rainfall during crop growth the data required mainly includes meteorological and crop parameters meteorological data such as relative humidity sunshine duration wind velocity and precipitation were obtained from zhangjiakou economic yearbooks the people s government of zhangjiakou city 2006 2016 average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature were obtained from the weather website http www tianqi com qiwen city zhangjiakou the parameters of crops such as sowing and harvesting date root depth crop coefficient growth period crop height were modified based on the data provided by fao according to the actual situation in zhangjiakou allan et al 1998 in addition socioeconomic factors such as the crops planted area the output of animal products gdp were derived from the zhangjiakou economic yearbooks 2006 2016 the data of actual water consumption of irrigation and utilization efficiency were derived from the zhangjiakou city water resources bulletin zhangjiakou water resource bureau 2006 2016 and other related government reports 4 results 4 1 general characteristics of the agricultural water footprint the total agricultural water footprint of zhangjiakou city increased from 3 61 109 m3 in 2005 to 5 30 109 m3 in 2015 an increase of 1 69 109 m3 of which the crop water footprint increased from 1 42 109 m3 to 1 52 109 m3 an increase of only 9 80 107 m3 and the water footprint of animal products increased from 2 19 109 m3 to 3 78 109 m3 an increase of 1 59 109 m3 fig 2 as a result the contribution rate of crop water footprint dropped from 39 in 2005 to 29 in 2015 the main reason for the slow growth of the crop water footprint is that the planting area has increased by only 3 7 from 5 53 105 ha to 5 65 105 ha due to the limited cultivated area however with the transformation of residents dietary structure during the process of urbanization and economic development the animal husbandry industry has developed rapidly and the output of animal products has increased by 102 2 from 9 40 105 tons to 1 90 106 tons resulting in a rapid increase of animal products water footprint in terms of spatial differences the agricultural water footprint was always the largest in zhangbei county increased from 5 99 108 m3 to 6 88 108 m3 and the smallest in chongli county increased from 1 55 108 m3 to 2 03 108 m3 fig 2 the contribution rate of crops to the total agricultural water footprint declined in each county while it increased from 40 to 47 in districts area regarding ecological zones the agricultural water footprint was the largest in ecological zone v 1 73 109 m3 and the smallest in ecological zone iv 4 05 108 m3 in 2015 accounting for 48 and 11 of zhangjiakou city respectively the contribution rate of crop water footprint was the highest 34 in ecological zone iv and the lowest 21 in ecological zone i in 2015 4 2 spatiotemporal changes of the crop water footprint 4 2 1 crop water footprint composition from 2005 to 2015 the structure of the crop water footprint was in a relatively stable state among them the water footprint of cereals was always the largest slowly increasing from 6 99 108 m3 to 8 29 108 m3 and the contribution rate increased from 49 to 54 which means cereals were the main contributor to crop water footprint in zhangjiakou city the water footprint of beans was the smallest slowly decreasing from 1 12 108 m3 to 6 40 107 m3 and the contribution rate dropped from 8 to 4 in terms of spatial differences from 2005 to 2015 the crop water footprint increased in ten counties districts and declined in the other four counties without showing obvious characteristics associated with the ecological zone fig 3 the largest region of crop water footprint thus has changed from zhangbei county 1 80 108 m3 in the ecological zone i to huailai county 1 85 108 m3 in the ecological zone v regarding ecological zones the crop water footprint in ecological zone v was always the largest and the contribution rate has increased from 30 to 36 the crop water footprints in ecological zone ii and v were the smallest and the contribution rates were only 9 in 2015 in terms of water footprint structure the contribution rates of cereal in all counties of ecological zone iii v and vi were always higher than 50 and they increased from 72 57 and 58 to 80 66 and 61 in these ecological zones respectively fig 4 while the contribution rates of cereal in most counties of ecological zone i ii and iv were always less than 50 and they were getting smaller and smaller in these ecological zones from 27 40 and 48 decreased to 25 34 and 46 respectively the decline of contribution rates of the cereal water footprint was mainly due to the continuous increase of the water footprint of potatoes 4 2 2 blue and green water footprint the irrigated area of the major crops increased from 1 41 105 ha in 2005 to 1 83 105 ha in 2015 which accounted for 26 and 32 of the total planting area respectively therefore as shown in fig 5 the contribution rate of green water footprint was always about four times higher than the blue water footprint in terms of spatial difference the ecological zone v had the largest share of green water footprint which increased from 29 to 35 while the ecological zone iii had the smallest share which has been maintained at 6 7 the ecological zone v had the largest share of blue water footprint which increased from 32 to 39 while the ecological zone ii had the smallest share of blue water footprint which was always below 5 in 2015 the share of blue water consumption in the ecological zones iii v and vi totaled 76 this is because these three ecological zones were the main irrigation areas and the proportion of irrigated farmland is higher than in other ecological zones 4 3 water footprint of animal products as shown in fig 6a the water footprint of each type of animal products has been rising from 2005 to 2015 milks products had the largest water footprint and the fastest growth rate increasing from 5 35 108 m3 to 1 26 109 m3 fish products had the smallest water footprint increasing from 2 2 107 m3 to 4 1 107 m3 it is obvious that the water footprint of animal products has increased in every county district but the growth rates were significantly different fig 6b the water footprint of animal products was always the largest in zhangbei county increased from 4 20 108 m3 to 5 81 108 m3 while it was always the smallest in chongli county increased from 3 10 107 m3 to 6 70 107 m3 in general the water footprint of animal products in counties of ecological zone i v and vi was higher than in the other counties and the total contribution rate of these three ecological zones has increased from 73 to 75 in addition the structure of the water footprint of the eight major animal products varies significantly in each area fig 7 the total water footprint of beef pork and mutton in the ecological zone iv has been declining but it was still higher than 64 while it was less than 35 in the ecological zones ii and iii the water footprint of equine was the largest in the ecological zone iv but only accounted for 6 7 the proportions of the milks water footprint in the ecological zones i and ii have been expanding from 35 and 60 to 55 and 72 respectively the water footprints of poultry related products such as poultry meat and eggs were very small in the ecological zones i and ii accounting for less than 7 the proportions of fish water footprint were very small in all ecological zones 4 4 the spatial relationship of water footprint and socioeconomic factors 4 4 1 gini coefficient 1 crop water footprint and planting area as shown in fig 8a and b from 2005 to 2015 the gini coefficient of crop water footprint and planting area increased from 0 12 to 0 14 indicating a high balance distribution pattern of the crop water footprint on the county scale regarding blue water and green water the gini coefficient of blue water footprint and planting area slightly increased from 0 33 to 0 34 indicating that the blue water footprint of crops was in a relatively reasonable spatial distribution pattern meanwhile the gini coefficient of green water footprint and planting area increased from 0 09 to 0 11 which means that the spatial distribution of green water footprint always remained in a high balance state therefore in general the spatial distribution of the green water footprint was more balanced than the blue water footprint during the research period 2 agricultural water footprint and population as shown in fig 8c and d the gini coefficient of agricultural water footprint and population increased from 0 12 in 2005 to 0 16 in 2015 which means the spatial distribution of agricultural water footprint and the population was in a high balance state the gini coefficient of the crop water footprint and the population increased from 0 23 to 0 26 indicating that the spatial distribution of the crop water footprint and the population was in a relative balance state the gini coefficient of the water footprint of animal products and population increased from 0 30 to 0 32 which indicates that the distribution of water footprint of animal products and the population was always in a relatively reasonable state in general the spatial balance degree of agricultural water footprint and the population was moving towards a more unbalanced trend 3 agricultural water footprint and gdp as shown in fig 8e and f the gini coefficient of agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp rose from 0 08 in 2005 to 0 15 in 2015 indicating that the spatial relationship between agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp was always in a high balance state in county scale in terms of crops the gini coefficient of crop water footprint and crops gdp increased from 0 15 to 0 27 indicating that the spatial distribution of crop water footprint and crops gdp dropped from a high balance state to a relative balance state in terms of animal products the gini coefficient of the water footprint and gdp of animal products increased from 0 14 to 0 21 which indicates that the spatial relationship of them changed from high balance to relative balance in general the spatial matching degree of the water footprint and animal products gdp was higher than that of the water footprint and crops gdp 4 4 2 imbalance index 1 water footprint and planting area as shown in fig 9a from 2005 to 2015 the imbalance index of the blue water footprint and planting area were always less than 1 in the counties of ecological zones i ii and iv indicating the amount of blue water per unit area of cultivated land in these counties was lower than the average level meanwhile the imbalance index of the blue water footprint and planting area were always greater than 1 in most counties of ecological zones iii v and vi which means the amount of blue water per unit area of cultivated land in these counties was higher than the average level regarding green water as shown in fig 9b the imbalance index of green water footprint and planting area was less than 1 only in four counties kangbao shangyi zhangbei and yu in 2005 while it was less than 1 in half of the counties in 2015 in general the imbalance index of green water footprint and planting area was more concentrated near the absolute balance line which also confirms that the spatial distribution of green water was more balanced 2 agricultural water footprint and population as shown in fig 9c it is obvious that the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and population was far less than 1 in districts area indicating that per capita agricultural water footprint was far below the average level during research period this is due to the high population density in the city center the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and population decreased in all counties of ecological zones i ii iii and iv indicating that per capita agricultural water footprint decreased in these counties while it increased in most counties of ecological zones v and vi indicating that per capita agricultural water footprint increased in these counties 3 agricultural water footprint and gdp as shown in fig 9d the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp was more concentrated around the absolute balance line in 2005 than in 2015 indicating that the differences in the consumption of water footprint per unit of gdp were increasing among counties the imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and agricultural gdp decreased in almost all counties except zhangbei of ecological zones i ii iii and iv indicating that the consumption of water footprint per unit of gdp was decreasing in these counties while it increased in all counties of ecological zones v and vi indicating that the consumption of water footprint per unit of gdp was increasing in these counties 5 discussion 5 1 recommendations for sustainable development cultivated land and grassland are the main types of land use in counties of ecological zone i which account for 42 and 47 in total in zhangjiakou city respectively from 2005 to 2015 the water footprint of crops decreased from 3 40 108 m3 to 2 50 108 m3 this is because the government has vigorously implemented conversation measures to return farmland to forests and grasslands to restore the ecological environment the planting area has been reduced from 1 74 105 ha to 1 50 105 ha meanwhile the area of irrigated land was reduced by planting drought resistant potatoes instead of water consuming vegetables and the water saving technology of dropper was actively promoted however the water footprint of animal products has increased from 6 50 108 m3 to 9 46 108 m3 especially dairy products have increased from 2 30 108 m3 to 5 20 108 m3 therefore in addition to continuing to optimize the planting structure implement efficient water saving irrigation measures and control the water footprint of crops the government needs to strictly prohibit overload grazing and develop modern animal husbandry from the perspective of water resources carrying capacity in guyuan county the ecological zone ii the crop water footprint increased from 1 25 108 m3 to 1 36 108 m3 compared with ecological zone i the government needs to strengthen the implementation of measures to return farmland to forests and grasslands to save water in addition due to the rapid increase in the milks water footprint the water footprint of animal products in this area increased from 1 70 108 m3 to 3 28 108 m3 therefore the government should accelerate the adoption of measures such as prohibiting grazing rotation grazing and captives to strictly control overgrazing of grasslands and prevent grassland degradation it should also limit the scale of animal husbandry development from the perspective of water conservation the ecological zone iii is the political economic and cultural center of zhangjiakou with the largest population density and a high level of economic development it is also the main area of high quality cultivated land the crop water footprint decreased from 1 41 108 m3 to 1 26 108 m3 of which the proportion of cereal water footprint increased from 72 to 80 while the water footprint of animal products increased from 2 20 108 m3 to 3 10 108 m3 the government thus needs to use the technological advantages of this region to explore effective ways to increase the irrigation coefficient of crops improve the agricultural ecological environment establish green ecological agriculture and improve the efficiency of water resource utilization in chongli county and chicheng county the ecological zone iv woodland and grassland are the main types of land use accounting for 54 in total there are three rivers heihe baihe and honghe which are important water supply sources for beijing from 2005 to 2015 the crop water footprint remained around 1 37 108 m3 and the water footprint of animal products increased from 1 96 108 m3 to 2 68 108 m3 in addition to the protection of natural ecosystems and enhancement of water conservation functions the government needs to control the cultivated area of crops optimize the production and management methods of animal husbandry and strictly control the number of animals based on water resources carrying capacity the counties of ecological zone v are the main area for agricultural development accounting for 25 of the total arable land in zhangjiakou city from 2005 to 2015 the water footprint of crops increased from 4 20 108 m3 to 5 45 108 m3 and the water footprint of animal products increased from 5 42 108 m3 to 1 18 109 m3 which made the ecological zone v has the largest agricultural water footprint and the fastest growth rate among the six ecological zones therefore these counties needs to actively develop ecological agriculture promote the development of water saving and efficient agriculture and build high tech agriculture with the goal of saving water around key industries such as vegetables animal husbandry and fruit processing yu county and zhuolu county are located in the south of zhangjiakou city the ecological services such as natural forest water conservation and soil and water conservation have weakened because of the impact of human activities from 2005 to 2015 the crops water footprint increased from 2 61 108 m3 to 3 27 108 m3 and the animal products water footprint increased from 4 10 108 m3 to 7 25 108 m3 therefore these two counties need to continue to strengthen forest construction prohibit land reclamation on slope land and improve water conservation capacity meanwhile the government should actively implement water saving irrigation technologies to control the increase of the water consumption of the plantation industry and optimize the structure of animal husbandry based on the virtual water content of the feed 5 2 relationships of water footprint and socioeconomic factors in terms of planting area the crop water footprint and the planting area were always in a high balance state indicating that the water consumption per unit of cultivated land in all counties was relatively close the spatial distribution of green water and planting area always remained in a stable state of high balance it only means that the green water consumption per unit area was quite close in all counties it is still vital to optimize the structure of the planting industry to improve the use of precipitation meanwhile the balance between the blue water footprint and the planting area declined slightly this is mainly due to the reduction of irrigated land in counties of bashang area and the increase in the proportion of rainfed and dripper farmland which has led to the reduction of irrigation water in the area through the analysis of the imbalance index the crop water footprint per unit area in counties of ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level of zhangjiakou city especially the blue water footprint therefore it is necessary to use various water saving measures and technologies to focus on improving the efficiency of the water footprint in these counties in terms of population the agricultural water footprint and the gini coefficient of the population remained stable and were always in a high balance state according to the analysis of imbalance degree the per capita agricultural water footprint was larger than the average level in most counties of ecological zones i ii v and vi while it was lower than the average level in counties of ecological zones iii and iv therefore it is necessary to actively reduce the agricultural water footprint in areas of ecological zones i ii v and vi from the perspective of population especially in ecological zones i and ii in terms of gdp the gini coefficient of water footprint and gdp of animal products was always smaller than the gini coefficient of water footprint and gdp of crops indicating that the distribution of water footprint of animal products was more balanced than crop water footprint in terms of gdp this is mainly due to the difference in planting structure and price of crops which led to a poor balance of the water footprint of the crops per unit of gdp in these counties through the analysis of imbalance degree the agricultural water footprint per unit of gdp in most counties of ecological zones i ii and iv was lower than the average level in zhangjiakou while the agricultural water footprint per unit of gdp in most counties of ecological zone vi was higher than the average level in 2015 therefore from the perspective of economic development it is vital to give priority to optimizing the structure of planting and animal husbandry in counties of ecological zone vi to maximize the economic benefits of water footprint however it needs to be emphasized that the adjustment of the agricultural structure in each county requires comprehensive consideration of multiple socioeconomic factors which is similar to the research result of fernández et al 2020 that the market value and local environmental conditions should be considered at the same time in irrigation management for example the water footprint consumption per unit planting area in counties of ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level but the per capita water footprint and per unit gdp water footprint were far below the average level 5 3 limitations and future work from 2005 to 2015 the water footprint of major crops in zhangjiakou increased slightly from 1 42 109 m3 to 1 52 109 m3 and the yield of crops rose from 4 29 106 tons to 7 79 106 tons resulting in a significant decrease of the virtual water content from 0 33 m3 kg to 0 20 m3 kg therefore the virtual water contained in animal feed should also be continuously decreasing however a constant virtual water coefficient was used to calculate the water footprint of animal products in this study which is the common way in the current water footprint research of animal products in addition due to improper management of animal manure animal husbandry can easily cause pollution and eutrophication of surface water groundwater and coastal ecosystems which can indirectly cause loss of water resources however the current research on water resources and agricultural development planning largely ignores the relationship between animal husbandry and water resources therefore the relationship between animal husbandry water resources and the environment will be the focus of further research especially regarding the gray water footprint 6 conclusions zhangjiakou city is in a critical period of economic transformation and development the shortage of water resources has become a serious factor restricting the sustainable development of society and the economy the agricultural water footprint of zhangjiakou city increased from 3 61 109 m3 to 5 30 109 m3 an increase of 1 69 109 m3 of which the water footprint of crops increased by only 9 80 107 m3 while the water footprint of animal products increased by 1 59 109 m3 therefore in addition to continuing to optimize the planting structure implement efficient water saving irrigation measures and control the water footprint of crops the government needs to strictly prohibit overload grazing and develop modern animal husbandry to reduce the water footprint of animal products especially in counties of high altitude ecological zones i ii and iv the gini coefficient and imbalance index of agricultural water footprint and socioeconomic factors indicate that the spatial distribution of agricultural water footprint and planting area population agricultural gdp was relatively balanced but there were still some significant differences for example the water footprint consumption per unit planting area in counties of ecological zone iii was much higher than the average level but the per capita water footprint and per unit gdp water footprint were far below the average level which indicates that adjustment of the agricultural structure in each county requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple socioeconomic factors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10146,shallow groundwater often presents multiple behaviors in supporting the sustainability of arid agroecosystems the behaviors are especially important and complicated for the arid irrigated areas with fragmented land use types in the view of understanding the role of shallow groundwater in such areas the modflow and mt3dms with the assistance of hydrus 1d were used to simulate groundwater flow and salt transport in a typical observation site of the arid upper yellow river basin yrb the original modflow was modified with introducing a variable expression of specific yield aiming to improve the modeling accuracy in shallow groundwater environments the model was calibrated and validated using the observation data of groundwater depth and drainage in 2013 and 2012 respectively groundwater evapotranspiration and lateral water salt exchange among different land use types were simulated and analyzed meanwhile the dry drainage effect of non cultivated natural land was quantitatively interpreted results indicated that the fragmented land use planting pattern with different irrigation scheduling resulted in significant lateral groundwater flow and water salt redistribution among different land use fields during irrigation the groundwater evapotranspiration ranged at about 160 220 mm for different land use types reaching to 0 30 0 45 of plant evapotranspiration et pt during the growing seasons this effectively supplemented the plant water use in arid climate especially for the unirrigated cultivated land during some stages and the non irrigated natural land meanwhile the lateral groundwater flow drove salt migrating from the cultivated land to the natural land the natural land accumulated 27 40 of salts introduced by irrigation playing a significant role in accommodating salts i e the dry drainage effect moreover our modeling work further implied that the reliable groundwater modeling in arid and shallow groundwater areas required a more detailed model conceptualization and more accurate information of land use distribution irrigation scheduling and local microrelief than the general understanding in the past keywords lateral groundwater flow groundwater evapotranspiration salt accumulation dry drainage modified modflow and mt3dms variable specific yield 1 introduction shallow groundwater system is a typical feature in many arid agricultural areas such as the irrigated areas in the west side of san joaquin valley in the united states schoups et al 2005 the fergana valley in central asia karimov et al 2014 the murray darling basin of southeast australia wahba and christen 2006 and irrigation districts of upper yellow river basin in northwest china xu et al 2011 the system is related to the processes of evaporation recharge drainage water salt movement etc and plays a critical role in affecting crop production and soil water environments e g plant growth salinization and desertification gao et al 2018 konukcu et al 2006 ren et al 2016 in addition the fragmented land use that often exists in many regions further increase the complexity of hydrological processes in arid irrigated areas with shallow groundwater these bring great challenges to the effective management of irrigation drainage and crop production therefore a thorough understanding the roles of shallow groundwater system in arid irrigated areas with fragmented land use types is very significant to the rational water management and agroecosystem sustainability the simulation model has been an effective tool to elucidate such complicated behaviors of shallow groundwater system one dimensional 1d variably saturated flow models e g hydrus 1d and swap šimůnek et al 2016 van dam et al 2008 are usually used on a field scale or extended to regional simulation by coupling with gis ren et al 2019a singh et al 2006 note that these models cannot describe the groundwater flows and lateral interactions of groundwater between different units three dimensional 3d variably saturated model is a type of model that can accurately characterize the subsurface flow and solute transport e g hydrus 3d and hydrogeosphere šimůnek et al 2011 therrien et al 2009 but its practical use is limited by the excessive calculation load and calculation instability due to very strong non linearity of 3d equations and too fine mesh for unsaturated zones besides some quasi 3d models are proposed for coupled simulation of vadose zone water flow 1d and groundwater flow 3d such as hydrus modflow twarakavi et al 2008 and swap modflow xu et al 2012 however the quasi 3d coupling approach is still immature and needs further research particularly on the way of information coupling both in time and space twarakavi et al 2008 xu et al 2012 thus the traditional 3d groundwater modeling in which the hydrological process in vadose zone is generalized is still an attractive approach to characterize the shallow groundwater system awan et al 2015 deng and bailey 2020 hopp et al 2019 in addition the specific yield s y is an important hydraulic parameter but often treated as a constant in groundwater flow models e g in modflow and feflow harbaugh et al 2000 trefry and muffels 2007 lu et al 2020 however due to the effects of capillary properties of soils the s y changes nonlinearly as groundwater depth gwd becomes deeper in shallow groundwater environments duke 1972 nachabe 2002 thus in order to reasonably describe the groundwater fluctuation processes in shallow groundwater areas an appropriate expression to characterize variable s y is necessary for groundwater flow models therefore in this paper a canal command observation site in the arid upper yellow river basin yrb was selected as a typical representative area to investigate the multiple roles of shallow groundwater system in detail the modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 were used to simulate the groundwater flow and salt transport in the observation site with the assistance of hydrus 1d a variable s y expression was introduced to modify the original modflow the detailed field survey and observation were carried out for model conceptualization construction and calibration the aims of this study were to simulate and analyze the groundwater evapotranspiration and lateral water salt exchange dynamics and quantitatively interpret the dry drainage effect of unirrigated natural land in shallow groundwater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation site 2 1 1 location agroecosystem and hydrogeological conditions the observation site named yangchang canal command area yca is located in hetao irrigation district also called hetao plain of the upper yrb northwest china fig 1 hetao is one of the three largest irrigation districts in china with an arid to semi arid continental climate it has a very flat topography with an average slope of 1 5000 1 8000 from east to west and 1 4000 1 8000 from south to north bwca 2007 irrigation water was mainly diverted from the yellow river groundwater is only used for irrigation in some local areas due to the distribution of brackish saline aquifer with the unfavorable hydrogeological conditions the flooding irrigation and poor drainage cause shallow groundwater tables the gwd generally varies from 0 5 m to 3 0 m in hetao the groundwater flow is also weak on a regional scale with small hydraulic gradient of near 0 02 xu et al 2011 ren et al 2016 the yca has an area of 19 63 ha with cultivated land and natural land being the main land use types fig 2 the cultivated land is mainly covered by vegetation of sunflower maize wheat and watermelon which presents a fragmented planting structure the natural land is located in the southwest corner with an area about 2 5 ha the soil texture was mainly the silty loam the observation site is surrounded by a secondary last order irrigation canal yangchang canal in the northwest and drainage ditches on the other three sides fig 2 the secondary last order canal controls four field irrigation canals the drainage ditches corresponding to irrigation canals are mainly used to drain groundwater during each irrigation event only parts of croplands are irrigated due to the different irrigation scheduling for different crops the lateral groundwater flow often takes place in the inner yca during irrigation there is almost no groundwater exchange with outside areas due to the effects of surrounding drainage ditches and very small regional hydraulic gradients thus the yca has a relatively closed shallow groundwater system actually the hetao can be seen as composed of many canal command units i e basic unit like yca ren et al 2016 2019a therefore in this study we took the yca as a proper representative unit to investigate the complex and multiple behaviors of shallow groundwater system 2 1 2 observation and data collection the experiment and observation were carried out in yca during crop growth season from may to september in 2012 and 2013 respectively four observation wells were set to observe the groundwater dynamics in different land use fields fig 2 soil samples were taken at corresponding four fields to measure soil water content and salt content 1 0 m depth every 7 17 days meanwhile a soil sampling survey fig 1 was conducted with a 3 0 m depth to measure the soil physical and hydraulic properties five irrigation events as shown in fig 3 were recorded with water volume measured by a trapezoidal thin wall weir total dissolved solid tds concentration of groundwater and irrigation water were measured by an electrical conductivity meter tds concentration of groundwater and irrigation water were relatively stable at about 2 0 g l 1 and 0 5 g l 1 respectively the detailed surface elevation were measured by a total station both in the cultivated land and natural land fig 1 the average elevation of the cultivated land was about 0 3 m higher than that of natural land the cross section size of field drain and collector drain was measured as well the drainage volume in the outlet observation section was measured by a flow meter daily meteorological data including wind speed air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration were obtained from linhe weather station and the precipitation was measured separately by an automatic rain gauge more detailed information related to soil properties irrigation scheduling and field measurements can be found in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 modeling description the modflow and mt3dms were adopted to simulate the groundwater flow and salt transport in shallow groundwater system of yca the partial differential equation of groundwater flow used in modflow is harbaugh et al 2000 1 x k x x h h x y k y y h h y z k z z h h z w s y h t for unconfined aquifer x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t for confined aquifer where k xx k yy and k zz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes l t 1 respectively h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water t 1 s y and s s are the specific yield and specific storage l 1 respectively and t is the time t the partial differential equation to describe the solute transport of species k in mt3dms is zheng and wang 1999 2 t θ c k t θ d i j c k x j t θ v i c k q s c s k r n where θ is porosity of the subsurface medium l3 l 3 c k is the dissolved concentration of species k m l 3 d ij is hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t 1 v i pore water velocity l t 1 q s is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer representing fluid sources sinks t 1 c s k is the concentration of the source sink flux for species k m l 3 and r n is the chemical reaction term m l 3 t 1 the modular packages can be selected and used in above models to deal with different boundary conditions and sinks sources such as recharge rch package evapotranspiration segments ets package drain drn package etc in this study we introduced a variable expression of s y instead of using a constant s y in original modflow in order to improve modeling accuracy under very shallow groundwater conditions a three segment expression related to soil water retention properties and gwd was adopted to characterize the variable s y as follows 3 s y s y c o n s d d 0 θ s θ r 1 1 α d n 1 n 1 0 d d 0 0 95 d 0 where θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual soil water contents l3 l 3 respectively α l 1 and n are empirical shape parameters in the van genuchten vg model d is groundwater depth l and d 0 is a threshold value of gwd over which the s y is assumed to be a traditional constant value i e s ycons l when gwd was too shallow and less than d 0 we combined the duke s equation duke 1972 and vg model van genuchten et al 1992 to express the variation of s y with gwd when groundwater overflowed to ground surface i e d 0 the s y should be considered as a constant value near 1 0 to deal with the surface water ponding and to avoid the unreal sharp rise of groundwater table in addition soil water and salt simulation has been conducted using the hydrus 1d model at three croplands and a natural patch in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 it could provide rich information to assist groundwater modeling and analyses such as 1 the soil water retention parameters for describing the variable s y expression in groundwater modeling 2 the plant water consumption for evaluating groundwater evapotranspiration and 3 the salt concentration of deep percolation water to define the recharge sources for solute modeling i e mt3dms the salt concentration of deep percolation water calculated by hydrus 1d for different land use types was set for the first layer in solute modeling during irrigation periods 2 2 2 lateral exchange calculation for different land use types an equation to describe the groundwater balance for different land use types can be expressed as 4 δ w i s y i δ h i a i i i f i p i w l f i e t g w i a i g d i where δw i is the change of groundwater storage for the i th land use type l3 δh i is the gwd change l i lf i and p i are the groundwater recharge from irrigation and rainfall l respectively a i is the corresponding area l2 w lf i is the groundwater lateral flow exchange l et gw i is the groundwater evapotranspiration l and g d i is the ditch drainage of groundwater l3 because other items could be calculated from the model simulation the w lf i was the only remaining item and can be obtained with eq 4 similarly the salt balance equation for groundwater system can be expressed as 5 w f i n i c f i n i w i n i i c i n i i i i f i c i f i e t g w i c g i s l f i a i g d i c d i where w ini i and w fin i are the initial and final volume storage of groundwater l3 respectively c ini i and c fin i are the initial and final tds concentration of groundwater m l 3 c if i c g i and c d i are the tds concentration of infiltration water groundwater and drainage water m l 3 respectively and s lf i is the mass of salt exchange through lateral groundwater flow m l 2 a positive value of s lf i means net inflow of salt to the i th land use type with a negative value meaning net outflow of salt similar to the w lf i the s lf i was the only remaining item and can be obtained with eq 5 2 3 model setup calibration and validation in the modflow the cultivated lands in yca were simplified into four different land use types based on the fragmented planting structure i e sunflower land maize land wheat land and watermelon land a uniform 10 m square cell was adopted horizontally in the model the aquifer system was discretized into 5 layers with thickness varying from 3 m to 10 m the aquifer was considered to be isotropic in the horizontal direction with vertical hydraulic conductivity being one tenth of the horizontal one d affonseca et al 2020 sathe and mahanta 2019 xu et al 2009 the hydraulic conductivity and solute transport parameters of five layers are assumed to be the same in this observation site bameng survey 1994 the parameters in vg model van genuchten et al 1992 was adopted in the expression of variable s y for the first layer the reference values for main hydraulic and solute transport parameters are presented in table 1 initial groundwater table and initial tds concentration of groundwater were set according the observed data on may 1st tds concentration of irrigation water was set to 0 5 g l 1 the elevation of field drain and collector drain were set to be about 0 5 m and 1 3 m lower than ground elevation of surrounding cultivated land respectively the simulation period covered whole plant growth season from may to september with very small regional hydraulic gradients and surrounded by drainage ditches the yca had a relatively closed groundwater system the irrigation canal in the northwest was considered as a flux boundary using rch package in the first layer the other three sides surrounded by drainage ditches i e collector drain in fig 1 were considered as drain boundaries using drn package in the first layer groundwater flow to field drainage ditches was also calculated using drn package in the first layer no flow boundary conditions were defined for the lower layers the recharge from irrigation infiltration in field and inner canal seepage were simulated by rch package the groundwater evapotranspiration et gw was considered as a head dependent flux boundary with using ets package a three segment linear function was used in ets package to describe the relationship between et gw and gwd the et gw decreased to zero when gwd reached the extinction depth d e with the link mt3dms lmt6 package the solute transport model mt3dms can be linked with modflow zheng et al 2001 to simulate salt transport in groundwater system the sources sinks from irrigation rainfall recharge and et gw were calculated using the sink and source mixing ssm package in mt3dms salt concentration of infiltration water into groundwater referred to the soil salinity concentration simulated by hydrus dualkc ren et al 2016 2017 the tds concentration of groundwater in the first layer was set as the evapotranspiration concentration model was calibrated and validated by the measured gwd data in 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition the volume of groundwater drainage by ditches was also used for model calibration statistical analysis indexes including determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were adopted to evaluate the simulation accuracy the definition of these indicators can refer to xu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and groundwater dynamics fig 3 presented the comparison of simulated and measured gwds for four observation wells from may to september in 2012 and 2013 respectively the simulated gwds were in good agreement with the observed ones for calibration 2013 r 2 and nse were greater than 0 75 and 0 71 respectively and rmse was smaller than 27 cm for validation 2012 r 2 was greater than 0 60 rmse was less than 41 cm and nse varied at 0 41 0 70 table 2 in addition the simulated volume of groundwater drainage by ditches was 1964 m3 and 2316 m3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively it accounted for about 3 8 of total irrigation water each year which was consistent with the values of water salt balance analysis 4 by ren et al 2019b overall the simulation accuracy was acceptable and the calibrated model can be used to analyze the groundwater dynamics in yca results indicated that groundwater table often had large spatial variations during the irrigation period caused by non uniform irrigation in space for example fig 4 showed the spatial distribution of groundwater table and gwd in three different times i e before during and after irrigation during the third irrigation in 2013 the groundwater table rose quickly at irrigated fields and drove groundwater flowing into the unirrigated lands fig 4a june 30th calculation indicated that the hydraulic gradient was very significant and can reach to 1 in yca thus the local groundwater flow was far more intense than the traditional understanding on a regional scale for the hetao plain i e with the hydraulic gradient near 0 02 xu et al 2011 xue et al 2017 yue et al 2016 then groundwater table gradually dropped after irrigation and became flat fig 4a july 10th thus the lateral groundwater exchange among different land use types was every complicated and frequent in local scale like yca however this phenomenon could not be well reflected in many previous modeling studies with adopting large scale grids xu et al 2011 xue et al 2017 3 2 groundwater evapotranspiration the spatial distribution of groundwater evapotranspiration et gw is presented in fig 5 during the growing season for 2012 and 2013 the et gw was significant in shallow groundwater system it showed a strong variation for different land use types primarily due to the fragmented land use planting structure and different irrigation scheduling for different crops for crop lands the watermelon land had the highest et gw of about 186 mm and 211 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively the et gw for crop fields of maize wheat and sunflower were 177 mm 166 mm and 168 mm in 2012 respectively while the corresponding et gw were 189 mm 190 mm and 160 mm in 2013 respectively for the arid agricultural areas with shallow groundwater system the et gw was mainly consumed to supplement crop water use playing an important role in supporting agroecosystems as groundwater contribution for different crop lands the ratio of et gw to plant evapotranspiration varied from 0 30 to 0 37 and from 0 29 to 0 48 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the values were less than those reported by ghamarnia and jalili 2014 in arid western iran this was mainly related that the gwd was deeper in our observation case in particular the shallow groundwater system played an important role in supplementing crop water consumption and resisting drought during the irrigation interval the et gw in unirrigated natural land was about 202 mm and 223 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively with the ratio of et gw to plant evapotranspiration reaching to 0 40 and 0 47 the shallow groundwater played a critical role in supporting vegetation growth and maintaining biodiversity in natural lands the unirrigated natural patches had the highest et gw because it was mainly distributed in the low lying zones with average gwd shallower than that in cultivated lands about 20 40 cm shallower in yca furthermore the microrelief was also an important factor to affect et gw especially for the natural land such as the surface elevation of natural patch n 2 was about 20 40 cm higher than that of natural patch n 1 while the et gw for n 2 was around 60 90 mm smaller than that for n 1 in 2013 fig 5b our results implied that the reliability of et gw calculation was closely dependent on the land use accuracy and cell size division in groundwater modeling obviously the modeling studies with coarse grids on the regional scale may result in significant errors in et gw estimation under fragmented land use conditions e g with 200 m cell size in xu et al 2011 and with 1000 m cell size in xue et al 2017 3 3 lateral groundwater flow salt migration and dry drainage effect the spatial distribution of lateral water salt exchange of a column with the around columns for whole simulation period are presented in figs 6 and 7 calculated with eqs 4 and 5 it showed that salt migrated into natural patches along with lateral groundwater flow resulting in significant salt accumulation in natural patches the simulated water and salt balance for each land use type is presented in table 3 results showed that the lateral exchange of water salt were highly related to the irrigation depth with larger irrigation causing stronger lateral outflow for example sunflower lands had the largest irrigation depth i e 369 mm and 502 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively which caused large lateral groundwater flow out into the surrounding fields i e 2023 m3 and 6084 m3 of water outflow accompanied with 5447 kg and 15 596 kg of salt outflow in 2012 and 2013 respectively during the simulation period 3316 kg and 4103 kg of salt was drained out by ditches in 2012 and 2013 respectively accounting for 13 of salt introduced by canal irrigation table 3 the remaining salt was redistributed in areas of different land use types fig 8 the salt accumulated in crop lands was 9543 kg and 16 982 kg in 2012 and 2013 respectively being about 37 53 of total salt introduced by canal irrigation the salt accumulated in unirrigated natural lands was 10 185 kg and 8593 kg in 2012 and 2013 respectively the percentage was about 27 40 of total salt introduced by irrigation fig 8b which was basically similar to the results of ren et al 2019b using a water salt balance approach with detailed experiments but the value was less than that of wu et al 2009 on the regional scale and konukcu et al 2006 in the lower indus basin this was mainly because the proportion of natural land area or fallow land area to the total area was smaller in our study than that in wu et al 2009 and konukcu et al 2006 therefore for arid irrigated plain with fragmented land use and shallow groundwater system the natural land can be seen as an effective salt storage area for controlling salinity effects during plant growing seasons this dry drainage effect is of great significance for supporting the sustainability of arid agroecosystems in addition how to effectively utilize the dry drainage effect of natural lands and meantime to control salinity for maintaining ecological functions of natural vegetation was deserved to be studied in the follow up investigations 4 conclusion the modified modflow and mt3dms with the assistance of hydrus 1d were used to simulate groundwater flow and salt transport in a typical observation site i e yangchang canal system in hetao irrigation district of the arid upper yellow river basin based on the detailed experiment observation data a detailed local scale groundwater model was established and calibrated for the yca and it was sufficient to characterize local groundwater behaviors for arid irrigated areas with shallow groundwater and fragmented land use the case study fully presented the multiple roles of shallow groundwater system in arid irrigated plains the main conclusions were as follows 1 the fragmented land use pattern with different irrigation scheduling resulted in intense lateral flow in shallow phreatic aquifer during irrigation the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater can reach to 1 was significant on a local scale being much larger than the traditional understanding on a regional scale 2 the groundwater contribution through groundwater evapotranspiration et gw played an important role in supplementing crop water use and resisting drought during irrigation interval with the ratio of et gw to crop water use being 0 29 0 48 in particular groundwater contribution played a critical role in supporting vegetation growth and maintaining biodiversity in natural lands with the ratio of et gw to natural plant water consumption being about 0 40 0 47 besides et gw presented a strong spatial distribution for different land use types which was largely affected by local microrelief and 3 the significant lateral groundwater flow drove salt migrating from the cultivated land to surrounding natural patches the salt mass accumulated in natural lands reached to 27 40 of total salt mass introduced by irrigation playing a significant role in dry drainage effect overall our study provided a thorough quantitative understanding of multiple behaviors of shallow groundwater system with fragmented land use types and also meaningful implications in improving irrigation and drainage management in arid irrigated plains like hetao in addition our modeling work further emphasized the reliable groundwater modeling in such areas was quite dependent on the detailed model generalization and the accurate information of land use distribution irrigation scheduling and local microrelief declaration of competing interest the

agricultural areas such as the irrigated areas in the west side of san joaquin valley in the united states schoups et al 2005 the fergana valley in central asia karimov et al 2014 the murray darling basin of southeast australia wahba and christen 2006 and irrigation districts of upper yellow river basin in northwest china xu et al 2011 the system is related to the processes of evaporation recharge drainage water salt movement etc and plays a critical role in affecting crop production and soil water environments e g plant growth salinization and desertification gao et al 2018 konukcu et al 2006 ren et al 2016 in addition the fragmented land use that often exists in many regions further increase the complexity of hydrological processes in arid irrigated areas with shallow groundwater these bring great challenges to the effective management of irrigation drainage and crop production therefore a thorough understanding the roles of shallow groundwater system in arid irrigated areas with fragmented land use types is very significant to the rational water management and agroecosystem sustainability the simulation model has been an effective tool to elucidate such complicated behaviors of shallow groundwater system one dimensional 1d variably saturated flow models e g hydrus 1d and swap šimůnek et al 2016 van dam et al 2008 are usually used on a field scale or extended to regional simulation by coupling with gis ren et al 2019a singh et al 2006 note that these models cannot describe the groundwater flows and lateral interactions of groundwater between different units three dimensional 3d variably saturated model is a type of model that can accurately characterize the subsurface flow and solute transport e g hydrus 3d and hydrogeosphere šimůnek et al 2011 therrien et al 2009 but its practical use is limited by the excessive calculation load and calculation instability due to very strong non linearity of 3d equations and too fine mesh for unsaturated zones besides some quasi 3d models are proposed for coupled simulation of vadose zone water flow 1d and groundwater flow 3d such as hydrus modflow twarakavi et al 2008 and swap modflow xu et al 2012 however the quasi 3d coupling approach is still immature and needs further research particularly on the way of information coupling both in time and space twarakavi et al 2008 xu et al 2012 thus the traditional 3d groundwater modeling in which the hydrological process in vadose zone is generalized is still an attractive approach to characterize the shallow groundwater system awan et al 2015 deng and bailey 2020 hopp et al 2019 in addition the specific yield s y is an important hydraulic parameter but often treated as a constant in groundwater flow models e g in modflow and feflow harbaugh et al 2000 trefry and muffels 2007 lu et al 2020 however due to the effects of capillary properties of soils the s y changes nonlinearly as groundwater depth gwd becomes deeper in shallow groundwater environments duke 1972 nachabe 2002 thus in order to reasonably describe the groundwater fluctuation processes in shallow groundwater areas an appropriate expression to characterize variable s y is necessary for groundwater flow models therefore in this paper a canal command observation site in the arid upper yellow river basin yrb was selected as a typical representative area to investigate the multiple roles of shallow groundwater system in detail the modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 were used to simulate the groundwater flow and salt transport in the observation site with the assistance of hydrus 1d a variable s y expression was introduced to modify the original modflow the detailed field survey and observation were carried out for model conceptualization construction and calibration the aims of this study were to simulate and analyze the groundwater evapotranspiration and lateral water salt exchange dynamics and quantitatively interpret the dry drainage effect of unirrigated natural land in shallow groundwater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation site 2 1 1 location agroecosystem and hydrogeological conditions the observation site named yangchang canal command area yca is located in hetao irrigation district also called hetao plain of the upper yrb northwest china fig 1 hetao is one of the three largest irrigation districts in china with an arid to semi arid continental climate it has a very flat topography with an average slope of 1 5000 1 8000 from east to west and 1 4000 1 8000 from south to north bwca 2007 irrigation water was mainly diverted from the yellow river groundwater is only used for irrigation in some local areas due to the distribution of brackish saline aquifer with the unfavorable hydrogeological conditions the flooding irrigation and poor drainage cause shallow groundwater tables the gwd generally varies from 0 5 m to 3 0 m in hetao the groundwater flow is also weak on a regional scale with small hydraulic gradient of near 0 02 xu et al 2011 ren et al 2016 the yca has an area of 19 63 ha with cultivated land and natural land being the main land use types fig 2 the cultivated land is mainly covered by vegetation of sunflower maize wheat and watermelon which presents a fragmented planting structure the natural land is located in the southwest corner with an area about 2 5 ha the soil texture was mainly the silty loam the observation site is surrounded by a secondary last order irrigation canal yangchang canal in the northwest and drainage ditches on the other three sides fig 2 the secondary last order canal controls four field irrigation canals the drainage ditches corresponding to irrigation canals are mainly used to drain groundwater during each irrigation event only parts of croplands are irrigated due to the different irrigation scheduling for different crops the lateral groundwater flow often takes place in the inner yca during irrigation there is almost no groundwater exchange with outside areas due to the effects of surrounding drainage ditches and very small regional hydraulic gradients thus the yca has a relatively closed shallow groundwater system actually the hetao can be seen as composed of many canal command units i e basic unit like yca ren et al 2016 2019a therefore in this study we took the yca as a proper representative unit to investigate the complex and multiple behaviors of shallow groundwater system 2 1 2 observation and data collection the experiment and observation were carried out in yca during crop growth season from may to september in 2012 and 2013 respectively four observation wells were set to observe the groundwater dynamics in different land use fields fig 2 soil samples were taken at corresponding four fields to measure soil water content and salt content 1 0 m depth every 7 17 days meanwhile a soil sampling survey fig 1 was conducted with a 3 0 m depth to measure the soil physical and hydraulic properties five irrigation events as shown in fig 3 were recorded with water volume measured by a trapezoidal thin wall weir total dissolved solid tds concentration of groundwater and irrigation water were measured by an electrical conductivity meter tds concentration of groundwater and irrigation water were relatively stable at about 2 0 g l 1 and 0 5 g l 1 respectively the detailed surface elevation were measured by a total station both in the cultivated land and natural land fig 1 the average elevation of the cultivated land was about 0 3 m higher than that of natural land the cross section size of field drain and collector drain was measured as well the drainage volume in the outlet observation section was measured by a flow meter daily meteorological data including wind speed air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration were obtained from linhe weather station and the precipitation was measured separately by an automatic rain gauge more detailed information related to soil properties irrigation scheduling and field measurements can be found in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 modeling description the modflow and mt3dms were adopted to simulate the groundwater flow and salt transport in shallow groundwater system of yca the partial differential equation of groundwater flow used in modflow is harbaugh et al 2000 1 x k x x h h x y k y y h h y z k z z h h z w s y h t for unconfined aquifer x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t for confined aquifer where k xx k yy and k zz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes l t 1 respectively h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water t 1 s y and s s are the specific yield and specific storage l 1 respectively and t is the time t the partial differential equation to describe the solute transport of species k in mt3dms is zheng and wang 1999 2 t θ c k t θ d i j c k x j t θ v i c k q s c s k r n where θ is porosity of the subsurface medium l3 l 3 c k is the dissolved concentration of species k m l 3 d ij is hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t 1 v i pore water velocity l t 1 q s is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer representing fluid sources sinks t 1 c s k is the concentration of the source sink flux for species k m l 3 and r n is the chemical reaction term m l 3 t 1 the modular packages can be selected and used in above models to deal with different boundary conditions and sinks sources such as recharge rch package evapotranspiration segments ets package drain drn package etc in this study we introduced a variable expression of s y instead of using a constant s y in original modflow in order to improve modeling accuracy under very shallow groundwater conditions a three segment expression related to soil water retention properties and gwd was adopted to characterize the variable s y as follows 3 s y s y c o n s d d 0 θ s θ r 1 1 α d n 1 n 1 0 d d 0 0 95 d 0 where θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual soil water contents l3 l 3 respectively α l 1 and n are empirical shape parameters in the van genuchten vg model d is groundwater depth l and d 0 is a threshold value of gwd over which the s y is assumed to be a traditional constant value i e s ycons l when gwd was too shallow and less than d 0 we combined the duke s equation duke 1972 and vg model van genuchten et al 1992 to express the variation of s y with gwd when groundwater overflowed to ground surface i e d 0 the s y should be considered as a constant value near 1 0 to deal with the surface water ponding and to avoid the unreal sharp rise of groundwater table in addition soil water and salt simulation has been conducted using the hydrus 1d model at three croplands and a natural patch in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 it could provide rich information to assist groundwater modeling and analyses such as 1 the soil water retention parameters for describing the variable s y expression in groundwater modeling 2 the plant water consumption for evaluating groundwater evapotranspiration and 3 the salt concentration of deep percolation water to define the recharge sources for solute modeling i e mt3dms the salt concentration of deep percolation water calculated by hydrus 1d for different land use types was set for the first layer in solute modeling during irrigation periods 2 2 2 lateral exchange calculation for different land use types an equation to describe the groundwater balance for different land use types can be expressed as 4 δ w i s y i δ h i a i i i f i p i w l f i e t g w i a i g d i where δw i is the change of groundwater storage for the i th land use type l3 δh i is the gwd change l i lf i and p i are the groundwater recharge from irrigation and rainfall l respectively a i is the corresponding area l2 w lf i is the groundwater lateral flow exchange l et gw i is the groundwater evapotranspiration l and g d i is the ditch drainage of groundwater l3 because other items could be calculated from the model simulation the w lf i was the only remaining item and can be obtained with eq 4 similarly the salt balance equation for groundwater system can be expressed as 5 w f i n i c f i n i w i n i i c i n i i i i f i c i f i e t g w i c g i s l f i a i g d i c d i where w ini i and w fin i are the initial and final volume storage of groundwater l3 respectively c ini i and c fin i are the initial and final tds concentration of groundwater m l 3 c if i c g i and c d i are the tds concentration of infiltration water groundwater and drainage water m l 3 respectively and s lf i is the mass of salt exchange through lateral groundwater flow m l 2 a positive value of s lf i means net inflow of salt to the i th land use type with a negative value meaning net outflow of salt similar to the w lf i the s lf i was the only remaining item and can be obtained with eq 5 2 3 model setup calibration and validation in the modflow the cultivated lands in yca were simplified into four different land use types based on the fragmented planting structure i e sunflower land maize land wheat land and watermelon land a uniform 10 m square cell was adopted horizontally in the model the aquifer system was discretized into 5 layers with thickness varying from 3 m to 10 m the aquifer was considered to be isotropic in the horizontal direction with vertical hydraulic conductivity being one tenth of the horizontal one d affonseca et al 2020 sathe and mahanta 2019 xu et al 2009 the hydraulic conductivity and solute transport parameters of five layers are assumed to be the same in this observation site bameng survey 1994 the parameters in vg model van genuchten et al 1992 was adopted in the expression of variable s y for the first layer the reference values for main hydraulic and solute transport parameters are presented in table 1 initial groundwater table and initial tds concentration of groundwater were set according the observed data on may 1st tds concentration of irrigation water was set to 0 5 g l 1 the elevation of field drain and collector drain were set to be about 0 5 m and 1 3 m lower than ground elevation of surrounding cultivated land respectively the simulation period covered whole plant growth season from may to september with very small regional hydraulic gradients and surrounded by drainage ditches the yca had a relatively closed groundwater system the irrigation canal in the northwest was considered as a flux boundary using rch package in the first layer the other three sides surrounded by drainage ditches i e collector drain in fig 1 were considered as drain boundaries using drn package in the first layer groundwater flow to field drainage ditches was also calculated using drn package in the first layer no flow boundary conditions were defined for the lower layers the recharge from irrigation infiltration in field and inner canal seepage were simulated by rch package the groundwater evapotranspiration et gw was considered as a head dependent flux boundary with using ets package a three segment linear function was used in ets package to describe the relationship between et gw and gwd the et gw decreased to zero when gwd reached the extinction depth d e with the link mt3dms lmt6 package the solute transport model mt3dms can be linked with modflow zheng et al 2001 to simulate salt transport in groundwater system the sources sinks from irrigation rainfall recharge and et gw were calculated using the sink and source mixing ssm package in mt3dms salt concentration of infiltration water into groundwater referred to the soil salinity concentration simulated by hydrus dualkc ren et al 2016 2017 the tds concentration of groundwater in the first layer was set as the evapotranspiration concentration model was calibrated and validated by the measured gwd data in 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition the volume of groundwater drainage by ditches was also used for model calibration statistical analysis indexes including determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were adopted to evaluate the simulation accuracy the definition of these indicators can refer to xu et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and groundwater dynamics fig 3 presented the comparison of simulated and measured gwds for four observation wells from may to september in 2012 and 2013 respectively the simulated gwds were in good agreement with the observed ones for calibration 2013 r 2 and nse were greater than 0 75 and 0 71 respectively and rmse was smaller than 27 cm for validation 2012 r 2 was greater than 0 60 rmse was less than 41 cm and nse varied at 0 41 0 70 table 2 in addition the simulated volume of groundwater drainage by ditches was 1964 m3 and 2316 m3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively it accounted for about 3 8 of total irrigation water each year which was consistent with the values of water salt balance analysis 4 by ren et al 2019b overall the simulation accuracy was acceptable and the calibrated model can be used to analyze the groundwater dynamics in yca results indicated that groundwater table often had large spatial variations during the irrigation period caused by non uniform irrigation in space for example fig 4 showed the spatial distribution of groundwater table and gwd in three different times i e before during and after irrigation during the third irrigation in 2013 the groundwater table rose quickly at irrigated fields and drove groundwater flowing into the unirrigated lands fig 4a june 30th calculation indicated that the hydraulic gradient was very significant and can reach to 1 in yca thus the local groundwater flow was far more intense than the traditional understanding on a regional scale for the hetao plain i e with the hydraulic gradient near 0 02 xu et al 2011 xue et al 2017 yue et al 2016 then groundwater table gradually dropped after irrigation and became flat fig 4a july 10th thus the lateral groundwater exchange among different land use types was every complicated and frequent in local scale like yca however this phenomenon could not be well reflected in many previous modeling studies with adopting large scale grids xu et al 2011 xue et al 2017 3 2 groundwater evapotranspiration the spatial distribution of groundwater evapotranspiration et gw is presented in fig 5 during the growing season for 2012 and 2013 the et gw was significant in shallow groundwater system it showed a strong variation for different land use types primarily due to the fragmented land use planting structure and different irrigation scheduling for different crops for crop lands the watermelon land had the highest et gw of about 186 mm and 211 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively the et gw for crop fields of maize wheat and sunflower were 177 mm 166 mm and 168 mm in 2012 respectively while the corresponding et gw were 189 mm 190 mm and 160 mm in 2013 respectively for the arid agricultural areas with shallow groundwater system the et gw was mainly consumed to supplement crop water use playing an important role in supporting agroecosystems as groundwater contribution for different crop lands the ratio of et gw to plant evapotranspiration varied from 0 30 to 0 37 and from 0 29 to 0 48 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the values were less than those reported by ghamarnia and jalili 2014 in arid western iran this was mainly related that the gwd was deeper in our observation case in particular the shallow groundwater system played an important role in supplementing crop water consumption and resisting drought during the irrigation interval the et gw in unirrigated natural land was about 202 mm and 223 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively with the ratio of et gw to plant evapotranspiration reaching to 0 40 and 0 47 the shallow groundwater played a critical role in supporting vegetation growth and maintaining biodiversity in natural lands the unirrigated natural patches had the highest et gw because it was mainly distributed in the low lying zones with average gwd shallower than that in cultivated lands about 20 40 cm shallower in yca furthermore the microrelief was also an important factor to affect et gw especially for the natural land such as the surface elevation of natural patch n 2 was about 20 40 cm higher than that of natural patch n 1 while the et gw for n 2 was around 60 90 mm smaller than that for n 1 in 2013 fig 5b our results implied that the reliability of et gw calculation was closely dependent on the land use accuracy and cell size division in groundwater modeling obviously the modeling studies with coarse grids on the regional scale may result in significant errors in et gw estimation under fragmented land use conditions e g with 200 m cell size in xu et al 2011 and with 1000 m cell size in xue et al 2017 3 3 lateral groundwater flow salt migration and dry drainage effect the spatial distribution of lateral water salt exchange of a column with the around columns for whole simulation period are presented in figs 6 and 7 calculated with eqs 4 and 5 it showed that salt migrated into natural patches along with lateral groundwater flow resulting in significant salt accumulation in natural patches the simulated water and salt balance for each land use type is presented in table 3 results showed that the lateral exchange of water salt were highly related to the irrigation depth with larger irrigation causing stronger lateral outflow for example sunflower lands had the largest irrigation depth i e 369 mm and 502 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively which caused large lateral groundwater flow out into the surrounding fields i e 2023 m3 and 6084 m3 of water outflow accompanied with 5447 kg and 15 596 kg of salt outflow in 2012 and 2013 respectively during the simulation period 3316 kg and 4103 kg of salt was drained out by ditches in 2012 and 2013 respectively accounting for 13 of salt introduced by canal irrigation table 3 the remaining salt was redistributed in areas of different land use types fig 8 the salt accumulated in crop lands was 9543 kg and 16 982 kg in 2012 and 2013 respectively being about 37 53 of total salt introduced by canal irrigation the salt accumulated in unirrigated natural lands was 10 185 kg and 8593 kg in 2012 and 2013 respectively the percentage was about 27 40 of total salt introduced by irrigation fig 8b which was basically similar to the results of ren et al 2019b using a water salt balance approach with detailed experiments but the value was less than that of wu et al 2009 on the regional scale and konukcu et al 2006 in the lower indus basin this was mainly because the proportion of natural land area or fallow land area to the total area was smaller in our study than that in wu et al 2009 and konukcu et al 2006 therefore for arid irrigated plain with fragmented land use and shallow groundwater system the natural land can be seen as an effective salt storage area for controlling salinity effects during plant growing seasons this dry drainage effect is of great significance for supporting the sustainability of arid agroecosystems in addition how to effectively utilize the dry drainage effect of natural lands and meantime to control salinity for maintaining ecological functions of natural vegetation was deserved to be studied in the follow up investigations 4 conclusion the modified modflow and mt3dms with the assistance of hydrus 1d were used to simulate groundwater flow and salt transport in a typical observation site i e yangchang canal system in hetao irrigation district of the arid upper yellow river basin based on the detailed experiment observation data a detailed local scale groundwater model was established and calibrated for the yca and it was sufficient to characterize local groundwater behaviors for arid irrigated areas with shallow groundwater and fragmented land use the case study fully presented the multiple roles of shallow groundwater system in arid irrigated plains the main conclusions were as follows 1 the fragmented land use pattern with different irrigation scheduling resulted in intense lateral flow in shallow phreatic aquifer during irrigation the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater can reach to 1 was significant on a local scale being much larger than the traditional understanding on a regional scale 2 the groundwater contribution through groundwater evapotranspiration et gw played an important role in supplementing crop water use and resisting drought during irrigation interval with the ratio of et gw to crop water use being 0 29 0 48 in particular groundwater contribution played a critical role in supporting vegetation growth and maintaining biodiversity in natural lands with the ratio of et gw to natural plant water consumption being about 0 40 0 47 besides et gw presented a strong spatial distribution for different land use types which was largely affected by local microrelief and 3 the significant lateral groundwater flow drove salt migrating from the cultivated land to surrounding natural patches the salt mass accumulated in natural lands reached to 27 40 of total salt mass introduced by irrigation playing a significant role in dry drainage effect overall our study provided a thorough quantitative understanding of multiple behaviors of shallow groundwater system with fragmented land use types and also meaningful implications in improving irrigation and drainage management in arid irrigated plains like hetao in addition our modeling work further emphasized the reliable groundwater modeling in such areas was quite dependent on the detailed model generalization and the accurate information of land use distribution irrigation scheduling and local microrelief declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was

10147,in north china plain straw mulching is increasingly applied to the succeeding crops with winter wheat summer maize double cropping system however research results on the effect of maize straw mulching on the yield of winter wheat are inconsistent and the underlying mechanism of the effect remains unclear such information is helpful to guide the field water management for higher yield in this study soil moisture plant growth photosynthesis and yield of winter wheat field treated with no till and straw mulching sm and non mulching n and three irrigation amounts high middle and low irrigation hi mi and li in four growing seasons in 2013 2016 the results showed that straw mulching improved soil moisture by reducing the days of soil moisture less than 60 field capacity for 2 10 days straw mulching increased net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance maximum carboxylation rate v cmax and the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport j max of flag leaves especially at the post anthesis measurements during which the above parameters increased by 20 6 21 9 28 7 and 25 2 respectively compared with pre anthesis measurements the post anthesis v cmax and j max values decreased but the decrease percentage of the sm treatments 10 8 25 7 for v cmax and 22 0 49 6 for j max was less than those of n treatments 19 6 41 4 for v cmax and 29 3 61 3 for j max v cmax and j max were significantly linear correlating to leaf nitrogen content and the relationships between them were not affected by straw mulching the yield was not affected by straw mulching however straw mulching significantly increased the intercept of the linear relationship between yield and canopy potential photosynthetic capacity the productions of leaf area index and v cmax or j max indicating that straw mulching may improve the harvest index of winter wheat the overall net eﬀect of straw mulching was a favorable environment that stimulated plant photosynthesis which compensated the lower lai and tiller density in turn maintained wheat yield this study elucidated the physiological basis of straw mulching and no till effect on yield and provided photosynthetic parameters of winter wheat under such soil management keywords straw mulching winter wheat soil moisture photosynthesis yield 1 introduction with the traditional winter wheat summer maize double cropping system the north china plain produces 50 of the total wheat production and 35 of the total maize production in china du et al 2010 instead of normally crop residues burning which is a main source of air pollution straw mulching is increasingly applied to the succeeding crops with the rapidly rising use of combine harvesters wang et al 2018 guan et al 2020 such agronomic measure to some extent alleviates air pollution reduces soil evaporation and improves water use efficiency in this area fang et al 2011 crop growth and yield response to straw mulch is relatively complex and influenced by interactions between mulch mass and factors such as crop species irrigation method and irrigation scheduling xiao et al 2019 accordingly straw mulch does not always increase yields most studies show that wheat straw mulching in this area increased the yield of summer maize yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however some studies have shown that maize straw mulching can lead to winter wheat crop yield reduction because it reduces soil temperature during the early growing season li et al 2008 chen et al 2013 in other studies where the soil water for the plant was limited straw mulching increased wheat yield because of the increased soil moisture and soil organic matter ram et al 2013 yang et al 2020 whereas no till usually increased the soil compaction and limits the plant roots growth and plant physiology tubeileh et al 2003 and was applied to reduce soil erosion it seems that the effects of straw mulching and no till depend on the available water amount to date there are few studies with clear physiological explanation for the effect of maize straw mulching and no till on winter wheat grain yield under different irrigation scheduling understanding how straw mulching affecting photosynthetic physiological processes and the link between such effects and crop yield will help to maximize the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of soil management on wheat yield net photosynthesis rate a n of flag leaf around anthesis is important for yield as higher pre anthesis and post anthesis a n increase photosynthetic efficiency when flag leaves are most active and at a critical stage for grain filling carmo silva et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in addition to the diurnal time course of leaf photosynthetic gas exchange measurements two important modeled parameters maximum rubisco carboxylation activity v cmax and electron transport rate j max while these parameters require more than a single point measurement of gas exchange parameters show promise as robust traits to assess photosynthetic capacity in c3 plants condon et al 2004 as mentioned previously maize straw mulching to winter wheat is usually reported to decrease the soil temperature resulting in lessen tiller and delaying grain filling which has negative effects on yield chen et al 2007 li et al 2008 on the other hand there are also studies reporting that straw mulching delaying the flag leaf senescence which may support higher photosynthesis capacity during the grain filling period and have positive effects on yield wang et al 2012 yin et al 2016 however it is not clear that whether the photosynthesis assimilation of the long flag leaf lifespan will compensate the drawbacks of straw mulching such as the lower tiller density and late starting of the grain filling and keep or increase gain yield it is widely reported that the photosynthetic parameter is related to leaf nitrogen content because of the large allocations of leaf nitrogen to rubisco and other photosynthesis related enzymes and organelles evans 1983 evans and clarke 2019 among diverse species within or among ecosystems the correlations between photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen are generally linear when both are expressed on a mass basis wright et al 2004 the relationships between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content are affected by environmental factors such as macronutrients reich et al 2009 and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ellsworth et al 2004 single or multiple impacts of straw mulching on soil nutrients soil water content and temperature and may be canopy air humidity may shift the correlation line between photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen a previous study of the same area in maize with wheat straw mulching showed that the leaf nitrogen use efficiency the ratio of photosynthetic capacity to leaf nitrogen is higher under straw mulching even though there was no significant increase of leaf nitrogen content in straw mulching treatment zhang et al 2019 while maize is a c4 plant which has different photosynthetic enzymes and biochemistry processes with c3 plant winter wheat to assimilate carbon we still do not know for winter wheat how the photosynthetic parameter and leaf nitrogen correlation will respond to such microenvironment changing with straw mulching in this study winter wheat photosynthesis and yield in north china plain was studied under the straw mulching sm and non mulching n treatments and three irrigation amounts high middle and low irrigation hi mi and li in four growing seasons in 2013 2016 the following questions need to be answered 1 how do the photosynthetic parameters such as a n v cmax and j max respond to straw mulching 2 is the relationships between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content affected by straw mulching 3 whether or not straw mulching can maintain the yield of winter wheat under different irrigation amounts in this area and 4 how the yield can be explained by photosynthetic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site the research site located at the agricultural water conservation irrigation experiment station of the chinese institute of water resources and hydropower research in the daxing district of beijing china 39 39 n 116 15 e the mean annual precipitation from 1980 to 2012 was about 540 mm only about 30 of which occurs in the winter wheat growth

overall pre a v cmax and j max were higher than post a values with only one exception of v cmax of li treatment in 2013 when pre a v cmax were slightly lower than those of post a comparing to the pre

respectively among all the treatments v cmax and j max of hi sm treatment were the highest ranging from 135 9 to 157 3 and 274 9 389 3 μmol m 2 s 1 for pre a measurements and from 125 5 to 147 6 and

light saturated a n of hi n treatments 24 7 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 2 determined by this study fell in the middle range of pre anthesis light saturated a n a sat measurement value 21 2 31 1 μmol m 2 s 1 for 64 winter wheat cultivars carmo silva et al 2017 that value of post anthesis 15 8 μmol m 2 s 1 was slightly lower than the post anthesis a sat range 17 1 23 1 μmol m 2 s 1 of the carmo silva et al 2017 data and fell in the range of the midday a n during the grain filling stage 11 8 23 μmol m 2 s 1 of 16 wheat cultivars grown in a warm irrigated environment reynolds et al 2000 reported wheat v cmax varied a wide range because of diverse cultivars or genotypes different growing temperature and soil water content etc the average value of pre anthesis v cmax of hi n treatments 145 7 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 determined by this study is higher than the listed value 83 μmol m 2 s 1 in a review in the 1990s wullschleger 1993 close to the upper range of pre anthesis v cmax measurement value about 145 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 6a in the literature for 64 winter wheat cultivars carmo silva et al 2017 and lower than that measured on well watered wheat during the early grain filling stage 157 3 μmol m 2 s 1 aljazairi and nogués 2015 middle and low irrigation treatments reduced a n while straw mulching treatment increased it fig 2 a n responding to water deficit has been considered and studied for a long time some common viewpoints have been reported in literature it is generally believed that the main reason for light or mild water deficit is the reduction of stomatal conductance which limits the photosynthetic rate liu et al 2016 for severe water deficit biochemical factors and stomatal factors jointly limit the photosynthetic rate martin and ruiz torres 1992 perdomo et al 2017 in this study the decrease of a n in low irrigation treatment was related to both the decrease of gs fig 3 and the decrease of v cmax and j max figs 4 and 5 because of the decrease of the absolute values under li water treatments sm increased the v cmax and j max by more percentages 30 5 and 28 7 than those under hi water treatments 17 5 and 14 1 for the post anthesis measurements there were no interactions between soil management and irrigation amount observed although these results are confirmatory the similarity of values in photosynthesis parameters measured in our study and from literatures lend confidence to the novel finding that there was a shift of relationships between yield and photosynthetic characters caused by straw mulching such results could explain the reason for winter wheat yield being maintained under maize straw mulching 4 2 carboxylation rate increased by straw mulching compared to the n treatments significantly or marginally significant higher v cmax and j max of sm treatments were observed in the post anthesis measurements in this study figs 4 and 5 the effects of straw mulching on photosynthetic parameters were the comprehensive effects of soil moisture soil temperature and other favorable change of plant canopy due to the above mentioned factors firstly we found that the soil water status of the sm treatments was better than those of the n treatment under the same irrigation treatment the days of soil water content lower than 60 soil water stress starts to blow this level allen et al 1998 of the mulching treatment were 5 10 days less than that of the non mulched treatment fig 1 also straw mulching can reduce soil temperature and may be beneficial to crop growth in the middle and late growth stages due to the high air temperature in the middle and late growth period a slight reduction of soil temperature may be a benefit to the growth of crops verhulst et al 2011 pavlů et al 2021 thirdly under the above comprehensive factors straw mulching significantly increased flag leaf nitrogen content thus improving photosynthetic parameters fig 6 previous studies have reported that certain measures such as late sowing yin et al 2019 reduced sowing seeds rate hu et al 2018 ridge tillage and mulching treatment li et al 2018 or drought priming in the vegetative growth stage cui et al 2019 resulted in lai decrease during the reproductive growth stage such decrease of lai improved the light condition of the flag leaf to some extent and increased flag leaf nitrogen content or total chlorophyll to improve the photosynthetic capacity at anthesis or filling stage the increase of leaf nitrogen content of sm treatments in our study may also be related to the lower lai lai of sm treatments was lower than that of n treatment in different degrees under all water treatments marginally significant mulching effect on lai was observed in two years table 2 the decrease of tiller number caused by the decrease of the soil temperature at the early growth stage under straw mulching may lead to the decrease of tiller density at the anthesis stage which was also a possible reason for the decrease of lai the relationships between v cmax and n mass and between j max and n mass were found to be linear in all the treatments fig 6 following numerous studies evans 1983 evans and clarke 2019 and straw mulching did not change these relationships such results confirmed the enhancement of the photosynthetic parameters was related to the increase of the leaf nitrogen content the enhancement of photosynthesis parameters was important to compensate for some drawbacks on yield caused by straw mulching and to explain the unaffecting winter wheat yield on which we will focus the following discussion 4 3 yield maintained under straw mulching unlike the commonly reported limitation of water deficit on crop yield zivcak et al 2013 cui et al 2015 the effect of straw mulching on wheat yield is inconsistent and complex with interactions of multiple factors kader et al 2017 straw mulching generally moderate soil temperature chen et al 2007 li et al 2008 decrease soil water evaporation zribi et al 2015 thus retaining soil moisture ram et al 2013 and improved soil nutrients mainly soil organic carbon pathak et al 2006 xu et al 2019 among these reduction of soil temperature in the early spring is usually considered delaying wheat growth and may have negative effects on yield other effects of straw mulching listed above are commonly confirmed as having positive effects on yield whether the yield will increase under straw mulching depends on which effects are prevailing previously study showed that by increasing spike number wide precision planting combined with straw mulching has the potential to mitigate the winter wheat grain yield reduction previously observed with straw mulching in the north china plain liu et al 2017 this study showed that both middle and low irrigation treatments affect wheat yield however for mulching treatment even though the lai and tiller density of sm treatment decreased two out of four years the yield did not significantly decrease table 2 the possible reason for such results was that the increase of photosynthetic capacity v cmax and j max figs 4 and 5 and net photosynthetic rate fig 2 of sm treatment compensated for the decrease of the photosynthetic area and thus maintained the yield even photosynthetic traits were measured in plants under near ideal conditions with uniform leaf illumination unlike the variable conditions prevailing during growth in the field significant positive correlation between yield and flag leaf photosynthetic parameters is often reported in wheat gaju et al 2016 carmo silva et al 2017 suggesting the importance of the flag leaf photosynthesis to grain filling and yield our result confirmed that there was a significant correlation between yield and the maximum canopy carbon assimilation potential v cmax x lai and j max x lai fig 7 moreover the observed elevated interception of the relationships by straw mulching indicated that the harvest index increased to some extent although the physiological mechanism of such results needs further study lower tiller density results from low seeding rate hu et al 2018 or late sowing yin et al 2018 were reported showing a higher harvest index other traits relating to yield increase including delaying the onset of post anthesis senescence and keeping higher flag leaf photosynthetic parameters during the grain filling period gaju et al 2011 shi et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in this study compared with pre anthesis measurements the fact that the post anthesis v cmax and j max values of the sm treatments decreased less than those of n treatments may be another explanation of the yield maintenance of straw mulching treatments 5 conclusions through four years of continuous field experiments we were able to show that winter wheat yield was not significantly reduced by maize straw mulching and no till under all irrigation treatments and explore the reason of such yield maintenance was that there was a shift of relationships between yield and photosynthetic characters by straw mulching compared to non mulching treatments straw mulching improved the soil moisture status and significantly reduced the days with soil water content less than 60 fc the maximum carboxylation rate and the maximum electron transfer rate of flag leaf especially the post anthesis values increased significantly such increase of photosynthetic parameters was significantly correlated with leaf nitrogen content but straw mulching did not change the above relationships the yield was significantly affected by water treatment and the yield of low water treatment was significantly reduced although straw mulching significantly reduced lai and tiller density at the anthesis stage the yield of straw mulching was not significantly lower than that of non mulching treatments our results also showed that there was a significant positive correlation between yield and canopy photosynthetic potential straw mulching and no till significantly increased the intercept of the relationship indicating that the comprehensive effect of such soil management may improve the harvest index of winter wheat in summary the overall net eﬀect of straw mulching and no till was a favorable environment that stimulated plant photosynthesis which compensated the lower lai and tiller density in turn maintained wheat yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10147,in north china plain straw mulching is increasingly applied to the succeeding crops with winter wheat summer maize double cropping system however research results on the effect of maize straw mulching on the yield of winter wheat are inconsistent and the underlying mechanism of the effect remains unclear such information is helpful to guide the field water management for higher yield in this study soil moisture plant growth photosynthesis and yield of winter wheat field treated with no till and straw mulching sm and non mulching n and three irrigation amounts high middle and low irrigation hi mi and li in four growing seasons in 2013 2016 the results showed that straw mulching improved soil moisture by reducing the days of soil moisture less than 60 field capacity for 2 10 days straw mulching increased net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance maximum carboxylation rate v cmax and the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport j max of flag leaves especially at the post anthesis measurements during which the above parameters increased by 20 6 21 9 28 7 and 25 2 respectively compared with pre anthesis measurements the post anthesis v cmax and j max values decreased but the decrease percentage of the sm treatments 10 8 25 7 for v cmax and 22 0 49 6 for j max was less than those of n treatments 19 6 41 4 for v cmax and 29 3 61 3 for j max v cmax and j max were significantly linear correlating to leaf nitrogen content and the relationships between them were not affected by straw mulching the yield was not affected by straw mulching however straw mulching significantly increased the intercept of the linear relationship between yield and canopy potential photosynthetic capacity the productions of leaf area index and v cmax or j max indicating that straw mulching may improve the harvest index of winter wheat the overall net eﬀect of straw mulching was a favorable environment that stimulated plant photosynthesis which compensated the lower lai and tiller density in turn maintained wheat yield this study elucidated the physiological basis of straw mulching and no till effect on yield and provided photosynthetic parameters of winter wheat under such soil management keywords straw mulching winter wheat soil moisture photosynthesis yield 1 introduction with the traditional winter wheat summer maize double cropping system the north china plain produces 50 of the total wheat production and 35 of the total maize production in china du et al 2010 instead of normally crop residues burning which is a main source of air pollution straw mulching is increasingly applied to the succeeding crops with the rapidly rising use of combine harvesters wang et al 2018 guan et al 2020 such agronomic measure to some extent alleviates air pollution reduces soil evaporation and improves water use efficiency in this area fang et al 2011 crop growth and yield response to straw mulch is relatively complex and influenced by interactions between mulch mass and factors such as crop species irrigation method and irrigation scheduling xiao et al 2019 accordingly straw mulch does not always increase yields most studies show that wheat straw mulching in this area increased the yield of summer maize yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however some studies have shown that maize straw mulching can lead to winter wheat crop yield reduction because it reduces soil temperature during the early growing season li et al 2008 chen et al 2013 in other studies where the soil water for the plant was limited straw mulching increased wheat yield because of the increased soil moisture and soil organic matter ram et al 2013 yang et al 2020 whereas no till usually increased the soil compaction and limits the plant roots growth and plant physiology tubeileh et al 2003 and was applied to reduce soil erosion it seems that the effects of straw mulching and no till depend on the available water amount to date there are few studies with clear physiological explanation for the effect of maize straw mulching and no till on winter wheat grain yield under different irrigation scheduling understanding how straw mulching affecting photosynthetic physiological processes and the link between such effects and crop yield will help to maximize the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of soil management on wheat yield net photosynthesis rate a n of flag leaf around anthesis is important for yield as higher pre anthesis and post anthesis a n increase photosynthetic efficiency when flag leaves are most active and at a critical stage for grain filling carmo silva et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in addition to the diurnal time course of leaf photosynthetic gas exchange measurements two important modeled parameters maximum rubisco carboxylation activity v cmax and electron transport rate j max while these parameters require more than a single point measurement of gas exchange parameters show promise as robust traits to assess photosynthetic capacity in c3 plants condon et al 2004 as mentioned previously maize straw mulching to winter wheat is usually reported to decrease the soil temperature resulting in lessen tiller and delaying grain filling which has negative effects on yield chen et al 2007 li et al 2008 on the other hand there are also studies reporting that straw mulching delaying the flag leaf senescence which may support higher photosynthesis capacity during the grain filling period and have positive effects on yield wang et al 2012 yin et al 2016 however it is not clear that whether the photosynthesis assimilation of the long flag leaf lifespan will compensate the drawbacks of straw mulching such as the lower tiller density and late starting of the grain filling and keep or increase gain yield it is widely reported that the photosynthetic parameter is related to leaf nitrogen content because of the large allocations of leaf nitrogen to rubisco and other photosynthesis related enzymes and organelles evans 1983 evans and clarke 2019 among diverse species within or among ecosystems the correlations between photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen are generally linear when both are expressed on a mass basis wright et al 2004 the relationships between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content are affected by environmental factors such as macronutrients reich et al 2009 and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ellsworth et al 2004 single or multiple impacts of straw mulching on soil nutrients soil water content and temperature and may be canopy air humidity may shift the correlation line between photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen a previous study of the same area in maize with wheat straw mulching showed that the leaf nitrogen use efficiency the ratio of photosynthetic capacity to leaf nitrogen is higher under straw mulching even though there was no significant increase of leaf nitrogen content in straw mulching treatment zhang et al 2019 while maize is a c4 plant which has different photosynthetic enzymes and biochemistry processes with c3 plant winter wheat to assimilate carbon we still do not know for winter wheat how the photosynthetic parameter and leaf nitrogen correlation will respond to such microenvironment changing with straw mulching in this study winter wheat photosynthesis and yield in north china plain was studied under the straw mulching sm and non mulching n treatments and three irrigation amounts high middle and low irrigation hi mi and li in four growing seasons in 2013 2016 the following questions need to be answered 1 how do the photosynthetic parameters such as a n v cmax and j max respond to straw mulching 2 is the relationships between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content affected by straw mulching 3 whether or not straw mulching can maintain the yield of winter wheat under different irrigation amounts in this area and 4 how the yield can be explained by photosynthetic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site the research site located at the agricultural water conservation irrigation experiment station of the chinese institute of water resources and

according to equation chen et al 1995 eq 1 1 q i h θ up θ low p η where h is the designed moisture layer of soil cm p is the percentage of wetting area which was taken to be 0 6 in this study and η is the application efficiency drip irrigation often assumed to be 95 θ up and θ low are the upper and lower limits of soil water content respectively cm3cm 3 which were taken to be 95 70 85 60 and 75 50 of the field capacity for the hi mi and li treatments the θ low was set according to literature in which water stress was reported occurring when soil water content lower than 60 65 of the field capacity allen et al 1998 liu et al 2016 with this scheduling irrigation rates for each time were the same but the irrigation frequency was different among irrigation treatments with li and mi treatments receiving fewer times of irrigation comparing to hi treatment thus the total irrigation amount was different among the three water treatments during the experiment period the hi mi and li were irrigated 4 5 101 178 mm 3 4 84 135 mm and 2 3 58 118 mm times respectively during the pse to harvest stages for the four seasons the precipitation amount during the pse to harvest stages for all

li 6400 licor inc lincoln ne usa in 2015 the diurnal time course of leaf photosynthetic gas exchange was assessed with measurements taken across all replicate plots every few hours throughout the day twice pre and post anthesis during the reproductive stages the net rate of photosynthetic co2 assimilation a n μmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance g s mol m 2 s 1 were measured the response of a n versus the intercellular co2 concentrations a n ci was measured on flag leaf twice a year pre and post anthesis in all four seasons to examine the effects of straw mulch and water treatment on the maximum apparent rate of the rubisco carboxylation activity v cmax and the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport j max the a n ci were measured from 9 00 to 14 00 with the photosynthetic

regression procedure developed by sharkey et al 2007 was used to simulate v cmax and j max due to the limitation of the time consuming measurements three plots were selected randomly two leaves from each plot were measured as replicates at every measurement campaign after the measurement of a n ci curves the leaf nitrogen content on a mass basis dry weight n content percentage n mass was determined with titration by kieldahl azotometer refer to zhang et al 2019 for sampling preparing details 2 5 tiller density leaf area index and yield leaf area index lai and the tiller density td

linear model was also applied when analyzing treatment effects of v cmax and j max in 2012 2016 with straw mulching treatment water treatment and their interaction included in the model and measuring dates were analyzed independently when analyzing the relationship between v cmax j max and n mass and between y and the productions of v cmax and lai j max and lai the covariance analysis of spss17 0 software was applied to determine whether there was a significant difference in the slope and intercept of regression lines between sm and n treatments sigma plot12 0 software was applied for making figures in this manuscript because of the high variability of the field data p values above 0 05 and lower than 0 1 were also given in figures to show the marginally significant difference except for

overall pre a v cmax and j max were higher than post a values with only one exception of v cmax of li treatment in 2013 when pre a v cmax were slightly lower than those of post a comparing to the pre

respectively among all the treatments v cmax and j max of hi sm treatment were the highest ranging from 135 9 to 157 3 and 274 9 389 3 μmol m 2 s 1 for pre a measurements and from 125 5 to 147 6 and

light saturated a n of hi n treatments 24 7 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 2 determined by this study fell in the middle range of pre anthesis light saturated a n a sat measurement value 21 2 31 1 μmol m 2 s 1 for 64 winter wheat cultivars carmo silva et al 2017 that value of post anthesis 15 8 μmol m 2 s 1 was slightly lower than the post anthesis a sat range 17 1 23 1 μmol m 2 s 1 of the carmo silva et al

cmax varied a wide range because of diverse cultivars or genotypes different growing temperature and soil water content etc the average value of pre anthesis v cmax of hi n treatments 145 7 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 determined by this study is higher than the listed value 83 μmol m 2 s 1 in a review in the 1990s wullschleger 1993 close to the upper range of pre anthesis v cmax measurement value about 145 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 6a in the literature for 64 winter wheat cultivars carmo silva et al 2017 and lower than that measured on well watered wheat during the early grain filling stage 157 3 μmol m 2 s 1 aljazairi and nogués 2015 middle and low irrigation treatments reduced a n while straw mulching treatment increased it fig 2 a n responding to water deficit has been considered and studied for a long time some common viewpoints have been reported in literature it is generally believed that the main reason for light or mild water deficit is the reduction of stomatal conductance which limits the photosynthetic rate liu et al 2016 for severe water deficit biochemical factors and stomatal factors jointly limit the photosynthetic rate martin and ruiz torres 1992 perdomo et al 2017 in this study the decrease of a n in low irrigation treatment was related to both the decrease of gs fig 3 and the decrease of v cmax and j max figs 4 and 5 because of the decrease of the absolute values under li water treatments sm increased the v cmax and j max by more percentages 30 5 and 28 7 than those under hi water treatments 17 5 and 14 1 for the post anthesis measurements there were no interactions between soil management and irrigation amount observed although these results are confirmatory the similarity of values in photosynthesis parameters measured in our study and from literatures lend confidence to the novel finding that there was a shift of relationships between yield and photosynthetic characters caused by straw mulching such results could explain the reason for winter wheat yield being maintained under maize straw mulching 4 2 carboxylation rate increased by straw mulching compared to the n treatments significantly or marginally significant higher v cmax and j max of sm treatments were observed in the post anthesis measurements in this study figs 4 and 5 the effects of straw mulching on photosynthetic parameters were the comprehensive effects of soil moisture soil temperature and other favorable change of plant canopy due to the above mentioned factors firstly we found that the soil water status of the sm treatments was better than those of the n treatment under the same irrigation treatment the days of soil water content lower than 60 soil water stress starts to blow this level allen et al 1998 of the mulching treatment were 5 10 days less than that of the non mulched treatment fig 1 also straw mulching can reduce soil temperature and may be beneficial to crop growth in the middle and late growth stages due to the high air temperature in the middle and late growth period a slight reduction of soil temperature may be a benefit to the growth of crops verhulst et al 2011 pavlů et al 2021 thirdly under the above comprehensive factors straw mulching significantly increased flag leaf nitrogen content thus improving photosynthetic parameters fig 6 previous studies have reported that certain measures such as late sowing yin et al 2019 reduced sowing seeds rate hu et al 2018 ridge tillage and mulching treatment li et al 2018 or drought priming in the vegetative growth stage cui et al 2019 resulted in lai decrease during the reproductive growth stage such decrease of lai improved the light condition of the flag leaf to some extent and increased flag leaf nitrogen content or total chlorophyll to improve the photosynthetic capacity at anthesis or filling stage the increase of leaf nitrogen content of sm treatments in our study may also be related to the lower lai lai of sm treatments was lower than that of n treatment in different degrees under all water treatments marginally significant mulching effect on lai was observed in two years table 2 the decrease of tiller number caused by the decrease of the soil temperature at the early growth stage under straw mulching may lead to the decrease of tiller density at the anthesis stage which was also a possible reason for the decrease of lai the relationships between v cmax and n mass and between j max and n mass were found to be linear in all the treatments fig 6 following numerous studies evans 1983 evans and clarke 2019 and straw mulching did not change these relationships such results confirmed the enhancement of the photosynthetic parameters was related to the increase of the leaf nitrogen content the enhancement of photosynthesis parameters was important to compensate for some drawbacks on yield caused by straw mulching and to explain the unaffecting winter wheat yield on which we will focus the following discussion 4 3 yield maintained under straw mulching unlike the commonly reported limitation of water deficit on crop yield zivcak et al 2013 cui et al 2015 the effect of straw mulching on wheat yield is inconsistent and complex with interactions of multiple factors kader et al 2017 straw mulching generally moderate soil temperature chen et al 2007 li et al 2008 decrease soil water evaporation zribi et al 2015 thus retaining soil moisture ram et al 2013 and improved soil nutrients mainly soil organic carbon pathak et al 2006 xu et al 2019 among these reduction of soil temperature in the early spring is usually considered delaying wheat growth and may have negative effects on yield other effects of straw mulching listed above are commonly confirmed as having positive effects on yield whether the yield will increase under straw mulching depends on which effects are prevailing previously study showed that by increasing spike number wide precision planting combined with straw mulching has the potential to mitigate the winter wheat grain yield reduction previously observed with straw mulching in the north china plain liu et al 2017 this study showed that both middle and low irrigation treatments affect wheat yield however for mulching treatment even though the lai and tiller density of sm treatment decreased two out of four years the yield did not significantly decrease table 2 the possible reason for such results was that the increase of photosynthetic capacity v cmax and j max figs 4 and 5 and net photosynthetic rate fig 2 of sm treatment compensated for the decrease of the photosynthetic area and thus maintained the yield even photosynthetic traits were measured in plants under near ideal conditions with uniform leaf illumination unlike the variable conditions prevailing during growth in the field significant positive correlation between yield and flag leaf photosynthetic parameters is often reported in wheat gaju et al 2016 carmo silva et al 2017 suggesting the importance of the flag leaf photosynthesis to grain filling and yield our result confirmed that there was a significant correlation between yield and the maximum canopy carbon assimilation potential v cmax x lai and j max x lai fig 7 moreover the observed elevated interception of the relationships by straw mulching indicated that the harvest index increased to some extent although the physiological mechanism of such results needs further study lower tiller density results from low seeding rate hu et al 2018 or late sowing yin et al 2018 were reported showing a higher harvest index other traits relating to yield increase including delaying the onset of post anthesis senescence and keeping higher flag leaf photosynthetic parameters during the grain filling period gaju et al 2011 shi et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in this study compared with pre anthesis measurements the fact that the post anthesis v cmax and j max values of the sm treatments decreased less than those of n treatments may be another explanation of the yield maintenance of straw mulching treatments 5 conclusions through four years of continuous field experiments we were able to show that winter wheat yield was not significantly reduced by maize straw mulching and no till under all irrigation treatments and explore the reason of such yield maintenance was that there was a shift of relationships between yield and photosynthetic characters by straw mulching compared to non mulching treatments straw mulching improved the soil moisture status and significantly reduced the days with soil water content less than 60 fc the maximum carboxylation rate and the maximum electron transfer rate of flag leaf especially the post anthesis values increased significantly such increase of photosynthetic parameters was significantly correlated with leaf nitrogen content but straw mulching did not change the above relationships the yield was significantly affected by water treatment and the yield of low water treatment was significantly reduced although straw mulching significantly reduced lai and tiller density at the anthesis stage the yield of straw mulching was not significantly lower than that of non mulching treatments our results also showed that there was a significant positive correlation between yield and canopy photosynthetic potential straw mulching and no till significantly increased the intercept of the relationship indicating that the comprehensive effect of such soil management may improve the harvest index of winter wheat in summary the overall net eﬀect of straw mulching and no till was a favorable environment that stimulated plant photosynthesis which compensated the lower lai and tiller density in turn maintained wheat yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by the ministry of

because of their positive effects on people s well being and health romo muñoz et al 2020 in chile blueberry production has increased during the last year concentrating 20 of worldwide production brazelton and young 2017 the total planted area was 19 000 ha in 2019 with mainly highbush and rabbiteye blueberries ciren 2020 the blueberry orchards are mainly located in mediterranean climate areas having high atmospheric demand for water vapor and scarce precipitation during the spring and summer period in addition rainfall has significantly decreased since 2010 due to a mega drought limiting the water availability for irrigation in mediterranean regions garreaud et al 2020 under these water scarcity conditions irrigation management strategies are required in blueberry production to avoid plant water stress that negatively affects yield and fruit quality carrasco benavides et al 2020 del pozo et al 2019 rabbiteye blueberry is well adapted to semi arid conditions but it is sensitive to soil water deficit it is characterized by its low water absorption capacity shallow root system lack of root hairs and high water requirements for profitable production bryla et al 2011 gough 1994 soil moisture is the most important factor affecting blueberry root growth and any water deficit negatively affects vegetative growth and fruit production bryla and strik 2007 bryla et al 2011 holzapfel et al 2004 spiers 1998a 1998b thus irrigation management has become an important decision making tool for improving water productivity wp kg m 3 without compromising yield or fruit quality ortega farias et al 2012 evidence has demonstrated significant reductions in fruit size and yield losses under severe water stress conditions depending on the cultivar less frequent irrigation and drought periods from one to three weeks decreased the leaf water potential ψleaf from 0 3 to 1 6 mpa which significantly reduced the yield and dry weight of the plants mingeau et al 2001 bryla and strik 2007 additionally water stress induces stomatal closure and diminishes co2 assimilation with consequent yield losses for highbush blueberries lee et al 2006 reported that the ψleaf and co2 assimilation rate an decreased from 1 07 to 1 79 mpa and from 8 84 to 4 6 µmol m 2 s 1 respectively after withholding water for seven days for lowbush blueberries glass et al 2005 observed values of midday stem water potential ψstem ranging from 1 45 to 1 41 mpa for stressed plants irrigated at 75 of crop evapotranspiration etc for well irrigated highbush blueberries at different plant densities bryla and strik 2007 recorded ψstem values ranging from 0 5 to 0 4 mpa at the end of spring and from 1 6 to 1 4 mpa at harvest blueberries are also susceptible to over irrigation which reduces root activity increases soil erosion and nutrient leaching and increases the prevalence of fungal diseases such as phytophthora root rot bryla and linderman 2007 bryla et al 2008 2011 starr et al 2004 the effects of under or overirrigation on yield fruit quality and water productivity depends on weather conditions site cultivar age spacing and irrigation method among other factors for the young highbush blueberry cultivar duke ehret et al 2012 found that compared to moderate irrigation treatments soil matric potential ψm from 20 to 50 kpa over irrigation ψm from 20 to 25 kpa significantly reduced fruit firmness and the soluble solids of the fruits in addition total yields were not significantly different between over and moderately irrigated plants but they were significantly greater than those in a rainfed treatment ψm from 20 to 90 kpa in this case yields were 6 3 6 6 and 6 0 kg plant 1 for the overirrigated moderately irrigated and rainfed treatments respectively for six year old plants ehret et al 2015 found no difference in berry weight fruit firmness or soluble solids for plants irrigated under moderated irrigation total water application twa between 150 and 170 l plant 1 year 1 and overirrigation twa between 300 and 340 l plant 1 year 1 treatments in a two year experiment carried out in nursery plants of the northern highbush blueberry cultivar elliott bryla et al 2011 found that plants drip irrigated at 100 etc twa 289 mm year 1 had a superior yield and berry weight compared to plants irrigated at 150 etc twa 411 163 mm year 1 which showed a reduction in growth new canes and cane dry weight in the same study the wp for plants irrigated at 50 etc twa 104 mm year 1 was 54 higher than those watered at 100 etc but the yield and berry weight were significantly reduced by water restriction in summary the scheduling of irrigation in blueberry orchards must be done to avoid over and under irrigation to optimize yield and fruit quality in chile for a seven year experiment with highbush blueberries cv bluetta holzapfel et al 2004 reported no significant differences in berry weight among plants irrigated at 33 twa 208 3 mm year 1 100 twa 624 9 mm year 1 and 133 etc twa 833 2 mm year 1 these authors pointed out that yield was reduced when water was applied at a rate of 200 mm year 1 3 6 t ha 1 and remained relatively constant when water was applied at a rate of 600 mm year 1 6 8 t ha 1 for a commercial drip irrigated rabbiteye blueberry vaccinium virgatum bonita orchard ortega farías 2013 found that plants irrigated at 80 etc twa 270 mm year 1 presented the highest yield 12 3 t ha 1 and wp 4 3 kg m 3 in this study the water application of 40 and 120 etc significantly reduced yield and wp corroborating that under or overirrigation had negative effects on blueberry yield in a drip irrigated highbush blueberry cv brigitta experiment lobos et al 2016 2018 indicated that depending on the growing season the application of 75 etc twa between 180 and 200 mm produced a similar yield 4 8 kg plant 1 berry weight 1 6 g fruit 1 and wp 6 9 kg m 3 as the application of 100 etc plants irrigated at 50 etc produced less yield 3 0 kg plant 1 and berry weight 1 4 g fruit 1 but higher wp 7 5 kg m 3 the same authors observed that the ψstem values were 1 2 and 0 7 mpa for plants in 50 and 100 etc treatments respectively however the effects of nonlinear interactions among soil cultivar and climate on irrigation scheduling are still poorly understood by the blueberry farmers thus irrigation management strategies are required to optimize water productivity yield and quality of rabbiteye blueberry orchards growing under water scarcity conditions in this context the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of four irrigation levels on plant water status yield fruit quality and water productivity in a drip irrigated rabbiteye blueberry vaccinium ashei reade tifblue orchard growing under mediterranean climate conditions 2

plants from the middle of each replication were used for all the measurements and two plants were guarded to avoid edge effects all the plants were irrigated using one line of 2 l h 1 drippers spaced every 0 5 m along the rows standard farming practice 2 3 measurements of weather conditions during the experiment rainfall relative humidity and air temperature were recorded daily for the two evaluated growing seasons using an automatic weather station aws a733 gsm gprs adcon telemetry austria located 1 3 km from the study area from the climate data reference evapotranspiration et0 was computed using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the etc was obtained by multiplying the et0 by the single crop coefficient kc which ranged between 0 10 and 0 75 depending on phenological stages the values of kc were 0 10 0 27 0 50 and 0 75 for bud set early bloom fruit coloring and harvest respectively allen et al 1998 retamales and hancock 2012 hunt et al 2008 finally the daily effective rainfall er was computed as follows acevedo opazo et al 2010 goodwin and victoria 1995 1 er r 10 0 75 where rainfall r and effective rainfall er are in mm day 1 2 4 plant and soil measurements at each replicate the volumetric soil water content θv in the effective root zone 0 6 m depth was measured five times per month during all the growing seasons using a portable time domain reflectometer tdr sensor trase system 6050 1 soilmoisture equipment corp usa the ψstem was measured at solar noon using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa to evaluate the plant water status in each irrigation treatment ahumada orellana et al 2019 each sample was previously prepared as follows healthy stem tips 15 20 cm long with nine to 12 leaves each were selected per replicate the stem tips were absent of fruits and were wrapped with plastic transparent film and aluminum foil at least 1 h before the measurements all the ψstem measurements were made twice a week from november to march for each season additionally to describe the accumulated effect of the sdi treatments the water stress integral wsi was calculated as follows myers 1988 2 wsi i 0 j ψ stem i i 1 c n where ψ stem i i 1 is the average midday stem water potential for any time interval i i 1 mpa c is the value of the maximum midday stem water potential measured during a season and n is the number of days in each interval the values of c were 0 34 and 0 45 mpa for the growing seasons 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively 2 5 yield components water productivity and fruit quality from early january to early march fruits with 80 external blue color were harvested during each growing season the fruits were harvested nine times from january 8th to march 6th 2013 during the first season and eight times from january 9th to february 26th 2014 during the second season respectively for each harvest the fruits were counted and weighed to estimate the total yield y kg plant 1 number of fruits per plant fp and fruit weight fw g fruit 1 the average values of fw were determined by counting and weighing a random sample of 60 fruits from each replicate water productivity wp was calculated as the ratio of blueberry yield kg ha 1 to water applied m3 ha 1 for fruit quality a subsample of 700 fruits from each plot was analyzed for quality characteristics three hundred grams of berries randomly selected from each replicate were frozen and later used for measuring soluble solids brix using an automatic temperature compensated refractometer model brix30 leica ag germany the ratio of berry weight to volume was estimated at harvest by a subsample of 10 fruits per plant randomly taken from each replicate then the subsample was weighed and subsequently introduced into a test tube containing water to measure the volume of water displaced 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significant effects of the treatments growing seasons and their interactions on the yield components fruit quality water productivity and water stress integral the repeated measurements such as θv ψstem and wsi were analyzed over time the treatment means were compared at p 0 05 using tukey s studentized range test hsd lee and lee 2018 and a regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between wsi and fruit yield the statistical analyses were performed using spss version 18 0 software spss inc chicago illinois usa 2 7 temporal stability analysis a principal component analysis pca was used to identify the temporal patterns of the irrigation treatments in the field the raw data were standardized on a per year basis before applying the pca to remove the influence of temporal variations this method assumes that if a significant amount of variance is explained by the first principal component then this component should represent the behavior of the irrigation treatment at each individual plant identifying patterns within the data through the use of exploratory analysis is a convenient way to discriminate influential variables or components that explain the intrinsic variability araya alman et al 2019 the pca analysis was performed using matlab r2019a mathworks inc natick ma usa 3 results 3 1 climatic variables the total water application varied according to blueberry phenology irrigation treatments and weather conditions table 1 and fig 1 the annual values of rainfall were 750 and 786 mm while those of et0 were 1002 and 1037 mm for the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons respectively in general seasonal variations in temperatures were similar for the two growing seasons except for 2013 14 in which the maximum average temperatures were higher during the summer months mid december to mid march fig 1b as expected minimum temperatures were recorded during the winter months and the first growing season presented the lowest values during july 0 9 c fig 1a the pattern of et0 was similar between the two seasons with peaks between 146 and 147 mm month 1 during december and january during the growing seasons from september to april the rainfall events were minimal with the highest effective rainfall occurring during the 2012 2013 season 139 mm fig 1c and d table 1 for both growing seasons table 1 indicates that the total water applications twas for the t2 t3 and t4 treatments were between 20 and 27 40 45 and 60 63 lower than that in the farmers irrigation treatment t1 respectively 3 2 midday stem water potential and soil water content at the end of november green fruit stage in both growing seasons doy 335 the ψstem values were less than 0 85 mpa with significant differences in the first season fig 2a after doy 338 the ψstem values were significantly lower in the t4 treatment than in the other treatments especially during the harvest period from january to march fig 2 for the two seasons the average values of the ψstem were 0 85 0 86 0 97 and 1 11 mpa for the t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively the lowest ψstem values close to 2 0mpa were observed in plants at 50 etc on doy 42 first season which showed a high atmospheric demand for water vapor et0 6 8 0 7 mm day 1 at the end of the seasons the average ψstem for all the treatments ranged between 0 72 and 0 74 mpa indicating that the level of plant water stress was reduced due to decreasing water requirements additionally there was a significant effect of the sdi treatments on the wsi with the lowest and highest values for the t1 28 07 mpa day and t4 57 90 mpa day treatments respectively table 2 this table also shows that the wsi was similar for both growing seasons due to similar atmospheric conditions and irrigation management fig 3 indicates that significant differences between the wsi values among the treatments started in the last week of december doy 361 and increased during the harvest period in this period the cumulative water stress was greater in the t4 treatment 50 etc than that in the other treatments but no significant differences were observed between the t1 and t2 treatments in either growing seasons additionally the regression analysis indicated that there was a significant linear correlation between the yield and wsi r 0 64 however dispersion points were observed especially for plants in the t1 and t2 treatments wsi 35 mpa day fig 4 a significant effect of water application was observed on the evolution of the volumetric soil water content θv during both growing seasons in general the values of θv in the t1 treatment were greater than those in the t2 t3 and t4 treatments at the end of november and this pattern was maintained throughout the two seasons fig 2c and d for both seasons the average values of θv ranged from 26 to 31 22 29 22 29 and 20 28 for the t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively additionally the values of θv in the t2 t3 and t4 treatments were similar in the first season and variable responses to the irrigation treatments were observed in the second season similar to the ψstem the lowest value of θv was observed in the most water restricted treatment 50 etc on doy 44 2012 2013 season when the θv was close to the wilting point fig 2c 3 3 yield components water productivity and fruit quality table 2 indicates significant effects of irrigation levels on the y fp and fw with higher values observed in the t1 and t2 treatments the interactions between the irrigation treatments and growing seasons were only significant for fw with the lowest values observed in plants irrigated at 50 etc during the 2012 2013 growing season fig 5 similarly the plants irrigated at 100 and 125 etc presented the highest y and fp values compared to those irrigated at 75 and 50 etc also fig 6 shows that significant differences in the y and fp among the treatments occurred mostly from the third to the seventh harvests from late january to middle february for each growing season with the plants irrigated at 50 etc consistently showing the lowest y and fp similarly fig 7 shows that the cumulative y was lower in the plants irrigated at 50 etc than in the plants in the other treatments but the plants with wsi values 31 mpa day t1 and t2 presented similar cumulative yields no significant response of wp was observed for the irrigation treatments growing seasons or interactions for all the treatments the wp ranged between 3 48 and 4 05 kg m 3 in the case of fruit quality the irrigation levels were significant for soluble solids with the highest and lowest values for plants irrigated at 50 and 125 etc respectively table 3 in addition the statistical analysis indicated that there were no significant effects among the treatments for juice ph and weight volume ratio but the juice ph was significantly lower in the second season than in the first season 3 4 temporal stability of the irrigation treatments the first pc 1 and second pc 2 principal components explained a significant proportion of the variability in the irrigation treatment 68 for the two growing seasons fig 8 the y appeared to be correlated to the wp and inversely correlated to the ss the plants that consistently exhibited low y low wp and high ss are located on the left side of pc 1 negative coordinates while the plants with consistently high y high wp and low ss can be found on the right side of pc 1 positive coordinates the ratio of weight to volume wv and ph did not correlate with the other variables fig 8 4 discussion the main differences in the yield components and ss were attributed to the irrigation treatments and the interactions between the irrigation treatments and growing seasons were significant only for fw similarly the plants irrigated at 100 and 125 etc presented higher productivity than those irrigated at 50 and 75 etc but the wp was similar among the treatments in general the harvest period coincided with the increase in plant water stress and blueberry water requirements during the harvest period water consumption was especially high and accounted for 53 of the seasonal etc this pattern was similar to that observed in blueberry plants by bryla and strik 2007 and mingeau et al 2001 in this study the field performance of blueberry plants was severely affected when water application was reduced with significant reductions in ψstem and ɵ which were lower in the plants irrigated at 50 etc t4 for both growing seasons the soil water content for the plants irrigated at 50 etc t4 was close to the wilting point average ɵ 23 4 from december doy 336 to february doy 60 with the values of the ψstem ranging between 1 11 and 1 89 mpa these water stress levels may have negatively affected co2 assimilation in the plants in the 50 etc treatment which in turn significantly reduced the y fp and fw under greenhouse conditions rho et al 2012 reported that bluecrop blueberry plants under severe water stress ψleaf of approximately 1 94 mpa exhibited several restrictions in gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence while améglio et al 1999 reported that ψleaf equal to 1 2 mpa is the threshold for xylem cavitation in vaccinium corymbosum l keen and slavich 2012 reported that five year old highbush blueberry plants irrigated close to 50 etc presented the highest wp but there were not significant differences in y or fw among the treatments in a drip irrigated highbush blueberry brigitta orchard lobos et al 2018 found that plants irrigated at 50 etc had ψstem values between 0 87 and 1 23 mpa and produced less y 3 0 kg plant 1 and fw 1 4 g fruit 1 but higher wp 7 5 kg m 3 than plants in fully watered treatments in this study plants in the 75 etc treatment were under moderate and severe water stress ψstem between 1 1 and 1 5 mpa during the harvest periods they exhibited lower y fp and fw than the fully irrigated plants i e those in the t1 and t2 treatments even though the water application in the t2 treatment was between 20 and 27 lower than that in the t1 treatment the plants in these irrigation management treatments were not under water stress conditions with θv values close to field capacity θv 25 and ψstem values 0 85 mpa for these reasons no significant differences in blueberry production or fruit quality were observed between the t1 and t2 treatments in a drip irrigated blueberry orchard lobos et al 2016 2018 observed that the application of water at 75 etc produced a similar y 4 8 kg plant 1 fw 1 6 g fruit 1 and wp 6 9 kg m 3 as the application of water at 100 etc in these cases the average values of ψstem were 0 94 and 0 91 mpa for plants at 75 and 100 etc respectively in this regard estrada et al 2015 and lobos et al 2018 suggested that threshold values of ψstem 1 0 mpa can be used to avoid water stress and significant reductions in yield and quality finally the negative relationship between the wsi and y indicates that the yield was reduced as cumulated water stress increased during the harvest period especially for drip irrigated blueberry plants under moderate and severe water stress in addition differences among treatments for the y and fp increased as plant water stress wsi augmented during the harvest periods plants irrigated at 50 etc consistently showing the lowest y and fp and highest wsi in comparison with other treatments the fruit quality analysis indicated that compared to the fully watered treatments plants irrigated at 50 etc presented the highest ss this is corroborated by the pca which indicates that the yield is inversely correlated to the ss in brigitta highbush blueberry lobos et al 2018 observed the highest ss in fruits from plants irrigated at 50 etc suggesting osmotic adjustment the data analysis also indicated that the fp was lower and the ss was higher in the second season than in the first season in this regard several researchers have indicated that the fruit load could affect solute accumulation in fruits with higher ss concentrations at low fruit loads léchaudel et al 2005 souty et al 1999 wünsche et al 2000 finally plants watered at 50 etc increased in ss but at the expense of the y fp and fw as a consequence of severe water stress in the studies by lobos et al 2016 2018 plants irrigated at 75 and 100 etc exhibited similar ss and fw levels but plants irrigated at 50 etc had reduced fw and increased ss levels these results indicated that the ss and fw were similar between plants irrigated at 75 and 100 etc but y and fp at 75 etc were superior to those at 100 etc in this study principal component 1 fig 8 was strongly correlated with the wp y and ss and can be related to the differences in the yield this indicates the relative temporal stability of the data irrigation treatment related to the quality and yield parameters associated with the blueberry orchard results indicated that it is possible to identify the main variables that explained the temporal distribution of the differences between the sampling sites irrigation treatments over the two years of the study fig 8 furthermore the ph and wv did not show a relationship with the yield parameters or plant water status a nonlinear approach will be required to relate berry quality parameters with plant water status according to the results of other studies of perennial crops acevedo opazo et al 2008 ojeda et al 2005 peterlunger et al 2002 5 conclusions the results of this study indicated that irrigation treatments significantly affected yield fruit quality and plant water status but not water productivity blueberry plants irrigated at 100 125 etc presented higher yield fruits per plant and fruit weight than plants watered at 75 50 etc the water application in the 100 etc treatment was between 20 and 27 lower than that in the 125 etc treatment but the yield and quality were similar in both treatments which were not under water stress conditions ψstem 0 85 mpa the plants in the 50 etc treatment yielded the fruits with the highest ss but the y fp and fw were significantly reduced because of severe water stress ψstem from 1 11 to 1 89 mpa observed especially during the harvest period finally the application of water at 100 etc and ψstem 1 0 mpa could be a good irrigation management strategy for drip irrigated blueberry orchards because it led to a reduction in the total water application between 950 and 1130 m3 ha 1 season 1 without affecting the yield or quality this water saving is very important for the sustainable production of blueberry orchards located in mediterranean climate zones that are facing continuous water scarcity declaration of

10148,as blueberries are susceptible to water stress and their future cultivation in semiarid mediterranean areas will be challenged by drought irrigation management strategies will be needed to optimize water productivity and maintain sufficient levels of fruit yield and quality this study aim was to evaluate the effect of different irrigation levels on plant water status yield fruit quality and water productivity in a drip irrigated rabbiteye blueberry vaccinium ashei reade tifblue orchard four irrigation treatments based on crop evapotranspiration etc were applied to blueberry plants

were 0 85 0 86 0 97 and 1 11 mpa for the t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively fruit weight fw yield y fruits per plant fp soluble solids ss and the water stress integral wsi were significantly affected by the irrigation treatments the water productivity wp juice ph and weight volume ratio were statistically similar among the treatments the highest values of y fp and fw were observed in the t1 and t2 treatments while the lowest values were found in the t4 treatment in addition the y fp fw and wsi in the t1 and t2 treatments were significantly similar but the total water application in the t2 treatment was between 20 and 27 lower than that in the t1 treatment for the t1 and t2 treatments the values of y were between 8 8 and 9 4 kg plant 1 and the ψstem was 0 85 mpa during the two growing seasons the interaction between irrigation treatments and growing season was only significant for the fw with the lowest values observed in the t4 treatment during the 2012 2013 growing season

because of their positive effects on people s well being and health romo muñoz et al 2020 in chile blueberry production has increased during the last year concentrating 20 of worldwide production brazelton and young 2017 the total planted area was 19 000 ha in 2019 with mainly highbush and rabbiteye blueberries ciren 2020 the blueberry orchards are mainly located in mediterranean climate areas having high atmospheric demand for water vapor and scarce precipitation during the spring and summer period in addition rainfall has significantly decreased since 2010 due to a mega drought limiting the water availability for irrigation in mediterranean regions garreaud et al 2020 under these water scarcity conditions irrigation management strategies are required in blueberry production to avoid plant water stress that negatively affects yield and fruit quality carrasco benavides et al 2020 del pozo et al 2019 rabbiteye blueberry is well adapted to semi arid conditions but it is sensitive to soil water deficit it is characterized by its low water absorption capacity shallow root system lack of root hairs and high water requirements for profitable production bryla et al 2011 gough 1994 soil moisture is the most important factor affecting blueberry root growth and any water deficit negatively affects vegetative growth and fruit production bryla and strik 2007 bryla et al 2011 holzapfel et al 2004 spiers 1998a 1998b thus irrigation management has become an important decision making tool for improving water productivity wp kg m 3 without compromising yield or fruit quality ortega farias et al 2012 evidence has demonstrated significant reductions in fruit size and yield losses under severe water stress conditions depending on the cultivar less frequent irrigation and drought periods from one to three weeks decreased the leaf water potential ψleaf from 0 3 to 1 6 mpa which significantly reduced the yield and dry weight of the plants mingeau et al 2001 bryla and strik 2007 additionally water stress induces stomatal closure and diminishes co2 assimilation with consequent yield losses for highbush blueberries lee et al 2006 reported that the ψleaf and co2 assimilation rate an decreased from 1 07 to 1 79 mpa and from 8 84 to 4 6 µmol m 2 s 1 respectively after withholding water for seven days for lowbush blueberries glass et al 2005 observed values of midday stem water potential ψstem ranging from 1 45 to 1 41 mpa for stressed plants irrigated at 75 of crop evapotranspiration etc for well irrigated highbush blueberries at different plant densities bryla and strik 2007 recorded ψstem values ranging from 0 5 to 0 4 mpa at the end of spring and from 1 6 to 1 4 mpa at harvest blueberries are also susceptible to over irrigation which reduces root activity increases soil erosion and nutrient leaching and increases the prevalence of fungal diseases such as phytophthora root rot bryla and linderman 2007 bryla et al 2008 2011 starr et al 2004 the effects of under or overirrigation on yield fruit quality and water productivity depends on weather conditions site cultivar age spacing and irrigation method among other factors for the young highbush blueberry cultivar duke ehret et al 2012 found that compared to moderate irrigation treatments soil matric potential ψm from 20 to 50 kpa over irrigation ψm from 20 to 25 kpa significantly reduced fruit firmness and the soluble solids of the fruits in addition total yields were not significantly different between over and moderately irrigated plants but they were significantly greater than those in a rainfed treatment ψm from 20 to 90 kpa in this case yields were 6 3 6 6 and 6 0 kg plant 1 for the overirrigated moderately irrigated and rainfed treatments respectively for six year old plants ehret et al 2015 found no difference in berry weight fruit firmness or soluble solids for plants irrigated under moderated irrigation total water application twa between 150 and 170 l plant 1 year 1 and overirrigation twa between 300 and 340 l plant 1 year 1 treatments in a two year experiment carried out in nursery plants of the northern highbush blueberry cultivar elliott bryla et al 2011 found that plants drip irrigated at 100 etc twa 289 mm year 1 had a superior yield and berry weight compared to plants irrigated at 150 etc twa 411 163 mm year 1 which showed a reduction in growth new canes and cane dry weight in the same study the wp for plants irrigated at 50 etc twa 104 mm year 1 was 54 higher than those watered at 100 etc but the yield and berry weight were significantly reduced by water restriction in summary the scheduling of irrigation in blueberry orchards must be done to avoid over and under irrigation to optimize yield and fruit quality in chile for a seven year experiment with highbush blueberries cv bluetta holzapfel et al 2004 reported no significant differences in berry weight among plants irrigated at 33 twa 208 3 mm year 1 100 twa 624 9 mm year 1 and 133 etc twa 833 2 mm year 1 these authors pointed out that yield was reduced when water was applied at a rate of 200 mm year 1 3 6 t ha 1 and remained relatively constant when water was applied at a rate of 600 mm year 1 6 8 t ha 1 for a commercial drip irrigated rabbiteye blueberry vaccinium virgatum bonita orchard ortega farías 2013 found that plants irrigated at 80 etc twa 270 mm year 1 presented the highest yield 12 3 t ha 1 and wp 4 3 kg m 3 in this study the water application of 40 and 120 etc significantly reduced yield and wp corroborating that under or overirrigation had negative effects on blueberry yield in a drip irrigated highbush blueberry cv brigitta experiment lobos et al 2016 2018 indicated that depending on the growing season the application of 75 etc twa between 180 and 200 mm produced a similar yield 4 8 kg plant 1 berry weight 1 6 g fruit 1 and wp 6 9 kg m 3 as the application of 100 etc plants irrigated at 50 etc produced less yield 3 0 kg plant 1 and berry weight 1 4 g fruit 1 but higher wp 7 5 kg m 3 the same authors observed that the ψstem values were 1 2 and 0 7 mpa for plants in 50 and 100 etc treatments respectively however the effects of nonlinear interactions among soil cultivar and climate on irrigation scheduling are still poorly understood by the blueberry farmers thus irrigation management strategies are required to optimize water productivity yield and quality of rabbiteye blueberry orchards growing under water scarcity conditions in this context the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of four irrigation levels on plant water status yield fruit quality and water productivity in a drip irrigated rabbiteye blueberry vaccinium ashei reade tifblue orchard growing under mediterranean climate conditions 2

evaluated growing seasons using an automatic weather station aws a733 gsm gprs adcon telemetry austria located 1 3 km from the study area from the climate data reference evapotranspiration et0 was computed using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the etc was obtained by multiplying the et0 by the single crop coefficient kc which ranged between 0 10 and 0 75 depending on phenological

the stem tips were absent of fruits and were wrapped with plastic transparent film and aluminum foil at least 1 h before the measurements all the ψstem measurements were made twice a week from november to march for each season additionally to describe the accumulated effect of the sdi treatments the water stress integral wsi was calculated as follows myers 1988 2 wsi i 0 j ψ stem i i 1 c n where ψ stem i i 1 is the average midday stem water potential for any time interval i i 1 mpa c is the value of the maximum midday stem water potential measured during a season and n is the number of

selected from each replicate were frozen and later used for measuring soluble solids brix using an automatic temperature compensated refractometer model brix30 leica ag germany the ratio of berry weight to volume was estimated at harvest by a subsample of 10 fruits per plant randomly taken from each replicate then the subsample was weighed and subsequently introduced into a test tube containing water to measure the volume of water displaced 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significant effects of the treatments growing seasons and their interactions on the yield components fruit quality water productivity and water stress integral the repeated measurements such as θv ψstem and wsi were analyzed over time the treatment means were compared at p 0 05 using tukey s studentized range test hsd lee and lee 2018 and a regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between wsi and fruit yield the statistical analyses were performed using spss version 18 0 software spss inc chicago illinois usa 2 7 temporal stability analysis a principal component analysis pca was used to identify the temporal patterns of the irrigation treatments in the field the raw data were standardized on a per year basis before applying the pca to remove the influence of temporal variations this method assumes that if a significant amount of variance is explained by the first principal component then this component should represent the behavior of the irrigation treatment at each individual plant identifying patterns within the data through the use of exploratory analysis is a convenient way to discriminate influential variables or components that explain the intrinsic variability araya alman et al 2019 the pca analysis was performed using matlab r2019a mathworks inc natick ma usa 3 results 3 1 climatic variables the total water application varied according to blueberry phenology irrigation treatments and weather conditions table 1 and fig 1 the annual values of rainfall were 750 and 786 mm while those of et0 were 1002 and 1037 mm for the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons respectively in general seasonal variations in temperatures were similar for the two growing seasons except for 2013 14 in which the maximum average temperatures were higher during the summer months mid december to mid march fig 1b as expected minimum temperatures were recorded during the winter months and the first growing season presented the lowest values during july 0 9 c fig 1a the pattern of et0 was similar between the two seasons with peaks between 146 and 147 mm month 1 during december and january during the growing seasons from september to april the rainfall events were minimal with the highest effective rainfall occurring during the 2012 2013 season 139 mm fig 1c and d table 1 for both growing seasons table 1 indicates that the total water applications twas for the t2 t3 and t4 treatments were between 20 and 27 40 45 and 60 63 lower than that in the farmers irrigation treatment t1 respectively 3 2 midday stem water potential and soil water content at the end of november green fruit stage in both growing seasons doy 335 the ψstem values were less than 0 85 mpa with significant differences in the first season fig 2a after doy 338 the ψstem values were significantly lower in the t4 treatment than in the other treatments especially during the harvest period from january to march fig 2 for the two seasons the average values of the ψstem were 0 85 0 86 0 97 and 1 11 mpa for the t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively the lowest ψstem values close to 2 0mpa were observed in plants at 50 etc on doy 42 first season which showed a high atmospheric demand for water vapor et0 6 8 0 7 mm day 1 at the end of the seasons the average ψstem for all the treatments ranged between 0 72 and 0 74 mpa indicating that the level of plant water stress was reduced due to decreasing water requirements additionally there was a significant effect of the sdi treatments on the wsi with the lowest and highest values for the t1 28 07 mpa day and t4 57 90 mpa day treatments respectively table 2 this table also shows that the wsi was similar for both growing seasons due to similar atmospheric conditions and irrigation management fig 3 indicates that significant differences between the wsi values among the treatments started in the last week of december doy 361 and increased during the harvest period in this period the cumulative water stress was greater in the t4 treatment 50 etc than that in the other treatments but no significant differences were observed between the t1 and t2 treatments in either growing seasons additionally the regression analysis indicated that there was a significant linear correlation between the yield and wsi r 0 64 however dispersion points were observed especially for plants in the t1 and t2 treatments wsi 35 mpa day fig 4 a significant effect of water application was observed on the evolution of the volumetric soil water content θv during both growing seasons in general the values of θv in the t1 treatment were greater than those in the t2 t3 and t4 treatments at the end of november and this pattern was maintained throughout the two seasons fig 2c and d for both seasons the average values of θv ranged from 26 to 31 22 29 22 29 and 20 28 for the t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments respectively additionally the values of θv in the t2 t3 and t4 treatments were similar in the first season and variable responses to the irrigation treatments were observed in the second season similar to the ψstem the lowest value of θv was observed in the most water restricted treatment 50 etc on doy 44 2012 2013 season when the θv was close to the wilting point fig 2c 3 3 yield components water productivity and fruit quality table 2 indicates significant effects of irrigation levels on the y fp and fw with higher values observed in the t1 and t2 treatments the interactions between the irrigation treatments and growing seasons were only significant for fw with the lowest values observed in plants irrigated at 50 etc during the 2012 2013 growing season fig 5 similarly the plants irrigated at 100 and 125 etc presented the highest y and fp values compared to those irrigated at 75 and 50 etc also fig 6 shows that significant differences in the y and fp among the treatments occurred mostly from the third to the seventh harvests from late january to middle february for each growing season with the plants irrigated at 50 etc consistently showing the lowest y and fp similarly fig 7 shows that the cumulative y was lower in the plants irrigated at 50 etc than in the plants in the other treatments but the plants with wsi values 31 mpa day t1 and t2 presented similar cumulative yields no significant response of wp was observed for the irrigation treatments growing seasons or interactions for all the treatments the wp ranged between 3 48 and 4 05 kg m 3 in the case of fruit quality the irrigation levels were significant for soluble solids with the highest and lowest values for plants irrigated at 50 and 125 etc respectively table 3 in addition the statistical analysis indicated that there were no significant effects among the treatments for juice ph and weight volume ratio but the juice ph was significantly lower in the second season than in the first season 3 4 temporal stability of the irrigation treatments the first pc 1 and second pc 2 principal components explained a significant proportion of the variability in the irrigation treatment 68 for the two growing seasons fig 8 the y appeared to be correlated to the wp and inversely correlated to the ss the plants that consistently exhibited low y low wp and high ss are located on the left side of pc 1 negative coordinates while the plants with consistently high y high wp and low ss can be found on the right side of pc 1 positive coordinates the ratio of weight to volume wv and ph did not correlate with the other variables fig 8 4 discussion the main differences in the yield components and ss were attributed to the irrigation treatments and the interactions between the irrigation treatments and growing seasons were significant only for fw similarly the plants irrigated at 100 and 125 etc presented higher productivity than those irrigated at 50 and 75 etc but the wp was similar among the treatments in general the harvest period coincided with the increase in plant water stress and blueberry water requirements during the harvest period water consumption was especially high and accounted for 53 of the seasonal etc this pattern was similar to that observed in blueberry plants by bryla and strik 2007 and mingeau et al 2001 in this study the field performance of blueberry plants was severely affected when water application was reduced with significant reductions in ψstem and ɵ which were lower in the plants irrigated at 50 etc t4 for both growing seasons the soil water content for the plants irrigated at 50 etc t4 was close to the wilting point average ɵ 23 4 from december doy 336 to february doy 60 with the values of the ψstem ranging between 1 11 and 1 89 mpa these water stress levels may have negatively affected co2 assimilation in the plants in the 50 etc treatment which in turn significantly reduced the y fp and fw under greenhouse conditions rho et al 2012 reported that bluecrop blueberry plants under severe water stress ψleaf of approximately 1 94 mpa exhibited several restrictions in gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence while améglio et al 1999 reported that ψleaf equal to 1 2 mpa is the threshold for xylem cavitation in vaccinium corymbosum l keen and slavich 2012 reported that five year old highbush blueberry plants irrigated close to 50 etc presented the highest wp but there were not significant differences in y or fw among the treatments in a drip irrigated highbush blueberry brigitta orchard lobos et al 2018 found that plants irrigated at 50 etc had ψstem values between 0 87 and 1 23 mpa and produced less y 3 0 kg plant 1 and fw 1 4 g fruit 1 but higher wp 7 5 kg m 3 than plants in fully watered treatments in this study plants in the 75 etc treatment were under moderate and severe water stress ψstem between 1 1 and 1 5 mpa during the harvest periods they exhibited lower y fp and fw than the fully irrigated plants i e those in the t1 and t2 treatments even though the water application in the t2 treatment was between 20 and 27 lower than that in the t1 treatment the plants in these irrigation management treatments were not under water stress conditions with θv values close to field capacity θv 25 and ψstem values 0 85 mpa for these reasons no significant differences in blueberry production or fruit quality were observed between the t1 and t2 treatments in a drip irrigated blueberry orchard lobos et al 2016 2018 observed that the application of water at 75 etc produced a similar y 4 8 kg plant 1 fw 1 6 g fruit 1 and wp 6 9 kg m 3 as the application of water at 100 etc in these cases the average values of ψstem were 0 94 and 0 91 mpa for plants at 75 and 100 etc respectively in this regard estrada et al 2015 and lobos et al 2018 suggested that threshold values of ψstem 1 0 mpa can be used to avoid water stress and significant reductions in yield and quality finally the negative relationship between the wsi and y indicates that the yield was reduced as cumulated water stress increased during the harvest period especially for drip irrigated blueberry plants under moderate and severe water stress in addition differences among treatments for the y and fp increased as plant water stress wsi augmented during the harvest periods plants irrigated at 50 etc consistently showing the lowest y and fp and highest wsi in comparison with other treatments the fruit quality analysis indicated that compared to the fully watered treatments plants irrigated at 50 etc presented the highest ss this is corroborated by the pca which indicates that the yield is inversely correlated to the ss in brigitta highbush blueberry lobos et al 2018 observed the highest ss in fruits from plants irrigated at 50 etc suggesting osmotic adjustment the data analysis also indicated that the fp was lower and the ss was higher in the second season than in the first season in this regard several researchers have indicated that the fruit load could affect solute accumulation in fruits with higher ss concentrations at low fruit loads léchaudel et al 2005 souty et al 1999 wünsche et al 2000 finally plants watered at 50 etc increased in ss but at the expense of the y fp and fw as a consequence of severe water stress in the studies by lobos et al 2016 2018 plants irrigated at 75 and 100 etc exhibited similar ss and fw levels but plants irrigated at 50 etc had reduced fw and increased ss levels these results indicated that the ss and fw were similar between plants irrigated at 75 and 100 etc but y and fp at 75 etc were superior to those at 100 etc in this study principal component 1 fig 8 was strongly correlated with the wp y and ss and can be related to the differences in the yield this indicates the relative temporal stability of the data irrigation treatment related to the quality and yield parameters associated with the blueberry orchard results indicated that it is possible to identify the main variables that explained the temporal distribution of the differences between the sampling sites irrigation treatments over the two years of the study fig 8 furthermore the ph and wv did not show a relationship with the yield parameters or plant water status a nonlinear approach will be required to relate berry quality parameters with plant water status according to the results of other studies of perennial crops acevedo opazo et al 2008 ojeda et al 2005 peterlunger et al 2002 5 conclusions the results of this study indicated that irrigation treatments significantly affected yield fruit quality and plant water status but not water productivity blueberry plants irrigated at 100 125 etc presented higher yield fruits per plant and fruit weight than plants watered at 75 50 etc the water application in the 100 etc treatment was between 20 and 27 lower than that in the 125 etc treatment but the yield and quality were similar in both treatments which were not under water stress conditions ψstem 0 85 mpa the plants in the 50 etc treatment yielded the fruits with the highest ss but the y fp and fw were significantly reduced because of severe water stress ψstem from 1 11 to 1 89 mpa observed especially during the harvest period finally the application of water at 100 etc and ψstem 1 0 mpa could be a good irrigation management strategy for drip irrigated blueberry orchards because it led to a reduction in the total water application between 950 and 1130 m3 ha 1 season 1 without affecting the yield or quality this water saving is very important for the sustainable production of blueberry orchards located in mediterranean climate zones that are facing continuous water scarcity declaration of

10149,a series of revegetation programs have been carried out since 1950s and a large area of cropland has been converted to forestland and grassland through tree plantation and natural vegetation restoration however it is still inadequately addressed how plant revegetation changes the characteristics of soil plant waters in this study we compared δ18o and δ2h values of different waters from precipitation soil water root water and leaf water between different herbaceous plants understory of the planted forestland and natural recovered grassland in two neighboring catchments there was a temporal consistence in δ18o and δ2h among different waters showing that root water and leaf water could record well the signals of soil water and precipitation followed by temperature change over month a series of water line equations between δ18o and δ2h indicate that herbaceous plants have higher soil evaporation for grassland than understory of the forestland instead of leaf transpiration moreover our study found significant differences in δ18o and δ2h between root water and soil water probably associated with isotopic fractionation during root water uptake leaf surface water pools and ecohydrological separation this study will be helpful to better understand the effect of plant revegetation programmes planted forestland catchment versus natural grassland catchment on ecohydrological processes on the chinese loess plateau keywords stable water isotopes ecohydrological processes the chinese loess plateau grassland forestland 1 introduction the earth s critical zone involves all aspects of surface and near surface environments from the base of the groundwater reservoir to the top of the vegetation canopy nrc 2001 brantley et al 2007 there is an increased interest in performing researches on the upper boundary of the critical zone as an important interface between vegetation and surrounding soils sprenger et al 2017 reobroek et al 2020 studying the interaction of soil and plant water is therefore vital for an in depth understanding of eco hydrological processes because the accessibility of soil water determines plant growth and survival and in turn the distribution of plants influences ecological functions of the soil vegetation system dawson and ehleringer 1991 drake and franks 2003 feng et al 2016 chang et al 2019 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h which serve as fingerprints of the water molecule of the terrestrial water cycle are often used to trace processes and connections of ecohydrology and plant tissues yakir and wang 1996 barbour 2007 for example numerous studies have shown that δ18o and δ2h of soil and root xylem waters can be used to study the proportions and dynamics of root water uptake by plants dawson et al 2002 jia et al 2013 rothfuss and javaux 2017 jespersen et al 2018 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2019a amin et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 under an assumption of no isotopic fractionation of δ2h and δ18o during root water uptake in terrestrial plants ehleringer and dawson 1992 brunel et al 1995 wang et al 2017 the exception is some salt tolerant coastal species lin and sternberg 1993 and woody xerophytes ellsowrth and williams 2007 leaf water is generally enriched in 18o and 2h compared to its source water because of evapotranspiration liu et al 2015 plavcová et al 2018 and it is subsequently used to generate carbohydrates such as cellulose barbour 2007 helliker and richter 2008 and leaf wax liu et al 2016 which can be used for paleoclimatic reconstruction barbour 2007 helliker and richter 2008 liu and an 2019 thus both soil water and plant water e g root water and leaf water are key components of the ecohydrological cycle and their isotopic variation can provide valuable information on the interactions between plant and soil waters sprenger et al 2016 vargas et al 2017 che et al 2019 the chinese loess plateau clp is the largest area with loess deposits in the world and the groundwater table depth is more than 60 m huang et al 2013 soil water is an important water source for plants in arid and semi arid areas especially areas where groundwater is too deep to access wang et al 2019a precipitation primarily occurs from july to september accounting for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation liu et al 2018 the high precipitation intensity during the rainy season and poor soil texture causes severe soil erosion and environmental degradation feng et al 2012 2016 to improve sustainable development of the clp a series of revegetation programmes have been carried out since the early 1950s especially noteworthy is the launch of the grain for green gfg project in the 2000s chen et al 2007 zhou et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 after implementation of these revegetation programmes a large area of cropland has been converted to forestland and grassland through tree plantation and natural vegetation restoration fu et al 2017 however it is still unclear how revegetation changes the terrestrial ecohydrological processes and how soil and plant waters interact together in the revegetated ecosystem a recent study by schwärzel et al 2020 has demonstrated that the understory instead of the overstory was the main water consumer in the planted forestland on the clp which challenged the general belief that soil water was mainly consumed by trees similar findings have been reported in mediterranean oak savannas dubbert et al 2014 and eastern siberian larch forests iida et al 2009 where understory was a significant component of the water balance in the planted forestland the forestland and grassland are widely distributed on the clp by conducting tree plantation and natural vegetation restoration and herbaceous plants exist simultaneously thus herbaceous plants play critical roles in the water balance in both ecosystems on the clp it is crucially important to compare the difference of ecohydrological processes in the same plant type i e herbaceous plants between forestland and grassland on the clp and help to in depth understand the soil and plant water interaction in the planted forestland in this study we conducted a temporal investigation of δ18o and δ2h from different waters in a pair of neighbouring small catchments on the clp planted forestland catchment versus natural grassland catchment with similar topographical and geological backgrounds fig 1 jin et al 2014 the herbaceous plants in the two catchments were collected to limit the soil water uptake depth within less than 2 m because studies have shown that shallow rooted plants such as grasses and herbs tend to use soil water near the surface while deep rooted trees rely on deep soil water or groundwater mccole and stern 2007 prechsl et al 2015 priyadarshini et al 2016 the objectives of this study are to investigate the isotopic variations of different waters e g precipitation soil water root water and leaf water in these two catchments and to test whether or not there is a difference of ecohydrological processes in the same taxonomy of herbaceous plants from an understory of the planted forestland and natural grassland this investigation from two contrasted catchments will be helpful to understand ecohydrological management practices in arid and semi arid areas especially in areas under revegetation

containing the two neighbouring catchments i e yjg forestland and dzg grassland in the central chinese loess plateau fig 1a b this region experiences a semi arid continental climate with the mean annual temperature and precipitation of 9 3 c and 556 5 mm respectively fig 1c jin et al 2018 the area is characterized as the typical table and gully landscape with elevations ranging from 1050 m to 1423 m the local loessal soil derived from quaternary dust is approximately 250 m thick and the texture is largely silt loamy li 2006 the dzg grassland catchment 1 15 km2 has undergone natural regrowth of native grass species since 1954 while yjg forestland catchment 0 87 km2 was planted with trees from 1954 to 1958 after ca 65 years of vegetation rehabilitation without other anthropogenic activities these two catchments have formed completely different vegetation landscapes representative of a planted forestland versus a natural grassland fig 1d the yjg forestland catchment is dominated by deciduous trees and there is a dense understory composed of shrubs and grasses jin et al 2018 the undergrowth herbaceous plants in yjg forestland are dominated by agropyron cristatum bothriochloa ischaemum phaenosperma globose carex lanceolata and lycium barbarum and species in dzg grassland by patrinia scabiosifolia artemisia capillaris phragmites australis 2 2 sample collection plant and soil samples were collected once a month from july to october 2019 six 10 m 10 m plots were established as the permanent field sites three plots were set up in each of the two catchments with two sites on both sides of the catchment and one site in the bottom of trench fig 1b the dominant herbaceous plants in each plot were sampled during the study periods artemisia scoparza phragmites communis were not available in october because they withered up and died and the whole body of each species was collected to obtain enough roots and leaves for analysis all samples were stored in a dry cooler ca 4 c in the field prior to immediate transportation to the laboratory in the laboratory all plant materials were cut into two main organs i e leaves and roots using sterilized scissors a total of 21 leaf and 21 root samples were obtained from six plots the soils surrounding the sampling plants were simultaneously collected by a hand held auger 6 cm in diameter with two auxiliary drill pipes each drill pipe was 1 m length soil samples were limited to 200 cm depth at intervals of 10 cm in each plot a total of 492 soil samples were collected during the study period soil samples were divided into two parts one was stored in a freezer for isotopic analysis and the other was used to obtain gravimetric soil water content swc as determined by drying the samples for 12 h at 105 c moreover a total of 15 precipitation samples were collected using a polyethylene bottle and funnel during the study periods an automatic weather station was set up in a clear area near the output of dzg grassland fig 1b jin et al 2018 2 3 stable isotope analysis precipitation samples were filtered to eliminate any impurities before conducting an isotopic analysis a cryogenic distillation system was used to extract water from soil and root leaf samples in the laboratory as detailed in liu et al 2015 the isotopic composition of soil water and precipitation were measured through using a picarro l2130 i isotope water analyzer sunnyvale ca usa the analytical accuracies were 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h the isotopic measurements of root and leaf waters were conducted using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer ht2000 ea irms delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific inc usa the measurement precisions were 0 2 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the isotopic composition of δ18o and δ2h is expressed as an isotope ratio 1 δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δ sample represents δ18o or δ2h r sample and r standard indicate the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h of the sample and standard respectively the δ18o and δ2h values are reported relative to the vienna mean standard ocean water vsmow 2 4 data analysis statistical analyses e g mean max and min for isotopes of precipitation soil root and leaf waters were performed to show the range and distribution of δ18o and δ2h pearson correlation was conducted to describe various correlations between δ18o and δ2h among different water types e g precipitation soil water root water and leaf water because the isotopic data were normally distributed according to the kolmogorov smirnov k s test a one way anova combined with a post hoc tukey s least significant difference lsd test was performed to identify the significant differences of the swc and isotopic compositions of precipitation soil root and leaf waters across months comparisons of the relationships of δ18o and δ2h for soil water and leaf water were performed by using an analysis of covariance ancova to compare slopes between yjg forestland and dzg grassland the significance level for all statistical tests was set to the 95 confidence interval 3 results 3 1 precipitation amount temperature and isotopes both daily air temperature and precipitation amount showed a unimodal distribution in 2019 fig 2a the daily air temperature peaked at july avg 22 5 c and decreased monotonically to october avg 10 3 c during the sampling period the daily precipitation was also concentrated in the same period accounting for 64 344 mm of the total annual amount 538 mm the three main precipitation events 20 mm occurred in this period showing the daily precipitation amounts of 69 8 mm on 3 august 49 2 mm on 26 august and 22 2 mm on 9 september respectively precipitation δ18o and δ2h showed large variations during the study period and both δ18o and δ2h decreased significantly from july to october fig 2a r2 0 49 for δ18o and r2 0 46 for δ2h 3 2 isotopes in different waters the δ18o and δ2h in the two catchments varied by water and month fig 3 the averages of δ18o values were 9 9 8 5 5 5 and 4 0 and those of δ2h values were 66 8 58 9 43 8 and 37 2 for precipitation soil water root water and leaf water respectively within precipitation soil root leaf psrl waters a progressive increase in δ18o or δ2h existed from precipitation to soil root and leaf waters for each month fig 3 moreover the δ18o and δ2h decreased significantly across months in precipitation root water and leaf water p 0 05 the δ18o and δ2h in soil water showed no significant differences across months for each catchment p 0 05 3 3 the swc and isotopes between forestland and grassland the swc showed no significant difference between forestland and grassland p 0 70 however there was a significant difference in soil water between forestland and grassland for δ18o p 0 05 instead of δ2h p 0 83 likewise significant differences in root and leaf waters between forestland and grassland for δ18o were observed p 0 05 but non significant differences in root water p 0 33 and leaf water p 0 30 for δ2h significant correlations between δ18o and δ2h were observed in psrl waters during the study period fig 4 the local meteoric water line lmwl is described by the equation δ2h 7 78 δ18o 10 8 r2 0 97 p 0 05 the slope is slightly smaller than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 17 δ18o 10 35 rozanski et al 2013 indicating relatively arid climate and strong kinetic fractionation due to evaporation the slopes and intercepts of the soil water line equations in both catchments were slightly smaller compared to the lmwl fig 4 indicating that soil water was mainly influenced by the mixture of various precipitation events and undergoing evaporation yang and fu 2017 the two relationship of δ18o and δ2h between yjg forestland and dzg grassland was significant ancova df 71 2 f 4 84 p 0 028 0 05 indicating that soil water evaporation is significantly different for herbaceous plants between yjg forestland and dzg grassland moreover the linear relationships between δ18o and δ2h was δ2h 5 82 δ18o 7 45 r2 0 98 in root water and δ2h 5 66 δ18o 11 4 r2 0 97 in leaf water in yjg forestland while those for root water and leaf water were δ2h 4 79 δ18o 22 4 r2 0 75 and δ2h 4 41 δ18o 24 0 r2 0 66 in dzg grassland respectively the ancova test showed no significant difference for the slopes of δ18o and δ2h between yjg forestland and dzg grassland df 120 6 f 1 485 p 0 24 0 05 suggesting that leaf water transpiration for herbaceous plants between yjg forestland and dzg grassland was not different 4 discussion 4 1 temporal pattern of psrl waters as a consequence of temperature effect there were significantly temporal variations of δ18o and δ2h for psrl waters in two catchments in spite of progressive enrichments of psrl waters for each month as months proceeded the δ18o and δ2h in root and leaf waters decreased significantly responding well to the decreasing trends of precipitation δ18o and δ2h fig 3 this finding of temporal consistency between precipitation and plant waters root water and leaf water has been observed in a number of studies phillips and ehleringer 1995 cernusak et al 2005 meinzer et al 2006 sprenger et al 2016 berry et al 2017 plavcová et al 2018 the isotopic inheritance from precipitation to plant waters indicated that precipitation δ18o and δ2h conduct a dominated control on temporal patterns of psrl waters the spatial and temporal variability in precipitation δ18o and δ2h can be described by temperature altitude latitude continental and amount effects dansgaard 1964 mcguire and mcdonnell 2008 wu et al 2019 penna and meerveld 2019 as these two catchments neighbour in the same watershed the effects of altitude latitude and continent could be excluded the decreasing trends of precipitation δ18o and δ2h would result from temperature and or precipitation amount effects no significant correlations between precipitation amount and precipitation δ18o p 0 77 and δ2h p 0 44 were observed fig 2b as months progressed during the study period daily precipitation amounts decreased significantly especially for the three main precipitation events fig 2a but isotopic compositions of three main precipitations were 11 3 4 7 and 11 4 for δ18o and 76 9 22 4 and 77 9 for δ2h thus the temporal variability of precipitation δ18o and δ2h should not originate from precipitation amount effect however significant correlations between temperature and precipitation δ18o r2 0 50 and δ2h r2 0 61 were observed fig 2c which is consistent with observations in middle latitudes rozanski et al 2013 and northwest china wan et al 2017 the temperature effect on precipitation δ18o and δ2h depends on the equilibrium isotopic fractionation with more enriched in 18o and 2h at higher temperature sachse et al 2012 our results indicated that temperature effect was the dominant control on precipitation δ18o and δ2h during the study period in these two catchments this finding is supported by a study that the temperature effect is the prominent factor across many regions outside the tropics bowen 2008 4 2 comparisons between natural grassland and planted forestland natural vegetation restoration and tree plantation are two important measures for revegetation on the clp jin et al 2014 many studies have shown that the revegetation exerted profound effects on the regional and local hydrological processes on the clp chen et al 2008 feng et al 2012 2016 jia et al 2017 although δ18o and δ2h varied significantly over months and within psrl waters fig 3 the temporal dynamics of psrl water interaction needs to be further examined in these two contrasted ecosystems to compare the difference of psrl water interaction from herbaceous plants between understory of the planted forestland and natural grassland we established a series of water line equations between δ18o and δ2h fig 4 soil root and leaf water samples lay at an angle to the lmwl and is well described by linear regressions e g brooks et al 2010 goldsmith et al 2012 evaristo et al 2015 che et al 2019 the slopes and intercepts of these water lines are determined by the relative evaporation rates of the different water isotopes crawford et al 2014 benettin et al 2018 bowen et al 2018 chi et al 2019 indicating the different magnitudes of evaporative enrichment of isotopes in soil root and leaf waters this result was also consistent with isotopic increase in psrl waters fig 3 the ancova test showed that the slopes of δ18o and δ2h in soil water is significant different p 0 05 and the slope and intercept of soil water in dzg grassland 7 05 and 0 38 respectively were slightly lower than those in yjg forestland 7 61 and 7 32 respectively suggesting that compared to forestland soil evaporation is slightly greater in grassland this outcome is probably due to dense coverage of overstory shading in yjg forestland which weakened soil evaporation from understory of planted forestland in yjg forestland this finding is supported by a consecutive observation that daily evaporation rates were slightly lower for understory than grassland during the growing season on the clp schwärzel et al 2020 nevertheless the ancova test showed no significant difference for the slopes of δ18o and δ2h in leaf water although the slopes and intercepts were seemingly different dzg grassland 4 41 and 24 0 yjg forestland 5 66 and 11 4 the superficial difference likely results from substantial variabilities for leaf water in yjg forestland mean 40 5 standard deviation 22 7 and dzg grassland man 30 9 standard deviation 19 6 thus leaf transpiration in the same taxonomy of herbaceous plants from an understory of the planted forestland and natural grassland was no significant different and both catchments contribute approximate leaf transpiration because isotopic fractionation in leaf water originates primarily from evaporative distinctions of 2h 1h and 18o 16o through leaf stomata helliker and ehleringer 2000 cappa et al 2003 farquhar et al 2007 as these two catchments are neighbouring they have similar topographical and geological backgrounds jin et al 2014 and precipitation δ18o and δ2h stayed the same in the two catchments which is mainly influenced as discussed above by temperature effect the δ18o in soil root and leaf waters showed significant differences between yjg forestland and dzg grassland p 0 05 instead of δ2h between the two catchments p 0 83 0 33 and 0 30 for soil root and leaf waters respectively which would produce the different slopes and intercepts of water line equations from soil root and leaf waters between two contrasted catchments isotope fractionated difference between δ18o and δ2h were also observed ellsowrth and williams 2007 we guess that the difference of isotope fractionation between δ18o and δ2h in these contrasted catchments is probably associated with micro environmental differences surrounding herbaceous plants between natural grassland and understory of the forestland despite the same outer conditions of the two catchments e g precipitation temperature and geological backgrounds 4 3 temporal variation of root water utilization and swc knowledge about soil water isotopic composition is of fundamental importance when studying the root water uptake pattern of plants rothfuss and javaux 2017 during the sampling period the isotopic values in surface soil water 70 cm were highly variable and relatively stable in deeper soil layers for all six sites in both catchments fig 5 which is supported by another study conducted approximately 50 km away from our catchments in the central clp wan and liu 2016 both δ18o and δ2h values were enriched in july and august but depleted in september and october in upper soil layers fig 5 in addition the isotopic profiles in soil water did not vary smoothly as predicted by zimmermann et al 1967 both of which mean that soil water isotopic compositions are influenced by precipitation recharge mixing with antecedent moisture and evaporation hsieh et al 1998 brooks et al 2015 soil water δ18o and δ2h from upper soil layers were relatively enriched in july and august but were depleted in september and october fig 5 this observation was supported by variation of the swc for all six sites across months fig 6 the enriched soil water in upper soil layers corresponded well to the lower swc in july and august which was probably attributed to less rainfall and intensive evaporation from surface soil horizon gazis and feng 2004 however the isotopically depleted soil water matched well with the high swc in september and october which was probably due to the effect of recent rainfall recharge with negatively isotopic values 18 1 137 2 and 14 5 100 5 in september and october respectively collectively compared to deep soil layers from july to october the isotopic values and swc exhibited larger variability in upper soil layers which is consistent with results of previous studies in arid and semi arid regions penna et al 2013 yang et al 2014 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2019a both δ18o and δ2h of root water across months exhibited significant variation p 0 05 because of the influence of soil water evaporative difference across months dawson and ehleringer 1991 evaristo et al 2015 comparison of water isotopes between root and soil provides information on the depth of soil water uptake by plants bodé et al 2019 the method for quantitatively evaluating mean uptake depth by plant roots is generally based on graphical inference method which defines the mean root water uptake depth as the soil depth where isotopic composition of soil water is most similar to or equals that of the xylem water amin et al 2020 in our study the mean uptake depths of herbaceous plants from all six sites were mainly concentrated at the upper soil layers during the study period because δ18o and δ2h in root water were similar to those in soil water from upper soil layers fig 5 similar results have been found in many previous studies asbjornsen et al 2008 yang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the upper soil layers as the mean uptake depth of herbaceous plants are likely to result from very high fine root density at these layers schenk and jackson 2005 li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2019b huo et al 2018 because plant water use patterns have been closely correlated with fine root distribution dawson et al 2002 schenk 2008 unexpectedly our study found that root water δ18o and δ2h in some species e g phaenosperma globose patrinia scabiosifolia and artemisia capillaris or some sampling months september and october deviated significantly from soil water isotopic profiles fig 5 and significant differences in both δ18o and δ2h between root water and soil water were observed across months in both catchments fig 3 this phenomenon could be explained by three possibilities first a growing number of studies has reported that isotopic composition of root water was generally enriched relative to that of the considered sources brooks et al 2010 bowling et al 2017 evaristo et al 2017 showing that isotopic fractionation during root water uptake may be more common than previously thought i e only occurred saline or xeric environments lin and sternberg 1993 ellsowrth and williams 2007 barbeta et al 2019 the existence of isotopic fractionation during root water uptake should be obtained under the condition of all potential water sources sampled all herbaceous plants in six plots utilized soil water as an exclusive water source during the study period the second possibility is that plants could access various leaf surface waters e g fog dew and water vapor barbeta et al 2019 although soil water provides a water source for herbaceous plants belowground in both catchments since we have not monitored these leaf surface waters during our sampling period this possibility could not be verified the third possibility is the two water worlds tww hypothesis where soil immobile water contained in small pores is accessible to plants whereby soil mobile water does not participate in plant water use but contributes to groundwater and stream flow brooks et al 2010 mcdonnell 2014 soil water in this study is obtained by the cryogenic distillation system which could extract soil mobile and immobile water together mcdonnell 2014 in light of the tww hypothesis the relative contribution of soil mobile and immobile water to soil water used by plant roots should be further examined in the future 5 conclusion in the natural grassland and understory of the planted forestland on the clp δ18o and δ2h of psrl waters varied significantly over months and waters the temporal patterns of psrl waters were dominantly controlled by the effect of temperature on precipitation δ18o and δ2h the relationships of δ18o and δ2h indicated that both soil evaporation and leaf transpiration in the understory of the forestland were relatively lower than they were in the grassland moreover the differences in δ18o and δ2h between root and soil waters in some herbaceous plants probably resulted from various possibilities as mentioned above these possibilities need to be further examined across a variety of species and other potential water sources and soil water separation

10149,a series of revegetation programs have been carried out since 1950s and a large area of cropland has been converted to forestland and grassland through tree plantation and natural vegetation restoration however it is still inadequately addressed how plant revegetation changes the characteristics of soil plant waters in this study we compared δ18o and δ2h values of different waters from precipitation soil water root water and leaf water between different herbaceous plants understory of the planted forestland and natural recovered grassland in two neighboring catchments there was a temporal consistence in δ18o and δ2h among different waters showing that root water and leaf water could record well the signals of soil water and precipitation followed by temperature change over month a series of water line equations between δ18o and δ2h indicate that herbaceous plants have higher soil evaporation for grassland than understory of the forestland instead of leaf transpiration moreover our study found significant differences in δ18o and δ2h between root water and soil water probably associated with isotopic fractionation during root water uptake leaf surface water pools and ecohydrological separation this study will be helpful to better understand the effect of plant revegetation programmes planted forestland catchment versus natural grassland catchment on ecohydrological processes on the chinese loess plateau keywords stable water isotopes ecohydrological processes the chinese loess plateau grassland forestland 1 introduction the earth s critical zone involves all aspects of surface and near surface environments from the base of the groundwater reservoir to the top of the vegetation canopy nrc 2001 brantley et al 2007 there is an increased interest in performing researches on the upper boundary of the critical zone as an important interface between vegetation and surrounding soils sprenger et al 2017 reobroek et al 2020 studying the interaction of soil and plant water is therefore vital for an in depth understanding of eco hydrological processes because the accessibility of soil water determines plant growth and survival and in turn the distribution of plants influences ecological functions of the soil vegetation system dawson and ehleringer 1991 drake and franks 2003 feng et al 2016 chang et al 2019 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h which serve as fingerprints of the water molecule of the terrestrial water cycle are often used to trace processes and connections of ecohydrology and plant tissues yakir and wang 1996 barbour 2007 for example numerous studies have shown that δ18o and δ2h of soil and root xylem waters can be used to study the proportions and dynamics of root water uptake by plants dawson et al 2002 jia et al 2013 rothfuss and javaux 2017 jespersen et al 2018 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2019a amin et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 under an assumption of no isotopic fractionation of δ2h and δ18o during root water uptake in terrestrial plants ehleringer and dawson 1992 brunel et al 1995 wang et al 2017 the exception is some salt tolerant coastal species lin and sternberg 1993 and woody xerophytes ellsowrth and williams 2007 leaf water is generally enriched in 18o and 2h compared to its source water because of evapotranspiration liu et al 2015 plavcová et al 2018 and it is subsequently used to generate carbohydrates such as cellulose barbour 2007 helliker and richter 2008 and leaf wax liu et al 2016 which can be used for paleoclimatic reconstruction barbour 2007 helliker and richter 2008 liu and an 2019 thus both soil water and plant water e g root water and leaf water are key components of the ecohydrological cycle and their isotopic variation can provide valuable information on the interactions between plant and soil waters sprenger et al 2016 vargas et al 2017 che et al 2019 the chinese loess plateau clp is the largest area with loess deposits in the world and the groundwater table depth is more than 60 m huang et al 2013 soil water is an important water source for plants in arid and semi arid areas especially areas where groundwater is too deep to access wang et al 2019a precipitation primarily occurs from july to september accounting for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation liu et al 2018 the high precipitation intensity during the rainy season and poor soil texture causes severe soil erosion and environmental degradation feng et al 2012 2016 to improve sustainable development of the clp a series of revegetation programmes have been carried out since the early 1950s especially noteworthy is the launch of the grain for green gfg project in the 2000s chen et al 2007 zhou et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 after implementation of these revegetation programmes a large area of cropland has been converted to forestland and grassland through tree plantation and natural vegetation restoration fu et al 2017 however it is still unclear how revegetation changes the terrestrial ecohydrological processes and how soil and plant waters interact together in the revegetated ecosystem a recent study by schwärzel et al 2020 has demonstrated that the understory instead of the overstory was the main water consumer in the planted forestland on the clp which challenged the general belief that soil water was mainly consumed by trees similar findings have been reported in mediterranean oak savannas dubbert et al 2014 and eastern siberian larch forests iida et al 2009 where understory was a significant component of the water balance in the planted forestland the forestland and grassland are widely distributed on the clp by conducting tree plantation and natural vegetation restoration and herbaceous plants exist simultaneously thus herbaceous plants play critical roles in the water balance in both ecosystems on the clp it is crucially important to compare the difference of ecohydrological processes in the same plant type i e herbaceous plants between forestland and grassland on the clp and help to in depth understand the soil and plant water interaction in the planted forestland in this study we conducted a temporal investigation of δ18o and δ2h from different waters in a pair of neighbouring small catchments on the clp planted forestland catchment versus natural grassland catchment with similar topographical and geological backgrounds fig 1 jin et al 2014 the herbaceous plants in the two catchments were collected to limit the soil water uptake depth within less than 2 m because studies have shown that shallow rooted plants such as grasses and herbs tend to use soil water near the surface while deep rooted trees rely on deep soil water or groundwater mccole and stern 2007 prechsl et al 2015 priyadarshini et al 2016 the objectives of this study are to investigate the isotopic variations of different waters e g precipitation soil water root water and leaf water in these two catchments and to test whether or not there is a difference of ecohydrological processes in the same taxonomy of herbaceous plants from an understory of the planted forestland and natural

containing the two neighbouring catchments i e yjg forestland and dzg grassland in the central chinese loess plateau fig 1a b this region experiences a semi arid continental climate with the mean annual temperature and precipitation of 9 3 c and 556 5 mm respectively fig 1c jin et al 2018 the area is characterized as the typical table and gully landscape with elevations ranging from 1050 m to 1423 m the local loessal soil derived from quaternary dust is approximately 250 m thick and the texture is largely silt loamy li 2006 the dzg grassland catchment 1 15 km2 has undergone natural regrowth of native grass species since 1954 while yjg forestland catchment 0 87 km2 was planted with trees from 1954 to 1958 after ca 65 years of vegetation rehabilitation without other anthropogenic activities these two catchments have formed completely different vegetation landscapes representative of a planted forestland versus a natural grassland fig 1d the yjg forestland catchment is dominated by deciduous trees and there is a dense understory composed of shrubs and grasses jin et al 2018 the undergrowth herbaceous plants in yjg forestland are dominated by agropyron cristatum bothriochloa ischaemum phaenosperma globose carex lanceolata and lycium barbarum and species in dzg grassland by patrinia scabiosifolia artemisia capillaris phragmites australis 2 2 sample collection plant and soil samples were collected once a month from july to october 2019 six 10 m 10 m plots were established as the permanent field sites three plots were set up in each of the two catchments with two sites on both sides of the catchment and one site in the bottom of trench fig 1b the dominant herbaceous plants in each plot were sampled during the study periods artemisia scoparza phragmites communis were not available in october because they withered up and died and the whole body of each species was collected to obtain enough roots and leaves for analysis all samples were stored in a dry cooler ca 4 c in the field prior to immediate transportation to the laboratory in the laboratory all plant materials were cut into two main organs i e leaves and roots using sterilized scissors a total of 21 leaf and 21 root samples were obtained from six plots the soils surrounding the sampling plants were simultaneously collected by a hand held auger 6 cm in diameter with two auxiliary drill pipes each drill pipe was 1 m length soil samples were limited to 200 cm depth at intervals of 10 cm in each plot a total of 492 soil samples were collected during the study period soil samples were divided into two parts one was stored in a freezer for isotopic analysis and the other was used to obtain gravimetric soil water content swc as determined by drying the samples for 12 h at 105 c moreover a total of 15 precipitation samples were collected using a polyethylene bottle and funnel during the study periods an automatic weather station was set up in a clear area near the output of dzg grassland fig 1b jin et al 2018 2 3 stable isotope analysis precipitation samples were filtered to eliminate any impurities before conducting an isotopic analysis a cryogenic distillation system was used to extract water from soil and root leaf samples in the laboratory as detailed in liu et al 2015 the isotopic composition of soil water and precipitation were measured through using a picarro l2130 i isotope water analyzer sunnyvale ca usa the analytical accuracies were 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h the isotopic measurements of root and leaf waters were conducted using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer ht2000 ea irms delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific inc usa the measurement precisions were 0 2 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the isotopic composition of δ18o and δ2h is expressed as an isotope ratio 1 δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δ sample represents δ18o or δ2h r sample and r standard indicate the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h of the sample and standard respectively the δ18o and δ2h values are reported relative to the vienna mean standard ocean water vsmow 2 4 data analysis statistical analyses e g mean max and min for isotopes of precipitation soil root and leaf waters were performed to show the range and distribution of δ18o and δ2h pearson correlation was conducted to describe various correlations between δ18o and δ2h among different water types e g precipitation soil water root water and leaf water because the isotopic data were normally distributed according to the kolmogorov smirnov k s test a one way anova combined with a post hoc tukey s least significant difference lsd test was performed to identify the significant differences of the swc and isotopic compositions of precipitation soil root and leaf waters across months comparisons of the relationships of δ18o and δ2h for soil water and leaf water were performed by using an analysis of covariance ancova to compare slopes between yjg forestland and dzg grassland the significance level for all statistical tests was set to the 95 confidence interval 3 results 3 1 precipitation amount temperature and isotopes both daily air temperature and precipitation amount showed a unimodal distribution in 2019 fig 2a the daily air temperature peaked at july avg 22 5 c and decreased monotonically to october avg 10 3 c during the sampling period the daily precipitation was also concentrated in the same period accounting for 64 344 mm of the total annual amount 538 mm the three main precipitation events 20 mm occurred in this period showing the daily precipitation amounts of 69 8 mm on 3 august 49 2 mm on 26 august and 22 2 mm on 9 september respectively precipitation δ18o and δ2h showed large variations during the study period and both δ18o and δ2h decreased significantly from july to october fig 2a r2 0 49 for δ18o and r2 0 46 for δ2h 3 2 isotopes in different waters the δ18o and δ2h in the two catchments varied by water and month fig 3 the averages of δ18o values were 9 9 8 5 5 5 and 4 0 and those of δ2h values were 66 8 58 9 43 8 and 37 2 for precipitation soil water root water and leaf water respectively within precipitation soil root leaf psrl waters a progressive increase in δ18o or δ2h existed from precipitation to soil root and leaf waters for each month fig 3 moreover the δ18o and δ2h decreased significantly across months in precipitation root water and leaf water p 0 05 the δ18o and δ2h in soil water showed no significant differences across months for each catchment p 0 05 3 3 the swc and isotopes between forestland and grassland the swc showed no significant difference between forestland and grassland p 0 70 however there was a significant difference in soil water between forestland and grassland for δ18o p 0 05 instead of δ2h p 0 83 likewise significant differences in root and leaf waters between forestland and grassland for δ18o were observed p 0 05 but non significant differences in root water p 0 33 and leaf water p 0 30 for δ2h significant correlations between δ18o and δ2h were observed in psrl waters during the study period fig 4 the local meteoric water line lmwl is described by the equation δ2h 7 78 δ18o 10 8 r2 0 97 p 0 05 the slope is slightly smaller than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 17 δ18o 10 35 rozanski et al 2013 indicating relatively arid climate and strong kinetic fractionation due to evaporation the slopes and intercepts of the soil water line equations in both catchments were slightly smaller compared to the lmwl fig 4 indicating that soil water was mainly influenced by the mixture of various precipitation events and undergoing evaporation yang and fu 2017 the two relationship of δ18o and δ2h between yjg forestland and dzg grassland was significant ancova df 71 2 f 4 84 p 0 028 0 05 indicating that soil water evaporation is significantly different for herbaceous plants between yjg forestland and dzg grassland moreover the linear relationships between δ18o and δ2h was δ2h 5 82 δ18o 7 45 r2 0 98 in root water and δ2h 5 66 δ18o 11 4 r2 0 97 in leaf water in yjg forestland while those for root water and leaf water were δ2h 4 79 δ18o 22 4 r2 0 75 and δ2h 4 41 δ18o 24 0 r2 0 66 in dzg grassland respectively the ancova test showed no significant difference for the slopes of δ18o and δ2h between yjg forestland and dzg grassland df 120 6 f 1 485 p 0 24 0 05 suggesting that leaf water transpiration for herbaceous plants between yjg forestland and dzg grassland was not different 4 discussion 4 1 temporal pattern of psrl waters as a consequence of temperature effect there were significantly temporal variations of δ18o and δ2h for psrl waters in two catchments in spite of progressive enrichments of psrl waters for each month as months proceeded the δ18o and δ2h in root and leaf waters decreased significantly responding well to the decreasing trends of precipitation δ18o and δ2h fig 3 this finding of temporal consistency between precipitation and plant waters root water and leaf water has been observed in a number of studies phillips and ehleringer 1995 cernusak et al 2005 meinzer et al 2006 sprenger et al 2016 berry et al 2017 plavcová et al 2018 the isotopic inheritance from precipitation to plant waters indicated that precipitation δ18o and δ2h conduct a dominated control on temporal patterns of psrl waters the spatial and temporal variability in precipitation δ18o and δ2h can be described by temperature altitude latitude continental and amount effects dansgaard 1964 mcguire and mcdonnell 2008 wu et al 2019 penna and meerveld 2019 as these two catchments neighbour in the same watershed the effects of altitude latitude and continent could be excluded the decreasing trends of precipitation δ18o and δ2h would result from temperature and or precipitation amount effects no significant correlations between precipitation amount and precipitation δ18o p 0 77 and δ2h p 0 44 were observed fig 2b as months progressed during the study period daily precipitation amounts decreased significantly especially for the three main precipitation events fig 2a but isotopic compositions of three main precipitations were 11 3 4 7 and 11 4 for δ18o and 76 9 22 4 and 77 9 for δ2h thus the temporal variability of precipitation δ18o and δ2h should not originate from precipitation amount effect however significant correlations between temperature and precipitation δ18o r2 0 50 and δ2h r2 0 61 were observed fig 2c which is consistent with observations in middle latitudes rozanski et al 2013 and northwest china wan et al 2017 the temperature effect on precipitation δ18o and δ2h depends on the equilibrium isotopic fractionation with more enriched in 18o and 2h at higher temperature sachse et al 2012 our results indicated that temperature effect was the dominant control on precipitation δ18o and δ2h during the study period in these two catchments this finding is supported by a study that the temperature effect is the prominent factor across many regions outside the tropics bowen 2008 4 2 comparisons between natural grassland and planted forestland natural vegetation restoration and tree plantation are two important measures for revegetation on the clp jin et al 2014 many studies have shown that the revegetation exerted profound effects on the regional and local hydrological processes on the clp chen et al 2008 feng et al 2012 2016 jia et al 2017 although δ18o and δ2h varied significantly over months and within psrl waters fig 3 the temporal dynamics of psrl water interaction needs to be further examined in these two contrasted ecosystems to compare the difference of psrl water interaction from herbaceous plants between understory of the planted forestland and natural grassland we established a series of water line equations between δ18o and δ2h fig 4 soil root and leaf water samples lay at an angle to the lmwl and is well described by linear regressions e g brooks et al 2010 goldsmith et al 2012 evaristo et al 2015 che et al 2019 the slopes and intercepts of these water lines are determined by the relative evaporation rates of the different water isotopes crawford et al 2014 benettin et al 2018 bowen et al 2018 chi et al 2019 indicating the different magnitudes of evaporative enrichment of isotopes in soil root and leaf waters this result was also consistent with isotopic increase in psrl waters fig 3 the ancova test showed that the slopes of δ18o and δ2h in soil water is significant different p 0 05 and the slope and intercept of soil water in dzg grassland 7 05 and 0 38 respectively were slightly lower than those in yjg forestland 7 61 and 7 32 respectively suggesting that compared to forestland soil evaporation is slightly greater in grassland this outcome is probably due to dense coverage of overstory shading in yjg forestland which weakened soil evaporation from understory of planted forestland in yjg forestland this finding is supported by a consecutive observation that daily evaporation rates were slightly lower for understory than grassland during the growing season on the clp schwärzel et al 2020 nevertheless the ancova test showed no significant difference for the slopes of δ18o and δ2h in leaf water although the slopes and intercepts were seemingly different dzg grassland 4 41 and 24 0 yjg forestland 5 66 and 11 4 the superficial difference likely results from substantial variabilities for leaf water in yjg forestland mean 40 5 standard deviation 22 7 and dzg grassland man 30 9 standard deviation 19 6 thus leaf transpiration in the same taxonomy of herbaceous plants from an understory of the planted forestland and natural grassland was no significant different and both catchments contribute approximate leaf transpiration because isotopic fractionation in leaf water originates primarily from evaporative distinctions of 2h 1h and 18o 16o through leaf stomata helliker and ehleringer 2000 cappa et al 2003 farquhar et al 2007 as these two catchments are neighbouring they have similar topographical and geological backgrounds jin et al 2014 and precipitation δ18o and δ2h stayed the same in the two catchments which is mainly influenced as discussed above by temperature effect the δ18o in soil root and leaf waters showed significant differences between yjg forestland and dzg grassland p 0 05 instead of δ2h between the two catchments p 0 83 0 33 and 0 30 for soil root and leaf waters respectively which would produce the different slopes and intercepts of water line equations from soil root and leaf waters between two contrasted catchments isotope fractionated difference between δ18o and δ2h were also observed ellsowrth and williams 2007 we guess that the difference of isotope fractionation between δ18o and δ2h in these contrasted catchments is probably associated with micro environmental differences surrounding herbaceous plants between natural grassland and understory of the forestland despite the same outer conditions of the two catchments e g precipitation temperature and geological backgrounds 4 3 temporal variation of root water utilization and swc knowledge about soil water isotopic composition is of fundamental importance when studying the root water uptake pattern of plants rothfuss and javaux 2017 during the sampling period the isotopic values in surface soil water 70 cm were highly variable and relatively stable in deeper soil layers for all six sites in both catchments fig 5 which is supported by another study conducted approximately 50 km away from our catchments in the central clp wan and liu 2016 both δ18o and δ2h values were enriched in july and august but depleted in september and october in upper soil layers fig 5 in addition the isotopic profiles in soil water did not vary smoothly as predicted by zimmermann et al 1967 both of which mean that soil water isotopic compositions are influenced by precipitation recharge mixing with antecedent moisture and evaporation hsieh et al 1998 brooks et al 2015 soil water δ18o and δ2h from upper soil layers were relatively enriched in july and august but were depleted in september and october fig 5 this observation was supported by variation of the swc for all six sites across months fig 6 the enriched soil water in upper soil layers corresponded well to the lower swc in july and august which was probably attributed to less rainfall and intensive evaporation from surface soil horizon gazis and feng 2004 however the isotopically depleted soil water matched well with the high swc in september and october which was probably due to the effect of recent rainfall recharge with negatively isotopic values 18 1 137 2 and 14 5 100 5 in september and october respectively collectively compared to deep soil layers from july to october the isotopic values and swc exhibited larger variability in upper soil layers which is consistent with results of previous studies in arid and semi arid regions penna et al 2013 yang et al 2014 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2019a both δ18o and δ2h of root water across months exhibited significant variation p 0 05 because of the influence of soil water evaporative difference across months dawson and ehleringer 1991 evaristo et al 2015 comparison of water isotopes between root and soil provides information on the depth of soil water uptake by plants bodé et al 2019 the method for quantitatively evaluating mean uptake depth by plant roots is generally based on graphical inference method which defines the mean root water uptake depth as the soil depth where isotopic composition of soil water is most similar to or equals that of the xylem water amin et al 2020 in our study the mean uptake depths of herbaceous plants from all six sites were mainly concentrated at the upper soil layers during the study period because δ18o and δ2h in root water were similar to those in soil water from upper soil layers fig 5 similar results have been found in many previous studies asbjornsen et al 2008 yang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the upper soil layers as the mean uptake depth of herbaceous plants are likely to result from very high fine root density at these layers schenk and jackson 2005 li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2019b huo et al 2018 because plant water use patterns have been closely correlated with fine root distribution dawson et al 2002 schenk 2008 unexpectedly our study found that root water δ18o and δ2h in some species e g phaenosperma globose patrinia scabiosifolia and artemisia capillaris or some sampling months september and october deviated significantly from soil water isotopic profiles fig 5 and significant differences in both δ18o and δ2h between root water and soil water were observed across months in both catchments fig 3 this phenomenon could be explained by three possibilities first a growing number of studies has reported that isotopic composition of root water was generally enriched relative to that of the considered sources brooks et al 2010 bowling et al 2017 evaristo et al 2017 showing that isotopic fractionation during root water uptake may be more common than previously thought i e only occurred saline or xeric environments lin and sternberg 1993 ellsowrth and williams 2007 barbeta et al 2019 the existence of isotopic fractionation during root water uptake should be obtained under the condition of all potential water sources sampled all herbaceous plants in six plots utilized soil water as an exclusive water source during the study period the second possibility is that plants could access various leaf surface waters e g fog dew and water vapor barbeta et al 2019 although soil water provides a water source for herbaceous plants belowground in both catchments since we have not monitored these leaf surface waters during our sampling period this possibility could not be verified the third possibility is the two water worlds tww hypothesis where soil immobile water contained in small pores is accessible to plants whereby soil mobile water does not participate in plant water use but contributes to groundwater and stream flow brooks et al 2010 mcdonnell 2014 soil water in this study is obtained by the cryogenic distillation system which could extract soil mobile and immobile water together mcdonnell 2014 in light of the tww hypothesis the relative contribution of soil mobile and immobile water to soil water used by plant roots should be further examined in the future 5 conclusion in the natural grassland and understory of the planted forestland on the clp δ18o and δ2h of psrl waters varied significantly over months and waters the temporal patterns of psrl waters were dominantly controlled by the effect of temperature on precipitation δ18o and δ2h the relationships of δ18o and δ2h indicated that both soil evaporation and leaf transpiration in the understory of the forestland were relatively lower than they were in the grassland moreover the differences in δ18o and δ2h between root and soil waters in some herbaceous plants probably resulted from various possibilities as mentioned above these possibilities need to be further examined across a variety of species and other potential water sources and soil water separation
