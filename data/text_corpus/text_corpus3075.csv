15375,although various pretreatments have been applied to promote the anaerobic digestion of waste active sludge was the mechanisms regarding the impact of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion have not been well addressed in this study the effects of acid alkali and thermal pretreatments on anaerobic digestion of was were comprehensively investigated from the perspectives of organic matter composition thermodynamics and multi omics results showed acid alkali and thermal pretreatments increased the methane production potential of was by 53 7 98 2 and 101 8 respectively compared with the control the protein secondary structure was disrupted after pretreatment with a shift from α helix and β sheet to random coil and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands thermodynamically the was flocculation process was controlled by the short range interfacial interactions described by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which was positively correlated r 0 97 p 0 05 with the organic matter solubilization of the was after pretreatment the flocculation energy barrier of pretreated was was 4 1 acid 7 0 alkali and 7 1 thermal times higher than that of the control group respectively multi omics analysis confirmed that pretreatment promoted amino acids tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate glutamate metabolism energy metabolism abc transporters and vitamin metabolism moreover the comparison of upregulated differentially expressed proteins deps revealed that for amino acid metabolism thermal treatment had the best promotion effect for carbohydrate metabolism alkali treatment had the best promotion effect and for lipid metabolism acid treatment was more advantageous resulting in different anaerobic digestion efficiencies this study provides an in depth understanding of the impact of different pretreatments on was anaerobic digestion and has practical implication for the choice of proper pretreatment technology for biosolids graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste active sludge pretreatment anaerobic digestion thermodynamic metaproteomic metabolomic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waste activated sludge was treatment is a significant financial burden in wastewater treatment plants with management expenses accounting for up to 50 of total wastewater treatment costs appels et al 2008 reduction stabilization and harmlessness are the ultimate purpose of was treatment and disposal anaerobic digestion has been widely used for was treatment since it can reduce biosolid mass and produce energy in the form of ch4 and other biofuels elsamadony et al 2021 luo et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 however most of the time the transformation rate of organic matters of was during anaerobic digestion is not as high as theoretically expected novak et al 2011 it is well known that the complex floc structure microbial cell walls and granular organic matters limit the solubilization of was neumann et al 2016 to overcome this limitation various pretreatments including mechanical thermal chemical and biological processes have been employed individually or in combination prior to anaerobic digestion among which the effects of acid alkali and thermal pretreatments on solubilization of was production of volatile fatty acids vfas and methane during anaerobic digestion have been investigated in numerous studies liu et al 2012 lu et al 2018 yuan et al 2006 liu et al 2012 and lu et al 2018 recommend a ph of 12 as the optimal condition for solubilization of was xu et al 2020b 2021 proposed an acid pretreatment technique based on the concept of isoelectric point pretreatment ph 2 4 which maximized the retention of organic matters in was and eliminated some inhibitory metal complexes to improve methane production for the well established and commercialized thermal pretreatment technology the solubilization of was was gradually promoted with increasing temperature in the typical temperature range of 60 180 c carrère et al 2008 li and noike 1992 however the above studies focused on the optimization of pretreatment conditions and consistently ascribed the facilitative effect of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion to the acceleration of sludge hydrolysis khanh nguyen et al 2021 zhen et al 2017 while the impact of pretreatment on physicochemical properties and spatial conformation of critical organic fractions in was during anaerobic digestion was neglected as therefore change of physicochemical properties and structure of was with pretreatment should be investigated as they play an important role in solubilization hydrolysis and even biodegradation of was xu et al 2020a moreover previous studies reported that thermal pretreatment 100 200 c physical pretreatment ultrasound microwave high pressure homogenization etc and chemical pretreatment acid alkali could enhance biogas production during anaerobic digestion by 20 150 4 115 and 12 110 respectively neumann et al 2016 the reason behind this big discrepancy also deserves further investigation the promotion mechanism of pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion process can be comprehensively elucidated in terms of physicochemical properties spatial conformation and microbial functions of was it has been shown that the low methanogenic efficiency of high protein wastes can be attributed to the hydrolysis rate limitation caused by the complex natural structure of the protein li et al 2022 since proteins are major components of was the impact of different pretreatments on their properties and conformation should be specifically concerned xu et al 2020a in addition the complex structure of was is usually stabilized by the flocculation between water extracellular polymers eps and bacterial cells xu et al 2020a and it has been suggested that this process is controlled by short range thermodynamic interactions described by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory grasso et al 2002 several literatures confirmed the feasibility of the proposed thermodynamic approach in quantifying flocculation energy chen et al 2019 liu et al 2007 wu et al 2020 in addition the highly complex microbial community in anaerobic digestion sludge plays a crucial role in sludge treatment characterization of the microbial community structure and its metabolic pathways during anaerobic digestion has a conducive role in understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of anaerobic digestion although metataxonomic 16s rrna sequencing and metagenomic techniques have been widely used to identify critical microorganisms and their potential functions in anaerobic digestion systems the diversity and functional redundancy of microbial communities may lead to misinterpretation of community function with the increased resolution of metaproteomic and metabolomic it is expected to provide direct evidence at the protein level to reveal microbial functions and their metabolic pathways related studies have confirmed that metaproteomic could identify critical functional proteins and their fate during anaerobic digestion of was liu et al 2021 park and helm 2008 zhang et al 2022 and metabolomic revealed the results of microbial interactions from a material perspective guo et al 2018 puig castellví et al 2020 however studies addressing the impact of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of was at the metaproteomic and metabolomic levels are still limited in other words the reasons for the discrepancy in functional mechanisms caused by pretreatment remain ambiguous therefore multi omics techniques could provide a useful tool to reveal the microbial mechanism behind the discrepancy during anaerobic digestion of was caused by different pretreatments the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of several typical pretreatments acid alkali and thermal pretreatments on the anaerobic digestion of was from the perspectives of organic matter composition thermodynamics and multi omics anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted for was after acid alkali and thermal pretreatments supernatant and freeze dried sludge samples of was after pretreatment and during anaerobic digestion process were characterized and compared the critical organic fractions were characterized by fluorescence excitation emission eem spectra fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements and xdlvo theory and multi omics analysis were combined to comprehensively elucidate the impact mechanism of these pretreatments on the anaerobic digestion of was 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup and was properties the raw was substrate was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank in a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china and used after sedimentation and concentration the inoculum was obtained from a laboratory scale mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor acid alkali and thermal pretreatments were used to investigate the impact of pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of was for acid and alkali pretreatments the ph of was was adjusted to 3 0 and 12 0 using 6 m hcl and naoh respectively and then the was was placed in a thermostatic air bath shaker for 12h 25 c 150 rpm the thermal pretreatment group was heated in an oven at 130 c for 1 h after the pretreatment the ph of was was readjusted to 6 8 kept consistent with the raw sludge to ensure a proper condition for the anaerobic digestion of was for anaerobic digestion experiments the was substrate was mixed with inoculated sludge in a 500 ml digester working volume 400 ml and divided into control acid pretreatment alkali pretreatment and thermal pretreatment groups recorded as control acid alkali and thermal each with three parallels the substrate used in the control group was the raw was without pretreatment while the pretreated was was used in the experimental groups the inoculation ratio of substrate to inoculum was 2 3 1 in vs and the specific sludge properties are shown in table 1 methane production was determined by an automatic methane potential meter multitalent 203 novaskantek sweden through the naoh adsorption unit to eliminate the acidic gases such as co2 and h2s 2 2 model analysis of methane production the modified gompertz model eq 1 was used to analyze the methane production of the different experimental groups during anaerobic digestion processes 1 m t m 0 e x p e x p r m e m 0 λ t 1 where mt represents the cumulative methane production ml g vs at time t t indicates the time of anaerobic digestion d m0 is the maximum methane potential ml gvs 1 rm is the maximum methane generation rate ml gvs 1 d 1 λ is lag phase time d e 2 71828 model fitting was carried out in the software origin 2018 2 3 interfacial thermodynamics analysis the traditional xdlvo theory can only quantify the interfacial interaction between two ideal planes van oss 1993 but the sludge particles are near spherical granules therefore the derjaguin integral approximation was used to quantify the short range interaction energy between two sludge particles yu et al 2018 a detailed description is provided in the supporting information text s1 2 4 multi omics analysis after different pretreatments was samples on day 0 and day 20 of anaerobic digestion were characterized by label free quantitative techniques proteomics the functional proteins of was were identified by protein sequences predicted from metagenomic sequencing of was samples the differentially expressed proteins deps were determined by thresholds of fold change fc fc 0 67 fc 1 5 and p 0 05 in addition metabolomic analysis of was was conducted on day 0 5 and 20 during anaerobic digestion to determine the impact of pretreatment on was anaerobic digestion metagenomic zhang et al 2022 metaproteomic zhang et al 2020 and metabolomic shi et al 2021 analyses were conducted at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china and a detailed description of the analysis procedure can refer to previous studies 2 5 other analytical methods total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined by standard methods apha 2005 soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and total chemical oxygen demand tcod were measured by a visible light spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa the concentration of vfas was detected by a gas chromatography gc equipped with flame ionization detection fid gc 6890 agilent usa protein and polysaccharides in the supernatant were colorimetrically measured using lowry folin method lowry et al 1951 and anthrone sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with bovine serum protein bsa and glucose as standard substances respectively eem spectra of supernatant were collected using a fluorescence spectrometer f 7100 hitachi japan and fluorescence region integration fri and fluorescence index fi analysis were calculated using domfluor toolbox chen et al 2003 stedmon and bro 2008 the contact angle of the was was measured by a contact angle meter jc2000d powereach china based on the drip stop method in order to obtain the individual surface tension components of a solid surface three typical liquids ultrapure water glycerin and diiodomethane were selected as probe liquids for contact angle measurements the zeta potential of the was suspension was determined by a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the content of c and n elements in was were measured by vario el iii elementar germany to investigate the functional groups and structural changes in the was the xps thermo scientific k alpha usa and ftir spectroscopy nicolet 5700 usa were conducted 2d correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir were obtained from the 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan moreover the amide i region of 1700 1600 cm 1 was further analyzed by peakfit v4 12 to extract information about the secondary structure of the protein yin et al 2015 the structural equation model was performed using spss and amos graphics software amos version 24 a combined correlation diagram was visualized with the linket package v 0 0 3 in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of pretreatment on methane production and the change of organic matters the cumulative methane production curves indicate that pretreatment significantly promoted the anaerobic digestion performance of was fig 1 the modified gompertz model was used to calculate the kinetic parameters of the was anaerobic digestion process as shown in table 2 the m0 of the pretreated was was effectively increased by 101 8 thermal 98 2 alkali and 53 7 acid respectively compared to the control 64 98 ml gvs furthermore the rm of alkali 19 28 ml gvs 1 d 1 and thermal pretreatment 17 11 ml gvs 1 d 1 was greatly higher than that of acid pretreatment 13 36 ml gvs 1 d 1 suggesting that alkali and thermal pretreatments were more efficient in enhancing ch4 production during anaerobic digestion the characterization of scod protein polysaccharide and vfas contents in the supernatant during anaerobic digestion of was after different pretreatments fig 2 shows that pretreatment had a significant contribution to hydrolysis and acidification of the was this observation is also supported by a previous study neumann et al 2016 herein alkali pretreatment was more conducive to the accumulation of vfas while thermal pretreatment had better solubilization effect on protein and polysaccharide overall effects of different pretreatments on the release of dom into the supernatant followed the order of alkali thermal acid in addition as the anaerobic digestion time increased dom was gradually degraded accompanied by the production of ch4 co2 and nh4 n eem is widely used for dom identification due to its fast and sensitive response fig s1 shows the eem spectra of the was supernatant at different periods of anaerobic digestion herein the fluorescence intensity of eem spectra at different digestion periods corresponded to the dom content in the supernatant fig 2 the eem spectral are usually divided into 5 regions region ⅰ aromatic protein ⅰ region ⅱ aromatic protein ⅱ region ⅲ fulvic acid like region ⅳ soluble microbial by product like and region ⅴ humic acid like in combination with fri analysis the fluorescence intensity of each region can be quantified to track the changes in each fluorescent component during anaerobic digestion chen et al 2003 fig 3 a it is reasonable that the fluorescence intensity of regions i and ii was enhanced after pretreatment because protein is the main component of was the three pretreatments had similar facilitation effects on regions i and ii enhancing the aromatic protein production by about 5 times compared with that of the control region iv was mainly proteins and polysaccharides derived from microbial by product which were also significantly increased after different pretreatments the fluorescence intensity of region iv was increased by 670 acid 800 alkali and 820 thermal respectively while region v mainly originated from refractory by products generated during the pretreatment alkali treatment and thermal treatment produced more refractory substances than acid treatment the biological index bix and the humification index hix can be used to determine the autotrophic productivity and humification of dom zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 b c the bix in the was supernatant increased and the hix decreased after pretreatment it is noted that bix increased on day 5 during anaerobic digestion which was associated with enhanced microbial metabolic capacity due to the release of dom after pretreatment while the hix of the acid group was close to hix of the control after 10 days of digestion and much higher than that of the alkali thermal group indicating that degradable dom was consumed more rapidly in the acid pretreatment group in conclusion eem analysis reflects that the release of soluble microbial by products may be responsible for the discrepancy in the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of was after different pretreatments the mechanisms involved in the impact of pretreatment on the change of was properties and microbial community deserve further exploration 3 2 impact of pretreatment on composition and structure of c and n substances organic elemental analysis and xps were used to determine the c and n contents of the was and their molecular structures after acid alkali and thermal pretreatments the mass percentages of c content was reduced by 0 07 1 31 and 0 88 respectively while the mass percentages of n content was reduced by 0 06 0 71 and 0 49 respectively table s2 fig 4 shows the structure composition of c and n in the was after different pretreatments derived from xps spectra fig s2 the c1s peak can be further resolved into component peaks of o c o c o n c o c o n and c c h which are mainly derived from proteins carboxylic acids lipids and polysaccharides in was hou et al 2015 after pretreatment c c h as the main hydrophobic functional group in the sludge decreased from 66 2 control to 64 6 acid 60 2 alkali and 60 3 thermal respectively this indicates the solubilization of was was enhanced especially by alkali and thermal pretreatments the resolution of the n1s peaks can be divided into protein n heterocyclic n pyridine n pyrrole n and inorganic n nh4 n component peaks with the binding energy of 399 4 398 8 400 3 and 401 4 ev respectively zhang et al 2013 among them the was was mainly dominated by protein n which decreased from 65 3 control to 43 0 acid 30 0 alkali and 36 0 thermal respectively indicating that alkali and thermal pretreatment were more favorable for protein release furthermore pretreatment transformed some protein n into nh4 n and heterocyclic refractories fig 5 a shows the ftir spectra of the was after different pretreatments the absorption peaks near 1460 cm 1 and 2957 cm 1 indicate the presence of c h in alkanes which is associated with lipids the peaks 1656 cm 1 in the amide i region are mainly associated with c o in the amide group and 1542 cm 1 in the amide ii region is attributed to n h bending vibrations and c n stretching vibrations which demonstrate the presence of proteins the broad absorption peaks near 3409 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 are attributed to o h bonding and coc stretching in the hydroxyl group respectively these peaks reveal the presence of polysaccharides the ftir spectra further confirms the rationality of xps peak splitting considering the peak overlap problem in traditional ftir spectra 2d ftir was used to resolve the 1700 900 cm 1 region this region was reported to involve the functional group bands of amide region 1700 1482 cm 1 associated with proteins structural carbohydrates 1482 1190 cm 1 and non structural carbohydrates 1190 900 cm 1 gamage et al 2014 li et al 2014 the analysis of synchronous and asynchronous spectra enabled to determine the impact of key organic fractions of pretreated was on anaerobic digestion the cross peaks of the synchronous spectrum in fig 5 c1 f1 are all positively correlated indicating that the organic fractions in was have similar degradation behavior during anaerobic digestion while the asynchronous spectrum c2 f2 shows a distinct difference in the variation sequence of functional groups in the was organic fractions after pretreatment the variation sequence of functional groups of the control was 1460 1542 1650 1035 cm 1 which corresponded to c h aliphatic groups mainly relating to cellulosic lipid compounds structural carbohydrates amide ii mainly relating to protein like materials amide i mainly relating to protein like materials and polysaccharides like compound non structural carbohydrates respectively the acid pretreatment group exhibited a similar variation sequence as the control however the variation sequence of functional groups of alkali and thermal samples were as follows 1035 1656 1542 1460 cm 1 and 1542 1460 1650 1035 cm 1 respectively this suggests that structural carbohydrates responded preferentially in the control and acid groups nonstructural carbohydrates tended to change first under alkali pretreatment while protein like substances were degraded preferentially under thermal pretreatment protein is one of the major components of was which changed significantly after pretreatment to investigate the variation mechanism of protein structure under different pretreatments the secondary structure distribution information of was proteins fig 5 b was obtained by deconvolution and second order derivatives for the amide i region 1600 1700 cm 1 the secondary structures of the proteins can be classified into aggregated strands 1625 1610 cm 1 β sheet 1640 1630 cm 1 random coil 1645 1640 cm 1 α helix 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turn helix 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands 1695 1680 cm 1 the secondary structure of protein in was was mainly dominated by α helix 3 turn helix and β sheet among which 3 turn helix did not change significantly after different pretreatments the variations in α helix and β sheet formed by hydrogen bond mediated folding of the peptide backbone have significant implications for the bioavailability of proteins li et al 2022 xiao et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that α helix and β sheet could promote was flocculation while antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands and random coils decreased the sludge flocculation capacity badireddy et al 2010 wang et al 2022 it is noteworthy that α helix and β sheet structures in the was proteins decreased significantly after all pretreatments form 44 59 control to 26 75 acid 25 51 alkali and 25 67 thermal in contrast the aggregated strands and random coil structures increased after all pretreatments from 25 16 control to 38 80 acid 40 41 alkali and 39 99 thermal compared to acid pretreatment alkali and thermal pretreatments are more effective in disrupting the secondary structure of proteins leading to the disruption of hydrogen bond and the disintegration of helix and folded structures which have been reported to be positively consistent with the degradation and utilization of protein li et al 2022 xiao et al 2013 3 3 thermodynamic mechanism for the impact of pretreatment on was surface properties since organic matter of was has colloidal properties the transformation of major organic components in was can be considered as the disruption of the colloid structure of was a process that can be elucidated by the was surface properties liu et al 2007 van oss 1993 table 3 shows the surface properties of the pretreated was which were obtained by solving a set of young s equations according to the contact angles of the three probe liquids on the sludge surface thermodynamically a was suspension can be regarded as an unstable system with large surface free energy and sludge particles tend to flocculate with each other to reduce the surface free energy stol and debruyn 1980 the stability of was is maintained mainly through the interaction between hydrophobic attraction force and hydrophilic repulsion force van oss proposed that the total free energy of interaction δ g s w s t o l 0 means hydrophilic and δ g s w s t o l 0 means hydrophobic state van oss 1993 the was surface properties showed that the the lifshitz van der waals component in the surface tension γlw of the was decreased after pretreatments and the δ g s w s t o l increased from 61 09 mj m 2 to about 18 00 mj m 2 which effectively improved the hydrophilic repulsion of the was this finding is also supported by the xps analysis and previous studies peng et al 2021 moreover the increase of electron donor γ after pretreatment implies more electron donor production which facilitated the subsequent methanogenic process the zeta potential is related to the electrostatic repulsion between the was which changed from 14 33 mv control to 14 83 mv acid 18 47 mv alkali and 16 87 mv thermal respectively after pretreatment indicating stronger flocculation disruption of the was by alkali thermal pretreatment in order to prevent sludge flocculation stirring was used to increase the efficiency of mass transfer within was during anaerobic digestion this is due to the existence of short range interactions between sludge flocs the quantification of the short range interactions between was can be realized by the xdlvo theory as shown in fig 6 the flocculation energy barriers of the pretreated was increased from 337 12 kt control to 1385 41 kt acid 2369 80 kt alkali and 2399 96 kt thermal respectively the increase in the flocculation energy barrier implies that more energy is required for the sludge to flocculate by interfacial attraction thereby tending to loosen the protein secondary structure of was and release dom into the supernatant the structural equation model fig s3 and pearson correlation analysis r 0 97 p 0 05 further indicate that the flocculation energy barrier of was has a significant positive correlation with scod therefore it is again confirmed from a thermodynamic perspective that alkali and thermal pretreatments were more conducive to the solubilization of was than acid pretreatment 3 4 multi omics analysis reveals the impact of pretreatment on metabolites microorganisms and functional proteins 3 4 1 analysis of differential metabolites a total of 941 metabolites were identified in the metabolomic analysis and a total of 650 significant differential metabolites were selected using masigpro chronological analysis fig 7 depicts the variation of metabolites during anaerobic digestion after different pretreatments as categorized by the van krenvelen diagram fig s4 the main metabolites in the was were ligin like lipid like and protein like substances among which ligin like tended to increase and subsequently decrease during anaerobic digestion after pretreatments the annotation of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and human metabolome database hmdb revealed that ligin like is mainly composed of organic acids and their derivatives which are potential intermediates with the decomposition of complex organic matters during anaerobic digestion lipid like and protein like substances were significantly reduced after pretreatment compared to the control which could be attributed to the destruction of sludge flocs by pretreatment while the elevation of lipid like and protein like at day 20 of anaerobic digestion was due to anaerobic microbial growth a total of 650 significant differential metabolites were selected using masigpro chronological analysis which were divided into 9 clusters based on metabolite expression trends fig 8 combined with compound classification annotations from kegg and hmdb databases the impact of pretreatment methods on metabolites can be explored in addition kegg pathway enrichment analysis can be used to identify metabolic pathways affected potentially p 0 05 impact values 0 1 the metabolites in cluster 1 and cluster 5 were mainly small molecules generated by was after pretreatment which facilitate utilization by microorganisms in the subsequent acidification and methanogenesis stages moreover the pathway enrichment analysis indicates that these metabolites were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism cluster 2 was dominated by large organic molecules such as glycerophospholipids carboxylic acids and their derivatives organooxygen compounds nucleosides nucleotides and analogues the degradability of metabolites in cluster 2 was significantly enhanced after pretreatment thermal alkali acid compared with the control clusters 3 4 9 are mainly composed of steroids and steroid derivatives phenol lipids and fatty acyls which are essential hormones for maintaining the physiological functions of microorganisms such as regulating carbohydrates proteins and lipid metabolism the expression of metabolites in clusters 3 and 4 decreased significantly after the pretreatment especially after alkali and acid treatments which may be attributed to the instability of such metabolites under pretreatment conditions diak and örmeci 2017 liang et al 2020 however the corresponding metabolites gradually increased with the recovery of functional microorganisms during anaerobic digestion moreover the metabolites in cluster 9 are mainly associated with the metabolism of sulfur containing amino acids cysteine methionine and b vitamins biotin d biotin some methanogenic bacteria were reported to be stimulated by vitamins especially the b vitamins to maintain growth fermoso et al 2010 speece 1985 on day 20 of anaerobic digestion the relative abundance of b vitamins was 0 40 control 0 35 acid 0 70 alkali and 0 76 thermal respectively which might be one of the reasons for the higher methanogenic efficiency in the alkali and thermal pretreated groups compared to the acid pretreatment group carboxylic acids and their derivatives organooxygen compounds fatty acyls indoles and their derivatives pyridines and their derivatives phenols benzene and substituted derivatives were the major metabolites in cluster 6 8 metabolites in cluster 6 did not show significant differences after pretreatment compared to other clusters involving purine metabolism and sulfur containing substances metabolism the expression of metabolites in cluster 7 8 increased after pretreatment and kegg topological analysis showed that the main impact pathway was associated with the metabolism of aromatic compounds tryptophan tyrosine benzoic acid etc there was no significant change in the control metabolites compared to the pretreatment groups indicating that pretreatment facilitated the degradation of the refractory aromatic compounds similar conclusions could be obtained from eem analysis fig 3 combining the vip value analysis and pathway enrichment results of each differential metabolite it can be found that pretreatment has a significant promotion effect on the metabolism of amino acids tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate glutamate energy metabolism abc transporters and vitamin metabolism especially the metabolism of b vitamins in terms of metabolite expression alkali thermal pretreatment had a better promotion effect than acid pretreatment which is consistent with dom release and methane production figs 1 and 2 therefore the reliability of the masigpro chronological analysis was further confirmed 3 4 2 taxonomic annotation and differentially expressed proteins analysis to further explore the impact mechanism of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion functional proteins on day 0 and 20 of anaerobic digestion were identified based on metaproteomics analysis a total of 1848 protein group numbers were identified of which 1492 control 1464 acid 1473 alkali and 1333 thermal protein group numbers were identified respectively cluster of orthologous groups cog of protein functional annotation allows the analysis of the functional classification corresponding to different proteins fig s5 it is noteworthy that the abundance of proteins corresponding to function m cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis and function p inorganic ion transport and metabolism increased significantly after pretreatment after acid alkali thermal pretreatments the abundance of function m proteins were increased by 1 32 1 39 and 1 66 times and the abundance of function p proteins were increased by 1 51 1 56 and 1 47 times respectively which were mainly associated with the porin and receptor proteins and the detailed proteins information is listed in table s3 the increase of these proteins might enhance the substance exchange process thereby facilitating the release of intracellular organic matters therefore there is no doubt that the variation of functional proteins has a non negligible impact on was properties and organic matter release the taxonomic annotation results can be obtained by aligning protein sequences with the non redundant protein sequence nr database fig 9 a shows the relative abundance of microbial community at phylum level in was after different pretreatments and after 20 days of anaerobic digestion where proteobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are the main hydrolytic acidifying bacteria in addition nitrospirae and actinobacteria are common microbial species in was liang et al 2020 the proteobacteria was reduced after pretreatment probably decaying as an organic substrate firmicutes are a strongly tolerant class of hydrolytic acidifying bacteria and can adapt to extreme environments li et al 2020 in this study its relative abundance increased from 1 64 control to 1 65 acid 15 34 alkali and 69 23 thermal respectively after pretreatment which indicates a stronger destructive effect of alkali thermal pretreatment on was euryarchaeota with methanogenic function was derived from the inoculum added before anaerobic digestion the relative abundance of euryarchaeota on day 20 of anaerobic digestion was 1 86 control 5 19 acid 6 72 alkali and 6 55 thermal respectively indicating the inactivation of was pretreatment to aerobic microorganisms promoted the release of organic substrates and facilitated the growth of anaerobic bacteria the correlation between top 50 metabolites and top 20 microorganisms at the genus level can further select the crucial functional microorganisms in anaerobic digestion and the results are shown in fig 9 b the functional proteins derived from romboutsia paraclostridium dorea clostridium longilinea treponema and methanothrix were significantly negatively correlated p 0 05 with long chain fatty acids and phosphate analogues c 10 36 and they also had significant positive correlation p 0 05 with simple organic acids c 10 on the contrary dechloromonas candidatus accumulibacter candidatus contendobacter candidatus competibacter nitrosomonas and hyphomicrobium showed the opposite correlation indicating that the metabolites related with these bacteria during was hydrolysis are macromolecules and cannot be directly utilized by methanogenic bacteria the kegg pathway enrichment analysis of top50 metabolites fig s6 indicate that these metabolites were mainly associated with abc transporters glycerophospholipid metabolism phenylalanine metabolism and styrene degradation phenylalanine is a refractory amino acid which suggests that the pretreatment facilitated the metabolism of refractory organic compounds moreover methanothrix was found to be the dominant bacterium in all samples indicating that the anaerobic digestion after acid alkali thermal pretreatments was still dominated by the acetoclastic methanogenesis liu et al 2019 pellerin et al 1987 the potential key functional bacteria selected according to fig 9 b can be classified into four categories a typical bacteria from was dominated by proteobacteria b romboutsia paraclostridium dorea clostridium derived from firmicutes c methanogen syntrophic bacteria longilinea treponema and d methanothrix the relative abundance of microorganisms in fig 10 a decreased from 28 86 control to 23 26 acid 16 13 alkali and 3 80 thermal after pretreatment correspondingly 136 156 208 differentially expressed proteins deps were downregulated after acid alkali and thermal pretreatments respectively the downregulated deps were mainly associated with function c energy production and conversion function e amino acid transport and metabolism function g carbohydrate transport and metabolism and function i lipid transport and metabolism while the upregulated functional proteins were mainly associated with function m and function p the variation in the relative abundance of these microorganisms suggests that pretreatment replaced the hydrolytic function of these microorganisms and reinforced the material transport process the upregulated deps in fig 10 b and c were mainly associated with functions c e g and i and 57 up regulated deps were identified after thermal pretreatment which was significantly higher than that of the acid 19 and alkali 39 groups the upregulation of these deps facilitated hydrolysis and acidification processes during was anaerobic digestion providing available substrates for methanogens fig 10 d shows the relative abundance of methanothrix was 1 24 control 3 39 acid 5 03 alkali and 4 45 thermal on day 20 of anaerobic digestion respectively although thermal treatment was more favorable for the growth of hydrolytic and acidifying bacteria the relative abundance of methanogens in the thermal treatment group was lower than that in the alkali treatment group it may be the reason why methane production was similar in the alkali and thermal pretreatment groups to further elucidate the impact of different pretreatments on was hydrolysis the upregulated deps with functions e g i were analyzed from fig 11 it can be concluded that each pretreatment exhibited a different impact mechanism on the metabolism of amino acids derived from the hydrolysis of proteins carbohydrates and lipids in the was the comparison of upregulated deps revealed that for amino acid metabolism thermal treatment had the best promotion effect for carbohydrate metabolism alkali treatment had the best promotion effect and for lipid metabolism acid treatment was more advantageous this result further confirmed the response sequence of pretreatment to was organics by 2d ftir fig 5 in was major organic matters were protein and carbohydrate with a relatively low lipid proportion therefore thermal and alkali pretreatments facilitated anaerobic digestion of was more effectively compared to acid pretreatment 3 4 3 comprehensive analysis of the impact of pretreatment on physicochemical properties microbial community and metabolites of was a combined correlation diagram was used to elucidate the possible relationships among the physicochemical properties microbial community and metabolites of the was after pretreatment and the results showed significant correlations between most of the characteristics fig 12 the strong correlation between methane production and protein secondary structure r 0 91 p 0 01 and flocculation energy barriers r 0 99 p 0 001 suggests that pretreatment facilitated the solubilization and anaerobic digestion of was mainly by disrupting protein secondary structure and flocculation these series of characterizations demonstrated that alkali and thermal pretreatments exhibited more significant effects on the promotion of anaerobic digestion of was compared with acid pretreatment the mantel test indicated that disruption of the protein secondary structure was driven by pretreatment conditions rather than microbial degradation r 0 4 p 0 05 4 conclusions this study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of the impact of different pretreatments on anaerobic digestion of was the main conclusions are drawn as follows the methane production potential of was was increased by 53 7 98 2 and 101 8 with acid alkali and thermal pretreatments respectively after pretreatment the protein secondary structure was disrupted and shifted from α helix and β sheet to random coil and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands which improved the degradability of the was a significant positive correlation p 0 05 between sludge flocculation behavior and organic matter dissolution was resolved by structural equation model and xdlvo theoretical calculations showed that the flocculation energy barrier of pretreated was was 4 1 acid 7 0 alkali and 7 1 thermal times higher than that of the control group respectively the combined multi omics analysis revealed that pretreatment mainly promoted amino acids tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate glutamate metabolism energy metabolism abc transporters and vitamin metabolism the analysis of upregulated deps identified that the function e amino acid transport and metabolism g carbohydrate transport and metabolism and i lipid transport and metabolism of was were all promoted after pretreatment and functions e g i were facilitated most by thermal alkali and acid pretreatments respectively resulting in different anaerobic digestion

15375,although various pretreatments have been applied to promote the anaerobic digestion of waste active sludge was the mechanisms regarding the impact of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion have not been well addressed in this study the effects of acid alkali and thermal pretreatments on anaerobic digestion of was were comprehensively investigated from the perspectives of organic matter composition thermodynamics and multi omics results showed acid alkali and thermal pretreatments increased the methane production potential of was by 53 7 98 2 and 101 8 respectively compared with the control the protein secondary structure was disrupted after pretreatment with a shift from α helix and β sheet to random coil and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands thermodynamically the was flocculation process was controlled by the short range interfacial interactions described by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which was positively correlated r 0 97 p 0 05 with the organic matter solubilization of the was after pretreatment the flocculation energy barrier of pretreated was was 4 1 acid 7 0 alkali and 7 1 thermal times higher than that of the control group respectively multi omics analysis confirmed that pretreatment promoted amino acids tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate glutamate metabolism energy metabolism abc transporters and vitamin metabolism moreover the comparison of upregulated differentially expressed proteins deps revealed that for amino acid metabolism thermal treatment had the best promotion effect for carbohydrate metabolism alkali treatment had the best promotion effect and for lipid metabolism acid treatment was more advantageous resulting in different anaerobic digestion efficiencies this study provides an in depth understanding of the impact of different pretreatments on was anaerobic digestion and has practical implication for the choice of proper pretreatment technology for biosolids graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste active sludge pretreatment anaerobic digestion thermodynamic metaproteomic metabolomic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waste activated sludge was treatment is a significant financial burden in wastewater treatment plants with management expenses accounting for up to 50 of total wastewater treatment costs appels et al 2008 reduction stabilization and harmlessness are the ultimate purpose of was treatment and disposal anaerobic digestion has been widely used for was treatment since it can reduce biosolid mass and produce energy in the form of ch4 and other biofuels elsamadony et al 2021 luo et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 however most of the time the transformation rate of organic matters of was during anaerobic digestion is not as high as theoretically expected novak et al 2011 it is well known that the complex floc structure microbial cell walls and granular organic matters limit the solubilization of was neumann et al 2016 to overcome this limitation various pretreatments including mechanical thermal chemical and biological processes have been employed individually or in combination prior to anaerobic digestion among which the effects of acid alkali and thermal pretreatments on solubilization of was production of volatile fatty acids vfas and methane during anaerobic digestion have been investigated in numerous studies liu et al 2012 lu et al 2018 yuan et al 2006 liu et al 2012 and lu et al 2018 recommend a ph of 12 as the optimal condition for solubilization of was xu et al 2020b 2021 proposed an acid pretreatment technique based on the concept of isoelectric point pretreatment ph 2 4 which maximized the retention of organic matters in was and eliminated some inhibitory metal complexes to improve methane production for the well established and commercialized thermal pretreatment technology the solubilization of was was gradually promoted with increasing temperature in the typical temperature range of 60 180 c carrère et al 2008 li and noike 1992 however the above studies focused on the optimization of pretreatment conditions and consistently ascribed the facilitative effect of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion to the acceleration of sludge hydrolysis khanh nguyen et al 2021 zhen et al 2017 while the impact of pretreatment on physicochemical properties and spatial conformation of critical organic fractions in was during anaerobic digestion was neglected as therefore change of physicochemical properties and structure of was with pretreatment should be investigated as they play an important role in solubilization hydrolysis and even biodegradation of was xu et al 2020a moreover previous studies reported that thermal pretreatment 100 200 c physical pretreatment ultrasound microwave high pressure homogenization etc and chemical pretreatment acid alkali could enhance biogas production during anaerobic digestion by 20 150 4 115 and 12 110 respectively neumann et al 2016 the reason behind this big discrepancy also deserves further investigation the promotion mechanism of pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion process can be comprehensively elucidated in terms of physicochemical properties spatial conformation and microbial functions of was it has been shown that the low methanogenic efficiency of high protein wastes can be attributed to the hydrolysis rate limitation caused by the complex natural structure of the protein li et al 2022 since proteins are major components of was the impact of different pretreatments on their properties and conformation should be specifically concerned xu et al 2020a in addition the complex structure of was is usually stabilized by the flocculation between water extracellular polymers eps and bacterial cells xu et al 2020a and it has been suggested that this process is controlled by short range thermodynamic interactions described by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory grasso et al 2002 several literatures confirmed the feasibility of the proposed thermodynamic approach in quantifying flocculation energy chen et al 2019 liu et al 2007 wu et al 2020 in addition the highly complex microbial community in anaerobic digestion sludge plays a crucial role in sludge treatment characterization of the microbial community structure and its metabolic pathways during anaerobic digestion has a conducive role in understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of anaerobic digestion although metataxonomic 16s rrna sequencing and metagenomic techniques have been widely used to identify critical microorganisms and their potential functions in anaerobic digestion systems the diversity and functional redundancy of microbial communities may lead to misinterpretation of community function with the increased resolution of metaproteomic and metabolomic it is expected to provide direct evidence at the protein level to reveal microbial functions and their metabolic pathways related studies have confirmed that metaproteomic could identify critical functional proteins and their fate during anaerobic digestion of was liu et al 2021 park and helm 2008 zhang et al 2022 and metabolomic revealed the results of microbial interactions from a material perspective guo et al 2018 puig castellví et al 2020 however studies addressing the impact of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of was at the metaproteomic and metabolomic levels are still limited in other words the reasons for the discrepancy in functional mechanisms caused by pretreatment remain ambiguous therefore multi omics techniques could provide a useful tool to reveal the microbial mechanism behind the discrepancy during anaerobic digestion of was caused by different pretreatments the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of several typical pretreatments acid alkali and thermal pretreatments on the anaerobic digestion of was from the perspectives of organic matter composition thermodynamics and multi omics anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted for was after acid alkali and thermal pretreatments supernatant and freeze dried sludge samples of was after pretreatment and during anaerobic digestion process were characterized and compared the critical organic fractions were characterized by fluorescence excitation emission eem spectra fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements and xdlvo theory and multi omics analysis were combined to comprehensively elucidate the impact mechanism of these pretreatments on the anaerobic digestion of was 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup and was properties the raw was substrate was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank in a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china and used after sedimentation and concentration the inoculum was obtained from a laboratory scale mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor acid alkali and thermal pretreatments were used to investigate the impact of pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of was for acid and alkali pretreatments the ph of was was adjusted to 3 0 and 12 0 using 6 m hcl and naoh respectively and then the was was placed in a thermostatic air bath shaker for 12h 25 c 150 rpm the thermal pretreatment group was heated in an oven at 130 c for 1 h after the pretreatment the ph of was was readjusted to 6 8 kept consistent with the raw sludge to ensure a proper condition for the anaerobic digestion of was for anaerobic digestion experiments the was substrate was mixed with inoculated sludge in a 500 ml digester working volume 400 ml and divided into control acid pretreatment alkali pretreatment and thermal pretreatment groups recorded as control acid alkali and thermal each with three parallels the substrate used in the control group was the raw was without pretreatment while the pretreated was was used in the experimental groups the inoculation ratio of substrate to inoculum was 2 3 1 in vs and the specific sludge properties are shown in table 1 methane production was determined by an automatic methane potential meter multitalent 203 novaskantek sweden through the naoh adsorption unit to eliminate the acidic gases such as co2 and h2s 2 2 model analysis of methane production the modified gompertz model eq 1 was used to analyze the methane production of the different experimental groups during anaerobic digestion processes 1 m t m 0 e x p e x p r m e m 0 λ t 1 where mt represents the cumulative methane production ml g vs at time t t indicates the time of anaerobic digestion d m0 is the maximum methane potential ml gvs 1 rm is the maximum methane generation rate ml gvs 1 d 1 λ is lag phase time d e 2 71828 model fitting was carried out in the software origin 2018 2 3 interfacial thermodynamics analysis the traditional xdlvo theory can only quantify the interfacial interaction between two ideal planes van oss 1993 but the sludge particles are near spherical granules therefore the derjaguin integral approximation was used to quantify the short range interaction energy between two sludge particles yu et al 2018 a detailed description is provided in the supporting information text s1 2 4 multi omics analysis after different pretreatments was samples on day 0 and day 20 of anaerobic digestion were characterized by label free quantitative techniques proteomics the functional proteins of was were identified by protein sequences predicted from metagenomic sequencing of was samples the differentially expressed proteins deps were determined by thresholds of fold change fc fc 0 67 fc 1 5 and p 0 05 in addition metabolomic analysis of was was conducted on day 0 5 and 20 during anaerobic digestion to determine the impact of pretreatment on was anaerobic digestion metagenomic zhang et al 2022 metaproteomic zhang et al 2020 and metabolomic shi et al 2021 analyses were conducted at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china and a detailed description of the analysis procedure can refer to previous studies 2 5 other analytical methods total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined by standard methods apha 2005 soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and total chemical oxygen demand tcod were measured by a visible light spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa the concentration of vfas was detected by a gas chromatography gc equipped with flame ionization detection fid gc 6890 agilent usa protein and polysaccharides in the supernatant were colorimetrically measured using lowry folin method lowry et al 1951 and anthrone sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with bovine serum protein bsa and glucose as standard substances respectively eem spectra of supernatant were collected using a fluorescence spectrometer f 7100 hitachi japan and fluorescence region integration fri and fluorescence index fi analysis were calculated using domfluor toolbox chen et al 2003 stedmon and bro 2008 the contact angle of the was was measured by a contact angle meter jc2000d powereach china based on the drip stop method in order to obtain the individual surface tension components of a solid surface three typical liquids ultrapure water glycerin and diiodomethane were selected as probe liquids for contact angle measurements the zeta potential of the was suspension was determined by a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the content of c and n elements in was were measured by vario el iii elementar germany to investigate the functional groups and structural changes in the was the xps thermo scientific k alpha usa and ftir spectroscopy nicolet 5700 usa were conducted 2d correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir were obtained from the 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan moreover the amide i region of 1700 1600 cm 1 was further analyzed by peakfit v4 12 to extract information about the secondary structure of the protein yin et al 2015 the structural equation model was performed using spss and amos graphics software amos version 24 a combined correlation diagram was visualized with the linket package v 0 0 3 in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of pretreatment on methane production and the change of organic matters the cumulative methane production curves indicate that pretreatment significantly promoted the anaerobic digestion performance of was fig 1 the modified gompertz model was used to calculate the kinetic parameters of the was anaerobic digestion process as shown in table 2 the m0 of the pretreated was was effectively increased by 101 8 thermal 98 2 alkali and 53 7 acid respectively compared to the control 64 98 ml gvs furthermore the rm of alkali 19 28 ml gvs 1 d 1 and thermal pretreatment 17 11 ml gvs 1 d 1 was greatly higher than that of acid pretreatment 13 36 ml gvs 1 d 1 suggesting that alkali and thermal pretreatments were more efficient in enhancing ch4 production during anaerobic digestion the characterization of scod protein polysaccharide and vfas contents in the supernatant during anaerobic digestion of was after different pretreatments fig 2 shows that pretreatment had a significant contribution to hydrolysis and acidification of the was this observation is also supported by a previous study neumann et al 2016 herein alkali pretreatment was more conducive to the accumulation of vfas while thermal pretreatment had better solubilization effect on protein and polysaccharide overall effects of different pretreatments on the release of dom into the supernatant followed the order of alkali thermal acid in addition as the anaerobic digestion time increased dom was gradually degraded accompanied by the production of ch4 co2 and nh4 n eem is widely used for dom identification due to its fast and sensitive response fig s1 shows the eem spectra of the was supernatant at different periods of anaerobic digestion herein the fluorescence intensity of eem spectra at different digestion periods corresponded to the dom content in the supernatant fig 2 the eem spectral are usually divided into 5 regions region ⅰ aromatic protein ⅰ region ⅱ aromatic protein ⅱ region ⅲ fulvic acid like region ⅳ soluble microbial by product like and region ⅴ humic acid like in combination with fri analysis the fluorescence intensity of each region can be quantified to track the changes in each fluorescent component during anaerobic digestion chen et al 2003 fig 3 a it is reasonable that the fluorescence intensity of regions i and ii was enhanced after pretreatment because protein is the main component of was the three pretreatments had similar facilitation effects on regions i and ii enhancing the aromatic protein production by about 5 times compared with that of the control region iv was mainly proteins and polysaccharides derived from microbial by product which were also significantly increased after different pretreatments the fluorescence intensity of region iv was increased by 670 acid 800 alkali and 820 thermal respectively while region v mainly originated from refractory by products generated during the pretreatment alkali treatment and thermal treatment produced more refractory substances than acid treatment the biological index bix and the humification index hix can be used to determine the autotrophic productivity and humification of dom zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 b c the bix in the was supernatant increased and the hix decreased after pretreatment it is noted that bix increased on day 5 during anaerobic digestion which was associated with enhanced microbial metabolic capacity due to the release of dom after pretreatment while the hix of the acid group was close to hix of the control after 10 days of digestion and much higher than that of the alkali thermal group indicating that degradable dom was consumed more rapidly in the acid pretreatment group in conclusion eem analysis reflects that the release of soluble microbial by products may be responsible for the discrepancy in the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of was after different pretreatments the mechanisms involved in the impact of pretreatment on the change of was properties and microbial community deserve further exploration 3 2 impact of pretreatment on composition and structure of c and n substances organic elemental analysis and xps were used to determine the c and n contents of the was and their molecular structures after acid alkali and thermal pretreatments the mass percentages of c content was reduced by 0 07 1 31 and 0 88 respectively while the mass percentages of n content was reduced by 0 06 0 71 and 0 49 respectively table s2 fig 4 shows the structure composition of c and n in the was after different pretreatments derived from xps spectra fig s2 the c1s peak can be further resolved into component peaks of o c o c o n c o c o n and c c h which are mainly derived from proteins carboxylic acids lipids and polysaccharides in was hou et al 2015 after pretreatment c c h as the main hydrophobic functional group in the sludge decreased from 66 2 control to 64 6 acid 60 2 alkali and 60 3 thermal respectively this indicates the solubilization of was was enhanced especially by alkali and thermal pretreatments the resolution of the n1s peaks can be divided into protein n heterocyclic n pyridine n pyrrole n and inorganic n nh4 n component peaks with the binding energy of 399 4 398 8 400 3 and 401 4 ev respectively zhang et al 2013 among them the was was mainly dominated by protein n which decreased from 65 3 control to 43 0 acid 30 0 alkali and 36 0 thermal respectively indicating that alkali and thermal pretreatment were more favorable for protein release furthermore pretreatment transformed some protein n into nh4 n and heterocyclic refractories fig 5 a shows the ftir spectra of the was after different pretreatments the absorption peaks near 1460 cm 1 and 2957 cm 1 indicate the presence of c h in alkanes which is associated with lipids the peaks 1656 cm 1 in the amide i region are mainly associated with c o in the amide group and 1542 cm 1 in the amide ii region is attributed to n h bending vibrations and c n stretching vibrations which demonstrate the presence of proteins the broad absorption peaks near 3409 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 are attributed to o h bonding and coc stretching in the hydroxyl group respectively these peaks reveal the presence of polysaccharides the ftir spectra further confirms the rationality of xps peak splitting considering the peak overlap problem in traditional ftir spectra 2d ftir was used to resolve the 1700 900 cm 1 region this region was reported to involve the functional group bands of amide region 1700 1482 cm 1 associated with proteins structural carbohydrates 1482 1190 cm 1 and non structural carbohydrates 1190 900 cm 1 gamage et al 2014 li et al 2014 the analysis of synchronous and asynchronous spectra enabled to determine the impact of key organic fractions of pretreated was on anaerobic digestion the cross peaks of the synchronous spectrum in fig 5 c1 f1 are all positively correlated indicating that the organic fractions in was have similar degradation behavior during anaerobic digestion while the asynchronous spectrum c2 f2 shows a distinct difference in the variation sequence of functional groups in the was organic fractions after pretreatment the variation sequence of functional groups of the control was 1460 1542 1650 1035 cm 1 which corresponded to c h aliphatic groups mainly relating to cellulosic lipid compounds structural carbohydrates amide ii mainly relating to protein like materials amide i mainly relating to protein like materials and polysaccharides like compound non structural carbohydrates respectively the acid pretreatment group exhibited a similar variation sequence as the control however the variation sequence of functional groups of alkali and thermal samples were as follows 1035 1656 1542 1460 cm 1 and 1542 1460 1650 1035 cm 1 respectively this suggests that structural carbohydrates responded preferentially in the control and acid groups nonstructural carbohydrates tended to change first under alkali pretreatment while protein like substances were degraded preferentially under thermal pretreatment protein is one of the major components of was which changed significantly after pretreatment to investigate the variation mechanism of protein structure under different pretreatments the secondary structure distribution information of was proteins fig 5 b was obtained by deconvolution and second order derivatives for the amide i region 1600 1700 cm 1 the secondary structures of the proteins can be classified into aggregated strands 1625 1610 cm 1 β sheet 1640 1630 cm 1 random coil 1645 1640 cm 1 α helix 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turn helix 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands 1695 1680 cm 1 the secondary structure of protein in was was mainly dominated by α helix 3 turn helix and β sheet among which 3 turn helix did not change significantly after different pretreatments the variations in α helix and β sheet formed by hydrogen bond mediated folding of the peptide backbone have significant implications for the bioavailability of proteins li et al 2022 xiao et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that α helix and β sheet could promote was flocculation while antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands and random coils decreased the sludge flocculation capacity badireddy et al 2010 wang et al 2022 it is noteworthy that α helix and β sheet structures in the was proteins decreased significantly after all pretreatments form 44 59 control to 26 75 acid 25 51 alkali and 25 67 thermal in contrast the aggregated strands and random coil structures increased after all pretreatments from 25 16 control to 38 80 acid 40 41 alkali and 39 99 thermal compared to acid pretreatment alkali and thermal pretreatments are more effective in disrupting the secondary structure of proteins leading to the disruption of hydrogen bond and the disintegration of helix and folded structures which have been reported to be positively consistent with the degradation and utilization of protein li et al 2022 xiao et al 2013 3 3 thermodynamic mechanism for the impact of pretreatment on was surface properties since organic matter of was has colloidal properties the transformation of major organic components in was can be considered as the disruption of the colloid structure of was a process that can be elucidated by the was surface properties liu et al 2007 van oss 1993 table 3 shows the surface properties of the pretreated was which were obtained by solving a set of young s equations according to the contact angles of the three probe liquids on the sludge surface thermodynamically a was suspension can be regarded as an unstable system with large surface free energy and sludge particles tend to flocculate with each other to reduce the surface free energy stol and debruyn 1980 the stability of was is maintained mainly through the interaction between hydrophobic attraction force and hydrophilic repulsion force van oss proposed that the total free energy of interaction δ g s w s t o l 0 means hydrophilic and δ g s w s t o l 0 means hydrophobic state van oss 1993 the was surface properties showed that the the lifshitz van der waals component in the surface tension γlw of the was decreased after pretreatments and the δ g s w s t o l increased from 61 09 mj m 2 to about 18 00 mj m 2 which effectively improved the hydrophilic repulsion of the was this finding is also supported by the xps analysis and previous studies peng et al 2021 moreover the increase of electron donor γ after pretreatment implies more electron donor production which facilitated the subsequent methanogenic process the zeta potential is related to the electrostatic repulsion between the was which changed from 14 33 mv control to 14 83 mv acid 18 47 mv alkali and 16 87 mv thermal respectively after pretreatment indicating stronger flocculation disruption of the was by alkali thermal pretreatment in order to prevent sludge flocculation stirring was used to increase the efficiency of mass transfer within was during anaerobic digestion this is due to the existence of short range interactions between sludge flocs the quantification of the short range interactions between was can be realized by the xdlvo theory as shown in fig 6 the flocculation energy barriers of the pretreated was increased from 337 12 kt control to 1385 41 kt acid 2369 80 kt alkali and 2399 96 kt thermal respectively the increase in the flocculation energy barrier implies that more energy is required for the sludge to flocculate by interfacial attraction thereby tending to loosen the protein secondary structure of was and release dom into the supernatant the structural equation model fig s3 and pearson correlation analysis r 0 97 p 0 05 further indicate that the flocculation energy barrier of was has a significant positive correlation with scod therefore it is again confirmed from a thermodynamic perspective that alkali and thermal pretreatments were more conducive to the solubilization of was than acid pretreatment 3 4 multi omics analysis reveals the impact of pretreatment on metabolites microorganisms and functional proteins 3 4 1 analysis of differential metabolites a total of 941 metabolites were identified in the metabolomic analysis and a total of 650 significant differential metabolites were selected using masigpro chronological analysis fig 7 depicts the variation of metabolites during anaerobic digestion after different pretreatments as categorized by the van krenvelen diagram fig s4 the main metabolites in the was were ligin like lipid like and protein like substances among which ligin like tended to increase and subsequently decrease during anaerobic digestion after pretreatments the annotation of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and human metabolome database hmdb revealed that ligin like is mainly composed of organic acids and their derivatives which are potential intermediates with the decomposition of complex organic matters during anaerobic digestion lipid like and protein like substances were significantly reduced after pretreatment compared to the control which could be attributed to the destruction of sludge flocs by pretreatment while the elevation of lipid like and protein like at day 20 of anaerobic digestion was due to anaerobic microbial growth a total of 650 significant differential metabolites were selected using masigpro chronological analysis which were divided into 9 clusters based on metabolite expression trends fig 8 combined with compound classification annotations from kegg and hmdb databases the impact of pretreatment methods on metabolites can be explored in addition kegg pathway enrichment analysis can be used to identify metabolic pathways affected potentially p 0 05 impact values 0 1 the metabolites in cluster 1 and cluster 5 were mainly small molecules generated by was after pretreatment which facilitate utilization by microorganisms in the subsequent acidification and methanogenesis stages moreover the pathway enrichment analysis indicates that these metabolites were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism cluster 2 was dominated by large organic molecules such as glycerophospholipids carboxylic acids and their derivatives organooxygen compounds nucleosides nucleotides and analogues the degradability of metabolites in cluster 2 was significantly enhanced after pretreatment thermal alkali acid compared with the control clusters 3 4 9 are mainly composed of steroids and steroid derivatives phenol lipids and fatty acyls which are essential hormones for maintaining the physiological functions of microorganisms such as regulating carbohydrates proteins and lipid metabolism the expression of metabolites in clusters 3 and 4 decreased significantly after the pretreatment especially after alkali and acid treatments which may be attributed to the instability of such metabolites under pretreatment conditions diak and örmeci 2017 liang et al 2020 however the corresponding metabolites gradually increased with the recovery of functional microorganisms during anaerobic digestion moreover the metabolites in cluster 9 are mainly associated with the metabolism of sulfur containing amino acids cysteine methionine and b vitamins biotin d biotin some methanogenic bacteria were reported to be stimulated by vitamins especially the b vitamins to maintain growth fermoso et al 2010 speece 1985 on day 20 of anaerobic digestion the relative abundance of b vitamins was 0 40 control 0 35 acid 0 70 alkali and 0 76 thermal respectively which might be one of the reasons for the higher methanogenic efficiency in the alkali and thermal pretreated groups compared to the acid pretreatment group carboxylic acids and their derivatives organooxygen compounds fatty acyls indoles and their derivatives pyridines and their derivatives phenols benzene and substituted derivatives were the major metabolites in cluster 6 8 metabolites in cluster 6 did not show significant differences after pretreatment compared to other clusters involving purine metabolism and sulfur containing substances metabolism the expression of metabolites in cluster 7 8 increased after pretreatment and kegg topological analysis showed that the main impact pathway was associated with the metabolism of aromatic compounds tryptophan tyrosine benzoic acid etc there was no significant change in the control metabolites compared to the pretreatment groups indicating that pretreatment facilitated the degradation of the refractory aromatic compounds similar conclusions could be obtained from eem analysis fig 3 combining the vip value analysis and pathway enrichment results of each differential metabolite it can be found that pretreatment has a significant promotion effect on the metabolism of amino acids tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate glutamate energy metabolism abc transporters and vitamin metabolism especially the metabolism of b vitamins in terms of metabolite expression alkali thermal pretreatment had a better promotion effect than acid pretreatment which is consistent with dom release and methane production figs 1 and 2 therefore the reliability of the masigpro chronological analysis was further confirmed 3 4 2 taxonomic annotation and differentially expressed proteins analysis to further explore the impact mechanism of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion functional proteins on day 0 and 20 of anaerobic digestion were identified based on metaproteomics analysis a total of 1848 protein group numbers were identified of which 1492 control 1464 acid 1473 alkali and 1333 thermal protein group numbers were identified respectively cluster of orthologous groups cog of protein functional annotation allows the analysis of the functional classification corresponding to different proteins fig s5 it is noteworthy that the abundance of proteins corresponding to function m cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis and function p inorganic ion transport and metabolism increased significantly after pretreatment after acid alkali thermal pretreatments the abundance of function m proteins were increased by 1 32 1 39 and 1 66 times and the abundance of function p proteins were increased by 1 51 1 56 and 1 47 times respectively which were mainly associated with the porin and receptor proteins and the detailed proteins information is listed in table s3 the increase of these proteins might enhance the substance exchange process thereby facilitating the release of intracellular organic matters therefore there is no doubt that the variation of functional proteins has a non negligible impact on was properties and organic matter release the taxonomic annotation results can be obtained by aligning protein sequences with the non redundant protein sequence nr database fig 9 a shows the relative abundance of microbial community at phylum level in was after different pretreatments and after 20 days of anaerobic digestion where proteobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are the main hydrolytic acidifying bacteria in addition nitrospirae and actinobacteria are common microbial species in was liang et al 2020 the proteobacteria was reduced after pretreatment probably decaying as an organic substrate firmicutes are a strongly tolerant class of hydrolytic acidifying bacteria and can adapt to extreme environments li et al 2020 in this study its relative abundance increased from 1 64 control to 1 65 acid 15 34 alkali and 69 23 thermal respectively after pretreatment which indicates a stronger destructive effect of alkali thermal pretreatment on was euryarchaeota with methanogenic function was derived from the inoculum added before anaerobic digestion the relative abundance of euryarchaeota on day 20 of anaerobic digestion was 1 86 control 5 19 acid 6 72 alkali and 6 55 thermal respectively indicating the inactivation of was pretreatment to aerobic microorganisms promoted the release of organic substrates and facilitated the growth of anaerobic bacteria the correlation between top 50 metabolites and top 20 microorganisms at the genus level can further select the crucial functional microorganisms in anaerobic digestion and the results are shown in fig 9 b the functional proteins derived from romboutsia paraclostridium dorea clostridium longilinea treponema and methanothrix were significantly negatively correlated p 0 05 with long chain fatty acids and phosphate analogues c 10 36 and they also had significant positive correlation p 0 05 with simple organic acids c 10 on the contrary dechloromonas candidatus accumulibacter candidatus contendobacter candidatus competibacter nitrosomonas and hyphomicrobium showed the opposite correlation indicating that the metabolites related with these bacteria during was hydrolysis are macromolecules and cannot be directly utilized by methanogenic bacteria the kegg pathway enrichment analysis of top50 metabolites fig s6 indicate that these metabolites were mainly associated with abc transporters glycerophospholipid metabolism phenylalanine metabolism and styrene degradation phenylalanine is a refractory amino acid which suggests that the pretreatment facilitated the metabolism of refractory organic compounds moreover methanothrix was found to be the dominant bacterium in all samples indicating that the anaerobic digestion after acid alkali thermal pretreatments was still dominated by the acetoclastic methanogenesis liu et al 2019 pellerin et al 1987 the potential key functional bacteria selected according to fig 9 b can be classified into four categories a typical bacteria from was dominated by proteobacteria b romboutsia paraclostridium dorea clostridium derived from firmicutes c methanogen syntrophic bacteria longilinea treponema and d methanothrix the relative abundance of microorganisms in fig 10 a decreased from 28 86 control to 23 26 acid 16 13 alkali and 3 80 thermal after pretreatment correspondingly 136 156 208 differentially expressed proteins deps were downregulated after acid alkali and thermal pretreatments respectively the downregulated deps were mainly associated with function c energy production and conversion function e amino acid transport and metabolism function g carbohydrate transport and metabolism and function i lipid transport and metabolism while the upregulated functional proteins were mainly associated with function m and function p the variation in the relative abundance of these microorganisms suggests that pretreatment replaced the hydrolytic function of these microorganisms and reinforced the material transport process the upregulated deps in fig 10 b and c were mainly associated with functions c e g and i and 57 up regulated deps were identified after thermal pretreatment which was significantly higher than that of the acid 19 and alkali 39 groups the upregulation of these deps facilitated hydrolysis and acidification processes during was anaerobic digestion providing available substrates for methanogens fig 10 d shows the relative abundance of methanothrix was 1 24 control 3 39 acid 5 03 alkali and 4 45 thermal on day 20 of anaerobic digestion respectively although thermal treatment was more favorable for the growth of hydrolytic and acidifying bacteria the relative abundance of methanogens in the thermal treatment group was lower than that in the alkali treatment group it may be the reason why methane production was similar in the alkali and thermal pretreatment groups to further elucidate the impact of different pretreatments on was hydrolysis the upregulated deps with functions e g i were analyzed from fig 11 it can be concluded that each pretreatment exhibited a different impact mechanism on the metabolism of amino acids derived from the hydrolysis of proteins carbohydrates and lipids in the was the comparison of upregulated deps revealed that for amino acid metabolism thermal treatment had the best promotion effect for carbohydrate metabolism alkali treatment had the best promotion effect and for lipid metabolism acid treatment was more advantageous this result further confirmed the response sequence of pretreatment to was organics by 2d ftir fig 5 in was major organic matters were protein and carbohydrate with a relatively low lipid proportion therefore thermal and alkali pretreatments facilitated anaerobic digestion of was more effectively compared to acid pretreatment 3 4 3 comprehensive analysis of the impact of pretreatment on physicochemical properties microbial community and metabolites of was a combined correlation diagram was used to elucidate the possible relationships among the physicochemical properties microbial community and metabolites of the was after pretreatment and the results showed significant correlations between most of the characteristics fig 12 the strong correlation between methane production and protein secondary structure r 0 91 p 0 01 and flocculation energy barriers r 0 99 p 0 001 suggests that pretreatment facilitated the solubilization and anaerobic digestion of was mainly by disrupting protein secondary structure and flocculation these series of characterizations demonstrated that alkali and thermal pretreatments exhibited more significant effects on the promotion of anaerobic digestion of was compared with acid pretreatment the mantel test indicated that disruption of the protein secondary structure was driven by pretreatment conditions rather than microbial degradation r 0 4 p 0 05 4 conclusions this study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of the impact of different pretreatments on anaerobic digestion of was the main conclusions are drawn as follows the methane production potential of was was increased by 53 7 98 2 and 101 8 with acid alkali and thermal pretreatments respectively after pretreatment the protein secondary structure was disrupted and shifted from α helix and β sheet to random coil and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands which improved the degradability of the was a significant positive correlation p 0 05 between sludge flocculation behavior and organic matter dissolution was resolved by structural equation model and xdlvo theoretical calculations showed that the flocculation energy barrier of pretreated was was 4 1 acid 7 0 alkali and 7 1 thermal times higher than that of the control group respectively the combined multi omics analysis revealed that pretreatment mainly promoted amino acids tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine aspartate glutamate metabolism energy metabolism abc transporters and vitamin metabolism the analysis of upregulated deps identified that the function e amino acid transport and metabolism g carbohydrate transport and metabolism and i lipid transport and metabolism of was were all promoted after pretreatment and functions e g i were facilitated most by thermal alkali and acid pretreatments respectively resulting in different anaerobic digestion

15376,reservoirs are widely established worldwide with considerable environmental impacts especially on the riverine carbon cycle however the influence of reservoirs on the cycling of different forms of carbon and its regulation factors e g seasonal variations versus hydrological management have not been simultaneously studied to fill this knowledge gap seasonal water samples from the deep subtropical reservoir longtan reservoir in the pearl river were collected and the concentrations and stable carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc were determined the variations in stable carbon isotopes of dic 11 4 to 5 2 doc 32 2 to 26 2 and poc 38 9 to 25 3 in the river reservoir system indicated active production and degradation processes in different layers we estimated that up to 23 0 of dic 20 5 of doc and most poc were intercepted or degraded within the reservoir our results further illustrated that hydrological management water storage regulation and seasonal variations from different perspectives controlled the cycling of different forms of carbon in the reservoir in addition with the gradual increase in the number of reservoirs hydrological management can be considered as a potentially effective strategy to adjust the carbon biogeochemical cycling of reservoirs in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological management seasonal variations reservoir carbon cycle stable carbon isotope data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have dramatically altered the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in inland aquatic systems directly or indirectly affecting the global climate best 2019 grill et al 2019 mendonca et al 2017 dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc are the primary forms of carbon in aquatic systems liu et al 2017 schefuß et al 2016 yi et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 these different forms of carbon are closely related and affect the carbon cycle for instance the primary production process can convert the dic into organic carbon oc pool poc and doc can exchange by dissolution degradation and adsorption they can also return to the dic pool by respiration and mineralization he et al 2016 contributing to complex biogeochemical processes in the carbon cycle in addition to the transformation between different forms of carbon carbon can be derived from various sources and indicated by the stable carbon isotopes δ13c mccallister et al 2018 which are also widely used in the particular form of carbon to investigate its biogeochemical processes evans et al 2017 hou et al 2013 maberly et al 2012 however it remains unclear whether there is any co influence within different forms of carbon and its coupling mechanisms therefore the systematic investigation conducted on various forms of carbon will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the carbon transformation processes in aquatic ecosystems karst areas cover 15 of the global land ipcc climate 2007 their aquatic systems typically have 6 10 times higher dic concentrations than non karst areas due to chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 shih et al 2019 china has the largest karst area in the world mainly in the southwest and most of the water bodies here are presently less impacted by anthropogenic influence a series of reservoirs are planned or built in southwest china due to the abundance of precipitation and the ideal topographic conditions wang et al 2019 wang 2020 among them the karstic river nanpan and hongshui river the up and mid stream of the peal river belongs to the top thirteen hydroelectric power generation bases in china http www hydropower org cn which is a place with minimized influence from the human activities and thus provide an ideal case to investigate the impact of operation under natural influences in reservoirs currently the primary production in most inland reservoirs is limited by nutrients especially by p beaulieu et al 2012 wang 2020 thus the karstic reservoirs likely lead to more intense aquatic biological carbon pump bcp processes than non karst areas since their abundant carbon source and nutrient input increase under anthropogenic activity be enhanced liu et al 2021 yi et al 2021 these intense bcp processes will result in more carbon loss or greenhouse gas ghgs emissions in karst areas liu et al 2018 2021 therefore the reservoir impacts can be enhanced and understanding the carbon cycling and regulation factors in the karst reservoir is essential for projecting future global climate change reservoirs have been established globally since 1800 and act as a double edged sword in daily life icold 2018 maavara et al 2020 for example reservoirs have financial functions of power generation water storage irrigation and aquaculture tockner and stanford 2002 yoshikawa et al 2014 meanwhile a lake like phenomenon can be found in the river reservoir system altering river connectivity intercepting large amounts of solutes and releasing ghgs grill et al 2019 icold 2018 matzinger et al 2007 which can be classified as reservoir impacts unlike the lake system the operation of reservoirs is deeply subject to artificial control cooley et al 2021 mccartney et al 2001 the hydrological management water storage regulation of reservoirs can be generally split into storage and drainage periods by the requirements of financial and river regulated functions mccartney et al 2001 tockner and stanford 2002 many studies point out that the degradability of dissolved organic matter dom the burial of organic carbon and the variation of the microbial community are vastly altered by hydrological management he et al 2020 she et al 2022 wang et al 2021 which will enhance ghgs release and further affect climate change meanwhile the geochemical parameters like ph dissolved oxygen do and different forms of carbon concentrations also exited a seasonal variation in various aquatic environments including reservoirs junger et al 2019 romera castillo et al 2013 wang et al 2012 in the reservoir system the variation of dissolved carbons will change with seasonal variations in the water column which is usually strengthened in the warm season but weakened in the cold season because of thermal stratification han et al 2018 wang et al 2020a indeed the reservoir impacts also behave a seasonal character junger et al 2019 xu and milliman 2009 up to date it remains unclear which factor is dominant hydrological management vs seasonal variations in controlling carbon dynamics of river reservoir systems answering this question will contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the role of reservoirs in carbon neutral and provide a theoretical basis for weakening the reservoir side impacts this study seasonally sampled inflow reservoir profile and outflow from longtan lt reservoir on the pearl river the second largest river in china in terms of water discharge covering the storage and drainage periods in particular we combined the hydrological conditions water chemistry parameters carbon concentrations and stable carbon isotopes to explore regulated factors including seasonal variations and hydrological management in reservoir impacts by evaluating the intensity and amounts of transformation processes between different species of carbon we hypothesize that seasonal variations mainly regulate the transformation intensity of different forms of carbon however hydrological management controls its amounts and the man regulation can weaken the impacts of reservoirs on the carbon cycle the results of our study will provide a systematic perspective for understanding the reservoirs in regional carbon cycling and a scientific basis to regulate the reservoir impacts in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the pearl river is located in the subtropical region with annual temperature and rainfall of 14 22 c and 1200 2200 mm respectively the yearly flow can reach 330 km3year 1 which is about seven times higher than the yellow river and more than 80 of the annual runoff occurs in the wet season april to september lt is the 5th largest reservoir in china located in the mid stream of pearl river fig 1 completed in 2009 with an average multi year runoff of 1639 m3 s and a maximum storage capacity of 1 3 1010 m3 the main functions of the lt reservoir are generating electricity flood control and water supply

and chlorophyll a 4 0 8 4 µg l 2 2 sample collection the water samples were collected in april july october of 2019 and january of 2020 corresponding to spring summer autumn and winter covering drainage and storage periods including the highest and lowest water levels the collected samples in each season from mainstream lt n lt 5 lt n is the inflow lt b is the tributary lt 0 to lt 4 is the reservoir sites and lt 5 is the outflow of the reservoir fig 1 the lt n lt b lt 0 and lt 5 were collected at 0 5 m below the surface layer of the river and water profile samples were collected at different depths at 0 5 5 15 25 30 60 90 135 and 170 m till the bottom layer using niskin water sampler model 1010 general oceanics usa in addition water ph chlorophyll a chl a temperature t and do were determined in situ by an automated multiparameter profiler model ysi exo water samples were filtered through a 0 7 µm filter membrane waterman gf f pre heated at 450 c the particulate matter retained on the filters was stored at 20 c until analyzed for the concentration and stable carbon isotope of poc the doc samples were acidified with phosphoric acid to ph 2 and kept at 4 c for measuring concentration and isotope the dic samples were first filtered in the field using 0 45 µm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters and 2 ml samples were injected into 10 ml labco bottles under pre treatment vacuum and 1 ml phosphoric acid was added with a syringe 2 3 geochemical parameter analyses 2 3 1 cation and anion analyses the water samples for the ion analyses were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane whatman inc and the samples for cation were acidified with 3 hno3 to ph 2 and the concentration of ca2 was then tested by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 5 analytical error and po4 3 was analyzed with a continuous flow analyser skalar sans systems 1 5 analytical error 2 3 2 dic doc and poc concentrations the concentration of dic was determined by titration with hcl at 0 02 mol l 1 in the field within 12 h telmer and veizer 1999 the filtered samples were determined on an aurora 1030 total oc analyzer oi analytical usa for the concentration of the doc with duplicates 1 5 analytical error regarding the elemental and stable carbon isotope analysis of the particulate samples the gf f filters removed any inorganic carbon by hydrochloric acid vapor and tested the concentration of poc and total nitrogen tn with an elemental analyzer euro vector ea3000 italy 5 uncertainty the elemental ratio c n was then calculated as the weight ratio of poc to tn where the poc represents the suspended poc if not otherwise mentioned 2 3 3 dic doc poc isotopes the δ13c of dic δ13c dic was determined with a gas bench coupled with a delta v plus instrument thermo fisher 0 3 analytical error as previously reported wang et al 2020a 2020b yi et al 2021 for δ13c of doc δ13c doc the filtrate 5 l was first concentrated through rotary evaporation and oxidized into co2 gas in a vacuum line system via wet oxidation yi et al 2021 the generated co2 was sealed into the tube for δ13c and directly tested with a 253 plus instrument thermo fisher 0 1 analytical error for δ13c of poc δ13c poc the sample after acidification was directly tested in a flash 2000 ht device coupled with the 253 plus instrument thermo fisher 0 2 analytical error 2 3 4 calculation methods to investigate the variations of dic doc and poc mainly caused by the reservoir impacts the calculation method for carbon dic doc and poc were illustrated in fig 2 using the equations as follows 1 δ d i c d i c s a m p l e d i c i n f l o w 2 δ d o c d o c s a m p l e d o c i n f l o w 3 δ p o c p o c s a m p l e p o c s u r f a c e dic and doc were calculated from their concentration at each sampling point minus those in the inflow sample to represent the changes in dic and doc note that poc was calculated by subtracting the poc in the maximum production layer 0 5 m of the reservoir the reason is that most of the riverine poc is removed once it enters the reservoir mccartney et al 2001 while the maximum phytoplankton production is in the 0 5 m layer yi et al 2021 assuming a similar maximum production layer in the lt reservoir the poc concentration at each sampling point minus the average poc concentration in 0 5 m of the reservoir area noted as poc could represent the consumption of poc in the reservoir the volume of the 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layers was obtained from the linear correlation of the reservoir volumes and corresponding water levels fig s1 as discussed in section 4 2 the 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layers are mainly affected by primary production and biodegradation processes respectively hence the transformation amounts of different forms of carbon could be calculated from the average carbon dic doc and poc in the 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layer multiplied by the respective water column volume 4 δ c a r b o n t r a n s δ c a r b o n 0 15

bottom layer 2 3 5 statistical analysis linear modeling analysis and remaining graphing were conducted in r 4 0 2 https www r project org the nonparametric kruskal wallis kw test was performed to examine the differences in different parameters in terms of different layers by r if the variables were not normally distributed where the notation represents the standard deviation if not otherwise mentioned and the standard deviation was considered and transferred to the calculation of quantification a level of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 physiochemical

found in dissolved oxygen saturation do with ph which had the highest 80 9 15 5 and lowest 66 0 18 9 average value in spring and winter however the highest 7 2 11 0 μg l average chl a concentration was found in summer and the lowest 1 0 1 2 μg l in winter 3 2 temporal distribution of dic doc and poc concentrations in lt reservoir lt reservoir had the highest average dic concentration 38 7 1 7 mg

was found in autumn and the lowest storage 238 6 7 7 tg was found in spring in the 0 15 m layer fig 7 the highest 9 4 2 8 mg l and lowest 2 3 1 1 mg l δdic was found in summer and spring and its corresponding transformation amounts were 32 1 9 7 tg summer and 4 8 2 4 tg spring fig 8 a in the 15 m bottom layer the highest 4 6 1 3 mg l and lowest 2 5 1 2 mg l δdic was found in winter and autumn and its corresponding transformation amounts were 27 4 8 0 tg winter and 21 9 10 3 tg autumn the total doc storage had the same trend as dic fig s3 in which the highest 12 2 0 6 tg and lowest 6 6 0 3 tg storages were found in autumn and spring respectively in the 0 15 m layer the δdoc had similar higher value in summer 0 1 0 1 mg l and autumn 0 1 0 1 mg l but the lowest in spring 0 1 0 1 mg l fig

and the lowest value was found in spring 0 2 0 1 mg l and its corresponding transformation amounts were 0 2 0 7 tg summer and 0 8 0 2 tg spring the total poc storage also showed the same trend with dic and doc fig s3 in which the highest 3 7 1 3 tg and lowest 0 2 0 1 tg storages were found in autumn and spring separately in the 0 15 m layer the highest 0 04 0 17 mg l and lowest 0 40 0 33 mg l

of carbon in lt reservoir the aquatic system in karstic areas tends to have a higher dic concentration than in non karstic areas shih et al 2019 in this study the dic storage in the lt reservoir can reach 24 35 times higher than the doc and poc storage but only 8 10 times showed in non karstic reservoirs fig s3 song et al 2018 wen et al 2020 this phenomenon attracts much attention to dic in the karst area herath et al 2020 pu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a however the differences in doc and poc concentrations between the karstic and non karst reservoirs were much more minor than in dic song et al 2018 for instance doc around 1 1 mg l and poc around 0 2 mg l concentration like lt reservoir is close to that in oligotrophic reservoirs in other regions kim et al 2000 raymond and bauer 2001 wang et al 2012 yi et al 2021 the direct physical influence of the reservoir on the river can be mainly categorized as slowing down the river flow increasing the transparency of the river water and retaining the riverine nutrients maavara et al 2020 matzinger et al 2007 while from the biogeochemical perspective the building of a reservoir mainly amplifies the primary production processes in the river decreases the proportion of terrestrial sources in riverine dom and significantly increases the efficiency of organic carbon burial he et al 2020 mendonça et al 2016 wang et al 2021 yi et al 2021 within the significant difference in water flows between inflow and outflow a considerable dic doc and poc were intercepted throughout the year table 2 among them summer storage period had the highest interception of dic 86 79 29 06 tg d doc 2 33 0 79 tg d and poc 0 49 0 16 tg d likely linked to the highest discharge input in contrast the lowest interception of dic 7 01 3 66 tg d doc 0 14 0 08 tg d and poc 0 01 0 01 tg d was found in winter drainage period which is mainly caused by the relative low discharge input table 2 the intercepted carbon also exhibited hydrological and seasonal variations in the reservoir area fig 3 table 2 the higher concentration variation of doc dic and poc mainly occurred in the storage period summer and autumn than in the drainage period spring and winter however the highest and lowest variations were found separately in summer and winter the extremum of variation and retention of different forms of carbon were mainly found in summer and winter rather than autumn and spring in this study likely supporting that the reservoir impacts were regulated by seasonal variations more than hydrological management furthermore the stable isotopes were used to study the influences of seasonal variations hydrological management and intercepted carbons fate 4 2 the isotopic evidence of production and degradation processes in lt reservoir as primary production processes in rivers are amplified by reservoirs yi et al 2021 the main carbon source for primary production in the reservoirs is dic which then results in a higher δ13c value for the remaining dic pool hollander and mckenzie 1991 on the one hand the significant positive correlation between chl a and δ13c dic with higher and positive values occurring in surface layers mainly in the 0 15 m layer supports the dominant effect of primary production on δ13c dic in this study fig 4 the higher δ13c dic of the 0 15 m layer in all seasons fig 5 indicated that the primary production mainly occurred in the 0 15 m layer in agreement with studies in many other reservoirs han et al 2018 herath et al 2020 wang et al 2019 yi et al 2021 on the other hand the lowest δ13c dic were found in the 15 m bottom layers likely caused by the microbial degradation process that preferentially utilized 12c enriched oc and released 12c depleted dic into the dic pool geeraert et al 2016 wang et al 2019 yi et al 2021 the doc and poc in the river mainly come from surface deep soil scouring and surface runoff leaching barnes et al 2018 hence the riverine oc usually has similar characteristics to the soil om e g higher δ13c values with a higher fraction of aromatic compounds than phytoplankton derived doc barnes et al 2018 marwick et al 2015 raymond and spencer 2015 typically a small proportion of riverine doc originates from the phytoplankton source and this part will be increased in the surface layer along with the water flow direction raymond and spencer 2015 yi et al 2021 then the δ13c doc of the 0 15 m layer with a more negative value on average than that in the 15 m bottom layer can also be attributed to primary production in our study fig 5 besides the phytoplankton derived doc with a more labile structure is easier to be consumed by microbes and contribute to a higher δ13c in the remaining doc pool d andrilli et al 2015 thullner et al 2008 in addition the seasonal total suspended matter concentration 1 4 0 9 mg l table s1 was lower in the reservoir than in the river and the influence of sorption and desorption can be reasonably ignored therefore we inferred that the doc in the 15 m bottom layer is mainly affected by microbial degradation and respiration supported by δ13c dic the poc is likely to completely change from terrestrial source to phytoplankton source which can be primarily settled down when the reservoir slows down river flows maavara et al 2020 the c n combined with δ13c poc is widely used to determine the poc sources because of the unique c n within different sources lamb et al 2006 the poc was well distributed in the freshwater algae area in our study and samples from the 0 15 m layer and 15 m bottom layer were well separated fig 6 further revealing that poc in the lt reservoir is mainly sourced from phytoplankton interestingly the δ13c poc in the 0 15 m layer is lower than the phytoplankton derived poc in other freshwater systems lamb et al 2006 which could be attributed to the lower δ13c dic 7 9 in karst area than non karstic freshwater 5 4 alling et al 2012 keeley and sandquist 1992 lamb et al 2006 furthermore the δ13c poc in the 0 15 m layer was lower in summer fig 5 mainly caused by the higher primary production due to more suitable conditions than in other seasons in addition the higher δ13c poc that appeared in the 15m bottom layer can largely be contributed by microbial activity and respiration processes as that of doc fig 5 4 3 the transformation intensity of different forms of carbon in lt reservoir the variations of δ13c dic δ13c doc and δ13c poc could support that the primary production and degradation process mainly occurs in 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layers of lt reservoir respectively across all seasons therefore we quantitatively evaluate the transformation among the different forms of carbon during different seasons based on the production 0 15 m and degradation 15 m bottom layers dic showed a significant difference between the production and degradation layers the layer dominated by the biodegradation process of the lt reservoir except for spring fig 7 the decrease in dic concentration 2 3 to 9 4 mg l was more prominent than in the non karst area which equals the total dic concentration in the non karstic aquatic system shih et al 2019 as mentioned above the dic in the production layer the layer dominated by the primary production process is mainly linked to the primary production consisting of calcium carbonate precipitation and co2 outgassing processes wang et al 2019 2020a indeed the highest decrease of dic 9 4 mg l in the production layer of summer supports the most vigorous primary production processes in the summer as discussed in the δ13c poc section followed by the autumn production layer 8 9 mg l other studies point out that the terrestrial substance usually carries abundant nutrients wang et al 2011 suggesting that the highest inflow in summer likely contributed to the most vigorous primary production process than in other seasons since relatively higher averaged po4 3 concentration was found in summer 22 7 μg l than autumn 17 5 μg l interestingly the decrease of dic in winter 6 5 mg l was also higher than in spring 2 3 mg l which is unusual in other studies since a more substantial primary production is usually found in spring than in winter han et al 2018 wang et al 2020b the δ13c dic of the lt reservoir in the spring 8 7 0 5 was higher on average than that in winter 10 0 0 7 which is likely attributed to a higher δ13c dic input to lt reservoir in spring 8 6 than in winter 9 4 the air temperature is higher in spring 25 c http gx cma gov cn than in winter 14 c increasing the water temperature in shallow aquatic systems like rivers and streams indeed the primary production process will also be strengthened in such systems and increase the proportion of phytoplankton source in doc and enrich δ13c dic further supported by a higher doc concentration of inflow found in spring 1 2 mg l instead of winter 1 0 mg l in addition another study points out that the part of the phytoplankton source in doc can be primarily consumed in the reservoir area but not for the part of the terrestrial source in doc yi et al 2021 therefore we assume that a more vital degradation or respiration process can occur in spring than in winter the newly produced oc was consumed rapidly under those processes and returned to the dic pool resulting in a lower dic concentration decrease in the spring which also is supported by a higher reduction in doc and poc concentration in spring than in winter fig 7 besides the dic was below 0 in all layers across different seasons indicating that riverine dic will ultimately be consumed under the reservoir impacts unlike dic doc showed a significant difference in all seasons especially in summer and autumn fig 7 the doc concentration will increase when the primary production process overwhelms the degradation processes which mainly occurs in the production layer of summer and autumn fig 7 in contrast the doc concentration will decrease when degradation processes are over the primary production process which is mainly found in the whole layer of spring and winter as well as the degradation layer in summer and autumn consistent with dic results the primary production process that contributed to doc 0 11 0 12 mg l had the highest increase in summer followed by autumn and doc had a considerable decrease in spring 0 20 0 06 mg l than winter which further support a more substantial degradation process exists in spring doc concentration increased in the production layer which indicates that the ultimate reservoir impact is to contribute an addition in riverine doc concentration even if the addition of doc was partially consumed along the water column suggesting that the doc after reservoir processing seems to have a higher chance to participate in the biogeochemical cycle of downstream the poc in different layers showed a significant difference in summer and autumn but a similar result in spring and winter fig 7 since poc in the reservoir was mainly derived from primary production less terrestrial poc could be delivered into the reservoir as discussed above the poc in the production layer is mainly regulated by primary production and a noticeable decrease was found in the 15 m layer of summer fig 3 indicating a degradation process occurred in this layer a similar phenomenon was also found in the hjd reservoir yi et al 2021 the poc around 0 mg l is likely to represent the extent of degradation in spring and winter since degradation processes are over primary production as mentioned and produced poc was difficult to observe in the surface layer hence a higher poc decrease in the degradation layer of summer than autumn also supports that summer with a stronger thermal stratification contains the most robust primary production and degradation processes than other seasons however this phenomenon could be disappeared in high discharge events e g floods and rainstorms tockner and stanford 2002 wu et al 2007 the dic doc and poc indicate that the strongest and weakest biogeochemical processes occur in summer and winter respectively which further supports that the intensity of biogeochemical processes seems mainly subject to seasonal variations instead of hydrological management in addition the variation of different forms of carbon also commonly supports that the lt reservoir has a potential productive ability in summer and autumn which can consume riverine dic and produce doc in contrast the lt reservoir in spring and winter mainly consume riverine carbon since degradation processes are over primary production in such seasons 4 4 quantifying the transformation process of different forms of carbon in lt reservoir the addition and reduction of different forms of carbon were operationally calculated in the production degradation and whole layers fig 8 a although the oc can be converted into the dic pool by microbial degradation wang et al 2020a yi et al 2021 the lt reservoir still acts as a sink of dic in all seasons and can be related to multiplying processes primary production and calcium carbonate precipitation wang et al 2019 2020a fig 8 a differently the reservoir has a predominantly consumable effect on riverine doc in spring and winter but plays a productive role in summer and autumn among them the reduction in dic was much higher in summer 60 7 17 9 tg than that in autumn 57 4 14 4 tg even though the water volume was around 19 less in summer table 1 followed by winter 47 4 10 4 tg and spring 17 3 7 3 tg however the highest reduction in doc was found in spring fig 8 a which can be linked to the highest amount of doc degraded into the dic pool contributing to the lowest reduction of dic in spring the higher reduction of dic in summer and autumn is related to evident doc production as discussed a consumable phenomenon was mainly dominated in riverine dic and doc within winter since weak biogeochemical processes exist in such seasons collectively the above evidence supports the internal transformation process between dic and doc those results agree with previous studies that an inter transfer process of dic poc doc widely exists in various aquatic systems he et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yi et al 2021 therefore we assume such an inter transformation process also worked in the lt reservoir and poc should be a bridge between dic and doc riverine poc was largely intercepted by reservoirs as discussed before a considerable dic is converted into the poc pool by primary production then the produced poc is rapidly consumed by microbial activity liu et al 2017 raymond and spencer 2015 the highest reduction of poc was found in summer followed by autumn but less in spring and winter fig 8 a according to the calculations of ca2 reduction around 29 48 of the δdic trans was lost by calcium carbonate precipitation in addition approximately 5 12 of the δdic trans is lost in the outgassing process as reported previously wang et al 2019 yi et al 2021 and the addition of doc and the total amount of poc in the reservoir area can be attributed to primary production then around 34 64 of the δdic trans was converted into the oc pool finally if the lt reservoir system was less affected by other processes such as dissolved co2 and chemical weathering in the sampling season then approximately 5 13 of the δdic trans was lost as missing carbon in the river reservoir system following the calculation of c equilibrium and the fate of missing carbon is still controversial liu et al 2021 indeed whether this missing carbon is buried as poc or degraded to co2 emissions will require further future incubation experiments or in site monitoring to further evaluate the influence of hydrological management and seasonal change on the reservoir impacts the absolute variations of dic doc and poc transformation amounts were analyzed with water volume fig 8 b the dic amount was mainly regulated by hydrological management where the variation followed the volume trend except for autumn the highest and lowest variations of dic were found in summer storage period and spring drainage period however such variation is also likely limited by volume since dic reduction in autumn storage period was higher than in winter drainage period compared to dic the doc amount is influenced by hydrological management in which the highest and lowest variations were found in autumn and spring along with the volume change however the poc amount seems mainly regulated by seasonal variations in which the highest and lowest variations were found in summer and winter along the seasonal biogeochemical influences change overall the hydrological management mainly affects carbon transportation and transformation in the reservoirs based on the transformation amounts perspective but the seasonal change is based on the transformation intensity perspective hence the seasonal variations can dominate the carbon cycling and influence on water environment when the reservoir operates with a stable water level throughout the year however the influence of seasonal variations seems to be further limited when water volume changes throughout the year by hydrological management which indicates that the influence of both seasonal and hydrological management should be considered when evaluating the environmental impacts of reservoirs in the future cooley et al 2021 keller et al 2021 maavara et al 2020 5 conclusion our study provides a comprehensive perspective of the reservoir impacts on different forms of carbon by their carbon isotopes it shows that the primary production and degradation processes are dominated in the shallow layer 0 15 m and the deep layer 15 m bottom of the lt reservoir respectively the reservoir mainly shows a consumable influence on riverine dic and poc over the year without high discharge events occurring but an addable influence on riverine doc in a high production season in addition a considerable missing carbon is found in the primary production process which requires more systematic incubation experiments or comprehensive monitoring to address this question collectively the reservoir impacts are regulated by hydrological management and seasonal variations from different perspectives sustainable hydrological management can be considered an effective measure to modify the biogeochemical cycling of

15376,reservoirs are widely established worldwide with considerable environmental impacts especially on the riverine carbon cycle however the influence of reservoirs on the cycling of different forms of carbon and its regulation factors e g seasonal variations versus hydrological management have not been simultaneously studied to fill this knowledge gap seasonal water samples from the deep subtropical reservoir longtan reservoir in the pearl river were collected and the concentrations and stable carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc were determined the variations in stable carbon isotopes of dic 11 4 to 5 2 doc 32 2 to 26 2 and poc 38 9 to 25 3 in the river reservoir system indicated active production and degradation processes in different layers we estimated that up to 23 0 of dic 20 5 of doc and most poc were intercepted or degraded within the reservoir our results further illustrated that hydrological management water storage regulation and seasonal variations from different perspectives controlled the cycling of different forms of carbon in the reservoir in addition with the gradual increase in the number of reservoirs hydrological management can be considered as a potentially effective strategy to adjust the carbon biogeochemical cycling of reservoirs in the future

introduction anthropogenic activities have dramatically altered the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in inland aquatic systems directly or indirectly affecting the global climate best 2019 grill et al 2019 mendonca et al 2017 dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc are the primary forms of carbon in aquatic systems liu et al 2017 schefuß et al 2016 yi et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 these different forms of carbon are closely related and affect the carbon cycle for instance the primary production process can convert the dic into organic carbon oc pool poc and doc can exchange by dissolution degradation and adsorption they can also return to the dic pool by respiration and mineralization he et al 2016 contributing to complex biogeochemical processes in the carbon cycle in addition to the transformation between different forms of carbon carbon can be derived from various sources and indicated by the stable carbon isotopes δ13c mccallister et al 2018 which are also widely used in the particular form of carbon to investigate its biogeochemical processes evans et al 2017 hou et al 2013 maberly et al 2012 however it remains unclear whether there is any co influence within different forms of carbon and its coupling mechanisms therefore the systematic investigation conducted on various forms of carbon will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the carbon transformation processes in aquatic ecosystems karst areas cover 15 of the global land ipcc climate 2007 their aquatic systems typically have 6 10 times higher dic concentrations than non karst areas due to chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 shih et al 2019 china has the largest karst area in the world mainly in the southwest and most of the water bodies here are presently less impacted by anthropogenic influence a series of reservoirs are planned or built in southwest china due to the abundance of precipitation and the ideal topographic conditions wang et al 2019 wang 2020 among them the karstic river nanpan and hongshui river the up and mid stream of the peal river belongs to the top thirteen hydroelectric power generation bases in china http www hydropower org cn which is a place with minimized influence from the human activities and thus provide an ideal case to investigate the impact of operation under natural influences in reservoirs currently the primary production in most inland reservoirs is limited by nutrients especially by p beaulieu et al 2012 wang 2020 thus the karstic reservoirs likely lead to more intense aquatic biological carbon pump bcp processes than non karst areas since their abundant carbon source and nutrient input increase under anthropogenic activity be enhanced liu et al 2021 yi et al 2021 these intense bcp processes will result in more carbon loss or greenhouse gas ghgs emissions in karst areas liu et al 2018 2021 therefore the reservoir impacts can be enhanced and understanding the carbon cycling and regulation factors in the karst reservoir is essential for projecting future global climate change reservoirs have been established globally since 1800 and act as a double edged sword in daily life icold 2018 maavara et al 2020 for example reservoirs have financial functions of power generation water storage irrigation and aquaculture tockner and stanford 2002 yoshikawa et al 2014 meanwhile a lake like phenomenon can be found in the river reservoir system altering river connectivity intercepting large amounts of solutes and releasing ghgs grill et al 2019 icold 2018 matzinger et al 2007 which can be classified as reservoir impacts unlike the lake system the operation of reservoirs is deeply subject to artificial control cooley et al 2021 mccartney et al 2001 the hydrological management water storage regulation of reservoirs can be generally split into storage and drainage periods by the requirements of financial and river regulated functions mccartney et al 2001 tockner and stanford 2002 many studies point out that the degradability of dissolved organic matter dom the burial of organic carbon and the variation of the microbial community are vastly altered by hydrological management he et al 2020 she et al 2022 wang et al 2021 which will enhance ghgs release and further affect climate change meanwhile the geochemical parameters like ph dissolved oxygen do and different forms of carbon concentrations also exited a seasonal variation in various aquatic environments including reservoirs junger et al 2019 romera castillo et al 2013 wang et al 2012 in the reservoir system the variation of dissolved carbons will change with seasonal variations in the water column which is usually strengthened in the warm season but weakened in the cold season because of thermal stratification han et al 2018 wang et al 2020a indeed the reservoir impacts also behave a seasonal character junger et al 2019 xu and milliman 2009 up to date it remains unclear which factor is dominant hydrological management vs seasonal variations in controlling carbon dynamics of river reservoir systems answering this question will contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the role of reservoirs in carbon neutral and provide a theoretical basis for weakening the reservoir side impacts this study seasonally sampled inflow reservoir profile and outflow from longtan lt reservoir on the pearl river the second largest river in china in terms of water discharge covering the storage and drainage periods in particular we combined the hydrological conditions water chemistry parameters carbon concentrations and stable carbon isotopes to explore regulated factors including seasonal variations and hydrological management in reservoir impacts by evaluating the intensity and amounts of transformation processes between different species of carbon we hypothesize that seasonal variations mainly regulate the transformation intensity of different forms of carbon however hydrological management controls its amounts and the man regulation can weaken the impacts of reservoirs on the carbon cycle the results of our study will provide a systematic perspective for understanding the reservoirs in regional carbon cycling and a scientific basis to regulate the reservoir impacts in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the pearl river is located in the subtropical region with annual temperature and rainfall of 14 22 c and 1200 2200 mm respectively the yearly flow can reach 330 km3year 1 which is about seven times higher than the yellow river and more than 80 of the annual runoff occurs in the wet season april to september lt is the 5th largest reservoir in china located in the mid stream of pearl river fig 1 completed in

were determined in situ by an automated multiparameter profiler model ysi exo water samples were filtered through a 0 7 µm filter membrane waterman gf f pre heated at 450 c the particulate matter retained on the filters was stored at 20 c until analyzed for the concentration and stable carbon isotope of poc the doc samples were acidified with phosphoric acid to ph 2 and kept at 4 c for measuring concentration and isotope the dic samples were first filtered in the field using 0 45 µm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters and 2 ml samples were injected into 10 ml labco bottles under pre treatment vacuum and 1 ml phosphoric acid was added with a syringe 2 3 geochemical parameter analyses 2 3 1 cation and anion analyses the water samples for the ion analyses were filtered through a

methods to investigate the variations of dic doc and poc mainly caused by the reservoir impacts the calculation method for carbon dic doc and poc were illustrated in fig 2 using the equations as follows 1 δ d i c d i c s a m p l e d i c i n f l o w 2 δ d o c d o c s a m p l e d o c i n f l o w 3 δ p o c p o c s a m p l e p o c s u r f a c e dic and doc were calculated from their concentration at each sampling point minus those in the inflow sample to represent the changes in dic and doc note that poc was calculated by subtracting the poc in the maximum production layer 0 5 m of the reservoir the reason is that most of the riverine poc is removed once it enters the reservoir mccartney et al 2001 while the maximum phytoplankton production is in the 0 5 m layer yi et al 2021 assuming a similar maximum production layer in the lt reservoir the poc concentration at each sampling point minus the average poc concentration in 0 5 m of the reservoir area noted as poc could represent the consumption of poc in the reservoir the volume of the 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layers was obtained from the linear correlation of the reservoir volumes and corresponding water levels fig s1 as discussed in section 4 2 the 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layers are mainly affected by primary production and biodegradation processes respectively hence the transformation amounts of different forms of carbon could be calculated from the average carbon dic doc and poc in the 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layer multiplied by the respective water column volume 4 δ c a r b o n t r a n s δ c a r b o n 0 15

of carbon in lt reservoir the aquatic system in karstic areas tends to have a higher dic concentration than in non karstic areas shih et al 2019 in this study the dic storage in the lt reservoir can reach 24 35 times higher than the doc and poc storage but only 8 10 times showed in non karstic reservoirs fig s3 song et al 2018 wen et al 2020 this phenomenon attracts much attention to dic in the karst area herath et al 2020 pu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a however the differences in doc and poc concentrations between the karstic and non karst reservoirs were much more minor than in dic song et al 2018 for instance doc around 1 1 mg l and poc around 0 2 mg l concentration like lt reservoir is close to that in oligotrophic reservoirs in other regions kim et al 2000 raymond and bauer 2001 wang et al 2012 yi et al 2021 the direct physical influence of the reservoir on the river can be mainly categorized as slowing down the river flow increasing the transparency of the river water and retaining the riverine nutrients maavara et al 2020 matzinger et al 2007 while from the biogeochemical perspective the building of a reservoir mainly amplifies the primary production processes in the river decreases the proportion of terrestrial sources in riverine dom and significantly increases the efficiency of organic carbon burial he et al 2020 mendonça et al 2016 wang et al 2021 yi et al 2021 within the significant difference in water flows between inflow and outflow a considerable dic doc and poc were intercepted throughout the year table 2 among them summer storage period had the highest interception of dic 86 79 29 06 tg d doc 2 33 0 79 tg d and poc 0 49 0 16 tg d likely linked to the highest discharge input in contrast the lowest interception of dic 7 01 3 66 tg d doc 0 14 0 08 tg d and poc 0 01 0 01 tg d was found in winter drainage period which is mainly caused by the relative low discharge input table 2 the intercepted carbon also exhibited hydrological and seasonal variations in the reservoir area fig 3 table 2 the higher concentration variation of doc dic and poc mainly occurred in the storage period summer and autumn than in the drainage period spring and winter however the highest and lowest variations were found separately in summer and winter the extremum of variation and retention of different forms of carbon were mainly found in summer and winter rather than autumn and spring in this study likely supporting that the reservoir impacts were regulated by seasonal variations more than hydrological management furthermore the stable isotopes were used to study the influences of seasonal variations hydrological management and intercepted carbons fate 4 2 the isotopic evidence of production and degradation processes in lt reservoir as primary production processes in rivers are amplified by reservoirs yi et al 2021 the main carbon source for primary production in the reservoirs is dic which then results in a higher δ13c value for the remaining dic pool hollander and mckenzie 1991 on the one hand the significant positive correlation between chl a and δ13c dic with higher and positive values occurring in surface layers mainly in the 0 15 m layer supports the dominant effect of primary production on δ13c dic in this study fig 4 the higher δ13c dic of the 0 15 m layer in all seasons fig 5 indicated that the primary production mainly occurred in the 0 15 m layer in agreement with studies in many other reservoirs han et al 2018 herath et al 2020 wang et al 2019 yi et al 2021 on the other hand the lowest δ13c dic were found in the 15 m bottom layers likely caused by the microbial degradation process that preferentially utilized 12c enriched oc and released 12c depleted dic into the dic pool geeraert et al 2016 wang et al 2019 yi et al 2021 the doc and poc in the river mainly come from surface deep soil scouring and surface runoff leaching barnes et al 2018 hence the riverine oc usually has similar characteristics to the soil om e g higher δ13c values with a higher fraction of aromatic compounds than phytoplankton derived doc barnes et al 2018 marwick et al 2015 raymond and spencer 2015 typically a small proportion of riverine doc originates from the phytoplankton source and this part will be increased in the surface layer along with the water flow direction raymond and spencer 2015 yi et al 2021 then the δ13c doc of the 0 15 m layer with a more negative value on average than that in the 15 m bottom layer can also be attributed to primary production in our study fig 5 besides the phytoplankton derived doc with a more labile structure is easier to be consumed by microbes and contribute to a higher δ13c in the remaining doc pool d andrilli et al 2015 thullner et al 2008 in addition the seasonal total suspended matter concentration 1 4 0 9 mg l table s1 was lower in the reservoir than in the river and the influence of sorption and desorption can be reasonably ignored therefore we inferred that the doc in the 15 m bottom layer is mainly affected by microbial degradation and respiration supported by δ13c dic the poc is likely to completely change from terrestrial source to phytoplankton source which can be primarily settled down when the reservoir slows down river flows maavara et al 2020 the c n combined with δ13c poc is widely used to determine the poc sources because of the unique c n within different sources lamb et al 2006 the poc was well distributed in the freshwater algae area in our study and samples from the 0 15 m layer and 15 m bottom layer were well separated fig 6 further revealing that poc in the lt reservoir is mainly sourced from phytoplankton interestingly the δ13c poc in the 0 15 m layer is lower than the phytoplankton derived poc in other freshwater systems lamb et al 2006 which could be attributed to the lower δ13c dic 7 9 in karst area than non karstic freshwater 5 4 alling et al 2012 keeley and sandquist 1992 lamb et al 2006 furthermore the δ13c poc in the 0 15 m layer was lower in summer fig 5 mainly caused by the higher primary production due to more suitable conditions than in other seasons in addition the higher δ13c poc that appeared in the 15m bottom layer can largely be contributed by microbial activity and respiration processes as that of doc fig 5 4 3 the transformation intensity of different forms of carbon in lt reservoir the variations of δ13c dic δ13c doc and δ13c poc could support that the primary production and degradation process mainly occurs in 0 15 m and 15 m bottom layers of lt reservoir respectively across all seasons therefore we quantitatively evaluate the transformation among the different forms of carbon during different seasons based on the production 0 15 m and degradation 15 m bottom layers dic showed a significant difference between the production and degradation layers the layer dominated by the biodegradation process of the lt reservoir except for spring fig 7 the decrease in dic concentration 2 3 to 9 4 mg l was more prominent than in the non karst area which equals the total dic concentration in the non karstic aquatic system shih et al 2019 as mentioned above the dic in the production layer the layer dominated by the primary production process is mainly linked to the primary production consisting of calcium carbonate precipitation and co2 outgassing processes wang et al 2019 2020a indeed the highest decrease of dic 9 4 mg l in the production layer of summer supports the most vigorous primary production processes in the summer as discussed in the δ13c poc section followed by the autumn production layer 8 9 mg l other studies point out that the terrestrial substance usually carries abundant nutrients wang et al 2011 suggesting that the highest inflow in summer likely contributed to the most vigorous primary production process than in other seasons since relatively higher averaged po4 3 concentration was found in summer 22 7 μg l than autumn 17 5 μg l interestingly the decrease of dic in winter 6 5 mg l was also higher than in spring 2 3 mg l which is unusual in other studies since a more substantial primary production is usually found in spring than in winter han et al 2018 wang et al 2020b the δ13c dic of the lt reservoir in the spring 8 7 0 5 was higher on average than that in winter 10 0 0 7 which is likely attributed to a higher δ13c dic input to lt reservoir in spring 8 6 than in winter 9 4 the air temperature is higher in spring 25 c http gx cma gov cn than in winter 14 c increasing the water temperature in shallow aquatic systems like rivers and streams indeed the primary production process will also be strengthened in such systems and increase the proportion of phytoplankton source in doc and enrich δ13c dic further supported by a higher doc concentration of inflow found in spring 1 2 mg l instead of winter 1 0 mg l in addition another study points out that the part of the phytoplankton source in doc can be primarily consumed in the reservoir area but not for the part of the terrestrial source in doc yi et al 2021 therefore we assume that a more vital degradation or respiration process can occur in spring than in winter the newly produced oc was consumed rapidly under those processes and returned to the dic pool resulting in a lower dic concentration decrease in the spring which also is supported by a higher reduction in doc and poc concentration in spring than in winter fig 7 besides the dic was below 0 in all layers across different seasons indicating that riverine dic will ultimately be consumed under the reservoir impacts unlike dic doc showed a significant difference in all seasons especially in summer and autumn fig 7 the doc concentration will increase when the primary production process overwhelms the degradation processes which mainly occurs in the production layer of summer and autumn fig 7 in contrast the doc concentration will decrease when degradation processes are over the primary production process which is mainly found in the whole layer of spring and winter as well as the degradation layer in summer and autumn consistent with dic results the primary production process that contributed to doc 0 11 0 12 mg l had the highest increase in summer followed by autumn and doc had a considerable decrease in spring 0 20 0 06 mg l than winter which further support a more substantial degradation process exists in spring doc concentration increased in the production layer which indicates that the ultimate reservoir impact is to contribute an addition in riverine doc concentration even if the addition of doc was partially consumed along the water column suggesting that the doc after reservoir processing seems to have a higher chance to participate in the biogeochemical cycle of downstream the poc in different layers showed a significant difference in summer and autumn but a similar result in spring and winter fig 7 since poc in the reservoir was mainly derived from primary production less terrestrial poc could be delivered into the reservoir as discussed above the poc in the production layer is mainly regulated by primary production and a noticeable decrease was found in the 15 m layer of summer fig 3 indicating a degradation process occurred in this layer a similar phenomenon was also found in the hjd reservoir yi et al 2021 the poc around 0 mg l is likely to represent the extent of degradation in spring and winter since degradation processes are over primary production as mentioned and produced poc was difficult to observe in the surface layer hence a higher poc decrease in the degradation layer of summer than autumn also supports that summer with a stronger thermal stratification contains the most robust primary production and degradation processes than other seasons however this phenomenon could be disappeared in high discharge events e g floods and rainstorms tockner and stanford 2002 wu et al 2007 the dic doc and poc indicate that the strongest and weakest biogeochemical processes occur in summer and winter respectively which further supports that the intensity of biogeochemical processes seems mainly subject to seasonal variations instead of hydrological management in addition the variation of different forms of carbon also commonly supports that the lt reservoir has a potential productive ability in summer and autumn which can consume riverine dic and produce doc in contrast the lt reservoir in spring and winter mainly consume riverine carbon since degradation processes are over primary production in such seasons 4 4 quantifying the transformation process of different forms of carbon in lt reservoir the addition and reduction of different forms of carbon were operationally calculated in the production degradation and whole layers fig 8 a although the oc can be converted into the dic pool by microbial degradation wang et al 2020a yi et al 2021 the lt reservoir still acts as a sink of dic in all seasons and can be related to multiplying processes primary production and calcium carbonate precipitation wang et al 2019 2020a fig 8 a differently the reservoir has a predominantly consumable effect on riverine doc in spring and winter but plays a productive role in summer and autumn among them the reduction in dic was much higher in summer 60 7 17 9 tg than that in autumn 57 4 14 4 tg even though the water volume was around 19 less in summer table 1 followed by winter 47 4 10 4 tg and spring 17 3 7 3 tg however the highest reduction in doc was found in spring fig 8 a which can be linked to the highest amount of doc degraded into the dic pool contributing to the lowest reduction of dic in spring the higher reduction of dic in summer and autumn is related to evident doc production as discussed a consumable phenomenon was mainly dominated in riverine dic and doc within winter since weak biogeochemical processes exist in such seasons collectively the above evidence supports the internal transformation process between dic and doc those results agree with previous studies that an inter transfer process of dic poc doc widely exists in various aquatic systems he et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yi et al 2021 therefore we assume such an inter transformation process also worked in the lt reservoir and poc should be a bridge between dic and doc riverine poc was largely intercepted by reservoirs as discussed before a considerable dic is converted into the poc pool by primary production then the produced poc is rapidly consumed by microbial activity liu et al 2017 raymond and spencer 2015 the highest reduction of poc was found in summer followed by autumn but less in spring and winter fig 8 a according to the calculations of ca2 reduction around 29 48 of the δdic trans was lost by calcium carbonate precipitation in addition approximately 5 12 of the δdic trans is lost in the outgassing process as reported previously wang et al 2019 yi et al 2021 and the addition of doc and the total amount of poc in the reservoir area can be attributed to primary production then around 34 64 of the δdic trans was converted into the oc pool finally if the lt reservoir system was less affected by other processes such as dissolved co2 and chemical weathering in the sampling season then approximately 5 13 of the δdic trans was lost as missing carbon in the river reservoir system following the calculation of c equilibrium and the fate of missing carbon is still controversial liu et al 2021 indeed whether this missing carbon is buried as poc or degraded to co2 emissions will require further future incubation experiments or in site monitoring to further evaluate the influence of hydrological management and seasonal change on the reservoir impacts the absolute variations of dic doc and poc transformation amounts were analyzed with water volume fig 8 b the dic amount was mainly regulated by hydrological management where the variation followed the volume trend except for autumn the highest and lowest variations of dic were found in summer storage period and spring drainage period however such variation is also likely limited by volume since dic reduction in autumn storage period was higher than in winter drainage period compared to dic the doc amount is influenced by hydrological management in which the highest and lowest variations were found in autumn and spring along with the volume change however the poc amount seems mainly regulated by seasonal variations in which the highest and lowest variations were found in summer and winter along the seasonal biogeochemical influences change overall the hydrological management mainly affects carbon transportation and transformation in the reservoirs based on the transformation amounts perspective but the seasonal change is based on the transformation intensity perspective hence the seasonal variations can dominate the carbon cycling and influence on water environment when the reservoir operates with a stable water level throughout the year however the influence of seasonal variations seems to be further limited when water volume changes throughout the year by hydrological management which indicates that the influence of both seasonal and hydrological management should be considered when evaluating the environmental impacts of reservoirs in the future cooley et al 2021 keller et al 2021 maavara et al 2020 5 conclusion our study provides a comprehensive perspective of the reservoir impacts on different forms of carbon by their carbon isotopes it shows that the primary production and degradation processes are dominated in the shallow layer 0 15 m and the deep layer 15 m bottom of the lt reservoir respectively the reservoir mainly shows a consumable influence on riverine dic and poc over the year without high discharge events occurring but an addable influence on riverine doc in a high production season in addition a considerable missing carbon is found in the primary production process which requires more systematic incubation experiments or comprehensive monitoring to address this question collectively the reservoir impacts are regulated by hydrological management and seasonal variations from different perspectives sustainable hydrological management can be considered an effective measure to modify the biogeochemical cycling of

microbial community were calculated including chao ace shannon and simpson indices and coverage 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and soil microbial community the do concentration decreased from 6 mg l in influents to 2 3 mg l in effluents during the 82 day omp exposure experiment fig s1 meanwhile the doc decreased from 6 mg l in the influent to approximately 4 mg l in the effluents during the exposure experiment fig s1 the relatively steady do consumption 50 66 and doc removal 33 implied that stable microbial ecology and bioactivity were established in the columns bertelkamp et al 2014 for both do and doc no significant differences were observed between the control and treatment columns cctrl 1 2 vs ctret 1 2 suggesting the high reliability and reproducibility of the present study in terms of the soil microbial communities the shannon index of inlet sand was significantly lower than that of outlet sand t test p 0 03 among the columns the bray curtis distance revealed that although the bacterial communities of inlet sand were significantly different the outlet sand became similar pcoa fig s2 within each column the stamp analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community composition of inlet sand was clearly different from that of outlet sand welch s t test p 0 05 fig s3 as shown in table 1 by the end of the column experiment phase 1 the abundance of bacteria decreased significantly from 1 8 108 copies g at inlet sand to 6 2 8 7 106 copies g at outlet sand in both the control and treatment columns p 0 001 in contrast the abundance of archaea increased from 4 5 105 copies g in inlet sand to 9 2 106 copies g in outlet sand in c ctrl 1 2 which remained stable from inlet sand to outlet sand in c tret 1 2 the relative abundance of archaea increased along with the infiltration distance from 0 5 to 11 7 indicating that archaea and their associated functions would be non negligible interestingly independent of the changes in bacteria and archaea the aob maintained stable abundances across c ctrl 1 2 and c tret 1 2 aoa increased significantly from inlet sand to outlet sand while the comammox decreased significantly from inlet sand to outlet sand in both groups in the inlet sand the aoa aom aoa aob comammox ratio and comammox aom ratio were 23 72 and 23 64 while aob only counted 5 13 suggesting aoa and comammox are dominators of aom in the outlet sand aoa counted 94 4 96 7 and dominated aom it is clear that aom are dominated by aoa and comammox which can be explained by aoa and comammox being more suitable than aob for oligotrophic low ammonium environments leininger et al 2006 liu et al 2011 straka et al 2019 sakoula et al 2021 in all the relative abundance of aom increased from 0 1 0 2 inlet sand to 5 3 5 9 outlet sand in phase 2 the abundance of bacteria archaea and aoa in the inlet sand and outlet sand of each column declined compared with that of phase 1 table 1 the decreases of bacteria and archaea might be due to the introduction of the 0 45 μm membrane pre filtration of feed water in phase 2 that reduced particulate organic matter and prevented the degradation of omps before entering the columns diem et al 2013 additionally the addition of omps might also inhibit bacteria and archaea since aoa are autotrophic microbes whose decreases in cctrl1 2 could be attributed the inhibition effect of omps e g antibiotic zhao et al 2022 as for the effect of atu addition on aom aob and comammox amoa genes abundances kept stable in the inlet sand of c ctrl1 2 table 1 while decreased 22 and 75 in the c tret1 2 suggesting the inhibition effect of atu on them notably aoa amoa genes abundances decreased 54 in c ctrl1 2 while decreased 86 in c tret1 2 more decline occurred in c tret1 2 could be attributed to the addition of atu the aom amoa genes abundances kept stable in the inlet sand of c ctrl1 2 while significantly decreased 78 in the c tret 1 2 providing strong evidence that the addition of atu could inhibit aom though atu has been widely recognized and used as aom inhibitor for investigating the role of aom in omps biotransformation yan et al 2022 rattier et al 2014 srithep et al 2018 tran et al 2014 vandevivere et al 1998 some studies found atu is a non specific ammonia oxidation inhibitor by comparing with octyne men et al 2017 octyne can inhibit aob but not aoa taylor et al 2013 while the degradation of omps by aoa strains is non negligible e g aoa exhibited the best removals of lincomycin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin followed by comammox and aob zhou et al 2021 since aoa were the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the simulated rbf atu was chosen as aom inhibitor in this study it should be mentioned that atu is not an exclusive aom inhibitor men et al 2017 therefore though this is currently the best we could achieve there is a chance that the observed decrease in omps removal caused by adding atu might not be completely resulted from aom inhibition 3 2 efficiency and mechanism of omp removal the recoveries of the 128 omps ranged from 52 to 145 table s5 no significant difference t test p 0 05 was found in the performance of duplicate columns c ctrl 1 vs c ctrl 2 c tret 1 vs c tret 2 during the 82 day operation indicating the high reproducibility and reliability of this study the data of duplicate columns were merged as a control group c ctrl 1 2 and a treatment group c tret 1 2 for the following discussion the removal efficiencies of the 128 omps over an 82 day experiment are presented in fig 2 in general 31 omps were completely removed and 87 omps were partially removed 51 omps 70 19 omps 30 70 suggesting that the simulated first meter of rbf is indeed an effective barrier for most omps atenolol caffeine trimethoprim and gemfibrozil were removed to a great extent 94 which is similar to the observations in the field rbf sites hollender et al 2018 regnery et al 2015 huntscha et al 2013 despite being highly effective for most omps 10 omps such as sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and atenolol acid broke through the simulated columns and were not removed at all possibly due to the physicochemical properties of the omps bertelkamp et al 2014 as presented in fig s4 the omp removal efficiency was positively correlated with log p and mw but negatively correlated with secondary amides sulfonamides ketimines benzyls and amines the secondary sulfonamides were the strongest negatively correlated functional groups this result complied with previous findings of persistent behaviors of sulfonamides in simulated and field rbf studies bertelkamp et al 2014 hamann et al 2016 this was especially true for sulfamethoxazole which was not removed in this experiment conflicting results have been obtained from batch tests only adsorption and column studies adsorption and biodegradation for several omps specifically five omps with 8 48 removal in the batch tests were hardly removed in the column study such as pirimicarb sulfamethazine and ritonavir fig s5 this is because the sand adsorbed these omps in the short term batch tests however such non degradable omps broke through sand columns and demonstrated persistent behavior in the long term study in contrast 32 omps that were partially or completely removed in the column study including nadolol and lidocaine were not removed in the batch test fig s6 suggesting that these omps can be removed by biodegradation or biosorption in other words these 32 omps could only be removed by active microorganisms thereby emphasizing the key role of microorganisms in the removal of omps biosorption has been reported to play a negligible role in the removal of omps whereas biodegradation is commonly accepted as the most important mechanism for the removal of omps bai et al 2019 bertelkamp et al 2014 huntscha et al 2013 the correlation between the removal of 32 omps and their physicochemical properties demonstrated that mw and log p were positively correlated with the removal efficiencies whereas secondary amides secondary sulfonamides secondary ketimines benzyls and primary amines were negatively correlated with the removal efficiencies fig s7 tertiary amides secondary ketimines secondary sulfonamides and tertiary sulfonamides are likely to be most hard degradable functional groups followed by secondary amides benzyl olefinic bond and phenyl fig s8 interestingly with an increase in exposure time the removal efficiency of 28 omps increased fig s9 which might be due to genetic changes enzyme induction and microbial composition changes bertelkamp et al 2016 in contrast the removal efficiency of 15 omps decreased indicating the possible occurrence of adsorption saturation which further implies the refractory biodegradation of these omps notably eight identical omps e g gemfibrozil norfloxacin and clofibric acid were observed in 32 omps only removed by active microorganisms and 28 omps with increased removal efficiencies suggesting the sustainability and potential growth of biodegradation in omps removal 3 3 the effects of aom on omp removal the inhibition of aom significantly decreased the removal efficiency of 32 128 selected omps fig 3 a as presented in fig 3 b the degradation of five omps namely isoprocarb phenacetin methomyl tolbutamide and 2 3 5 trimethacarb was nearly completely inhibited these omps were hardly removed by sand adsorption during the batch tests this suggests a key role of aom in the removal of certain groups of omps in the simulated first meter of rbf however the other 13 omps e g lidocaine and lincomycin that could not be removed by sand adsorption were removed by up to 40 100 by columns via biodegradation the addition of atu decreased the removal efficiency by 2 71 thereby indicating that these 13 omps might be degraded not only by aom but also by other microorganisms for example heterotrophic microorganisms have been reported to degrade ee2 atenolol and trimethoprim via co metabolism kennes veiga et al 2021 gusseme et al 2009 xu et al 2017 moreover for 14 other omps e g repaglinide atenolol and difloxacin it was observed that both sand adsorption 2 96 removed and aom 2 65 inhibited by atu contributed to their degradation while it is unclear whether heterotrophic bacteria play a role in this process aom could make negligible or major contribution to the removal of omp due to the existences of adsorption and heterotrophic microorganisms degradation which is depend on the type of omp among the 32 aom degradable omps in the present study only the degradation of lincomycin clindamycin gemfibrozil and atenolol transformation by aom have been documented previously the mechanism of which were attributed to the reaction of hydroxylation and primary amide hydrolysis induced by the non specific enzyme of ammonia monooxygenase amo fernandez fontaina et al 2012 rattier et al 2014 xu et al 2017 helbling et al 2012 men et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 besides the hydroxylamine intermediate of ammonia oxidation could react with lincomycin and achieve 90 removal zhou et al 2021 and the hno2 and no may also contribute to the biotransformation of omps yu et al 2018 it should be noted that the above mentioned omps degradation via amo and hydroxylamine were observed in nitrifying activated sludge and aom pure culture since the matrix of organic matter and community of microbes are different the specific omps degradation in the simulated rbf system of the present study might be not exactly the same which deserves further research moreover sulfamethoxazole and naproxen which were classified as non degradable in the present study were reported to be degradable by aom in aob dominated high ammonium eutrophic systems kassotaki et al 2016 fernandez fontaina et al 2016 it might be reasonable to hypothesis that sulfamethoxazole and naproxen could be degraded by aob but not aoa and comammox nonetheless this hypothesis is inconsistent with previous pure culture study which found both aoa and comammox can degradate sulfamethoxazole zhou et al 2019 the contradictory observation in the present study might be attributed to complex bacterial community and different environmental conditions which may lead to insufficient abundances of aoa and comammox for degrading sulfamethoxazole or there were microorganisms and or environmental factors suppressed such function differently it is observed that sotalol was degradable by aom in the present study which was not degraded in nitrification enrichment culture sathyamoorthy et al 2013 this might be attributed to the stronger omp degradation capability of amo associated with comammox for example carbendazim can be degraded by comammox but not aoa or aob han et al 2019 in general the observed variations in omps degradation performances of the three ammonia oxidizers could be caused by differences in either microbial community or water quality of the targeted system further study in controllable conditions is needed and highly recommended to explore the mechanisms and differences of omps transformation by aoa aob and comammox 3 4 key factors affecting the co metabolism potential of aom on omps the inhibition ratio y was defined to assess the contribution of aom to the degradation of omps y x 100 1 x s removal in c tret x s removal in c ctrl where x one omp y x the contribution ratio of aom on the removal of x as presented in fig 4 the removal efficiencies of omps in both the batch tests re batch and column studies re column were negatively correlated with the inhibition ratio indicating that aom plays a remarkable role in the degradation of the difficult to remove omps the inhibition ratio was also negatively correlated with mw suggesting that aom tends to remove omps with lower mw additionally the inhibition ratio was positively correlated with log p 32 omps fig 4 indicating that omps with higher log p values tend to be removed by aom notably log p was negatively correlated with the removal efficiency of 32 omps fig 4 but positively correlated with the removal efficiency of 128 omps fig s4 these conflicting observations may be related to the differences in the log p ranges 128 omps 1 5 to 6 vs 32 omps 0 to 3 5 fig s10 in terms of functional groups positive correlations were observed between the inhibition ratio and secondary amides benzyls secondary sulfonamides and secondary ketimines fig 4 secondary amides and benzyls are the two most strongly positively correlated functional groups the co metabolism of omps containing amides by aom has been reported in wastewater treatment plants where atenolol is biotransformed to atenolol acid through primary amide hydrolysis by aob helbling et al 2012 xu et al 2017 and lincomycin with secondary amide is biodegraded by aom zhou et al 2021 it is reasonable to hypothesize that hydrolysis of primary and or secondary amides by aom might occur for the 16 omps containing amides e g atenolol lincomycin and isoprocarb in addition 4 8 of the benzyl containing omps did not contain nitrogen functional groups i e secondary amides and secondary sulfonamides implying that the strong positive correlation between benzyls and the inhibition ratio may be attributed to ammonia monooxygenase mediated ch hydroxylation of aliphatic compounds su et al 2021 interestingly among the 13 128 omps containing tertiary amide groups only the degradation of zolpidem which contains both tertiary amides and benzyls was inhibited hence the inhibition of zolpidem degradation was due to benzyls rather than tertiary amides suggesting that the co metabolism of aom could not act on tertiary amides the observed positive correlation between the inhibition ratio and secondary sulfonamides complied with previous findings of the degradation of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole containing secondary sulfonamides by aob in wastewater treatment processes wang et al 2019 kassotaki et al 2016 meanwhile the removal of sildenafil containing tertiary sulfonamides not containing secondary amides benzyls and secondary sulfonamides was not inhibited suggesting that tertiary sulfonamides may not be transformed by aom overall the ability of certain omps to be co metabolically degraded by aom is largely determined by their physicochemical properties more specifically omps with lower mw containing primary amide benzyl secondary amide and secondary sulfonamide groups are more likely to be degraded by aom 3 5 environmental relevance and implications recently there has been an increasing concern regarding the presence and potential risk of omps in urban water system especially in drinking water hollender et al 2018 kondor et al 2020 li et al 2021 it is an urgent need to develop green and effective barrier that can remove target omps while avoid generation of byproducts with low additional cost this study focuses on nature based rbf system and its omps biodegradation mechanism though it has been widely observed that rbf performed well regarding omps removal through biodegradation such bio process remains poorly documented which hampered the application and improvements of omps removal in drinking water systems bertelkamp et al 2014 hamann et al 2016 kondor et al 2020 this work determined the removal efficiencies of 128 omps in the simulated first meter of rbf of which 82 omps were 70 highlighting the important role of the oxic zone combined the results from the column and batch experiments it can be concluded that the removals of 32 omps were entirely accomplished via biodegradation suggesting a critical contribution of biodegradation on omps removal in rbf for those omps the observed correlations between omps functional groups and their corresponding biodegradation potential are valuable for predicting the fate of omps in rbf interestingly the removal efficiency of 28 omps increased with exposure time indicating there might be adaption time needed for biofiltration to remove omps the role of aom in omps biodegradation was studied by atu inhibition experiments which showed the omps biodegradation is achieved by both aom and non aom microbes considering the functional groups aom tend to degrade omps containing primary amide benzyl secondary amide and secondary sulfonamide the finding sheds new light on the correlation between physiochemical properties of omps and their aom co metabolic potential based on which prediction could be made when new omps present in source water on this basis the omps removal could be enhanced and necessary subsequent treatments can be adjusted to minimize the risk of new omps the mechanism of omps transformation by aom might be different among water systems such as wwtps wetlands and rbf however the obtained knowledge about the functional groups of omps and their aom co metabolic potential may be helpful for understanding the omps degradation in other water systems it should be noted that the activities of aoa aob and comammox were simultaneously inhibited by atu in this study which might also inhibit other enzymes to explore the specific contribution of each aom precisely strategies should be developed for inhibiting the microbes separately and exclusively 4 conclusions based on the simulated first meter infiltration of rbf in this study it can be concluded that most of the omps were effectively removed among the 128 omps the removal efficiencies of 82 omps were above 70 31 omps were completely removed 15 omps were 30 70 and 31 omps were below 30 10 omps were not removed at all biodegradation was the most important factor followed by adsorption inefficiently removed omps tended to have low mw low log p and contain secondary amide sulfonamide ketimine and benzyl groups the relative abundance of aom increased with infiltration distance from 0 2 to 5 9 in which aoa accounted for 23 72 inlet sand to 97 outlet sand comammox accounted for 1 outlet sand to 23 64 inlet sand the abundances of aom amoa genes decreased 78 suggesting the inhibition effects of atu on aom aom play an important role in this process inhibiting aom suppressed the degradation of 32 omps five of which were almost completely inhibited omps with low mw and containing primary amide secondary amide secondary sulfonamide and benzyl groups are more likely to be removed by aom

15377,biodegradation plays an important role in the removal of organic micropollutants omps during riverbank filtration rbf for drinking water production the ability of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom to remove omps has attracted increasing attention however the distribution of aom in rbf and its role in the degradation of omps remains unknown in this study the behavior of 128 selected omps and the distribution of aom and their roles in the degradation of omps in rbf were explored by column and batch experiments simulating the first meter of the riverbank the results showed that the selected omps were effectively removed 82 128 omps 70 removal primarily by biodegradation and partly by adsorption inefficiently removed omps tended to have low molecular weights low log p and contain secondary amides secondary sulfonamides secondary ketimines and benzyls in terms of the microbial communities the relative abundance of aom increased from 0 1 0 2 inlet sand to 5 3 5 9 outlet sand which was dominated by ammonia oxidizing archaea whose relative abundance increased from 23 72 inlet sand to 97 outlet sand comammox accounted for 23 64 in the inlet sand and 1 in the outlet sand the abundances of aom amoa genes kept stable in the inlet sand of control columns while decreased by 78 in the treatment columns suggesting the inhibition effect of allylthiourea atu on aom it is observed that aom played an important role in the degradation of omps where its inhibition led to the corresponding inhibition of 32 omps 5 32 were completely suppressed in particular omps with low molecular weights and containing primary amides secondary amides benzyls and secondary sulfonamides were more likely to be removed by aom this study reveals the vital role of aom in the removal of omps deepens our understanding of the degradation of omps in rbf and offers valuable insights into the physiochemical properties of omps and their aom co metabolic potential graphical

out of the 111 selected omps were detected in the danube in hungary 52 were detected in the danube and 32 were present in drinking water wells and 36 out of the targeted 194 omps were observed in two sites at the ems river and two at the ruhr river in germany oberleitner et al 2020 kondor et al 2020 hollender et al 2018 the concentrations of omps detected in the water sources range from a few to several hundred ng l thereby posing a severe threat to public drinking water safety borrull et al 2021 riverbank filtration rbf is used globally as a drinking water pre treatment technology and has been widely reported as an effective barrier to omps hamann et al 2016 hollender et al 2018 zhai et al 2022 the dissolved oxygen do in the river water is gradually consumed during the infiltration process forming unique aerobic suboxic and anoxic zones bertelkamp et al 2016 bai et al 2019 the aerobic zone commonly referred to as the first meter of infiltration is the most active biochemical reaction zone where the greatest attenuation of omps is observed hollender et al 2018 omps can be removed via various mechanisms including microbial biodegradation adsorption phytodegradation hydrolysis and volatilization in rbf of which microbial biodegradation is generally recognized as the most important mechanism hamann et al 2016 bertelkamp et al 2014 zhao et al 2022 ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom include ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and comammox the presence of aob and aoa in rbf has been reported junier et al 2010 zuo et al 2021 but not comammox yet based on the reports of comammox s presences in both aquifer and drinking water system fowler et al 2018 wang et al 2017 it is reasonable to speculate that comammox would be present in rbf it is generally accepted that aoa and comammox are dominant over aob under low nh4 and oligotrophic conditions kits et al 2017 hence we hypothesize that the aom in rbf system would be dominated by comammox and aoa it has been widely reported that aom are closely related to omps degradation in wastewater treatment plants wwtp or in pure culture studies xu et al 2017 kassotaki et al 2016 rattier

oxidation and demethylation and comammox hydroxylation demethylation and demethylthioation but not by aob zhou et al 2021 these findings suggests that the ability efficiency and reaction type during omps degradation of aoa aob and comammox could be different the variations may be attributed to their different ammonia affinities e g aoa aob comammox many aoa and aob ammonia conversion pathway i e aob and aoa oxide ammonia to nitrite while comammox oxides ammonia to nitrate and enzymatic repertoires e g aob and comammox induce hydroxylamine oxidoreductase but aoa may not only comammox generate nitrite oxidoreductase zhou et al 2019 stein 2019 men et al 2016 kits et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 since aom niche can be affected by nh4 concentration the observed omps degradations by aom in high nh4 concentration wwtp may be not applicable in low nh4 concentration rbf systems limpiyakorn et al 2011 covatti and grischek 2021 to better understand manage and enhance omps degradation in rbf system it is highly necessary to explore the aom niche and their role in omps degradation in this study 128 omps with a high detection frequency in surface water were selected as targets the removal of these selected omps was studied via batch tests and a series of one meter sand columns simulating the first meter infiltration of the rbf the abundances of bacteria archaea and aom were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the role of aom in the degradation of omps was explored by running the columns with and without inhibiting aom with atu the correlations between the inhibition ratio and physiochemical properties of omps including log p molecular weight mw and the type and quantity of nitrogen containing functional groups were determined based on the data set 2

approximately 0 25 l d which corresponded to the 36 h residence time estimated using the kbr tracer experiment after a 6 month microbial cultivation period 5 g of sand from the bottom inlet sand and top outlet sand of each column were collected and stored at 80 c for dna extraction an 82 day omp exposure experiment was subsequently conducted the feed water was refreshed weekly and 128 omps 100 ng l of each were added the feed water was then filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters before weekly refreshing to avoid the attenuation of omps in inlet flasks two control columns c ctrl 1 and c ctrl 2 were used to determine the removal efficiency of the omps the continuous addition of 5 mg l of atu inhibitor of aom to the feed water of the two treatment columns c tret 1 and c tret 2 was used to explore the effect of inhibiting aom on the removal of omps the concentrations of the influent omps were determined by measuring at three time points in the first week t 1 4 and 7 days and then randomly six times in the following 75 days the concentrations of the effluent omps were measured at 23 different time points over three months t 1 2 3 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 and 82 days 2 3 batch experiments to estimate the contribution of sand adsorption to the removal of omps a triple parallel batch test was performed control tests were assembled in brown flasks with 800 ml ultrapure water

9 1 http qiime org the sequences were clustered with operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity level of 97 based on the otu data parameters reflecting the abundance and diversity of the microbial community were calculated including chao ace shannon and simpson indices and coverage 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and soil microbial community the do concentration decreased from 6 mg l in influents to 2 3 mg l in effluents during the 82 day omp exposure experiment fig s1 meanwhile the doc decreased from 6 mg l in the influent to approximately 4 mg l in the effluents during the exposure experiment fig s1 the relatively steady do consumption 50 66 and doc removal 33 implied that stable microbial ecology and bioactivity were established in the columns bertelkamp et al 2014 for both do and doc no significant differences were observed between the control and treatment columns cctrl 1 2 vs ctret 1 2 suggesting the high reliability and reproducibility of the present study in terms of the soil microbial communities the shannon index of inlet sand was significantly lower than that of outlet sand t test p 0 03 among the columns the bray curtis distance revealed that although the bacterial communities of inlet sand were significantly different the outlet sand became similar pcoa fig s2 within each column the stamp analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community composition of inlet sand was clearly different from that of outlet sand welch s t test p 0 05 fig s3 as shown in table 1 by the end of the column experiment phase 1 the abundance of bacteria decreased significantly from 1 8 108 copies g at inlet sand to 6 2 8 7 106 copies g at outlet sand in both the control and treatment columns p 0 001 in contrast the abundance of archaea increased from 4 5 105 copies g in inlet sand to 9 2 106 copies g in outlet sand in c ctrl 1 2 which remained stable from inlet sand to outlet sand in c tret 1 2 the relative abundance of archaea increased along with the infiltration distance from 0 5 to 11 7 indicating that archaea and their associated functions would be non negligible interestingly independent of the changes in bacteria and archaea the aob maintained stable abundances across c ctrl 1 2 and c tret 1 2 aoa increased significantly from inlet sand to outlet sand while the comammox decreased significantly from inlet sand to outlet sand in both groups in the inlet sand the aoa aom aoa aob comammox ratio and comammox aom ratio were 23 72 and 23 64 while aob only counted 5 13 suggesting aoa and comammox are dominators of aom in the outlet sand aoa counted 94 4 96 7 and dominated aom it is clear that aom are dominated by aoa and comammox which can be explained by aoa and comammox being more suitable than aob for oligotrophic low ammonium environments leininger et al 2006 liu et al 2011 straka et al 2019 sakoula et al 2021 in all the relative abundance of aom increased from 0 1 0 2 inlet sand to 5 3 5 9 outlet sand in phase 2 the abundance of bacteria archaea and aoa in the inlet sand and outlet sand of each column declined compared with that of phase 1 table 1 the decreases of bacteria and archaea might be due to the introduction of the 0 45 μm membrane pre filtration of feed water in phase 2 that reduced particulate organic matter and prevented the degradation of omps before entering the columns diem et al 2013 additionally the addition of omps might also inhibit bacteria and archaea since aoa are autotrophic microbes whose decreases in cctrl1 2 could be attributed the inhibition effect of omps e g antibiotic zhao et al 2022 as for the effect of atu addition on aom aob and comammox amoa genes abundances kept stable in the inlet sand of c ctrl1 2 table 1 while decreased 22 and 75 in the c tret1 2 suggesting the inhibition effect of atu on them notably aoa amoa genes abundances decreased 54 in c ctrl1 2 while decreased 86 in c tret1 2 more decline occurred in c tret1 2 could be attributed to the addition of atu the aom amoa genes abundances kept stable in the inlet sand of c ctrl1 2 while significantly decreased 78 in the c tret 1 2 providing strong evidence that the addition of atu could inhibit aom though atu has been widely recognized and used as aom inhibitor for investigating the role of aom in omps biotransformation yan et al 2022 rattier et al 2014 srithep et al 2018 tran et al 2014 vandevivere et al 1998 some studies found atu is a non specific ammonia oxidation inhibitor by comparing with octyne men et al 2017 octyne can inhibit aob but not aoa taylor et al 2013 while the degradation of omps by aoa strains is non negligible e g aoa exhibited the best removals of lincomycin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin followed by comammox and aob zhou et al 2021 since aoa were the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the simulated rbf atu was chosen as aom inhibitor in this study it should be mentioned that atu is not an exclusive aom inhibitor men et al 2017 therefore though this is currently the best we could achieve there is a chance that the observed decrease in omps removal caused by adding atu might not be completely resulted from aom inhibition 3 2 efficiency and mechanism of omp removal the recoveries of the 128 omps ranged from 52 to 145 table s5 no significant difference t test p 0 05 was found in the performance of duplicate columns c ctrl 1 vs c ctrl 2 c tret 1 vs c tret 2 during the 82 day operation indicating the high reproducibility and reliability of this study the data of duplicate columns were merged as a control group c ctrl 1 2 and a treatment group c tret 1 2 for the following discussion the removal efficiencies of the 128 omps over an 82 day experiment are presented in fig 2 in general 31 omps were completely removed and 87 omps were partially removed 51 omps 70 19 omps 30 70 suggesting that the simulated first meter of rbf is indeed an effective barrier for most omps atenolol caffeine trimethoprim and gemfibrozil were removed to a great extent 94 which is similar to the observations in the field rbf sites hollender et al 2018 regnery et al 2015 huntscha et al 2013 despite being highly effective for most omps 10 omps such as sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and atenolol acid broke through the simulated columns and were not removed at all possibly due to the physicochemical properties of the omps bertelkamp et al 2014 as presented in fig s4 the omp removal efficiency was positively correlated with log p and mw but negatively correlated with secondary amides sulfonamides ketimines benzyls and amines the secondary sulfonamides were the strongest negatively correlated functional groups this result complied with previous findings of persistent behaviors of sulfonamides in simulated and field rbf studies bertelkamp et al 2014 hamann et al 2016 this was especially true for sulfamethoxazole which was not removed in this experiment conflicting results have been obtained from batch tests only adsorption and column studies adsorption and biodegradation for several omps specifically five omps with 8 48 removal in the batch tests were hardly removed in the column study such as pirimicarb sulfamethazine and ritonavir fig s5 this is because the sand adsorbed these omps in the short term batch tests however such non degradable omps broke through sand columns and demonstrated persistent behavior in the long term study in contrast 32 omps that were partially or completely removed in the column study including nadolol and lidocaine were not removed in the batch test fig s6 suggesting that these omps can be removed by biodegradation or biosorption in other words these 32 omps could only be removed by active microorganisms thereby emphasizing the key role of microorganisms in the removal of omps biosorption has been reported to play a negligible role in the removal of omps whereas biodegradation is commonly accepted as the most important mechanism for the removal of omps bai et al 2019 bertelkamp et al 2014 huntscha et al 2013 the correlation between the removal of 32 omps and their physicochemical properties demonstrated that mw and log p were positively correlated with the removal efficiencies whereas secondary amides secondary sulfonamides secondary ketimines benzyls and primary amines were negatively correlated with the removal efficiencies fig s7 tertiary amides secondary ketimines secondary sulfonamides and tertiary sulfonamides are likely to be most hard degradable functional groups followed by secondary amides benzyl olefinic bond and phenyl fig s8 interestingly with an increase in exposure time the removal efficiency of 28 omps increased fig s9 which might be due to genetic changes enzyme induction and microbial composition changes bertelkamp et al 2016 in contrast the removal efficiency of 15 omps decreased indicating the possible occurrence of adsorption saturation which further implies the refractory biodegradation of these omps notably eight identical omps e g gemfibrozil norfloxacin and clofibric acid were observed in 32 omps only removed by active microorganisms and 28 omps with increased removal efficiencies suggesting the sustainability and potential growth of biodegradation in omps removal 3 3 the effects of aom on omp removal the inhibition of aom significantly decreased the removal efficiency of 32 128 selected omps fig 3 a as presented in fig 3 b the degradation of five omps namely isoprocarb phenacetin methomyl tolbutamide and 2 3 5 trimethacarb was nearly completely inhibited these omps were hardly removed by sand adsorption during the batch tests this suggests a key role of aom in the removal of certain groups of omps in the simulated first meter of rbf however the other 13 omps e g lidocaine and lincomycin that could not be removed by sand adsorption were removed by up to 40 100 by columns via biodegradation the addition of atu decreased the removal efficiency by 2 71 thereby indicating that these 13 omps might be degraded not only by aom but also by other microorganisms for example heterotrophic microorganisms have been reported to degrade ee2 atenolol and trimethoprim via co metabolism kennes veiga et al 2021 gusseme et al 2009 xu et al 2017 moreover for 14 other omps e g repaglinide atenolol and difloxacin it was observed that both sand adsorption 2 96 removed and aom 2 65 inhibited by atu contributed to their degradation while it is unclear whether heterotrophic bacteria play a role in this process aom could make negligible or major contribution to the removal of omp due to the existences of adsorption and heterotrophic microorganisms degradation which is depend on the type of omp among the 32 aom degradable omps in the present study only the degradation of lincomycin clindamycin gemfibrozil and atenolol transformation by aom have been documented previously the mechanism of which were attributed to the reaction of hydroxylation and primary amide hydrolysis induced by the non specific enzyme of ammonia monooxygenase amo fernandez fontaina et al 2012 rattier et al 2014 xu et al 2017 helbling et al 2012 men et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 besides the hydroxylamine intermediate of ammonia oxidation could react with lincomycin and achieve 90 removal zhou et al 2021 and the hno2 and no may also contribute to the biotransformation of omps yu et al 2018 it should be noted that the above mentioned omps degradation via amo and hydroxylamine were observed in nitrifying activated sludge and aom pure culture since the matrix of organic matter and community of microbes are different the specific omps degradation in the simulated rbf system of the present study might be not exactly the same which deserves further research moreover sulfamethoxazole and naproxen which were classified as non degradable in the present study were reported to be degradable by aom in aob dominated high ammonium eutrophic systems kassotaki et al 2016 fernandez fontaina et al 2016 it might be reasonable to hypothesis that sulfamethoxazole and naproxen could be degraded by aob but not aoa and comammox nonetheless this hypothesis is inconsistent with previous pure culture study which found both aoa and comammox can degradate sulfamethoxazole zhou et al 2019 the contradictory observation in the present study might be attributed to complex bacterial community and different environmental conditions which may lead to insufficient abundances of aoa and comammox for degrading sulfamethoxazole or there were microorganisms and or environmental factors suppressed such function differently it is observed that sotalol was degradable by aom in the present study which was not degraded in nitrification enrichment culture sathyamoorthy et al 2013 this might be attributed to the stronger omp degradation capability of amo associated with comammox for example carbendazim can be degraded by comammox but not aoa or aob han et al 2019 in general the observed variations in omps degradation performances of the three ammonia oxidizers could be caused by differences in either microbial community or water quality of the targeted system further study in controllable conditions is needed and highly recommended to explore the mechanisms and differences of omps transformation by aoa aob and comammox 3 4 key factors affecting the co metabolism potential of aom on omps the inhibition ratio y was defined to assess the contribution of aom to the degradation of omps y x 100 1 x s removal in c tret x s removal in c ctrl where x one omp y x the contribution ratio of aom on the removal of x as presented in fig 4 the removal efficiencies of omps in both the batch tests re batch and column studies re column were negatively correlated with the inhibition ratio indicating that aom plays a remarkable role in the degradation of the difficult to remove omps the inhibition ratio was also negatively correlated with mw suggesting that aom tends to remove omps with lower mw additionally the inhibition ratio was positively correlated with log p 32 omps fig 4 indicating that omps with higher log p values tend to be removed by aom notably log p was negatively correlated with the removal efficiency of 32 omps fig 4 but positively correlated with the removal efficiency of 128 omps fig s4 these conflicting observations may be related to the differences in the log p ranges 128 omps 1 5 to 6 vs 32 omps 0 to 3 5 fig s10 in terms of functional groups positive correlations were observed between the inhibition ratio and secondary amides benzyls secondary sulfonamides and secondary ketimines fig 4 secondary amides and benzyls are the two most strongly positively correlated functional groups the co metabolism of omps containing amides by aom has been reported in wastewater treatment plants where atenolol is biotransformed to atenolol acid through primary amide hydrolysis by aob helbling et al 2012 xu et al 2017 and lincomycin with secondary amide is biodegraded by aom zhou et al 2021 it is reasonable to hypothesize that hydrolysis of primary and or secondary amides by aom might occur for the 16 omps containing amides e g atenolol lincomycin and isoprocarb in addition 4 8 of the benzyl containing omps did not contain nitrogen functional groups i e secondary amides and secondary sulfonamides implying that the strong positive correlation between benzyls and the inhibition ratio may be attributed to ammonia monooxygenase mediated ch hydroxylation of aliphatic compounds su et al 2021 interestingly among the 13 128 omps containing tertiary amide groups only the degradation of zolpidem which contains both tertiary amides and benzyls was inhibited hence the inhibition of zolpidem degradation was due to benzyls rather than tertiary amides suggesting that the co metabolism of aom could not act on tertiary amides the observed positive correlation between the inhibition ratio and secondary sulfonamides complied with previous findings of the degradation of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole containing secondary sulfonamides by aob in wastewater treatment processes wang et al 2019 kassotaki et al 2016 meanwhile the removal of sildenafil containing tertiary sulfonamides not containing secondary amides benzyls and secondary sulfonamides was not inhibited suggesting that tertiary sulfonamides may not be transformed by aom overall the ability of certain omps to be co metabolically degraded by aom is largely determined by their physicochemical properties more specifically omps with lower mw containing primary amide benzyl secondary amide and secondary sulfonamide groups are more likely to be degraded by aom 3 5 environmental relevance and implications recently there has been an increasing concern regarding the presence and potential risk of omps in urban water system especially in drinking water hollender et al 2018 kondor et al 2020 li et al 2021 it is an urgent need to develop green and effective barrier that can remove target omps while avoid generation of byproducts with low additional cost this study focuses on nature based rbf system and its omps biodegradation mechanism though it has been widely observed that rbf performed well regarding omps removal through biodegradation such bio process remains poorly documented which hampered the application and improvements of omps removal in drinking water systems bertelkamp et al 2014 hamann et al 2016 kondor et al 2020 this work determined the removal efficiencies of 128 omps in the simulated first meter of rbf of which 82 omps were 70 highlighting the important role of the oxic zone combined the results from the column and batch experiments it can be concluded that the removals of 32 omps were entirely accomplished via biodegradation suggesting a critical contribution of biodegradation on omps removal in rbf for those omps the observed correlations between omps functional groups and their corresponding biodegradation potential are valuable for predicting the fate of omps in rbf interestingly the removal efficiency of 28 omps increased with exposure time indicating there might be adaption time needed for biofiltration to remove omps the role of aom in omps biodegradation was studied by atu inhibition experiments which showed the omps biodegradation is achieved by both aom and non aom microbes considering the functional groups aom tend to degrade omps containing primary amide benzyl secondary amide and secondary sulfonamide the finding sheds new light on the correlation between physiochemical properties of omps and their aom co metabolic potential based on which prediction could be made when new omps present in source water on this basis the omps removal could be enhanced and necessary subsequent treatments can be adjusted to minimize the risk of new omps the mechanism of omps transformation by aom might be different among water systems such as wwtps wetlands and rbf however the obtained knowledge about the functional groups of omps and their aom co metabolic potential may be helpful for understanding the omps degradation in other water systems it should be noted that the activities of aoa aob and comammox were simultaneously inhibited by atu in this study which might also inhibit other enzymes to explore the specific contribution of each aom precisely strategies should be developed for inhibiting the microbes separately and exclusively 4 conclusions based on the simulated first meter infiltration of rbf in this study it can be concluded that most of the omps were effectively removed among the 128 omps the removal efficiencies of 82 omps were above 70 31 omps were completely removed 15 omps were 30 70 and 31 omps were below 30 10 omps were not removed at all biodegradation was the most important factor followed by adsorption inefficiently removed omps tended to have low mw low log p and contain secondary amide sulfonamide ketimine and benzyl groups the relative abundance of aom increased with infiltration distance from 0 2 to 5 9 in which aoa accounted for 23 72 inlet sand to 97 outlet sand comammox accounted for 1 outlet sand to 23 64 inlet sand the abundances of aom amoa genes decreased 78 suggesting the inhibition effects of atu on aom aom play an important role in this process inhibiting aom suppressed the degradation of 32 omps five of which were almost completely inhibited omps with low mw and containing primary amide secondary amide secondary sulfonamide and benzyl groups are more likely to be removed by aom

15378,treatment and reuse of some produced waters is made difficult due to their hypersalinity high concentrations of myriad other dissolved and suspended components specialized technology requirements modularity portability and short residence times and lack of existing information on their processing in this work produced water containing 100 000 mg l total dissolved solids from the permian basin was coagulated with aluminum chlorohydrate ach and flocculated with an anionic high molecular weight organic polymer prior to dissolved air flotation daf and sedimentation to reduce turbidity to 4 ntu and iron 0 8 mg l 95 removal in both cases with a total coagulation flocculation sedimentation flotation residence time of only 5 min two advantages of daf over sedimentation were noted i daf required only half the dosage of the pre hydrolyzed ach coagulant to remove 90 of turbidity and iron even without the organic polymeric flocculant and ii daf even operated successfully without ach coagulation i e using only the organic polymeric flocculant evidencing its lower chemical dosing needs further daf attained all water quality and operational goals at a recycle ratio of only 12 demonstrating that it outperformed sedimentation to generate clean brine at relatively reduced excess energies necessary for air saturation higher daf recycle ratios reduced turbidity and iron removal possibly due to floc breakage colloids were effectively destabilized by double layer compression due to high water salinity charge neutralization via adsorption of al13 polycations and enmeshment precipitation of amorphous aluminum they were flocculated via interparticle bridging by the anionic organic polymeric flocculant to create large compact flocs facilitating ultrashort

the united states generating 10 million barrels 1 6 x 109 l of produced water daily hu et al 2022 scanlon et al 2017 environmental social and governance objectives of oil and gas operators motivate the development of cost effective produced water management technologies to reduce their reliance on freshwater decrease subsurface injection volumes enable its beneficial reuse and alleviate environmental and geologic concerns cooper et al 2022 hu et al 2022 however several bottlenecks need to be overcome to successfully remove suspended solids turbidity and iron from produced water to generate clean brine for recycle scanlon et al 2017 chief amongst them is that produced water from unconventional oil and gas operations contains myriad chemical additives metals including iron geogenic colloids organics along with high concentrations of suspended solids and salts and its composition can vary widely spatiotemporally conrad et al 2020 cooper et al 2022 emmons et al 2022 scanlon et al 2017 robust technologies capable of removing suspended solids and iron from such hypersaline matrices of complex composition have not yet been rigorously evaluated nor have they been compared additionally process intensification requires modular portable treatment plants demanding very high treatment rates 16 24 m3 min for high volumes 80 000 m3 well necessitating ultrashort residence times we hypothesize that produced water s extremely high salt concentrations and operators need for ultrashort processing times preclude direct application of gravity separations design criteria originally developed for municipal water and wastewater treatment necessitating systematic optimization of liquid solid separation technologies applicable to salt concentrations 100 g l this is the primary novelty of our research to date only limited mechanistic information has been generated on the ability of coagulation flocculation sedimentation to clarify hypersaline produced water chorghe et al 2017 nadella et al 2020 rosenblum et al 2016 sari and chellam 2015 dissolved air flotation daf is an alternative liquid solid separation process that can increase the clarification rate use lower amounts of coagulant and concomitantly generate lower volumes of sludge edzwald 2010 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 younker and walsh 2014 making it potentially attractive for oilfield applications however high salinity reduces air saturation as well as the mobility of bubbles and flocs necessitating greater recycle ratios or saturation pressures which increase daf operating costs fanaie and khiadani 2020 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 jiménez et al 2017 rajapakse et al 2022 to date only one peer reviewed publication is available for daf for produced water which considered a sample with salinity similar to seawater used 30 min total residence time and considered removal of oil and grease and dissolved aromatics without providing mechanistic insights younker and walsh 2014 hence daf mechanisms need to be elucidated and process conditions need rigorous optimization for side by side comparison with sedimentation for treating hypersaline produced water to remove colloids and iron the overarching goals of this research targeted towards treatment of highly saline produced water are to 1 develop gravity separation processes with ultrashort residence times and low footprint that are portable and applicable for decentralized treatment and 2 methodically evaluate daf for liquid solid separation and compare it to sedimentation providing an alternative technology for field scale implementation we employ a pre hydrolyzed coagulant aluminum chlorohydrate ach in conjunction with an organic polymeric flocculant to achieve our process engineering goals ach was chosen because it consumes less alkalinity and produces lower sludge volumes than conventional metal ion coagulants such as alum gregory and dupont 2001 wang et al 2008 thus benefitting onsite implementation in remote locations such as the permian basin and it has not yet been mechanistically evaluated for treating produced water adding to the novelty of our work specific objectives are to 1 engineer flotation and sedimentation to reduce turbidity to 4 ntu and iron to 1 mg l 95 removal in both cases within a total coagulation flocculation clarification time of only 5 min for produced water and 2 elucidate underlying treatment mechanisms including coagulation relevant to this hypersaline matrix this manuscript is the first implementation of daf to hypersaline wastewater in the peer reviewed literature additionally we developed daf and sedimentation with ultrashort residence times by using ach as a coagulant and coupling it with an organic polymeric flocculant further this is the first identification of the al13 polycation in produced water along with a rigorous description of associated destabilization aggregation mechanisms daf and sedimentation were individually optimized by adjusting chemical dosing and operational parameters to maximize turbidity and iron removal and minimize residence time their relative performance in a hypersaline matrix was systematically compared for the first time and flocs were comprehensively characterized 2 materials and methods 2 1 produced water sample and chemicals used in experiments produced water was sampled from the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in the texas permian basin individual wells average 3000 m in depth and spanned a few months to several years in age produced water samples were acidified to ph 5 using hcl and stored immediately upon receipt at 4 c an organic free synthetic solution of 107 000 mg l nacl was prepared to mimic the total dissolved solids tds and specific gravity of produced water which was used in control experiments and in the air saturator ach was obtained from g2o technologies little rock arkansas ach is a polyaluminum chloride pacl that pre neutralizes h ions formed by hydrolysis

prehydrolyzed nature and high basicity substantially reduces the need for external base addition to maintain coagulation ph making it more attractive for field application especially in remote

allowed to settle in b ker2 jars daf was conducted using a platypustm bench scale system microfloc australia including jars connected to the saturator via the manifold port with tubing in turn connected to a compressed air cylinder before each experiment the daf saturator was thoroughly flushed to remove salt residues then filled with nacl solution of the same tds as the produced water sample and ph matching that of the designated experiment the saturator pressure 586 kpa 85 psi and saturation time 15 min were fixed for all experiments rapid mixing and flocculation intensities were always 600 s 1 and 30 s 1 respectively rapid mixing was performed for 1 min in all cases whereas slow mixing durations necessary to attain stated water quality goals changed with polymer dosage five minutes were necessary when using ach with little or no 2 mg l organic polymeric flocculant this reduced to only one minute when 2 mg l organic polymeric flocculant was added at the onset of rapid mixing ph was adjusted using naoh and chlorine was added to catalyze iron oxidation and inactivate microorganisms after which ach was added the target free chlorine residual at the end of the experiment was 2 0 2 mg l when needed the organic polymeric flocculant was added 30 s before the end of rapid mixing after flocculation flocs were carefully transferred using wide cut 10 ml pipette tips to avoid breakage johnson et al 1996 nadella et al 2020 and analyzed immediately for size and morphology section 2 3 then flocs were allowed to settle during conventional jar tests or air

vahedi and gorczyca 2011 settling velocity was measured using a quiescent sedimentation column and video analysis x ray diffractograms of flocs were obtained after suspending them in ultrapure water and repeated washing centrifugation to minimize interferences from produced water components flocs were analyzed for their zeta potential litesizer 500 anton paar surface functionalities atr ftir and elemental composition eds and xps survey scans detailed information on functional groups bonding and elemental state were obtained from xps high resolution scans tga was performed to directly evidence organic polymeric flocculant sorption on flocs si section s3 table s1 and fig s3 contain analytical details 3 results and discussion 3 1 produced water physicochemical characteristics as summarized in table 1 the produced water sample was hypersaline tds 107 000 mg l dominated by sodium chloride and consequently was 8 denser than freshwater it had high concentrations of total suspended solids tss 134 mg l and 78 ntu turbidity doc 104 mg c l divalent ions 1461 mg l calcium 189 mg l magnesium 952 mg l strontium and 93 mg l sulfate boron 85 mg b l and 16 mg l of iron like other permian basin produced water samples hu et al 2022 nadella et al 2020 the sample was also nanofiltered nf270 dow to reduce its intense chloride signal and the filtered materials were surveyed via xps chorghe et al 2017 sari and chellam 2015 revealing carbon and oxygen as major elements along with sulfur calcium magnesium sodium silicon iron strontium barium boron and residual chlorine si table s2 qualitatively validating the presence of these constituents in table 1 additionally the infrared spectrum of the produced water red curve in fig s9 exhibited bands associated with νs b o 987 cm 1 νsi o si o si 1077

3404 cm 1 reinforcing xps results and the presence of organics in produced water 3 2 process engineering of daf and sedimentation to remove turbidity and iron 3 2 1 evidence for iron oxidation and sweep coagulation during rapid mixing first two negative control experiments were performed where no chemicals were added to study physical separation in the first one the produced water was simply stirred and allowed to settle which removed 5 turbidity and iron in the second control produced water was introduced into the daf unit and bubbles were injected which removed 30 turbidity and iron next another set of two negative control experiments were conducted by simply adjusting the ph of the produced water to 7 5 and adding chlorine i e no coagulant and flocculant were added neither suspended solids nor iron were appreciably removed via sedimentation even after 15 min but 60 of turbidity and iron subnantant concentrations of 30 ntu and 6 mg l respectively were removed in daf in only 3 min bright field microscopy fig 1 a revealed flocs were small 20 µm and highly porous fractal dimension 1 4 and consequently not settleable but floatable validating turbidity and iron removal by daf and not sedimentation in this control experiment eds fig 1b of these aggregates revealed iron as one of their major constituents arising from chlorine catalyzed oxidation of fe ii inherently present in the produced water cheng et al 2017 lytle et al 2004 and consistent with their reddish brown color residual fe ii concentrations were below detection limits of colorimetric testing 0 02 mg l demonstrating near complete iron oxidation and successful removal more evidence for iron oxidation are provided in si section s8 and fig s11 after adding ach portions of the flocs were translucent with low contrast typical of aluminum precipitates jarvis et al 2008 yu et al 2015 which encompassed abovementioned reddish brown solids fig 1c correspondingly eds fig 1d reflected flocs rich in aluminum and iron symptomatic of successful sweep coagulation and iron enmeshment 3 2 2 optimizing process conditions without organic polymeric flocculant gravity separation efficacies were initially optimized by monitoring residual turbidity and iron at 12 daf recycle ratio 40 0 ach dosage 75 mg al l and 6 5 ph 8 5 the sedimentation and flotation times were set at five and three minutes respectively first lower daf recycle ratios 12 improved subnatant turbidity and iron fig 2 a and b unlike what was recommended for seawater oil in water emulsions and synthetic produced water haarhoff and edzwald 2013 jiménez et al 2017 shutova et al 2016 zouboulis and avranas 2000 this is potentially due to shear induced breakage of relatively fragile flocs associated with pre hydrolyzed coagulants such as ach duan and gregory 2003 miranda et al 2020 when bubbles were released at high pressure anderson maia et al 2015 jarvis et al 2008 jiménez et al 2017 wang et al 2018 as explored in section 3 2 4 second for sedimentation supernatant turbidity and iron concentrations declined as more ach was dosed black symbols in fig 2c and d but reductions were negligible beyond 50 mg al l the optimal dose noted by a black arrow remaining at 16 ntu and 2 3 mg l respectively even at 75 mg al l analogously the optimal ach dose for daf red arrow was selected as 25 mg al l since subnatant turbidity and iron remained at 13 ntu and 2 1 mg l respectively even for higher ach doses red symbols in fig 2c and d hence daf attained similar turbidity and iron levels as sedimentation but at half the ach concentration and at 66 higher clarification rate 3 min for flotation compared with 5 min for sedimentation edzwald 2010 jiménez et al 2017 these results support previous studies emphasizing the lower coagulant dose requirements for daf to maintain appropriate floc bubble ratio edzwald 2010 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 this was also reflected in terms of doc removal 25 30 removal for daf compared to 15 20 for sedimentation owing to the hydrophobic nature of bubbles that facilitated organics removal during flotation al shamrani et al 2002 gamage and chellam 2014 younker and walsh 2014 the optimized ach doses for daf 25 mg al l and sedimentation 50 mg al l for the hypersaline sample are in the same range as the alum dose we reported earlier 40 mg al l to treat produced waters with significantly lower tds and iron content chorghe et al 2017 validating its choice in this research as seen in fig 2e and f ph 7 5 was suitable for both clarification processes corroborating earlier studies with preformed polymeric aluminum species lin et al 2008 yan et al 2008 larger 90 µm more settleable 0 5 mm s flocs were formed at alkaline ph compared with ph 6 5 only 50 µm in diameter and settling at 0 3 mm s explaining these results si fig s4 these observations are consistent with al13 being more protonated at acidic conditions an et al 2021 and the presence of positively charged flocs as shown later in fig 7b poor flotation at ph 6 5 is a consequence of the formation of smaller flocs but at higher number concentrations even outnumbering bubbles in daf haarhoff and edzwald 2013 lin et al 2008 hence ph was fixed at 7 5 for both sedimentation and daf black and red arrows respectively since it was closer to the produced water s native ph i e less chemical addition hence daf outperformed sedimentation needing only half the ach dose and shorter flotation duration corroborating previous studies favoring daf against sedimentation for seawater and freshwater edzwald 2010 fanaie and khiadani 2020 however daf is more energy intensive than sedimentation but using only 12 recycle ratio reduces the excess energy needed for air saturation edzwald and haarhoff 2011 zabel 1992 3 2 3 using an organic polymeric flocculant facilitated ultrashort separation times adding 2 mg l organic polymeric flocculant at optimized conditions of ach dosage ph and daf recycle ratio further reduced turbidity and iron to 4 ntu and 0 8 mg l respectively representing 95 removal of both constituents fig 3 importantly floc growth was accelerated at higher organic polymeric flocculant concentrations allowing us to reduce flocculation time to only 1 min instead of 5 min for all other experiments larger flocs were formed in the presence of the organic polymeric flocculant as seen in fig 1g exhibiting both translucent and reddish brown features correspondingly flocs were rich in aluminum and iron and even richer in carbon fig 1h compared to fig 1b suggesting adsorption of the organic polymeric flocculant additionally phase separation was excellent in only 3 min for sedimentation thereby necessitating a total residence time of only 5 min including coagulation and flocculation identical to daf another control experiment was performed to compare both clarification methods by adding 5 mg l organic polymeric flocculant after adjusting the produced water ph to 7 5 and adding chlorine but no ach this evaluated the ability of the organic polymeric flocculant to remove solids and iron even in the absence of the metal ion coagulant turbidity and iron were removed to 90 for daf in 3 min and only 75 for sedimentation in 5 min demonstrating better daf performance significantly larger flocs 270 µm were formed in this experiment fig 1e whose eds spectrum fig 1f like fig 1h was again rich in iron and carbon indicating the organic polymeric flocculant s ability to aggregate particulate iron efficient removal of suspended solids by daf using only an organic polymeric flocculant demonstrates that this technology can be operated successfully to treat produced water even without adding a metal ion coagulant 3 2 4 elucidating daf bubble floc interactions we evaluated potential mechanisms underlying process engineering results described in sections 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 subnatant aluminum concentrations were measured to represent coagulant residues remaining in the daf reactor i e those that did not attach to bubbles and float to the top fig 4 the produced water itself had negligible aluminum 0 1 mg l table 1 allowing us to assign the measured values to leftover coagulant after flotation as seen in fig 4 low residual aluminum concentrations were measured under the same optimal conditions and trends for turbidity and iron removal identified in figs 2 and 3 for example residual aluminum concentrations increased with recycle ratio in fig 4a even as more bubbles were introduced at higher recycle ratios indicative of poor attachment of flocs to bubbles and subsequent flotation these results are consistent with floc breakage at higher turbulence intensities when saturated water is recycled al shamrani et al 2002 anderson maia et al 2015 gonzalez galvis and narbaitz 2020 jiménez et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in turn increasing the floc bubble ratio thereby worsening daf performance edzwald 2010 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 adding 1 mg l of the organic polymeric flocculant also reduced residual aluminum concentrations in the harvested subnantant samples fig 4d potentially due to formation of stronger flocs bolto and gregory 2007 moreover residual aluminum levels were higher when ach dosage was 25 mg al l fig 4b and at ph 6 5 fig 4 c corroborating the higher floc number concentrations and unfavorable floc bubble ratios under these non optimal conditions which worsen daf performance haarhoff and edzwald 2013 lin et al 2008 further floc size decreased with increasing recycle ratio as shown in si fig s5 which was attributed to higher shear exerted by bubbles for example with only ach as coagulant but no organic polymeric flocculant aid black symbols at 40 recycle ratio flocs decreased in size by more than 50 compared to floc sizes exposed to white water i e 0 recycle ratio in si fig s5 similar results were obtained even for flocs formed with ach coagulant and organic polymeric flocculant red symbols even after breakage at 40 recycle ratio rightmost red circle these flocs were comparable in size to the initial floc size for the experiments with ach alone where no organic polymeric flocculant aid was added hence higher recycle ratios negated the advantage of size enhancement arising from adding the organic polymeric flocculant these measurements demonstrate the negative consequences of operating at higher recycle ratios that diminished floc sizes thereby increasing their residual number concentration and reducing overall process performance in terms of solids removal 3 2 5 removal of other produced water components even though our principal focus was to remove suspended solids and iron with ultrashort residence times we also obtained information on behavior of other produced water constituents si table s2 survey scans of the treated produced water confirmed uptake of numerous metals boron strontium barium calcium sodium magnesium as well as silicon chlorine and sulfur onto flocs as validated by eds fig 1 scans of flocs with organic polymeric flocculant and ach reflected a slight enrichment of aluminum iron and boron validating the organic polymeric flocculant s role in enhancing removal efficiencies and reducing residual aluminum section 3 2 these observations were further validated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry that showed high removals of magnesium 65 silicon 54 calcium 67 potassium 55 strontium 52 and barium 88 along with 20 boron under optimized operating conditions finally daf removed slightly more doc 25 30 compared to sedimentation 15 20 attributed to the hydrophobic nature of air bubbles hence daf and sedimentation removed several scale forming components divalent ions and silicon along with suspended solids and iron which can alleviate fouling during desalination and beneficial reuse conrad et al 2020 cooper et al 2022 hu et al 2022 3 3 polymorphs of aluminum precipitates a noisy baseline in flocs x ray diffractograms fig 5 suggests the formation of largely amorphous aluminum precipitates symptomatic of coagulation flocculation processes berkowitz et al 2005 even though flocs were extensively washed centrifuged strong signals of halite nacl 111 200 202 calcite caco3 102 104 110 113 202 211 300 quartz sio2 100 101 112 301 anhydrite caso4 020 031 400 and hematite fe2o3 104 116 were obtained this demonstrates the ability of ach to remove scale forming constituents calcium silica sulfates importantly hematite was also identified shon et al 2009 confirming iron enmeshment these observations partially explain the absence of highly ordered aluminum phases since sorption of these and other produced water components including organic matter retards crystallization beyrouty et al 1984 masion et al 2000 nevertheless a weak signal near 8 appeared fig 5 inset characteristic of al13 species that are generated when using pre formed aluminum bottero et al 1990 lin et al 2009 3 4 organic polymeric flocculant s mechanistic role on ultrashort clarification times 3 4 1 organic polymeric flocculant formed larger and more compact flocs bright field optical microscope images of flocs collected at the end of the slow mixing period qualitatively revealed that they grew bigger with increasing organic polymeric flocculant dosage si fig s6a e for sedimentation and si fig 6 f j for daf electron micrographs revealed rougher surfaces and larger flocs formed upon organic polymeric flocculant addition as shown in si section s4 and fig s7 two dimensional fractal dimensions of flocs formed without the organic polymeric flocculant i e using ach alone such as fig 1c were relatively high 1 6 and was attributed to the high charge density of al13 species forming more compact flocs than monomeric e g alum coagulants an et al 2021 bottero et al 1990 organic polymeric flocculant addition progressively increased fractal dimension to 1 70 0 5 1 mg l and to 1 75 2 5 mg l for both daf and sedimentation as shown in fig 6a representing the formation of more compact and denser flocs with better resistance to breakage chakraborti et al 2003 jarvis et al 2005a floc diameter also increased with organic polymeric flocculant concentration in both cases fig 6b reflecting interparticle bridging bolto and gregory 2007 gregory and barany 2011 the ability of the organic polymeric flocculant to simultaneously increase floc density i e fractal dimension and size substantially augmented settling velocities at higher dosages fig 6c for example the settling velocity increased 5 fold from 0 45 mm s with only ach to 2 2 mm s with 5 mg l organic polymeric flocculant justifying organic polymeric flocculant addition for ultrashort sedimentation time more densely packed structures formed as more and more organic anionic polymeric flocculant was added is possibly due to a flatter polymer adsorption configuration owing to its strong electrostatic attractions with highly charged ach moieties gregory and barany 2011 additionally settling velocity was strongly and quantitatively correlated with the fractal dimension and size utilizing a single fitting parameter si section s5 and fig s8 3 4 2 destabilization mechanisms the zeta potential of produced water colloids was only 6 mv at ph 7 5 fig 7 a like previous reports nadella et al 2020 younker and walsh 2014 attributed to its high salinity and divalent cation concentrations section 3 1 given high al13 species concentration gregory and dupont 2001 ye et al 2007 even the lowest ach dose investigated 25 mg al l was sufficient to reverse the charge to 3 mv which further increased in magnitude at higher coagulant dosages symbolizing the adsorption of highly charged surface active aluminum ions benjamin and lawler 2013 tang et al 2015 van benschoten and edzwald 1990 the zeta potential was only marginally positive 5 mv at the optimal doses for sedimentation and daf 50 and 25 mg al l respectively signifying a low energy barrier that avoided restabilization nevertheless in all cases aluminum was precipitated effectively removing turbidity and iron fig 2 revealing enmeshment and sweep flocculation as the dominant destabilization mechanism in the absence of the organic polymeric flocculant additionally floc zeta potential decreased as ph increased reaching its isoelectric point at ph 8 5 as shown in fig 7b like previous reports bottero et al 1990 chen et al 2006 the zeta potential decreased with the addition of organic polymeric flocculant even reversing charge at 2 mg l for sedimentation and 1 mg l for daf fig 7c this is consistent with sorption of the organic anionic polymeric flocculant and partial neutralization of electrostatic patches formed by ach gregory and barany 2011 ye et al 2007 zeta potential measurements in conjunction with formation of progressively larger flocs figs 6b and si fig s6 evidences interparticle bridging especially in light of high concentrations of divalent cations in the produced water which enhance bridging flocculation bolto and gregory 2007 several characteristics of amide or acrylamide functional groups were seen in atr ftir spectra of flocs formed by adding the organic polymeric flocculant si section s6 and si fig s9 and corresponding tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves si section s7 and si fig s10 providing strong direct evidence for adsorption of organic polymeric flocculant and corresponding flocculation via interparticle bridging these include ftir peaks at 1413 cm 1 1455 cm 1 and 1663 cm 1 representing νc n ch2 scissoring and νc o of the amide or acrylamide functional groups chen et al 2009 chiem et al 2006 nadella et al 2020 wang et al 2017 as well as amide dehydration and breakdown chen et al 2009 van dyke and kasperski 1993 hence destabilization appears to have occurred by a combination of i diffuse layer compression induced by the high ionic strength of the produced water ii adsorption of highly charged aluminum species present in ach iii sweep coagulation by amorphous precipitates and iv adsorption and interparticle bridging by the organic anionic polymeric flocculant forming large dense and strong flocs 3 4 3 xps high resolution scans of various matrices c 1s scans of produced water constituents after drying and homogenization fig 8 top left panel in blue were deconvoluted into a dominant peak at 284 8 ev and

polyacrylamides zhao et al 2020 further evidencing organic polymeric flocculant adsorption on ach flocs al 2p scans of ach flocs with and without organic polymeric flocculant bottom row middle panel in red and right panel in magenta showed a dominant peak with 13 1 peak areal ratio at 74 4 ev for octahedral al vi and a minor peak at 73 ev for tetrahedral al iv in both cases this strongly indicates the presence of keggin like structured al13 flocs with 12 octahedral al vi groups surrounding an al iv group an et al 2021 lin et al 2009 tang et al 2015 in summary xps high resolution scans further validated polymer adsorption and interparticle bridging and the presence of al13 species si section s8 and si fig s11 provide supporting evidence for iron oxidation and uptake in flocs based on fe 2p scans 4 conclusions this is the first daf implementation for a matrix with salinity greater than seawater we additionally report the first systematic rigorous and comprehensive comparison of fit for purpose produced water clarification by daf and sedimentation incorporating ultrashort residence times ach and an organic polymeric flocculant aid together purified hypersaline produced water to 4 ntu turbidity and 0 8 mg l iron via flotation or sedimentation within a total residence time of 5 min direct evidence for the presence of al13 species having a keggin like structure was obtained via two independent techniques xrd and xps for the first time in a hypersaline wastewater along with adsorption of the organic polymeric flocculant on aluminum flocs also using two independent methods tga dtg and ftir spectroscopy highly charged al13 polycations amorphous aluminum precipitates and high molecular weight polymer together effectively neutralized the charge of suspended solids enmeshed and flocculated them expeditiously forming large and compact flocs that could be clarified within very short times iron was removed through multiple steps first by oxidizing it by chlorine to form micro particles that were uptaken by flocs when ach was added and using an organic polymeric flocculant to grow flocs capable of gravity separation either by daf or sedimentation although both daf and sedimentation were shown to be capable of producing clean brine in small decentralized units necessary for field implementation two advantages of daf over sedimentation were noted first in the absence of the organic polymeric flocculant daf outperformed sedimentation under optimized conditions of ph and recycle ratio by requiring only half the ach dosage to remove turbidity and iron to similar extents 80 and at lower residence time 3 min compared to 5 min second in the absence of ach daf removed 90 turbidity and iron solely using the organic polymeric flocculant demonstrating its lower need for added chemicals while concomitantly decreasing sludge volumes because daf was optimized at a relatively low 12 recycle ratio the excess energy required to saturate water was only modest hence our bench scale results show that daf is better suited to clarify hypersaline produced water compared with sedimentation even though anecdotal field scale evidence from practicing engineers supports our findings of the superiority of flotation over sedimentation we strongly recommend that they be validated at pilot scale and conducting a technoeconomic analysis before potentially implementing daf at larger scales the technoeconomic analysis should incorporate daf needing lower ach dosages but higher energy costs associated with air saturation and the decreasing air solubility with increasing

15378,treatment and reuse of some produced waters is made difficult due to their hypersalinity high concentrations of myriad other dissolved and suspended components specialized technology requirements modularity portability and short residence times and lack of existing information on their processing in this work produced water containing 100 000 mg l total dissolved solids from the permian basin was coagulated with aluminum chlorohydrate ach and flocculated with an anionic high molecular weight organic polymer prior to dissolved air flotation daf and sedimentation to reduce turbidity to 4 ntu and iron 0 8 mg l 95 removal in both cases with a total coagulation flocculation sedimentation flotation residence time of only 5 min two advantages of daf over sedimentation were noted i daf required only half the dosage of the pre hydrolyzed ach coagulant to remove 90 of turbidity and iron even without the organic polymeric flocculant and ii daf even operated successfully without ach coagulation i e using only the organic polymeric flocculant evidencing its lower chemical dosing needs further daf attained all water quality and operational goals at a recycle ratio of only 12 demonstrating that it outperformed sedimentation to generate clean brine at relatively reduced excess energies necessary for air saturation higher daf recycle ratios reduced turbidity and iron removal possibly due to floc breakage colloids were effectively destabilized by double layer compression due to high water salinity charge neutralization via adsorption of al13 polycations and enmeshment precipitation of amorphous aluminum they were flocculated via interparticle bridging by the anionic organic polymeric flocculant to create large compact flocs facilitating ultrashort

the united states generating 10 million barrels 1 6 x 109 l of produced water daily hu et al 2022 scanlon et al 2017 environmental social and governance objectives of oil and gas operators motivate the development of cost effective produced water management technologies to reduce their reliance on freshwater decrease subsurface injection volumes enable its beneficial reuse and alleviate environmental and geologic concerns cooper et al 2022 hu et al 2022 however several bottlenecks need to be overcome to successfully remove suspended solids turbidity and iron from produced water to generate clean brine for recycle scanlon et al 2017 chief amongst them is that produced water from unconventional oil and gas operations contains myriad chemical additives metals including iron geogenic colloids organics along with high concentrations of suspended solids and salts and its composition can vary widely spatiotemporally conrad et al 2020 cooper et al 2022 emmons et al 2022 scanlon et al 2017 robust technologies capable of removing suspended solids and iron from such hypersaline matrices of complex composition have not yet been rigorously evaluated nor have they been compared additionally process intensification requires modular portable treatment plants demanding very high treatment rates 16 24 m3 min for high volumes 80 000 m3 well necessitating ultrashort residence times we hypothesize that produced water s extremely high salt concentrations and operators need for ultrashort processing times preclude direct application of gravity separations design criteria originally developed for municipal water and wastewater treatment necessitating systematic optimization of liquid solid separation technologies applicable to salt concentrations 100 g l this is the primary novelty of our research to date only limited mechanistic information has been generated on the ability of coagulation flocculation sedimentation to clarify hypersaline produced water chorghe et al 2017 nadella et al 2020 rosenblum et al 2016 sari and chellam 2015 dissolved air flotation daf is an alternative liquid solid separation process that can increase the clarification rate use lower amounts of coagulant and concomitantly generate lower volumes of sludge edzwald 2010 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 younker and walsh 2014 making it potentially attractive for oilfield applications however high salinity reduces air saturation as well as the mobility of bubbles and flocs necessitating greater recycle ratios or saturation pressures which increase daf operating costs fanaie and khiadani 2020 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 jiménez et al 2017 rajapakse et al 2022 to date only one peer reviewed publication is available for daf for produced water which considered a sample with salinity similar to seawater used 30 min total residence time and considered removal of oil and grease and dissolved aromatics without providing mechanistic insights younker and walsh 2014 hence daf mechanisms need to be elucidated and process conditions need rigorous optimization for side by side comparison with sedimentation for treating hypersaline produced water to remove colloids and iron the overarching goals of this research targeted towards treatment of highly saline produced water are to 1 develop gravity separation processes with ultrashort residence times and low footprint that are portable and applicable for decentralized treatment and 2 methodically evaluate daf for liquid solid separation and compare it to sedimentation providing an alternative technology for field scale implementation we employ a pre hydrolyzed coagulant aluminum chlorohydrate ach in conjunction with an organic polymeric flocculant to achieve our process engineering goals ach was chosen because it consumes less alkalinity and produces lower sludge volumes than conventional metal ion coagulants such as alum gregory and dupont 2001 wang et al 2008 thus benefitting onsite implementation in remote locations such as the permian basin and it has not yet been mechanistically evaluated for treating produced water adding to the novelty of our work specific objectives are to 1 engineer flotation and sedimentation to reduce turbidity to 4 ntu and iron to 1 mg l 95 removal in both cases within a total coagulation flocculation clarification time of only 5 min for produced water and 2 elucidate underlying treatment mechanisms including coagulation relevant to this hypersaline matrix this manuscript is the first implementation of daf to hypersaline wastewater in the peer reviewed literature additionally we developed daf and sedimentation with ultrashort residence times by using ach as a coagulant and coupling it with an organic polymeric flocculant further this is the first identification of the al13 polycation in produced water along with a rigorous description of associated destabilization aggregation mechanisms daf and sedimentation were individually optimized by adjusting chemical dosing and operational parameters to maximize turbidity and iron removal and minimize residence time their relative performance in a hypersaline matrix was systematically compared for the first time and flocs were comprehensively characterized 2 materials and methods 2 1 produced water sample and chemicals used in experiments produced water was sampled from the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in the texas permian basin individual wells average 3000 m in depth and spanned a few months to several years in age produced water samples were acidified to ph 5 using hcl and stored immediately upon receipt at 4 c an organic free synthetic solution of 107 000 mg l nacl was prepared to mimic the total dissolved solids tds and specific gravity of produced water which was used in control experiments and in the air saturator ach was obtained from g2o technologies little rock arkansas ach is a polyaluminum chloride pacl that pre neutralizes h ions formed by hydrolysis has the highest basicity 82 5 84 5 and is typically composed of 6 of monomers 78 of al13 polymers and 16 of colloids respectively lin et al 2009 miranda et al 2020 wang et al 2008 yan et al 2007 its prehydrolyzed nature and high basicity substantially reduces the need for external base addition to maintain coagulation ph making it more attractive for field application especially in remote oilfield locations where hydraulic fracturing is typically performed an anionic linear poly sodium acrylate co acrylamide polymer having low charge density 5 mol and high molecular weight 7 5 12 5 x

connected to a compressed air cylinder before each experiment the daf saturator was thoroughly flushed to remove salt residues then filled with nacl solution of the same tds as the produced water sample and ph matching that of the designated experiment the saturator pressure 586 kpa 85 psi and saturation time 15 min were fixed for all experiments rapid mixing and flocculation intensities were always 600 s 1 and 30 s 1 respectively rapid mixing was performed for 1 min in all cases whereas slow mixing durations necessary to attain stated water quality goals changed with polymer dosage five minutes were necessary when using ach with little or no 2 mg l organic polymeric flocculant this reduced to only one minute when 2 mg l organic polymeric flocculant was added at the onset of rapid mixing ph was adjusted using naoh and chlorine was added to catalyze iron oxidation and inactivate microorganisms after which ach was added the target free chlorine residual at the end of the experiment was 2 0 2 mg l when needed the organic polymeric flocculant was added 30 s before the end of rapid mixing after flocculation flocs were carefully transferred using wide cut 10 ml pipette tips to avoid breakage johnson et al 1996 nadella et al 2020 and analyzed immediately for size and morphology section 2 3 then flocs were allowed to settle during conventional jar tests or air saturated water was released to initiate flotation in daf experiments initially sedimentation and flotation durations were set for five and three minutes respectively that were reduced to only three minutes for both technologies after optimizing chemical including organic polymeric flocculant dosing these jar testing and clarification protocols are summarized schematically in si fig s2 around 100

free chlorine total iron and residual aluminum numerous other metals were also measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after thermally digesting the samples using concentrated nitric acid and performing necessary standard and cross validation measurements details of water quality analyses are in si section s2 settled floated flocs were also collected and characterized in detail 2

vahedi and gorczyca 2011 settling velocity was measured using a quiescent sedimentation column and video analysis x ray diffractograms of flocs were obtained after suspending them in ultrapure water

elemental composition eds and xps survey scans detailed information on functional groups bonding and elemental state were obtained from xps high resolution scans tga was performed to directly evidence organic polymeric flocculant sorption on flocs si section s3 table s1 and fig s3 contain analytical details 3 results and discussion 3 1 produced water physicochemical characteristics as summarized in table 1 the produced water sample was hypersaline tds 107 000 mg l dominated by sodium chloride and consequently was 8 denser than freshwater it had high concentrations of total suspended solids tss

produced water samples hu et al 2022 nadella et al 2020 the sample was also nanofiltered nf270 dow to reduce its intense chloride signal and the filtered materials were surveyed via xps chorghe et al 2017 sari and chellam 2015 revealing carbon and oxygen as major elements along with sulfur calcium magnesium sodium silicon iron strontium barium boron and residual chlorine si table s2 qualitatively

sweep coagulation during rapid mixing first two negative control experiments were performed where no chemicals were added to study physical separation in the first one the produced water was simply stirred and allowed to settle which removed 5 turbidity and iron in the second control produced water was introduced into the daf unit and bubbles were injected which removed 30 turbidity and iron next another set of two negative control experiments were conducted by simply adjusting the ph of the produced water to 7 5 and adding chlorine i e no coagulant and flocculant were added neither suspended solids nor iron were appreciably removed via sedimentation even after 15 min but 60 of turbidity and iron subnantant concentrations of 30 ntu and 6 mg l respectively were removed in daf in only 3 min bright field microscopy fig 1 a revealed flocs were small 20 µm and highly porous fractal dimension 1 4 and consequently not settleable but floatable validating turbidity and iron removal by daf and not sedimentation in this control experiment eds fig 1b of these aggregates revealed iron as one of their major constituents arising from chlorine catalyzed oxidation of fe ii inherently present in the produced water cheng et al 2017 lytle et al 2004 and consistent with their reddish brown color residual fe ii concentrations were below detection limits of colorimetric testing 0 02 mg l demonstrating near complete iron oxidation and successful removal more evidence for iron oxidation are provided in si section s8 and fig s11 after adding ach portions of the flocs were translucent with low contrast typical of aluminum precipitates jarvis et al 2008 yu et al 2015 which encompassed abovementioned reddish brown solids fig 1c correspondingly eds fig 1d reflected flocs rich in aluminum and iron symptomatic of successful sweep coagulation and iron enmeshment 3 2 2 optimizing process conditions without organic polymeric flocculant gravity separation efficacies were initially optimized by monitoring residual turbidity and iron at 12 daf recycle ratio 40 0 ach dosage 75 mg al l and 6 5 ph 8 5 the sedimentation and flotation times were set at five and three minutes respectively first lower daf recycle ratios 12 improved subnatant turbidity and iron fig 2 a and b unlike what was recommended for seawater oil in water emulsions and synthetic produced water haarhoff and edzwald 2013 jiménez et al 2017 shutova et al 2016 zouboulis and avranas 2000 this is potentially due to shear induced breakage of relatively fragile flocs associated with pre hydrolyzed coagulants such as ach duan and gregory 2003 miranda et al 2020 when bubbles were released at high pressure anderson maia et al 2015 jarvis et al 2008 jiménez et al 2017 wang et al 2018 as explored in section 3 2 4 second for sedimentation supernatant turbidity and iron concentrations declined as more ach was dosed black symbols in fig 2c and d but reductions were negligible beyond 50 mg al l the optimal dose noted by a black arrow remaining at 16 ntu and 2 3 mg l respectively even at 75 mg al l analogously the optimal ach dose for daf red arrow was selected as 25 mg al l since subnatant turbidity and iron remained at 13 ntu and 2 1 mg l respectively even for higher ach doses red symbols in fig 2c and d hence daf attained similar turbidity and iron levels as sedimentation but at half the ach concentration and at 66 higher clarification rate 3 min for flotation compared with 5 min for sedimentation edzwald 2010 jiménez et al 2017 these results support previous studies emphasizing the lower coagulant dose requirements for daf to maintain appropriate floc bubble ratio edzwald 2010 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 this was also reflected in terms of doc removal 25 30 removal for daf compared to 15 20 for sedimentation owing to the hydrophobic nature of bubbles that facilitated organics removal during flotation al shamrani et al 2002 gamage and chellam 2014 younker and walsh 2014 the optimized ach doses for daf 25 mg al l and sedimentation 50 mg al l for the hypersaline sample are in the same range as the alum dose we reported earlier 40 mg al l to treat produced waters with significantly lower tds and iron content chorghe et al 2017 validating its choice in this research as seen in fig 2e and f ph 7 5 was suitable for both clarification processes corroborating earlier studies with preformed polymeric aluminum species lin et al 2008 yan et al 2008 larger 90 µm more settleable 0 5 mm s flocs were formed at alkaline ph compared with ph 6 5 only 50 µm in diameter and settling at 0 3 mm s explaining these results si fig s4 these observations are consistent with al13 being more protonated at acidic conditions an et al 2021 and the presence of positively charged flocs as shown later in fig 7b poor flotation at ph 6 5 is a consequence of the formation of smaller flocs but at higher number concentrations even outnumbering bubbles in daf haarhoff and edzwald 2013 lin et al 2008 hence ph was fixed at 7 5 for both sedimentation and daf black and red arrows respectively since it was closer to the produced water s native ph i e less chemical addition hence daf outperformed sedimentation needing only half the ach dose and shorter flotation duration corroborating previous studies favoring daf against sedimentation for seawater and freshwater edzwald 2010 fanaie and khiadani 2020 however daf is more energy intensive than sedimentation but using only 12 recycle ratio reduces the excess energy needed for air saturation edzwald and haarhoff 2011 zabel 1992 3 2 3 using an organic polymeric flocculant facilitated ultrashort separation times adding 2 mg l organic polymeric flocculant at optimized conditions of ach dosage ph and daf recycle ratio further reduced turbidity and iron to 4 ntu and 0 8 mg l respectively representing 95 removal of both constituents fig 3 importantly floc growth was accelerated at higher organic polymeric flocculant concentrations allowing us to reduce flocculation time to only 1 min instead of 5 min for all other experiments larger flocs were formed in the presence of the organic polymeric flocculant as seen in fig 1g exhibiting both translucent and reddish brown features correspondingly flocs were rich in aluminum and iron and even richer in carbon fig 1h compared to fig 1b suggesting adsorption of the organic polymeric flocculant additionally phase separation was excellent in only 3 min for sedimentation thereby necessitating a total residence time of only 5 min including coagulation and flocculation identical to daf another control experiment was performed to compare both clarification methods by adding 5 mg l organic polymeric flocculant after adjusting the produced water ph to 7 5 and adding chlorine but no ach this evaluated the ability of the organic polymeric flocculant to remove solids and iron even in the absence of the metal ion coagulant turbidity and iron were removed to 90 for daf in 3 min and only 75 for sedimentation in 5 min demonstrating better daf performance significantly larger flocs 270 µm were formed in this experiment fig 1e whose eds spectrum fig 1f like fig 1h was again rich in iron and carbon indicating the organic polymeric flocculant s ability to aggregate particulate iron efficient removal of suspended solids by daf using only an organic polymeric flocculant demonstrates that this technology can be operated successfully to treat produced water even without adding a metal ion coagulant 3 2 4 elucidating daf bubble floc interactions we evaluated potential mechanisms underlying process engineering results described in sections 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 subnatant aluminum concentrations were measured to represent coagulant residues remaining in the daf reactor i e those that did not attach to bubbles and float to the top fig 4 the produced water itself had negligible aluminum 0 1 mg l table 1 allowing us to assign the measured values to leftover coagulant after flotation as seen in fig 4 low residual aluminum concentrations were measured under the same optimal conditions and trends for turbidity and iron removal identified in figs 2 and 3 for example residual aluminum concentrations increased with recycle ratio in fig 4a even as more bubbles were introduced at higher recycle ratios indicative of poor attachment of flocs to bubbles and subsequent flotation these results are consistent with floc breakage at higher turbulence intensities when saturated water is recycled al shamrani et al 2002 anderson maia et al 2015 gonzalez galvis and narbaitz 2020 jiménez et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in turn increasing the floc bubble ratio thereby worsening daf performance edzwald 2010 haarhoff and edzwald 2013 adding 1 mg l of the organic polymeric flocculant also reduced residual aluminum concentrations in the harvested subnantant samples fig 4d potentially due to formation of stronger flocs bolto and gregory 2007 moreover residual aluminum levels were higher when ach dosage was 25 mg al l fig 4b and at ph 6 5 fig 4 c corroborating the higher floc number concentrations and unfavorable floc bubble ratios under these non optimal conditions which worsen daf performance haarhoff and edzwald 2013 lin et al 2008 further floc size decreased with increasing recycle ratio as shown in si fig s5 which was attributed to higher shear exerted by bubbles for example with only ach as coagulant but no organic polymeric flocculant aid black symbols at 40 recycle ratio flocs decreased in size by more than 50 compared to floc sizes exposed to white water i e 0 recycle ratio in si fig s5 similar results were obtained even for flocs formed with ach coagulant and organic polymeric flocculant red symbols even after breakage at 40 recycle ratio rightmost red circle these flocs were comparable in size to the initial floc size for the experiments with ach alone where no organic polymeric flocculant aid was added hence higher recycle ratios negated the advantage of size enhancement arising from adding the organic polymeric flocculant these measurements demonstrate the negative consequences of operating at higher recycle ratios that diminished floc sizes thereby increasing their residual number concentration and reducing overall process performance in terms of solids removal 3 2 5 removal of other produced water components even though our principal focus was to remove suspended solids and iron with ultrashort residence times we also obtained information on behavior of other produced water constituents si table s2 survey scans of the treated produced water confirmed uptake of numerous metals boron strontium barium calcium sodium magnesium as well as silicon chlorine and sulfur onto flocs as validated by eds fig 1 scans of flocs with organic polymeric flocculant and ach reflected a slight enrichment of aluminum iron and boron validating the organic polymeric flocculant s role in enhancing removal efficiencies and reducing residual aluminum section 3 2 these observations were further validated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry that showed high removals of magnesium 65 silicon 54 calcium 67 potassium 55 strontium 52 and barium 88 along with 20 boron under optimized operating conditions finally daf removed slightly more doc 25 30 compared to sedimentation 15 20 attributed to the hydrophobic nature of air bubbles hence daf and sedimentation removed several scale forming components divalent ions and silicon along with suspended solids and iron which can alleviate fouling during desalination and beneficial reuse conrad et al 2020 cooper et al 2022 hu et al 2022 3 3 polymorphs of aluminum precipitates a noisy baseline in flocs x ray diffractograms fig 5 suggests the formation of largely amorphous aluminum precipitates symptomatic of coagulation flocculation processes berkowitz et al 2005 even though flocs were extensively washed centrifuged strong signals of halite nacl 111 200 202 calcite caco3 102 104 110 113 202 211 300 quartz sio2 100 101 112 301 anhydrite caso4 020 031 400 and hematite fe2o3 104 116 were obtained this demonstrates the ability of ach to remove scale forming constituents calcium silica sulfates importantly hematite was also identified shon et al 2009 confirming iron enmeshment these observations partially explain the absence of highly ordered aluminum phases since sorption of these and other produced water components including organic matter retards crystallization beyrouty et al 1984 masion et al 2000 nevertheless a weak signal near 8 appeared fig 5 inset characteristic of al13 species that are generated when using pre formed aluminum bottero et al 1990 lin et al 2009 3 4 organic polymeric flocculant s mechanistic role on ultrashort clarification times 3 4 1 organic polymeric flocculant formed larger and more compact flocs bright field optical microscope images of flocs collected at the end of the slow mixing period qualitatively revealed that they grew bigger with increasing organic polymeric flocculant dosage si fig s6a e for sedimentation and si fig 6 f j for daf electron micrographs revealed rougher surfaces and larger flocs formed upon organic polymeric flocculant addition as shown in si section s4 and fig s7 two dimensional fractal dimensions of flocs formed without the organic polymeric flocculant i e using ach alone such as fig 1c were relatively high 1 6 and was attributed to the high charge density of al13 species forming more compact flocs than monomeric e g alum coagulants an et al 2021 bottero et al 1990 organic polymeric flocculant addition progressively increased fractal dimension to 1 70 0 5 1 mg l and to 1 75 2 5 mg l for both daf and sedimentation as shown in fig 6a representing the formation of more compact and denser flocs with better resistance to breakage chakraborti et al 2003 jarvis et al 2005a floc diameter also increased with organic polymeric flocculant concentration in both cases fig 6b reflecting interparticle bridging bolto and gregory 2007 gregory and barany 2011 the ability of the organic polymeric flocculant to simultaneously increase floc density i e fractal dimension and size substantially augmented settling velocities at higher dosages fig 6c for example the settling velocity increased 5 fold from 0 45 mm s with only ach to 2 2 mm s with 5 mg l organic polymeric flocculant justifying organic polymeric flocculant addition for ultrashort sedimentation time more densely packed structures formed as more and more organic anionic polymeric flocculant was added is possibly due to a flatter polymer adsorption configuration owing to its strong electrostatic attractions with highly charged ach moieties gregory and barany 2011 additionally settling velocity was strongly and quantitatively correlated with the fractal dimension and size utilizing a single fitting parameter si section s5 and fig s8 3 4 2 destabilization mechanisms the zeta potential of produced water colloids was only 6 mv at ph 7 5 fig 7 a like previous reports nadella et al 2020 younker and walsh 2014 attributed to its high salinity and divalent cation concentrations section 3 1 given high al13 species concentration gregory and dupont 2001 ye et al 2007 even the lowest ach dose investigated 25 mg al l was sufficient to reverse the charge to 3 mv which further increased in magnitude at higher coagulant dosages symbolizing the adsorption of highly charged surface active aluminum ions benjamin and lawler 2013 tang et al 2015 van benschoten and edzwald 1990 the zeta potential was only marginally positive 5 mv at the optimal doses for sedimentation and daf 50 and 25 mg al l respectively signifying a low energy barrier that avoided restabilization nevertheless in all cases aluminum was precipitated effectively removing turbidity and iron fig 2 revealing enmeshment and sweep flocculation as the dominant destabilization mechanism in the absence of the organic polymeric flocculant additionally floc zeta potential decreased as ph increased reaching its isoelectric point at ph 8 5 as shown in fig 7b like previous reports bottero et al 1990 chen et al 2006 the zeta potential decreased with the addition of organic polymeric flocculant even reversing charge at 2 mg l for sedimentation and 1 mg l for daf fig 7c this is consistent with sorption of the organic anionic polymeric flocculant and partial neutralization of electrostatic patches formed by ach gregory and barany 2011 ye et al 2007 zeta potential measurements in conjunction with formation of progressively larger flocs figs 6b and si fig s6 evidences interparticle bridging especially in light of high concentrations of divalent cations in the produced water which enhance bridging flocculation bolto and gregory 2007 several characteristics of amide or acrylamide functional groups were seen in atr ftir spectra of flocs formed by adding the organic polymeric flocculant si section s6 and si fig s9 and corresponding tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves si section s7 and si fig s10 providing strong direct evidence for adsorption of organic polymeric flocculant and corresponding flocculation via interparticle bridging these include ftir peaks at 1413 cm 1 1455 cm 1 and 1663 cm 1 representing νc n ch2 scissoring and νc o of the amide or acrylamide functional groups chen et al 2009 chiem et al 2006 nadella et al 2020 wang et al 2017 as well as amide dehydration and breakdown chen et al 2009 van dyke and kasperski 1993 hence destabilization appears to have occurred by a combination of i diffuse layer compression induced by the high ionic strength of the produced water ii adsorption of highly charged aluminum species present in ach iii sweep coagulation by amorphous precipitates and iv adsorption and interparticle bridging by the organic anionic polymeric flocculant forming large dense and strong flocs 3 4 3 xps

polyacrylamides zhao et al 2020 further evidencing organic polymeric flocculant adsorption on ach flocs al 2p scans of ach flocs with and without organic polymeric flocculant bottom row middle panel in red and right panel in magenta showed a dominant peak with 13 1 peak areal ratio at 74 4 ev for octahedral al vi and a minor peak at 73 ev for tetrahedral al iv in both cases this strongly indicates the presence of keggin like structured al13 flocs with 12 octahedral al vi groups surrounding an al iv group an et al 2021 lin et al 2009 tang et al 2015 in summary xps high resolution scans further validated polymer adsorption and interparticle bridging and the presence of al13 species si section s8 and si fig s11 provide supporting evidence for iron oxidation and uptake in flocs based on fe 2p scans 4 conclusions this is the first daf implementation for a matrix with salinity greater than seawater we additionally report the first systematic rigorous and comprehensive comparison of fit for purpose produced water clarification by daf and sedimentation incorporating ultrashort residence times ach and an organic polymeric flocculant aid together purified hypersaline produced water to 4 ntu turbidity and 0 8 mg l iron via flotation or sedimentation within a total residence time of 5 min direct evidence for the presence of al13 species having a keggin like structure was obtained via two independent techniques xrd and xps for the first time in a hypersaline wastewater along with adsorption of the organic polymeric flocculant on aluminum flocs also using two independent methods tga dtg and ftir spectroscopy highly charged al13 polycations amorphous aluminum precipitates and high molecular weight polymer together effectively neutralized the charge of suspended solids enmeshed and flocculated them expeditiously forming large and compact flocs that could be clarified within very short times iron was removed through multiple steps first by oxidizing it by chlorine to form micro particles that were uptaken by flocs when ach was added and using an organic polymeric flocculant to grow flocs capable of gravity separation either by daf or sedimentation although both daf and sedimentation were shown to be capable of producing clean brine in small decentralized units necessary for field implementation two advantages of daf over sedimentation were noted first in the absence of the organic polymeric flocculant daf outperformed sedimentation under optimized conditions of ph and recycle ratio by requiring only half the ach dosage to remove turbidity and iron to similar extents 80 and at lower residence time 3 min compared to 5 min second in the absence of ach daf removed 90 turbidity and iron solely using the organic polymeric flocculant demonstrating its lower need for added chemicals while concomitantly decreasing sludge volumes because daf was optimized at a relatively low 12 recycle ratio the excess energy required to saturate water was only modest hence our bench scale results show that daf is better suited to clarify hypersaline produced water compared with sedimentation even though anecdotal field scale evidence from practicing engineers supports our findings of the superiority of flotation over sedimentation we strongly recommend that they be validated at pilot scale and conducting a technoeconomic analysis before potentially implementing daf at larger scales the technoeconomic analysis should incorporate daf needing lower ach dosages but higher energy costs associated with air saturation and the decreasing air solubility with increasing

15379,microplastics have been identified as a kind of emerging pollutant with potential ecological risks and it is an urgent endeavor to find proper technologies for their remediation electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop technology has exhibited robust performance in the removal of various refractory organic pollutants in this study we explored a new remediation strategy for polystyrene microplastics ps mps introducing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to enhance its degradation performance in boron doped diamond bdd anode adopted eaop at first we investigated the degradation behaviors of sds in the bdd electrolysis according to the sds half life under various current densities the sds addition strategy into eaop is proposed that is supplement sds to 500 mg l at every half life during electrolysis except the last cycle results indicated that sds addition greatly enhanced mps degradation rate in 72 h of eaop about 1 35 2 29 times higher than that in bdd electrolysis alone the sds assisted eaop also led to more obvious changes in the particle size morphology and functional groups of the mps after treatment a variety of alkyl cleavage and oxidation products were identified which attributed to the strong attack of oxidants i e persulfate on the mps the enhanced persulfate generation and oxidants adsorption on mps can explain the enhancement effect in the eaop strategy cost analysis results showed the surfactant only accounts for 0 05 of the total operating costs in the sds assisted eaop in general the current study provided new insight into the effective way to improve the eaop efficiency of microplastics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics surfactant boron doped diamond bdd electrolysis synergistic effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years microplastics mps pollution has been attracted worldwide attention as an emerging and ubiquitous contaminant in the aquatic environment yuan et al 2022 microplastics are commonly defined as plastic pieces and particles less than 5 mm in diameter thompson et al 2004 with diverse sources from specific materials i e cosmetics cleaning agents and coatings and broken pieces of large plastics wang et al 2022 microplastics are widely detected in aquatic environments and effluent discharge from wastewater and sewage treatment plants wwtps has been identified as the main source iyare et al 2020 wong et al 2020 the potential ecological and health risks of microplastics are of increasing public concern during the last two decades currently the main technologies for microplastic removal can be divided into coagulation filtration biodegradation photocatalysis and other advanced oxidation treatments in coagulation physical treatment technology the removal efficiency in primary treatment varies with the composition and size of microplastics ahmed et al 2022 ultrafiltration nanofiltration and permeation can exert a good removal effect on microplastics of small size but they all require high operating costs and maintenance costs for the membranes ma et al 2019 talvitie et al 2017 most biodegradation methods are difficult to achieve the desired effects due to the relatively severe operating conditions ahmed et al 2022 the treatment efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation depends on the microplastic properties and the recovery and reuse rate of photocatalysts ariza tarazona et al 2019 wang et al 2019 therefore cost effective and highly efficient remediation technologies are urgently needed for microplastic removal from the aquatic environments in comparison electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop technology has advantages in terms of simple operation low secondary pollution and robust performance which has been proven to effectively degrade various toxic or refractory organic pollutants radjenovic and sedlak 2015 among them boron doped diamond bdd used as an anode has been studied extensively in recent years except for the degradation of dissolvable organic pollutants such as pesticides dyes and other persistent pollutants polystyrene ps microplastics have also been reported to achieve degradation in bdd eaop kiendrebeogo et al 2021 bdd anode has a relatively high overpotential for o2 evolution cai et al 2019 and consequently exhibits powerful oxidation capacity through the generation of oh by water electrolysis on the anode surface samet et al 2010 however in bdd eaop the electrolysis efficiency for a pollutant is controlled by its transport rate from the bulk solution to the bdd anode surface chen et al 2022 martínez huitle et al 2015 in addition in the removal of hydrophobic pollutants using eaop techniques their oxidation may deactivate the electrode through the formation of polymers on the electrode surface trellu et al 2017 since microplastics are highly hydrophobic and insoluble their degradation in bdd eaop is limited by the adsorption efficiency of oxidants on mps in the previous study the high degradation rate of ps mps can only be observed at a very high current intensity 108 4 ma cm2 kiendrebeogo et al 2021 surfactants have the ability to improve homogenization modify surface properties and equilibrium interfacial tension chang et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and other surfactants are widely used to remediate contaminated soils through actively solubilizing hydrophobic pollutants laha et al 2009 rathankumar et al 2022 sáez et al 2010 in recent years researchers have unexpectedly found the presence of sds around its critical micellar concentration cmc can improve the pollutants degradation from wastewater in eaop escalona durán et al 2020 escalona durán et al 2019 fabbri et al 2004 silva et al 2021 trellu et al 2017 in addition extra persulfate can be electrochemically produced from oxidizing sds by the bdd anode which enhances its oxidation performance araújo et al 2018 however if a higher concentration cmc of surfactants was introduced in the eaop system the formation of micelles can strongly hinder the treatment efficiency dionisio et al 2019 silva et al 2021 trellu et al 2017 it also should be noted that sds is a kind of important pollutant but it can be completely decomposed by electrocatalysis nguyen et al 2016 therefore in the sds assisted eaop suitable working conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the effective removal of pollutants without introducing additional pollution ps is one of the widely used plastics in foam products various instrument

analysis the mps degradation was determined by a gravimetric technique following ariza tarazona et al 2020 briefly the filtered and air dried mps were quantified using an electronic balance ax224zh ohaus usa and the degradation rate was calculated as the mass loss 1 mps degradation rate m 0 m m 0 100 where m0 is the initial mass of the ps mps and m is the mass after 72 h of electrolysis the sds

electrolysis alone and sds assisted eaop respectively the energy consumption kwh of sds and mps degradation was calculated according to the following equation teng et al 2020 3 energy consumption u i t v s where u v is the applied voltage i the applied current a t h the degradation time and vs l the system volume the operating costs of sds assisted eaop can be estimated as the sum of energy costs electrolyte costs and surfactant costs kiendrebeogo et al 2021 2 7 ecotoxicity assay the acute biotoxicity of the eaop electrolyte was evaluated according to the bioluminescence inhibition assay with vibrio fischeri parvez et al 2006 the assay was carried out in triplicate approximately 200 μl of diluted bacteria suspension and 100 μl of the filtered sample 0 22 μm were added to each plate the 0 2 mol l sodium sulfate solution without sds was used as a control the luminescence for samples was measured using microtox toxicity test system carlsbad ca usa after 15 min at 15 c and results were expressed as the percentage of bioluminescence inhibition the chronic toxicity was assessed for samples collected from solutions before during the first half life of sds degradation and after the kinetic experiments based on the well described chlorella vulgaris assay zhu et al 2020 algae suspensions were exposed to the filtered electrolyte samples 0 22 μm for 72 h at a temperature of 27 c and a light intensity of 1000 3000 lx comprising five replicates for each time tests were also performed in triplicate with blank assays toxic effects were calculated from the growth inhibition ratio of algae biomass compared with the control cell number counts were determined using a neubauer camera 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical behaviors of sds ps mps and their mixture fig 2 a shows the oxidation behavior of sds at elevated concentrations by cyclic voltammograms cvs on the bdd anode during the scan an irreversible oxidation peak appeared from 0 8 to 1 0 v sce and the peak increased with increasing sds concentrations from 0 6 to 2 4 mm this demonstrates that the anodic oxidation of sds occurs in this potential zone the oxidation current is attributed to the oxygen evolution reaction that started at 1 3 v on the bdd anode which reflected the wide potential window of the bdd electrode de moura et al 2015 the reduction peaks appearing at 0 1 v indicated the oxidizing species which might be formed from the oxidation of sulfate in the previous oxidizing environment cai et al 2019 this result indicated that the sds can be deposited on the bdd surface to cause their oxidization the promotion effect of sds on oxidation of ps mps during bdd electrolysis was also investigated by cyclic voltammetry fig 2 b as can be observed there is no obvious oxidation peak in the potential of 0 8 to 1 0 v sce for the ps mps it has been proved that the oxidation of organics in bdd electrolysis can be mainly attributed to the free hydroxyl radicals oh on the anode surface medeiros de araújo et al 2014 michaud et al 2003 and the oxidation process of bdd anode leads to a more hydrophilic surface because of the formation of c o c o c and c oh functionalities wang et al 2009 conversely the high hydrophobicity may reduce the transportation efficiency of ps mps to the electrode surface and hinder the surface absorbability of ps mps to oh thereby leading to low current response in the cv however the addition of 1 8 mm sds improved the current response in both oxidation and reduction peaks of cv in addition the onset potential v onset for the sds and ps mps mixture 1 25 v was lower than that of ps mps only 1 32 v during bdd electrolysis the increase in current response and decrease in v onset indicated that sds addition facilitated water dissociation on the bdd anode surface to produce oh and other subsequent oxidants chen et al 2022 song et al 2018 3 2 degradation kinetics of sds as it is well known surfactants are considered important pollutants in wastewater for this reason we explored the degradation kinetics of sds in the bdd electrolysis system before using sds as an auxiliary reagent in the electrochemical treatment the degradation of sds was studied at a concentration of 500 mg l according to the estimated ideal concentration for enhancing the degradation of other organic compounds from the previous studies araújo et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 degradation kinetics of sds proceeded according to pseudo first order kinetic under various current densities fig 3 a the degradation rates of sds k increased obviously as the current densities j increased from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 and the corresponding half lives t 1 2 were 9 00 5 87 and 2 74 h respectively table s1 this enhancement of sds oxidation at a higher applied current density is directly related to the increased production and thickness of the surface bdd oh layer for alleviating the steric hindrance effect davis et al 2014 as can be observed fig s1 the increase of steady state oh concentrations in systems occurred when increasing the j from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 the accumulation of 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone o3 also followed the expected trend with the increase of current densities these nonradical oxidates exhibit excellent catalytic durability acosta santoyo et al 2021 luo et al 2019 which promotes the degradation of sds in solution in addition when using sulfate ion as the supporting electrolyte the release of persulfate can be also promoted at higher j via the following two mechanisms eqs 4 6 araújo et al 2018 rocha et al 2012 4 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 5 bdd oh so 4 2 bdd s o 4 h o 6 bdd s o 4 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 e as a more stable oxidant persulfate can migrate and remain in the electrolyte solution thereby providing so4 to the attack of organic substrates davis et al 2014 notably the accumulation of persulfate can not only be evolved from free sulfate ions in the electrolyte but also from the degradation of the sds eq 7 araújo et al 2018 7 sds bdd oh or s 2 o 8 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 an increase in current density caused a more significant effect on the persulfate accumulation in the sds assisted systems compared to the eaop system in absence of sds fig s1 therefore although the initial degradation of sds will compete with some extents of oxidants its degradation process will complementally produce extra oxidants participating in the reaction for other substances in the solution 3 3 the degradation of ps mps in an sds assisted eaop strategy sds is an efficient surfactant that can enhance the interaction between the electro generated oxidative species and insoluble compounds escalona durán et al 2019 when using sds in eaop treatment of ps mps it is required to maintain enough sds concentration for producing higher concentrations of persulfate in most of the electrolysis times taking into account the critical micellar concentration of sds about 1500 mg l according to escalona durán et al 2019 and its degradation kinetics in the bdd electrolysis system we proposed an sds assisted eaop strategy for various current densities as shown in fig 1 b except for the addition of sds at the beginning of electrolysis sds was supplemented in each half life to reach the initial dose corresponding to the j of 10 20 and 30 ma cm2 the time intervals for sds supplementation were set as 9 h 6 h and 3 h respectively figs 1 b and s2 this can ensure that the sds concentration in the electrolytic system is always greater than 200 mg l except in the last cycle then it is important to confirm the residual sds was eliminated at the end of the eaop as seen in figs 1 b and s2 high sds removal 99 2 was reached after 72 h of electrolysis independent of all the cases on the basis of ensuring the nearly full elimination of sds in eaop we explored the enhancement of sds assisted strategy on the degradation of ps mps fig 3 b in the bdd electrolysis alone the 72 h degradation rate of ps from solution was increased from j of 0 3 83 to 30 ma cm2 18 5 similar conclusions were also found in previous studies about the influence of current density on the electro oxidation of ps mps on bdd anode kiendrebeogo et al 2021 due to the lower initial concentration of ps applied in the electrolysis system 100 mg l of 26 μm diameter ps they found a relatively higher degradation rate 6 h 89 at a current density of 108 4 ma cm2 kiendrebeogo et al 2021 this indicates that increasing the current density has higher promoting effects on the degradation of ps mps for the sds assisted eaop it was also observed that the higher applied j the higher the degradation rate of ps table 1 the sds assisted eaop can exhibit enhancement coefficients at the 72 h degradation rate of ps 126 relative to that of bdd electrolysis alone these results clearly indicate that enough concentration of sds can enhance the elimination of ps mps by oxidants produced electrochemically the synergistic effect can be attributed to electrochemical activation achieved at the bdd anode we also analyzed the particle size distribution of ps mps before and after different eaop conditions fig 4 the average size of the ps mps declined from 18 5 15 2 to 13 3 6 59 μm after 30 ma cm2 of bdd electrolysis alone p 0 05 and further decreased to 7 90 5 68 μm after 72 h sds assisted eaop treatment p 0 05 and the decreasing trends of mp size were also observed from bdd electrolysis alone to sds assisted eaop under other current densities fig s3 this indicated that the ps mps were gradually broken into smaller sized particles in the eaop treatment especially for the sds assisted strategy therefore upgrading the bdd electrolysis to sds assisted eaop is beneficial to the degradation of hydrophobic ps mps 3 4 the variations of surface morphology of ps mps after eaop the surface morphology is an important parameter for evaluating its degradation degree and mechanisms for mps sun et al 2021 wang et al 2017 as shown in the sem micrographs the pristine ps mps have a non porous smooth surface fig 5 a after 72 h of treatment under various eaop conditions the ps mps surface accumulated rough cracks and cavities the changes in surface morphology increased with the increase of current density in eaop and the presence of sds possessed stronger electro oxidation performance on ps mps than that using bdd electrolysis alone for each current density condition these rough and porous structures may also cause a large extent of adsorption of sds and oxidants on its surface and the inside of the plastic material ariza tarazona et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 mao et al 2020 thereby further enhancing the electrocatalysis effect in addition the variations of functional groups in the surface of ps mps after eaop treatments were analyzed by ftir as seen in fig 5 b all ps mps under different treatments show the major absorption peaks in the regions of 4000 400 cm 1 the peaks at 1452 cm 1 and 1493 cm 1 were attributed to the cyclic c h bond stretching vibration cooper and corcoran 2010 and the 1600 cm 1 peak corresponds to the c c vibration of aromatic rings ding et al 2020 these characteristic peaks of the ps alkyl chains can be observed under different eaop treatments in addition the intensities of these functional groups involved in the characteristic structures i e cyclic c h and c c bonds of ps remain stable after the eaop treatments in addition we mainly focused on the stretching vibrations of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups to monitor the oxidation and degradation of mechanical properties in the zoomed carbonyl region only the 1748 cm 1 peak is readable under j of 30 ma cm2 in eaop which was identified as the ch2cooh liu et al 2020 mailhot and gardette 1992b compared with the original ps mps the calculated carbonyl indexes ci of mps were not increased after treatments under all the eaop conditions table 1 although ci is a useful tool to determine the early step degradation of mps in previous photodegradation and biodegradation studies ariza tarazona et al 2020 hadad et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2018 the ci was not sensitive enough in characterizing the more rapid electro degradation of mps similar results have been obtained for the electrooxidation of ps in previous research kiendrebeogo et al 2021 by amplifying the hydroxyl region the peaks that appeared at approximately 3440 cm 1 and 3480 cm 1 were assigned to a typical intermolecularly bonded oh and free oh mailhot and gardette 1992a the vibration of the bonded oh peak was greatly enhanced as the current density of eaop extended from j of 10 to 30 ma cm2 whereas the free oh can only be found under j of 30 ma cm2 the density of these peaks from sds assisted eaop was always higher than those in separate bdd eaop for every applied current density the result was in line with the results of sem the calculated hydroxyl index hi also exhibited a similar trend table 1 which indicates the destruction of the benzene rings of ps in sds assisted eaop under j of 30 ma cm2 ding et al 2020 lucas and porter 1988 3 5 degradation mechanisms of ps mps in sds assisted eaop to show evidence of degradation of ps mps in the sds assisted eaop and to elucidate its mechanisms uplc q orbitrap ms was used to identify the main water soluble transformed products tps the expected tps were identified by matching the observed accurate mass of precursor ion spectra and their ms ms spectra distribution this information as well as the corresponding names retention times the proposed structures and peak intensity for the tps were summarized in table 2 seven tps were identified in electrolytes for ps mps and six tps were identified for sds the explanation for the proposed structures of the identified tps for ps mps and sds was given in figs s5 and s6 respectively based on the identified products of sds the specific degradation pathway of sds was tentatively proposed as shown in fig 6 a at first two formulas were detected as dibasic acids with long alkyl chains sds tp1 c10h18o4 sebacic acid or other isomers and sds tp3 c11h20o4 undecanedioic acid or other isomers which originates from the alkyl sulfate hydrolysis products i e dodecanol etc the sds degradation pathway in the electro oxidation process has also been reported by previous studies araújo et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 nguyen et al 2016 where the sds products of sulfate persulfate and the intermediates with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups were identified therefore we proposed that the alkyl sulfate hydrolysis is the initial step of degradation of sds which was mediated by the electrogenerated oh radicals and the electrode surface escalona durán et al 2019 moreover the relatively low molecular weight species at m z 101 09618 143 06990 195 08632 and 145 05019 were assigned to the alcohol aldehyde or carboxylic acid with short carbon chain sds tp2 sds tp4 sds tp5 and sds tp6 respectively which formed through the further chain cleavage and oxidation pathways all these tps except sds tp3 and tp5 could only be detected in sds assisted eaop which verified that they were the products of sds a last important piece of information about the transformations could be obtained by comparing the variation of the ph values after the electrolysis fig s4 the ph became acidic after the electrolysis only in sds assisted eaop which can be attributed to the vast formation of carboxylic acid and other small molecular products for the ps mps we found an oxidation product with diphenyl rings ps tp4 c17h20o4 which could be assigned to bis hydroxyphenyl pentane diol hydroxyphenyl phenylpentane triol or other isomers two main next degradation steps could be observed for the ps tp4 fig 6 b ps tp3 c11h20o4 was formed through the next alkyl cleavage of the phenylethyl position and then 3 hydroxyphenylethylenglycol ps tp5 c8h10o3 hydroquinone ps tp6 c6h6o2 and benzoic acid ps tp7 c7h6o2 were formed via further oxidation in the phenylethyl position or benzene ring another pathway found for ps tp3 was attacking the benzene ring to open the ring producing esters aldehydes and alcohols ps tp1 and ps tp2 these carboxylated and hydroxylated products were consistent with the results detected in ftir spectra previous studies focusing on the other biotic or abiotic degradation processes of ps mps also have found similar pathways duan et al 2022 li et al 2022 uheida et al 2021 xing et al 2022 indicating that the products in electrolyte solutions were released from the oxygenated surface of ps mps to the best of our knowledge this is the first report regarding the identification of the electro oxidation tps of ps mps based on the above findings the degradation mechanism of ps mps in the sds assisted eaop using bdd anode was proposed at first the probability of directly oxidized ps mps at the anode surface via direct electron transfer is little because of its strong hydrophobicity and low density thus the degradation of ps mps can refer to the formation of strongly oxidizing active radical species it is well known that oh and persulfate play a vital role in the bdd eaop process using sulfate as the electrolyte araújo et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 song et al 2018 trellu et al 2017 as we above mentioned the synergistic mechanisms of sds on bdd electrolysis can be explained by the significantly enhanced production of persulfate fig s1 the production of the radical was slightly inhibited by the addition of sds especially for the eaop system under high current density i e 20 and 30 ma cm2 p 0 05 however according to the conclusion from the previous studies kapałka et al 2009 trellu et al 2017 oh has a very short lifetime and only distributes in the range of 10 nm from the bdd anode surface we deduce that the degradation of ps is driven by persulfate from eqs 4 6 in electrolyte solution rather than oh which is consistent with our above mentioned cv results the acidified electrolyte fig s4 in sds assisted eaop system also tends to generate more persulfate along with the reaction moving forward which is consistent this observation the production of 1o2 and h2o2 were inhibited by the addition of sds whereas the o3 production was promoted fig s1 these results indicated o3 might also be involved in the oxidation of cleavage products of ps therefore the enhancement effect of sds addition on the degradation of ps mps can be explained in the following two ways 1 activation in the generation of available persulfate and other stable oxidants i e o3 to attack the ps molecules and 2 dispersion of microplastics in solution and improvement in the adsorption of inorganic ions including persulfate on ps surface by changing the hydrophobicity it is important to highlight that the sds concentration in electrolytic solution was less than its cmc about 1500 mg l according to escalona durán et al 2019 which can confirm sds behaves only as monomers during the eaop process if the sds concentration of eaop exceeds cmc most of the eaop time the steric hindrance of micelles may restrict the degradation this effect has been confirmed in the electro oxidation of several dissolved organic pollutants dos santos et al 2015 fabbri et al 2004 silva et al 2021 trellu et al 2017 however for the eaop degradation of mps the concentration effect of surfactants still needs to be further verified the enhancement of adsorption for mps to inorganic radical species may vary according to the surfactant species cationic surfactants can make the mps have positive charges which attracts persulfate by electrostatic and ionic bonding whereas it can also competitively adsorb non polar anions shen et al 2021 anionic surfactants such as sds have opposite mechanisms therefore future studies are also needed on the corresponding effects of different surfactants on the eaop degradation of mps 3 6 toxicity evaluation the acute toxicity evaluation results using vibrio fischeri are shown in fig s7 sds has previously attracted attention about its aquatic ecotoxicity han et al 2020 and the sds contained electrolyte 500 mg l exhibited an inhibition to vibrio fischeri after 48 h of exposure the acute toxicology of the electrolyte to vibrio fischeri cannot be largely reduced along with the half amount of sds removal in the eaop system we also found that the inhibition rates were still more than 90 9 and 17 0 in electrolytes after 72 h of treatment under j of 10 and 20 ma cm2 respectively even though almost all the initial amount of sds was removed this indicates the presence of persistent and toxic products of sds in the electrolytes the toxicities of electrolyte samples after 72 h of treatment under 30 ma cm2 could be effectively reduced by the eaop process chronic toxicity results fig s7 also revealed similar trends the chronic toxicity of the electrolytes to chlorella vulgaris was almost nil 5 01 to 22 4 after 72 h treatment under j of 30 ma cm2 this means that total removal of the toxic intermediates of sds in this condition and that there is a very low secondary risk to increase ecotoxicity as a result of the sds addition under the present eaop conditions 3 7 energy consumption and cost analysis we analyzed the energy consumption in the sds assisted eaop under various conditions table s2 concerning the degradation of ps mps the addition of sds in 72 h of eaop led to an increase in mps removal efficiency but a decrease in energy consumption ec the decreased energy consumption ec of the sds assisted eaop is directly related to the decreased electrical potential at constant electrical current intensity after sds addition which is due to the higher availability of free so4 provided by sds for oxidation by bdd oh trellu et al 2017 another important feature is that when considering the ec per percent of mps removal the values for sds assisted eaop could be extremely lower than those obtained for bdd eaop alone because of the elevated ps removal efficiency sds can act both as a persulfate source and a homogenization promoter for polymers escalona durán et al 2020 silva et al 2021 the higher efficiency of the formation of persulfate radicals and the weaker mass transfer limitation can favor lower energy requirements in the bdd electrolysis system in addition the cost benefit relationship was estimated for the eaop to indicate the operating costs regarding operating costs it can be observed that electric energy accounts for the dominant proportion relative to the electrolytes and surfactants in the eaop the surfactant cost in sds assisted eaop is less than 0 05 of the total operating cost considering the removal of ps mps sds assisted eaop under a current density of 30 ma cm2 is the best condition because a significantly higher removal efficiency was obtained without inducing toxicity and a substantial increase in the total operating cost it is worth noting that with the future scale up of the process the eaop strategy will exhibit better economic significance these results imply that the addition of surfactant sds is a feasible technique to improve the eaop efficiency of microplastics or maybe other insoluble organic pollutants which is beneficial to its practical application 4 conclusion this study proposed an sds assisted eaop strategy for ps mps treatment and investigated its performance and the underlying mechanisms in the sds assisted eaop strategy sds concentration can be maintained at relatively higher levels for most of the time and completely eliminated at the end of electrolysis without inducing additional ecotoxicity the eaop strategy could achieve more than 40 mps removal in a current density of 30 ma cm2 under a very high mps concentration 2 g l where appreciable enhancement efficiency is obtained in sds assisted eaop compared to the bdd electrolysis alone through sem observations ftir characterization and product identification it was concluded that the chain scissions and oxidation led to the degradation of the mps in eaop the sds addition could activate persulfate generation and improve the adsorption of oxidants on mps surface thereby exerting the enhancement effect cost analysis showed that the surfactant cost was far lower than that of energy consumption in the eaop strategy in general this study proves that sds assisted bdd eaop is a potential technology for the small batch

15379,microplastics have been identified as a kind of emerging pollutant with potential ecological risks and it is an urgent endeavor to find proper technologies for their remediation electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop technology has exhibited robust performance in the removal of various refractory organic pollutants in this study we explored a new remediation strategy for polystyrene microplastics ps mps introducing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to enhance its degradation performance in boron doped diamond bdd anode adopted eaop at first we investigated the degradation behaviors of sds in the bdd electrolysis according to the sds half life under various current densities the sds addition strategy into eaop is proposed that is supplement sds to 500 mg l at every half life during electrolysis except the last cycle results indicated that sds addition greatly enhanced mps degradation rate in 72 h of eaop about 1 35 2 29 times higher than that in bdd electrolysis alone the sds assisted eaop also led to more obvious changes in the particle size morphology and functional groups of the mps after treatment a variety of alkyl cleavage and oxidation products were identified which attributed to the strong attack of oxidants i e persulfate on the mps the enhanced persulfate generation and oxidants adsorption on mps can explain the enhancement effect in the eaop strategy cost analysis results showed the surfactant only accounts for 0 05 of the total operating costs in the sds assisted eaop in general the current study provided new insight into the effective way to improve the eaop efficiency of microplastics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics surfactant boron doped diamond bdd electrolysis synergistic effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years microplastics mps pollution has been attracted worldwide attention as an emerging and ubiquitous contaminant in the aquatic environment yuan et al 2022 microplastics are commonly defined as plastic pieces and particles less than 5 mm in diameter thompson et al 2004 with diverse sources from specific materials i e cosmetics cleaning agents and coatings and broken pieces of large plastics wang et al 2022 microplastics are widely detected in aquatic environments and effluent discharge from wastewater and sewage treatment plants wwtps has been identified as the main source iyare et al 2020 wong et al 2020 the potential ecological and health risks of microplastics are of increasing public concern during the last two decades currently the main technologies for microplastic removal can be divided into coagulation filtration biodegradation photocatalysis and other advanced oxidation treatments in coagulation physical treatment technology the removal efficiency in primary treatment varies with the composition and size of microplastics ahmed et al 2022 ultrafiltration nanofiltration and permeation can exert a good removal effect on microplastics of small size but they all require high operating costs and maintenance costs for the membranes ma et al 2019 talvitie et al 2017 most biodegradation methods are difficult to achieve the desired effects due to the relatively severe operating conditions ahmed et al 2022 the treatment efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation depends on the microplastic properties and the recovery and reuse rate of photocatalysts ariza tarazona et al 2019 wang et al 2019 therefore cost effective and highly efficient remediation technologies are urgently needed for microplastic removal from the aquatic environments in comparison electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop technology has advantages in terms of simple operation low secondary pollution and robust performance which has been proven to effectively degrade various toxic or refractory organic pollutants radjenovic and sedlak 2015 among them boron doped diamond bdd used as an anode has been studied extensively in recent years except for the degradation of dissolvable organic pollutants such as pesticides dyes and other persistent pollutants polystyrene ps microplastics have also been reported to achieve degradation in bdd eaop kiendrebeogo et al 2021 bdd anode has a relatively high overpotential for o2 evolution cai et al 2019 and consequently exhibits powerful oxidation capacity through the generation of oh by water electrolysis on the anode surface samet et al 2010 however in bdd eaop the electrolysis efficiency for a pollutant is controlled by its transport rate from the bulk solution to the bdd anode surface chen et al 2022 martínez huitle et al 2015 in addition in the removal of hydrophobic pollutants using eaop techniques their oxidation may deactivate the electrode through the formation of polymers on the electrode surface trellu et al 2017 since microplastics are highly hydrophobic and insoluble their degradation in bdd eaop is limited by the adsorption efficiency of oxidants on mps in the previous study the high degradation rate of ps mps can only be observed at a very high current intensity 108 4 ma cm2 kiendrebeogo et al 2021 surfactants have the ability to improve homogenization modify surface properties and equilibrium interfacial tension chang et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and other surfactants are widely used to remediate contaminated soils through actively solubilizing hydrophobic pollutants laha et al 2009 rathankumar et al 2022 sáez et al 2010 in recent years researchers have unexpectedly found the presence of sds around its critical micellar concentration cmc can improve the pollutants degradation from wastewater in eaop escalona durán et al 2020 escalona durán et al 2019 fabbri et al 2004 silva et al 2021 trellu et al 2017 in addition extra persulfate can be electrochemically produced from oxidizing sds by the bdd anode which enhances its oxidation performance araújo et al 2018 however if a higher concentration cmc of surfactants was introduced in the eaop system the formation of micelles can strongly hinder the treatment efficiency dionisio et al 2019 silva et al 2021 trellu et al 2017 it also should be noted that sds is a kind of important pollutant but it can be completely decomposed by electrocatalysis nguyen et al 2016 therefore in the sds assisted eaop suitable working conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the effective removal of pollutants without introducing additional pollution ps is one of the widely used plastics in foam products various instrument housings capacitor dielectric layers and cosmetics oral et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 turner 2020 resulting in its widespread distribution in the aquatic environment for its microplastics ahmed et al 2022 in this study sds assisted eaop treatment of ps mps was explored using bdd anode the specific objectives of this study are to i investigate the degradation kinetics of sds during eaop under

analysis the mps degradation was determined by a gravimetric technique following ariza tarazona et al 2020 briefly the filtered and air dried mps were quantified using an electronic balance ax224zh ohaus usa and the degradation rate was calculated as the mass loss 1 mps degradation rate m 0 m m 0 100 where m0 is the initial mass of the ps mps and m is the mass after 72 h of electrolysis the sds

electrolysis alone and sds assisted eaop respectively the energy consumption kwh of sds and mps degradation was calculated according to the following equation teng et al 2020 3 energy consumption u i t v s where u v is the applied voltage i the applied current a t h the degradation time and vs l the system volume the operating costs of sds assisted eaop can be estimated as the sum of energy costs electrolyte costs and surfactant costs kiendrebeogo et al 2021 2 7 ecotoxicity assay the acute biotoxicity of the eaop electrolyte was evaluated according to the bioluminescence inhibition assay with vibrio fischeri parvez et al 2006 the assay was carried out in triplicate approximately 200 μl of diluted bacteria suspension and 100 μl of the filtered sample 0 22 μm were added to each plate the 0 2 mol l sodium sulfate solution without sds was used as a control the luminescence for samples was measured using microtox toxicity test system carlsbad ca usa after 15 min at 15 c and results were expressed as the percentage of bioluminescence inhibition the chronic toxicity was assessed for samples collected from solutions before during the first half life of sds degradation and after the kinetic experiments based on the well described chlorella vulgaris assay zhu et al 2020 algae suspensions were exposed to the filtered electrolyte samples 0 22 μm for 72 h at a temperature of 27 c and a light intensity of 1000 3000 lx comprising five replicates for each time tests were also performed in triplicate with blank assays toxic effects were calculated from the growth inhibition ratio of algae biomass compared with the control cell number counts were determined using a neubauer camera 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical behaviors of sds ps mps and their mixture fig 2 a shows the oxidation behavior of sds at elevated concentrations by cyclic voltammograms cvs on the bdd anode during the scan an irreversible oxidation peak appeared from 0 8 to 1 0 v sce and the peak increased with increasing sds concentrations from 0 6 to 2 4 mm this demonstrates that the anodic oxidation of sds occurs in this potential zone the oxidation current is attributed to the oxygen evolution reaction that started at 1 3 v on the bdd anode which reflected the wide potential window of the bdd electrode de moura et al 2015 the reduction peaks appearing at 0 1 v indicated the oxidizing species which might be formed from the oxidation of sulfate in the previous oxidizing environment cai et al 2019 this result indicated that the sds can be deposited on the bdd surface to cause their oxidization the promotion effect of sds on oxidation of ps mps during bdd electrolysis was also investigated by cyclic voltammetry fig 2 b as can be observed there is no obvious oxidation peak in the potential of 0 8 to 1 0 v sce for the ps mps it has been proved that the oxidation of organics in bdd electrolysis can be mainly attributed to the free hydroxyl radicals oh on the anode surface medeiros de araújo et al 2014 michaud et al 2003 and the oxidation process of bdd anode leads to a more hydrophilic surface because of the formation of c o c o c and c oh functionalities wang et al 2009 conversely the high hydrophobicity may reduce the transportation efficiency of ps mps to the electrode surface and hinder the surface absorbability of ps mps to oh thereby leading to low current response in the cv however the addition of 1 8 mm sds improved the current response in both oxidation and reduction peaks of cv in addition the onset potential v onset for the sds and ps mps mixture 1 25 v was lower than that of ps mps only 1 32 v during bdd electrolysis the increase in current response and decrease in v onset indicated that sds addition facilitated water dissociation on the bdd anode surface to produce oh and other subsequent oxidants chen et al 2022 song et al 2018 3 2 degradation kinetics of sds as it is well known surfactants are considered important pollutants in wastewater for this reason we explored the degradation kinetics of sds in the bdd electrolysis system before using sds as an auxiliary reagent in the electrochemical treatment the degradation of sds was studied at a concentration of 500 mg l according to the estimated ideal concentration for enhancing the degradation of other organic compounds from the previous studies araújo et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 degradation kinetics of sds proceeded according to pseudo first order kinetic under various current densities fig 3 a the degradation rates of sds k increased obviously as the current densities j increased from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 and the corresponding half lives t 1 2 were 9 00 5 87 and 2 74 h respectively table s1 this enhancement of sds oxidation at a higher applied current density is directly related to the increased production and thickness of the surface bdd oh layer for alleviating the steric hindrance effect davis et al 2014 as can be observed fig s1 the increase of steady state oh concentrations in systems occurred when increasing the j from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 the accumulation of 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone o3 also followed the expected trend with the increase of current densities these nonradical oxidates exhibit excellent catalytic durability acosta santoyo et al 2021 luo et al 2019 which promotes the degradation of sds in solution in addition when using sulfate ion as the supporting electrolyte the release of persulfate can be also promoted at higher j via the following two mechanisms eqs 4 6 araújo et al 2018 rocha et al 2012 4 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 5 bdd oh so 4 2 bdd s o 4 h o 6 bdd s o 4 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 e as a more stable oxidant persulfate can migrate and remain in the electrolyte solution thereby providing so4 to the attack of organic substrates davis et al 2014 notably the accumulation of persulfate can not only be evolved from free sulfate ions in the electrolyte but also from the degradation of the sds eq 7 araújo et al 2018 7 sds bdd oh or s 2 o 8 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 an increase in current density caused a more significant effect on the persulfate accumulation in the sds assisted systems compared to the eaop system in absence of sds fig s1 therefore although the initial degradation of sds will compete with some extents of oxidants its degradation process will complementally produce extra oxidants participating in the reaction for other substances in the solution 3 3 the degradation of ps mps in an sds assisted eaop strategy sds is an efficient surfactant that can enhance the interaction between the electro generated oxidative species and insoluble compounds escalona durán et al 2019 when using sds in eaop treatment of ps mps it is required to maintain enough sds concentration for producing higher concentrations of persulfate in most of the electrolysis times taking into account the critical micellar concentration of sds about 1500 mg l according to escalona durán et al 2019 and its degradation kinetics in the bdd electrolysis system we proposed an sds assisted eaop strategy for various current densities as shown in fig 1 b except for the addition of sds at the beginning of electrolysis sds was supplemented in each half life to reach the initial dose corresponding to the j of 10 20 and 30 ma cm2 the time intervals for sds supplementation were set as 9 h 6 h and 3 h respectively figs 1 b and s2 this can ensure that the sds concentration in the electrolytic system is always greater than 200 mg l except in the last cycle then it is important to confirm the residual sds was eliminated at the end of the eaop as seen in figs 1 b and s2 high sds removal 99 2 was reached after 72 h of electrolysis independent of all the cases on the basis of ensuring the nearly full elimination of sds in eaop we explored the enhancement of sds assisted strategy on the degradation of ps mps fig 3 b in the bdd electrolysis alone the 72 h degradation rate of ps from solution was increased from j of 0 3 83 to 30 ma cm2 18 5 similar conclusions were also found in previous studies about the influence of current density on the electro oxidation of ps mps on bdd anode kiendrebeogo et al 2021 due to the lower initial concentration of ps applied in the electrolysis system 100 mg l of 26 μm diameter ps they found a relatively higher degradation rate 6 h 89 at a current density of 108 4 ma cm2 kiendrebeogo et al 2021 this indicates that increasing the current density has higher promoting effects on the degradation of ps mps for the sds assisted eaop it was also observed that the higher applied j the higher the degradation rate of ps table 1 the sds assisted eaop can exhibit enhancement coefficients at the 72 h degradation rate of ps 126 relative to that of bdd electrolysis alone these results clearly indicate that enough concentration of sds can enhance the elimination of ps mps by oxidants produced electrochemically the synergistic effect can be attributed to electrochemical activation achieved at the bdd anode we also analyzed the particle size distribution of ps mps before and after different eaop conditions fig 4 the average size of the ps mps declined from 18 5 15 2 to 13 3 6 59 μm after 30 ma cm2 of bdd electrolysis alone p 0 05 and further decreased to 7 90 5 68 μm after 72 h sds assisted eaop treatment p 0 05 and the decreasing trends of mp size were also observed from bdd electrolysis alone to sds assisted eaop under other current densities fig s3 this indicated that the ps mps were gradually broken into smaller sized particles in the eaop treatment especially for the sds assisted strategy therefore upgrading the bdd electrolysis to sds assisted eaop is beneficial to the degradation of hydrophobic ps mps 3 4 the variations of surface morphology of ps mps after eaop the surface morphology is an important parameter for evaluating its degradation degree and mechanisms for mps sun et al 2021 wang et al 2017 as shown in the sem micrographs the pristine ps mps have a non porous smooth surface fig 5 a after 72 h of treatment under various eaop conditions the ps mps surface accumulated rough cracks and cavities the changes in surface morphology increased with the increase of current density in eaop and the presence of sds possessed stronger electro oxidation performance on ps mps than that using bdd electrolysis alone for each current density condition these rough and porous structures may also cause a large extent of adsorption of sds and oxidants on its surface and the inside of the plastic material ariza tarazona et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 mao et al 2020 thereby further enhancing the electrocatalysis effect in addition the variations of functional groups in the surface of ps mps after eaop treatments were analyzed by ftir as seen in fig 5 b all ps mps under different treatments show the major absorption peaks in the regions of 4000 400 cm 1 the peaks at 1452 cm 1 and 1493 cm 1 were attributed to the cyclic c h bond stretching vibration cooper and corcoran 2010 and the 1600 cm 1 peak corresponds to the c c vibration of aromatic rings ding et al 2020 these characteristic peaks of the ps alkyl chains can be observed under different eaop treatments in addition the intensities of these functional groups involved in the characteristic structures i e cyclic c h and c c bonds of ps remain stable after the eaop treatments in addition we mainly focused on the stretching vibrations of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups to monitor the oxidation and degradation of mechanical properties in the zoomed carbonyl region only the 1748 cm 1 peak is readable under j of 30 ma cm2 in eaop which was identified as the ch2cooh liu et al 2020 mailhot and gardette 1992b compared with the original ps mps the calculated carbonyl indexes ci of mps were not increased after treatments under all the eaop conditions table 1 although ci is a useful tool to determine the early step degradation of mps in previous photodegradation and biodegradation studies ariza tarazona et al 2020 hadad et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2018 the ci was not sensitive enough in characterizing the more rapid electro degradation of mps similar results have been obtained for the electrooxidation of ps in previous research kiendrebeogo et al 2021 by amplifying the hydroxyl region the peaks that appeared at approximately 3440 cm 1 and 3480 cm 1 were assigned to a typical intermolecularly bonded oh and free oh mailhot and gardette 1992a the vibration of the bonded oh peak was greatly enhanced as the current density of eaop extended from j of 10 to 30 ma cm2 whereas the free oh can only be found under j of 30 ma cm2 the density of these peaks from sds assisted eaop was always higher than those in separate bdd eaop for every applied current density the result was in line with the results of sem the calculated hydroxyl index hi also exhibited a similar trend table 1 which indicates the destruction of the benzene rings of ps in sds assisted eaop under j of 30 ma cm2 ding et al 2020 lucas and porter 1988 3 5 degradation mechanisms of ps mps in sds assisted eaop to show evidence of degradation of ps mps in the sds assisted eaop and to elucidate its mechanisms uplc q orbitrap ms was used to identify the main water soluble transformed products tps the expected tps were identified by matching the observed accurate mass of precursor ion spectra and their ms ms spectra distribution this information as well as the corresponding names retention times the proposed structures and peak intensity for the tps were summarized in table 2 seven tps were identified in electrolytes for ps mps and six tps were identified for sds the explanation for the proposed structures of the identified tps for ps mps and sds was given in figs s5 and s6 respectively based on the identified products of sds the specific degradation pathway of sds was tentatively proposed as shown in fig 6 a at first two formulas were detected as dibasic acids with long alkyl chains sds tp1 c10h18o4 sebacic acid or other isomers and sds tp3 c11h20o4 undecanedioic acid or other isomers which originates from the alkyl sulfate hydrolysis products i e dodecanol etc the sds degradation pathway in the electro oxidation process has also been reported by previous studies araújo et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 nguyen et al 2016 where the sds products of sulfate persulfate and the intermediates with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups were identified therefore we proposed that the alkyl sulfate hydrolysis is the initial step of degradation of sds which was mediated by the electrogenerated oh radicals and the electrode surface escalona durán et al 2019 moreover the relatively low molecular weight species at m z 101 09618 143 06990 195 08632 and 145 05019 were assigned to the alcohol aldehyde or carboxylic acid with short carbon chain sds tp2 sds tp4 sds tp5 and sds tp6 respectively which formed through the further chain cleavage and oxidation pathways all these tps except sds tp3 and tp5 could only be detected in sds assisted eaop which verified that they were the products of sds a last important piece of information about the transformations could be obtained by comparing the variation of the ph values after the electrolysis fig s4 the ph became acidic after the electrolysis only in sds assisted eaop which can be attributed to the vast formation of carboxylic acid and other small molecular products for the ps mps we found an oxidation product with diphenyl rings ps tp4 c17h20o4 which could be assigned to bis hydroxyphenyl pentane diol hydroxyphenyl phenylpentane triol or other isomers two main next degradation steps could be observed for the ps tp4 fig 6 b ps tp3 c11h20o4 was formed through the next alkyl cleavage of the phenylethyl position and then 3 hydroxyphenylethylenglycol ps tp5 c8h10o3 hydroquinone ps tp6 c6h6o2 and benzoic acid ps tp7 c7h6o2 were formed via further oxidation in the phenylethyl position or benzene ring another pathway found for ps tp3 was attacking the benzene ring to open the ring producing esters aldehydes and alcohols ps tp1 and ps tp2 these carboxylated and hydroxylated products were consistent with the results detected in ftir spectra previous studies focusing on the other biotic or abiotic degradation processes of ps mps also have found similar pathways duan et al 2022 li et al 2022 uheida et al 2021 xing et al 2022 indicating that the products in electrolyte solutions were released from the oxygenated surface of ps mps to the best of our knowledge this is the first report regarding the identification of the electro oxidation tps of ps mps based on the above findings the degradation mechanism of ps mps in the sds assisted eaop using bdd anode was proposed at first the probability of directly oxidized ps mps at the anode surface via direct electron transfer is little because of its strong hydrophobicity and low density thus the degradation of ps mps can refer to the formation of strongly oxidizing active radical species it is well known that oh and persulfate play a vital role in the bdd eaop process using sulfate as the electrolyte araújo et al 2018 escalona durán et al 2019 song et al 2018 trellu et al 2017 as we above mentioned the synergistic mechanisms of sds on bdd electrolysis can be explained by the significantly enhanced production of persulfate fig s1 the production of the radical was slightly inhibited by the addition of sds especially for the eaop system under high current density i e 20 and 30 ma cm2 p 0 05 however according to the conclusion from the previous studies kapałka et al 2009 trellu et al 2017 oh has a very short lifetime and only distributes in the range of 10 nm from the bdd anode surface we deduce that the degradation of ps is driven by persulfate from eqs 4 6 in electrolyte solution rather than oh which is consistent with our above mentioned cv results the acidified electrolyte fig s4 in sds assisted eaop system also tends to generate more persulfate along with the reaction moving forward which is consistent this observation the production of 1o2 and h2o2 were inhibited by the addition of sds whereas the o3 production was promoted fig s1 these results indicated o3 might also be involved in the oxidation of cleavage products of ps therefore the enhancement effect of sds addition on the degradation of ps mps can be explained in the following two ways 1 activation in the generation of available persulfate and other stable oxidants i e o3 to attack the ps molecules and 2 dispersion of microplastics in solution and improvement in the adsorption of inorganic ions including persulfate on ps surface by changing the hydrophobicity it is important to highlight that the sds concentration in electrolytic solution was less than its cmc about 1500 mg l according to escalona durán et al 2019 which can confirm sds behaves only as monomers during the eaop process if the sds concentration of eaop exceeds cmc most of the eaop time the steric hindrance of micelles may restrict the degradation this effect has been confirmed in the electro oxidation of several dissolved organic pollutants dos santos et al 2015 fabbri et al 2004 silva et al 2021 trellu et al 2017 however for the eaop degradation of mps the concentration effect of surfactants still needs to be further verified the enhancement of adsorption for mps to inorganic radical species may vary according to the surfactant species cationic surfactants can make the mps have positive charges which attracts persulfate by electrostatic and ionic bonding whereas it can also competitively adsorb non polar anions shen et al 2021 anionic surfactants such as sds have opposite mechanisms therefore future studies are also needed on the corresponding effects of different surfactants on the eaop degradation of mps 3 6 toxicity evaluation the acute toxicity evaluation results using vibrio fischeri are shown in fig s7 sds has previously attracted attention about its aquatic ecotoxicity han et al 2020 and the sds contained electrolyte 500 mg l exhibited an inhibition to vibrio fischeri after 48 h of exposure the acute toxicology of the electrolyte to vibrio fischeri cannot be largely reduced along with the half amount of sds removal in the eaop system we also found that the inhibition rates were still more than 90 9 and 17 0 in electrolytes after 72 h of treatment under j of 10 and 20 ma cm2 respectively even though almost all the initial amount of sds was removed this indicates the presence of persistent and toxic products of sds in the electrolytes the toxicities of electrolyte samples after 72 h of treatment under 30 ma cm2 could be effectively reduced by the eaop process chronic toxicity results fig s7 also revealed similar trends the chronic toxicity of the electrolytes to chlorella vulgaris was almost nil 5 01 to 22 4 after 72 h treatment under j of 30 ma cm2 this means that total removal of the toxic intermediates of sds in this condition and that there is a very low secondary risk to increase ecotoxicity as a result of the sds addition under the present eaop conditions 3 7 energy consumption and cost analysis we analyzed the energy consumption in the sds assisted eaop under various conditions table s2 concerning the degradation of ps mps the addition of sds in 72 h of eaop led to an increase in mps removal efficiency but a decrease in energy consumption ec the decreased energy consumption ec of the sds assisted eaop is directly related to the decreased electrical potential at constant electrical current intensity after sds addition which is due to the higher availability of free so4 provided by sds for oxidation by bdd oh trellu et al 2017 another important feature is that when considering the ec per percent of mps removal the values for sds assisted eaop could be extremely lower than those obtained for bdd eaop alone because of the elevated ps removal efficiency sds can act both as a persulfate source and a homogenization promoter for polymers escalona durán et al 2020 silva et al 2021 the higher efficiency of the formation of persulfate radicals and the weaker mass transfer limitation can favor lower energy requirements in the bdd electrolysis system in addition the cost benefit relationship was estimated for the eaop to indicate the operating costs regarding operating costs it can be observed that electric energy accounts for the dominant proportion relative to the electrolytes and surfactants in the eaop the surfactant cost in sds assisted eaop is less than 0 05 of the total operating cost considering the removal of ps mps sds assisted eaop under a current density of 30 ma cm2 is the best condition because a significantly higher removal efficiency was obtained without inducing toxicity and a substantial increase in the total operating cost it is worth noting that with the future scale up of the process the eaop strategy will exhibit better economic significance these results imply that the addition of surfactant sds is a feasible technique to improve the eaop efficiency of microplastics or maybe other insoluble organic pollutants which is beneficial to its practical application 4 conclusion this study proposed an sds assisted eaop strategy for ps mps treatment and investigated its performance and the underlying mechanisms in the sds assisted eaop strategy sds concentration can be maintained at relatively higher levels for most of the time and completely eliminated at the end of electrolysis without inducing additional ecotoxicity the eaop strategy could achieve more than 40 mps removal in a current density of 30 ma cm2 under a very high mps concentration 2 g l where appreciable enhancement efficiency is obtained in sds assisted eaop compared to the bdd electrolysis alone through sem observations ftir characterization and product identification it was concluded that the chain scissions and oxidation led to the degradation of the mps in eaop the sds addition could activate persulfate generation and improve the adsorption of oxidants on mps surface thereby exerting the enhancement effect cost analysis showed that the surfactant cost was far lower than that of energy consumption in the eaop strategy in general this study proves that sds assisted bdd eaop is a potential technology for the small batch treatment of microplastics in wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this manuscript for publication in the water research
