20835,lazy wave risers can mitigate the kinematic coupling between floating structure and riser touchdown zone tdz so as to improve its fatigue life however due to the introduction of buoyancy blocks nonlinear dynamic response and fatigue damage prediction will be more complicated in this paper a concept of multiple lazy wave riser namely deepwater lazy wave riser configuration based on multiple waveform serial arrangement is proposed according to the improved slender rod theory and equivalent optimization of buoyancy sections three riser configurations with different heave excitations and currents are structured the dynamic response characteristics excitation motion transfer paths and fatigue damage hotspots are well compared moreover the influence law of riser fatigue damage and decoupling mechanism of riser tdz movements are also explored the results indicate that by constructing lazy wave configuration deepwater risers based on lazy wave configuration can attenuate the kinematic coupled response of floating structure in the first sag bend section and reduce the normal motion response in the riser tdz so as to optimize its anti fatigue performance compared with lazy wave riser multiple lazy wave riser has some competitiveness in the anti fatigue performance for the riser tdz for flexible risers this competitiveness will become even more prominent keywords

development however with the continuous increase of water depth and increasingly harsh environment steel catenary risers are subjected to reciprocating movement of floating structure on the top irregular hydrodynamic loads and cyclic soil resistances which may cause excessive bending stress and fatigue damage to the riser top region and tdz therefore petrobras r d center torres et al 2002 2003 conducted a large number of studies on the extreme load analysis vortex induced vibration analysis and fatigue analysis for different riser configurations and found that lazy wave riser is a more suitable configuration for deep water in terms of structural performance and economy as shown in fig 1 a certain number of buoyancy blocks are bound at equal intervals in the lower half of the riser and the buoyancy provided by the buoyancy block would cause the riser to arch and thus produce a lazy wave shape fergestad et al 2014 this arrangement can effectively reduce the tension at the top of the riser and alleviate the coupling effect of floating structure movement in the riser tdz thus improving the fatigue life of this hot spot region therefore it has been more and more widely applied to deepwater oil and gas development nowadays the research on lazy wave riser has drawn more attention taking the maximum dynamic stress fatigue life engineering cost and buoyancy section parameters as optimization objectives tanaka et al 2006 pina et al 2011 yang et al 2012 and ai et al 2019 adopted genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm and quasi newton method to carry out the configuration optimization design for lazy wave riser thus obtained the optimized parameters such as the number dimension and installation location of buoyancy blocks in addition sun and wang 2013 studied the influence rules for mechanical properties of deepwater lazy wave risers under different layout parameters and pointed out that the size and installation position of buoyancy blocks were highly sensitive parameters kim et al 2015 indicated that steel lazy wave risers can effectively reduce the local dynamic buckling in the riser tdz and the stress at the touchdown point tdp and the short term fatigue damage is relatively small later wang et al 2015 2018 combined euler bernoulli beam theory and keller box finite difference method to establish a mechanical analysis model for deepwater lazy wave risers and found that the floating structure motion internal flow and current load have significant influences on the mechanical properties of lazy wave risers considering the boundary effect in the tdz and internal flow velocity ruan et al 2019 proposed an efficient approach for evaluating the static stress range of lazy wave steel risers in deepwater under the action of vessel slow drift motion and ocean current coupling cheng et al 2020 employed a nonlinear finite element method to investigate the impacts of motion amplitude motion period buoyancy segment length wave current load internal ﬂow and seabed friction on the dynamic behavior of steel lazy wave riser then oh et al 2020 put forward the simulation based design process to find the optimal shape of steel lazy wave riser at the installation besides amaechi et al 2018 2019 deeply investigated the dynamic response of submarine hoses on catenary anchor leg moorings buoys with different layout configurations the above papers have carried out in depth studies on the dynamic response and fatigue damage of lazy wave risers but have not conducted further research on the mechanism of how to achieve the dynamic response and fatigue damage optimization of deepwater risers by constructing lazy wave layout configurations in this paper a developed rod theory is put forward that fully considers the influence factors such as the riser internal fluid as well as the interaction between seabed and riser as the buoyancy blocks are discretely attached to in the lower half of lazy wave riser at equal intervals equivalent parameters of buoyancy section are introduced based on the principle of equivalent optimization to further explore the dynamic response and fatigue damage optimization mechanism of deepwater lazy wave risers based on multiple waveform serial arrangement three kinds of different riser configurations i e catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are chosen and applied to the proposed theoretical model then the axial and normal motions static dynamic tensions bending moments and fatigue damage of deepwater risers under different layout configurations are well compared and analyzed it can provide some reference value for the configuration design and structure optimization of lazy wave riser in deepwater 2 mathematical formulation for lazy wave riser considering that the length diameter ratio of deepwater riser is very large the configuration position and instantaneous shape of lazy wave riser are described by the riser axis line and its dynamic response characteristics can be solved based on the modified slender rod theory nordgren 1974 garrett 1982 the greatest advantage of this theory is that its motion governing equation is directly established in the global coordinate system which can eliminate the time consuming coordinate transformation from local coordinate system to global coordinate system and greatly improve the calculation efficiency moreover include all the geometric and boundary nonlinear characteristics 2 1 governing equation as displayed in fig 2 in the three dimensional cartesian coordinate system the configuration position and instantaneous shape of deepwater riser are expressed by the position vector r s t which is a function of riser arc length s and time t based on the right hand screw rule the orthogonal coordinate vector of any point on the axis of slender rod can be denoted as t n b including the tangent direction unit vector t r normal direction unit vector n r r and sub normal direction unit vector b t n according to euler bernoulli beam theory it is assumed that the cross section of offshore riser is always perpendicular to the axis line that is the shear deformation for the cross section of the riser is not considered since there is no distributed moment acting on the risers and mooring lines and the torque is also very small the distributed moment and torque are not taken into consideration in the proposed modified slender rod theory to study the mechanics of marine risers and mooring lines based on the principle of momentum conservation and moment of momentum conservation fig 3 the motion balance equation of deepwater lazy wave riser can be established 1 ei r λ r q ρ r where λ t w ei κ 2 the distributed external load vector on the unit riser length q includes the additional mass force drag force and froude krylov force the superscript represents the partial derivative of time denotes the partial derivative of arc length the additional mass force drag force and froude krylov force acting on the riser can be calculated by the following formulas respectively 2 q f i s t ρ o a o c a n c a t t a f r 3 q f d s t 1 2 ρ o d o c

n i t as the fluid flow field in the riser is very complex to analyze the internal flow is assumed as a plug flow for simplification of analysis in this paper in addition the velocity of fluid transport on the cross section of the riser is treated as constant according to païdoussis s work 2014 the force induced by plug flow in the riser can be derived as 6 q f l o w ρ i a i t u s 2 r ρ i a i r 2 u r u 2 r where the first term at the right end of the above equation is the inertial force caused by the internal flow the second term is the coriolis force caused by the rotation of the riser the third term is the centripetal force caused by the change of the flow direction of the fluid to keep the same curvature as the riser finally the motion equilibrium equation for an inextensible slender rod with equal principal stiffness in the rod theory model can be revised as follows 7 m r 2 ρ i a i u r e i r λ r q 8 m ρ t a t ρ i a i i ρ i a i c a n ρ i a i c a t t 9 q ρ o a o ρ t a t ρ i

to the transient position of offshore riser which are affected by the wave current load and floating structure motion therefore equation 7 behaves strong nonlinear characteristics in addition λ t w p o a o p i a i ρ i a i u 2 is the improved lagrange multiplier taking the effects of hydrostatic pressure internal fluid velocity and axial deformation caused by circumferential stress the axial deformation is proportional to poisson s ratio into account the modified axial deformation constraint equation can be derived based on the assumption of small expansion deformation 10 1 2 r r 1 λ 1 2 υ p o a o p i a i ρ i a i u 2 e a 0 considering that the riser is subjected to the action of sea water and fluid hydrostatic pressure the hydrostatic internal and external pressures on the riser at different riser positions is defined compared with the external hydrostatic pressure it is necessary to think about the internal pressure of riser top end in this modified rod theory model the internal pressure of riser top end is set to be equivalent to the height of hydrostatic pressure for numerical calculation moreover the outer diameter weight per unit length and hydrodynamic coefficients of buoyancy section are different from the bare riser parameters in this study the winkler foundation model and modified coulomb friction model are employed to actually simulate the vertical and lateral riser seabed interaction respectively guo et al 2019 2 2 equivalent optimization of buoyancy section as illustrated in fig 4 in practical offshore engineering the buoyancy blocks are clamped on the lower half section of the riser to make the buoyancy and gravity act on the suspended riser together to form a waveform system layout so as to effectively decouple the kinematic relationship between the riser tdz and the floating structure and reduce the tension at the top of the riser buoyancy blocks are usually made of composite foams with low water absorbency and have low fluid separation characteristics in order to avoid the change of riser layout caused by the slippage of buoyancy blocks it is very necessary to ensure that the buoyancy blocks are tightly bound to the riser body in practical engineering in addition the buoyancy loss will occur after a certain service period of buoyancy blocks therefore the waveform layout of deepwater riser should be designed to meet the situation that the buoyancy loss of buoyancy block is about 10 in order to facilitate the theoretical analysis the riser lower half section with buoyancy blocks referred to as buoyancy section as depicted in fig 5 is treated equivalently and simplified as a riser structure with uniform internal and external diameters based on the equivalence principle of the hydrodynamic loads and buoyancy load per unit length for the buoyancy section the equivalent outer diameter d e equivalent weight w e and equivalent hydrodynamic coefficients c de and c τe for the buoyancy section can be expressed as follows orcina 2017 11 d e d f 2 d o 2 l f s f d o 2 12 w e w π 4 ρ f l f d f 2 d o 2 m f h g s f 13 c d e c d s f d e d f l f d o s f l f 14 c τ e 1 s f d e c τ n 4 d f 2 d o 2 c d t d f l f c d t d o s f l f the equivalent normal and tangential added mass coefficients for the buoyancy section can refer to the equivalent process of drag force coefficients 2 3 finite element discretization since the governing equations 7 and 10 show strong nonlinear characteristics galerkin method is adopted to discretize these partial differential equations which is simplified into a series of nonlinear ordinary differential equations in time domain in order to improve the computational efficiency of the governing equation for differential element the hermite cubic interpolating function a i s and quadratic interpolating function p m s are used to discretize the transient position of the riser and improved lagrangian multiplier therefore the position vector improved lagrangian multiplier distributed loads mass matrix and axial strain of offshore riser in three dimensional cartesian coordinate system can be approximately expressed by tensor summative criteria taking the position vector r as an example its tensor summation expression can be obtained 15 r n s t u i n t a i s n 1 3 i 1 4 16 u 1 n t r n 0 t u 2 n t l r n 0 t u 3 n t r n l t u 4 n t l r n l t it can be seen from the above formula that u in is actually the three dimensional space position vector and the product of tangent vector and element length at both ends of the differential element λ m is approximately the effective tension at the end nodes and midpoint of differential element fig 6 is a schematic diagram of parameter meanings for node variables u in and λ m of the riser differential element other node variables can be referred to λ m herein galerkin method is employed to calculate the integral of partial differential equations 7 and 10 along the length of the riser differential element by multiplying them by a i s and p m s respectively based on the sum expression of tensors the following ordinary differential equations could be derived 17 γ i k m m n j m u k j

numerical calculation process for each riser differential element its final governing equation can be described by matrix form a x b where the vector a is the stiffness matrix of differential element and the vector x contains 15 unknowns namely u 11 u 12 u 13 u 21 u 22 u 23 λ 1 λ 2 u 31 u 32 u 33 u 41 u 42 u 43 λ 3 integrating the matrix equations for k riser elements a global matrix equation group containing 15 8 k 1 unknowns a x b is established boundary constraints at both ends of deepwater riser are regarded as hinged constraints and the motion response of the floating structure is employed as the input boundary condition of the riser top end for numerical calculation since the global matrix equations behave strong nonlinear characteristics the unknown quantities such as riser coordinates and lagrange multiplier are estimated in advance then newton raphson method is adopted to conduct the iteration in riser static problem until the convergence criteria are met based on the calculation results of static analysis newmark β method and newton raphson method are employed in combination to acquire the dynamic response characteristics of deepwater riser 3 simple fatigue damage calculation fatigue is a progressive localized structural damage due to the initiation of a crack and its subsequent propagation when a structure is subjected to the cyclic loading and most structural failures are due to fatigue bai et al 2014 the stress variation along the cross section of offshore riser is very important for its fatigue damage calculation standard fatigue calculation is based on palmgren miner accumulative damage rule which calculates the each fatigue damage caused by alternating stress at different levels in the service life and then acquires the total accumulated fatigue damage by linear combination in general the total axial stress of metal tube is adopted to estimate the riser fatigue damage which is a linear combination of the direct tensile stress σ a contributed by wall tension t w and bending stress σ m contributed by bending moment m dnv rp f204 2010 in this work the global loads effective tension bending moment internal and external pressures acting on the offshore riser under service condition may be obtained from the global analyses for offshore riser dynamics then as illustrated in fig 7 the direct tensile stress σ a and maximum bending stress σ m can be calculated by wall tension and bending moment of offshore riser respectively 20 σ a t w a t σ m m d o 2 i the calculation and analysis methods of engineering structure s fatigue damage are mainly divided into two kinds 1 fatigue cumulative damage method i e s n curve method 2 fracture mechanics method so far most scholars employed s n curve to research the fatigue damage of marine riser and fracture mechanics method is mainly used for engineering critical assessment the s n curve describes the relationship between the fatigue strength s and number of stress cycles n when the material is damaged under the cyclic action of constant stress range s the cycle number experienced by the structure to reach fatigue failure is denoted as n to acquire the fatigue damage of offshore riser it is assumed that the riser material behavior can be well characterized by a s n equation as following 21 n a s m as shown in fig 7 it can be found that the bending stresses along the cross section of riser vary linearly along the vertical direction which is very different from the direct tensile stress distribution caused by wall tension according to s n curve the structural fatigue damage is closely related to structural stress range and stress cycle number therefore it is necessary to calculate the fatigue damage for the whole cross section and then pick up the maximum damage value as the final fatigue damage of this section in this paper to simplify the calculation 32 nodes along the inner and outer surfaces of the riser cross section see fig 7 are selected to carry out the fatigue damage analyses once the total axial stress ranges at these 32 nodes along the cross section of the riser are acquired the number of stress cycles can be counted by the rain flow counting method then palmgren miner rule combined with s n curve is adopted to evaluate the fatigue damage along offshore riser arc length under service condition 4 case study based on the research background of a sea area at a depth of 600 m three kinds of deepwater riser configurations namely catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser were established the proposed mathematical formulation was employed to study the fatigue damage optimization mechanism of deepwater riser based on lazy wave configuration arrangement the main parameters of deepwater riser and buoyancy block are described in tables 1 and 2 respectively the layout parameters of different riser configurations are depicted in table 3 since the heave motion of floating structure is comparatively significant for all seas wang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 and would increase the stress concentration in the sag bend and hog bend regions of lazy wave riser szczepanski et al 2018 a simple harmonic motion along y axis direction is imposed on the top of the riser to simulate the heave motion of floating structure in this study the power rule was used to describe the current profile the positive direction of ocean current was set along x axis and the power rule exponent was set as 7 in addition the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of seabed soil are chosen as 11 3 kn m2 and 10 0 kn m3 respectively the material constants a and m for s n curve can be obtained from experiments and are set as 4 23 1013 and 3 5 respectively bai et al 2015 4 1 motion response comparison of different riser configurations since the motion of floating structure is very significant to the dynamic response of offshore riser three riser layout configurations are selected and simple harmonic heave motions under different amplitudes heave period is 15 2 s and heave amplitudes are 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m respectively then are imposed to the top of offshore riser to well investigate the transmission process and motion characteristics of floating structure excitation along a deepwater riser the interference factors such as ocean currents are not taken into account in this section based on the above engineering example to carry out the dynamic response calculation of these three riser layout configurations the influence law of lazy wave configuration on the riser dynamic response and the decoupling mechanism of the floating structure motion in the riser touchdown zone are deeply explored besides the fatigue damage optimization mechanism of deepwater lazy wave risers based on multiple waveform serial arrangement is also well studied fig 8 shows the static riser configuration effective tension and bending moment comparisons of multiple lazy wave riser obtained from the improved slender rod model and orcaflex simulation orcina 2017 and fig 9 displays the corresponding dynamic top effective tension bottom effective tension and absolute maximum bending moment comparisons by these two approaches it can be observed from the figures that the riser global configuration effective tension and bending moment of deepwater riser calculated by the improved slender rod model are in good agreement with orcaflex finite element numerical simulation results which can fully verify the feasibility and accuracy of the theoretical model proposed in this paper figs 10 32 illustrate the axial motion normal motion effective tension wall tension bending moment axial stress and annual fatigue damage distributions of these three riser layout configurations under different heave amplitudes table 4 depicts the calculation results of riser dynamic responses and fatigue damage for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser under different heave amplitudes as shown in figs 10 and 11 the maximum axial velocity and acceleration for these three riser layout configurations would all occur at the top of the riser suffering from the heave excitation induced by floating structure the axial velocity and acceleration envelopes for catenary riser decline slowly along the riser suspended segment in sea water and decrease rapidly to zero when it reaches the tdz then fluctuate slightly along the flowline segment however the envelopes of axial velocity and acceleration for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser produce a large attenuation in the first sag bend segment by constructing the lazy wave configuration by comparing figs 10 and 12 and figs 11 and 13 it can be found that the riser normal movement law is significantly different from that of riser axial movement the maximum normal velocity and acceleration of these three riser layout configurations do not occur at the top of the riser i e at the external excitation source but are more severe than the top excitation response induced by floating structure especially for catenary riser under the condition of heave amplitude 4 0 m top excitation normal velocity and acceleration are 0 26 m s and 0 11 m s2 respectively the maximum normal velocities for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 1 95 m s 0 84 m s and 0 87 m s respectively while the maximum normal accelerations are 1 96 m s2 0 39 m s2 and 0 43 m s2 respectively form figs 12 and 13 the riser normal velocity and acceleration envelopes do not decrease along the suspended segment but keep increasing in the first sag bend segment the maximum normal values are far greater than the external excitation response at the riser top the maximum normal velocity and acceleration of catenary riser are located in the riser tdz while the maximum normal velocity and acceleration of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are generated in the first sag bend region it follows that through building lazy wave configuration the floating structure motion and the riser tdz motion can be decoupled successfully under the same service condition the dynamic effective tension effective tension range dynamic wall tension and wall tension range for catenary riser are significantly larger than those of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser see figs 14 17 it can be seen that the lazy wave configuration constructed by binding buoyancy blocks in the lower half of the riser can effectively reduce the dynamic tension and its range response at the top of offshore riser under the same heave excitation condition the dynamic tension and its range at the top of lazy wave riser are slightly larger than that of multiple lazy wave riser although the total length of the buoyancy sections for multiple wave riser increases by 100 m compared with that of lazy wave riser in this case study the increase in the length of 100 m buoyancy section seems to have no significant effect on the effective tension and wall tension of deepwater risers this is because the tension distribution along offshore riser is not only related to the length of buoyancy section but also closely related to the location of buoyancy section ruan et al 2014 when the whole buoyancy section is shifted towards the top region of the riser both effective tension and wall tension at the top end of the riser will decrease accordingly by comparing figs 14 and 16 it can be observed the maximum effective tension distribution curves under different heave excitations are similar to these of maximum wall tension due to the introduction of buoyancy blocks local tension peaks occur at the connections between buoyancy section and bare riser besides the effective tension range distribution curves are almost identical to the wall tension range distribution curve see figs 15 and 17 according to the calculation equation for wall tension t w t e p o a o p i a i ρ i a i u 2 the wall tension is the product of the combined action of effective tension hydrostatic external pressure and hydrostatic internal pressure as the hydrostatic external pressure and hydrostatic internal pressure are related to the water depth coordinate of riser node which changes very little the wall tension range is mainly dominant by the effective tension range through comparison it can be found that the riser tension range based on the lazy wave arrangement configuration drops significantly in the first sag bend segment and the riser tension range value is very small in the tdz however the tension range for catenary riser is still very large in the tdz which is only slightly less than that in the riser top region when the floating structure moves more and more severely the excessive tension range in the tdz for catenary riser may generate compression load which would lead to the global instability in this region moreover the tension range in the riser tdz will appear local peak which may be induced by the seabed vertical resistance as illustrated in fig 18 under the same riser dimension and hang off angle lazy wave riser arrangement can reduce the top tension through the introduction of buoyancy blocks however on the other hand the static local maximum bending moment of these two riser configurations is greater than that of catenary riser when the floating structure movement is not significant the dynamic amplification response of bending moment for catenary riser in the tdz is not obvious therefore its value is smaller than these of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser when the movement of floating structure becomes severe the lazy wave configuration can effectively decouple the motion response between the floating structure and riser tdz to slow down the riser normal movement in this area as a result the dynamic bending moment responses of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser will be much less than that of catenary riser displayed in figs 19 and 20 when the heave amplitude is 1 0 m the maximum dynamic bending moment for catenary riser is 41 71 kn m and occurs in the tdz meanwhile the maximum dynamic bending moments for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 57 78 kn m and 59 91 kn m respectively and doesn t happen in the tdz the local maximum dynamic bending moments in the tdz for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 52 17 kn m and 53 88 kn m respectively as shown in fig 19 with the increase of heave amplitude the maximum dynamic bending moment for catenary riser increases significantly while these for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser increase slowly under the action of 4 0 m heave amplitude the local maximum dynamic bending moments in the tdz for three types of riser arrangement configurations are 66 61 kn m 52 81 kn m and 54 42 kn m respectively see fig 20 under the premise of excluding the influence of ocean current on the riser mechanical properties classic catenary theory can be adopted to conduct the static analysis of deepwater riser yuan et al 2020 then the relationship between the top tension t top and local maximum bending moment m can be gained i e m e i w a t t o p sin θ t o p where w a is related to the riser dead weight fluid gravity in the riser and buoyancy force when the dimension and arrangement of the riser and buoyancy block are determined the top tension is inversely proportional to the static local maximum bending moment fig 21 shows the bending moment range distributions for three riser configurations under different heave movements it can be seen from the figure that the maximum bending moment range for catenary riser occurs in the tdz however for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser it mainly occurs in the first hog bend by comparing the maximum bending moment ranges for the three riser configurations shown in fig 22 the maximum bending moment range for catenary riser increases more significantly than these for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser furthermore when the floating structure movement is significant multiple lazy wave riser is the best lazy wave riser is the second and catenary riser is the last in terms of the bending moment range in the tdz see fig 23 with the increase of heave amplitude this phenomenon will become more and more obvious when the heave amplitude is 4 0 m the maximum bending moment ranges for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 46 50 kn m 8 32 kn m and 13 14 kn m respectively at the same time the local maximum bending moment ranges in the tdz for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 6 65 kn m and 4 81 kn m it can be found that deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement can effectively reduce the response of the dynamic bending moment and its range in the touchdown zone as we all known the total axial stress of offshore riser is combined of the direct tensile stress σ a contributed by wall tension t w and bending stress σ m contributed by bending moment m dnv rp f204 2010 it can be seen from fig 24 that the maximum dynamic axial stress range distribution characteristics for the three riser layout configurations are very similar to these of maximum dynamic bending moment range distributions the maximum dynamic axial stress range for catenary riser occurs in the riser tdz while the maximum dynamic axial stress ranges for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser occur in the first hog bend region it can be found that for steel risers the axial stress of deepwater riser is mainly controlled by bending moment load with the increase of heave amplitude the maximum dynamic axial stress ranges for the three riser layout configurations increase almost linearly fig 25 but its growth rate for catenary riser is significantly higher than these of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser in addition as depicted in fig 26 with the continuous increase of heave amplitude the local maximum dynamic axial stress range in the tdz for lazy wave riser increases more significantly and gets closer and closer to its global maximum value in the meantime the local maximum dynamic axial stress range in the tdz for multiple lazy wave riser increases slowly the riser in the tdz is not only subjected to the cyclic loading of bending moment and tension load but also directly contacts with the seabed soil which may cause certain friction damage and further aggravate the fatigue damage in the region since the bending moment will cause different normal stresses at different positions of the riser cross section it is necessary to calculate the dynamic stress and range response at the typical positions of the riser cross section and finally acquire the maximum fatigue damage for this cross section fig 27 displays the dynamic axial stress ranges of 32 typical outer inner edge locations on the tdp cross section for three riser layout configurations the node numbers for these three riser layout configurations are 140 221 and 257 respectively in this figure the symbols outer and inner denote the outer and inner cross section respectively it can be seen from the figure that when the dynamic axial stress response of the riser is mainly determined by the bending moment load the maximum axial stress range on the riser cross section occurs at 0 and 180 namely the maximum bending moment stress locations once the axial stress range of offshore riser has been obtained its annual fatigue damage can be calculated by adopting s n curve and palmgren miner linear cumulative rule fig 28 illustrates the annual fatigue damage distributions for three riser layout configurations with the increasing heave amplitude the annual fatigue damages for three riser layout configurations would aggrandize under the same service condition the annual fatigue damage for catenary riser is significantly higher than these of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser especially in the riser tdz it can be observed that deepwater riser based on lazy wave layout configuration can optimize riser fatigue damage especially for the tdz through comparison it can be concluded that lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance followed by multiple lazy wave riser and catenary riser is the worst see fig 29 however for the riser tdz multiple lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance followed by lazy wave riser and catenary riser see fig 30 in short the fatigue damage optimization in the riser tdz would be effectively realized by constructing multiple lazy wave risers with more lazy wave shapes since the bending stiffness of the riser has a significant effect on the fatigue damage in the riser tdz five types of riser bending stiffnesses 4 61 102 n m2 4 61 103 n m2 4 61 104 n m2 4 61 105 n m2 and 4 61 106 n m2 are selected for calculation and analysis under the service condition of 4 0 m heave amplitude and then the anti fatigue damage performances of three riser configurations are well compared fig 31 displays the variation trends of maximum annual fatigue damage and local maximum annual fatigue damage in the tdz for the three riser configurations under different riser bending stiffness conditions as can be seen from the figure when the bending stiffness of the riser is continuously reduced the maximum annual fatigue damage of the three riser configurations is unremittingly aggravated especially in the tdz when the local maximum annual fatigue damage in the tdz intensifies to a certain extent the maximum annual fatigue damage location of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser will shift from the sag bend or hog bend region to the touchdown zone and the riser tdz will become the maximum fatigue damage location for the whole riser at the same time the maximum annual fatigue damage of multiple lazy wave riser is less than that of lazy wave riser therefore for flexible risers the anti fatigue performance of multiple lazy wave riser may be better than that of lazy wave riser the main reason for this phenomenon is that the decline of the riser bending stiffness leads to the increase of the riser dynamic curvature range especially in the tdz see fig 32 which further intensifies the dynamic axial stress range of the riser however due to the multilayer structure of flexible riser the stress distribution calculation on the cross section is very complex wang 2018 amaechi et al 2019 moreover lager seabed stiffness will also deteriorate the riser fatigue damage in the tdz which further reflects the fatigue damage resistance advantage of multiple lazy wave riser in the tdz 4 2 riser dynamic response analysis under ocean current considering that lazy wave riser configuration is extremely sensitive to ocean current the motion responses of three riser layout configurations under the action of simple harmonic heave motion with amplitude of 4 0 m and period of 15 2 s are well studied based on three current conditions current velocities at sea surface are 1 0 m s 0 m s and 1 0 m s to explore the influence of ocean current on deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement figs 33 39 display the static configuration maximum effective tension effective tension range maximum bending moment bending moment range dynamic axial stress range and annual fatigue damage distributions for three riser layout configurations under the action of different ocean current velocities table 5 shows the corresponding calculation results for three riser layout configurations under different current conditions as illustrated in fig 33 lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are more sensitive to ocean current when current velocity varies from 1 0 m s to 1 0 m s the x coordinate of static tdp for catenary riser recedes from 265 86 m to 293 83 m meanwhile the x coordinates of static tdp for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser unexpectedly advances from 640 76 m to 629 85 m and from 857 46 m to 843 07 m respectively in addition by constructing two lazy wave shapes the height difference between the hog bend peak and sag bend trough can be greatly reduced thus improving the fluid transport environment in the riser as depicted in figs 34 and 35 the dynamic effective tension and its range of catenary riser is sensitive to ocean current while its influence on the dynamic effective tension of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave is diversified as can be seen from the figure maximum dynamic effective tensions of lazy wave riser in the top end are 372 98 kn 378 43 kn and 389 60 kn respectively under three ocean current conditions for multiple lazy wave risers these values are 360 08 kn 364 86 kn and 375 67 kn respectively it can be found that the impact of ocean current on the dynamic effective tension in the top region of deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement is not great but the effect for the riser tdz and flowline section is more significant figs 36 and 37 illustrate the maximum dynamic bending moment and its range distribution for the three riser configurations under different ocean current velocities it can be seen from the figure that ocean current has a highly significant impact on the dynamic bending moment and its range in the tdz for the three riser configurations when current velocity changes from 1 0 m s to 1 0 m s the maximum dynamic bending moment in the tdz for catenary riser decreases from 104 05 kn m to 49 32 kn m with a decrease of up to 53 meanwhile the maximum dynamic bending moments of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser in the tdz decrease from 103 25 kn m to 64 86 kn m and from 108 14 kn m to 68 74 kn m respectively furthermore the maximum dynamic bending moment range for catenary riser see fig 37 decreases from 70 88 kn m to 37 15 kn m with a decrease of up to 48 however the maximum dynamic bending moment range for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser is the largest under the condition of 0 m s ocean current especially for the tdz by comparing the dynamic axial stress range and annual fatigue damage distributions for the three riser configurations under different current velocities in figs 38 and 39 it can be concluded that considering the influence of ocean current the anti fatigue performance of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser is better than that of catenary riser for the tdz the anti fatigue performance of multiple lazy wave riser is better than that of catenary riser and lazy wave riser 5 conclusions given the fact that lazy wave riser can reduce the riser top tension and decouple the movement between the floating structure and riser tdz by constructing lazy wave configuration the concept of deepwater lazy wave riser configuration based on multiple waveform serial arrangement i e multiple lazy wave riser is proposed in this paper then the slender rod theory is improved and employed to establish the calculation models for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser based on the calculation results the dynamic response and anti fatigue performance advantages of deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement under floating structure movement and ocean current are well investigated through comparison and analysis of the dynamic response and motion transfer path for the three riser configurations the following conclusions can be obtained 1 by constructing lazy wave configuration deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement can greatly attenuate the kinematic coupled response of the floating structure in the first sag bend section and effectively reduce the normal motion response of the riser tdz which could greatly optimize the dynamic bending moment and anti fatigue performance of the riser in the tdz 2 compared with lazy wave riser multiple lazy wave riser can reduce the height difference between the hog bend peak and sag bend trough and improve the fluid transport environment in the riser by constructing multiple lazy wave shapes 3 under the same service condition lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser have an increasingly significant advantage in the dynamic tension and bending moment response with strenuous floating structure movement especially for the tdz 4 the maximum annual fatigue damage of catenary riser mainly occurs in the tdz while the maximum annual fatigue damage of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser mainly happens in the sag bend or hog bend region for steel riser lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance followed by multiple lazy wave riser and catenary riser is the worst however for the riser tdz multiple lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance 5 when the riser bending stiffness decreases continuously the maximum annual fatigue damage of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser may be transferred to the riser tdz therefore for flexible risers the anti fatigue performance of multiple lazy wave riser may be better than that of lazy

20835,lazy wave risers can mitigate the kinematic coupling between floating structure and riser touchdown zone tdz so as to improve its fatigue life however due to the introduction of buoyancy blocks nonlinear dynamic response and fatigue damage prediction will be more complicated in this paper a concept of multiple lazy wave riser namely deepwater lazy wave riser configuration based on multiple waveform serial arrangement is proposed according to the improved slender rod theory and equivalent optimization of buoyancy sections three riser configurations with different heave excitations and currents are structured the dynamic response characteristics excitation motion transfer paths and fatigue damage hotspots are well compared moreover the influence law of riser fatigue damage and decoupling mechanism of riser tdz movements are also explored the results indicate that by constructing lazy wave configuration deepwater risers based on lazy wave configuration can attenuate the kinematic coupled response of floating structure in the first sag bend section and reduce the normal motion response in the riser tdz so as to optimize its anti fatigue performance compared with lazy

development however with the continuous increase of water depth and increasingly harsh environment steel catenary risers are subjected to reciprocating movement of floating structure on the top irregular hydrodynamic loads and cyclic soil resistances which may cause excessive bending stress and fatigue damage to the riser top region and tdz therefore petrobras r d center torres et al 2002 2003 conducted a large number of studies on the extreme load analysis vortex induced vibration analysis and fatigue analysis for different riser configurations and found that lazy wave riser is a more suitable configuration for deep water in terms of structural performance and economy as shown in fig 1 a certain number of buoyancy blocks are bound at equal intervals in the lower half of the riser and the buoyancy provided by the buoyancy block would cause the riser to arch and thus produce a lazy wave shape fergestad et al 2014 this arrangement can effectively reduce the tension at the top of the riser and alleviate the coupling effect of floating structure movement in the riser tdz thus improving the fatigue life of this hot spot region therefore it has been more and more widely applied to deepwater oil and gas development nowadays the research on lazy wave riser has drawn more attention taking the maximum dynamic stress fatigue life engineering cost and buoyancy section parameters as optimization objectives tanaka et al 2006 pina et al 2011 yang et al 2012 and ai et al 2019 adopted genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm and quasi newton method to carry out the configuration optimization design for lazy wave riser thus obtained the optimized parameters such as the number dimension and installation location of buoyancy blocks in addition sun and wang 2013 studied the influence rules for mechanical properties of deepwater lazy wave risers under different layout parameters and pointed out that the size and installation position of buoyancy blocks were highly sensitive parameters kim et al 2015 indicated that steel lazy wave risers can effectively reduce the local dynamic buckling in the riser tdz and the stress at the touchdown point tdp and the short term fatigue damage is relatively small later wang et al 2015 2018 combined euler bernoulli beam theory and keller box finite difference method to establish a mechanical analysis model for deepwater lazy wave risers and found that the floating structure motion internal flow and current load have significant influences on the mechanical properties of lazy wave risers considering the boundary effect in the tdz and internal flow velocity ruan et al 2019 proposed an efficient approach for evaluating the static stress range of lazy wave steel risers in deepwater under the action of vessel slow drift motion and ocean current coupling cheng et al 2020 employed a nonlinear finite element method to investigate the impacts of motion amplitude motion period buoyancy segment length wave current load internal ﬂow and seabed friction on the dynamic behavior of steel lazy wave riser then oh et al 2020 put forward the simulation based design process to find the optimal shape of steel lazy wave riser at the installation besides amaechi et al 2018 2019 deeply investigated the dynamic response of submarine hoses on catenary anchor leg moorings buoys with different layout configurations the above papers have carried out in depth studies on the dynamic response and fatigue damage of lazy wave risers but have not conducted further research on the mechanism of how to achieve the dynamic response and fatigue damage optimization of deepwater risers by constructing lazy wave layout configurations in this paper a developed rod theory is put forward that fully considers the influence factors such as the riser internal fluid as well as the interaction between seabed and riser as the buoyancy blocks are discretely attached to in the lower half of lazy wave riser at equal intervals equivalent parameters of buoyancy section are introduced based on the principle of equivalent optimization to further explore the dynamic response and fatigue damage optimization mechanism of deepwater lazy wave risers based on multiple waveform serial arrangement three kinds of different riser configurations i e catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are chosen and applied to the proposed theoretical model then the axial and normal motions static dynamic tensions bending moments and fatigue damage of deepwater risers under different layout configurations are well compared and analyzed it can provide some reference value for the configuration design and structure optimization of lazy wave riser in deepwater 2 mathematical formulation for lazy wave riser considering that the length diameter ratio of deepwater riser is very large the configuration position and instantaneous shape of lazy wave riser are described by the riser axis line and its dynamic response characteristics can be solved based on the modified slender rod theory nordgren 1974 garrett 1982 the greatest advantage of this theory is that its motion governing equation is directly established in the global coordinate system which can eliminate the time consuming coordinate transformation from local coordinate system to global coordinate system and greatly improve the calculation efficiency moreover include all the geometric and boundary nonlinear characteristics 2 1 governing equation as displayed in fig 2 in the three dimensional cartesian coordinate system the configuration position and instantaneous shape of deepwater riser are expressed by the position vector r s t which is a function of riser arc length s and time t based on the right hand screw rule the orthogonal coordinate vector of any point on the axis of slender rod can be denoted as t n b including the tangent direction unit vector t r normal direction unit vector n r r and sub normal direction unit vector b t n according to euler bernoulli beam theory it is assumed that the cross section of offshore riser is always perpendicular to the axis line that is the shear deformation for the cross section of the riser is not considered since there is no distributed moment acting on the risers and mooring lines and the torque is also very small the distributed moment and torque are not taken into consideration in the proposed modified slender rod theory to study the mechanics of marine risers and mooring lines based on the principle of momentum conservation and moment of momentum conservation fig 3 the motion balance equation of deepwater lazy wave riser can be established 1 ei r λ r q ρ r where λ t w ei κ 2 the distributed external load vector on the unit riser length q includes the additional mass force drag force and froude krylov force the superscript represents the partial derivative of time denotes the partial derivative of arc length the additional mass force drag force and froude krylov force acting on the riser can be calculated by the following formulas respectively 2 q f i s t ρ o a o c a n c a t t a f r 3 q f d s t 1 2 ρ o d o c

n i t as the fluid flow field in the riser is very complex to analyze the internal flow is assumed as a plug flow for simplification of analysis in this paper in addition the velocity of fluid transport on the cross section of the riser is treated as constant according to païdoussis s work 2014 the force induced by plug flow in the riser can be derived as 6 q f l o w ρ i a i t u s 2 r ρ i a i r 2 u r u 2 r where the first term at the right end of the above equation is the inertial force caused by the internal flow the second term is the coriolis force caused by the rotation of the riser the third term is the centripetal force caused by the change of the flow direction of the fluid to keep the same curvature as the riser finally the motion equilibrium equation for an inextensible slender rod with equal principal stiffness in the rod theory model can be revised as follows 7 m r 2 ρ i a i u r e i r λ r q 8 m ρ t a t ρ i a i i ρ i a i c a n ρ i a i c a t t 9 q ρ o a o ρ t a t ρ i

to the transient position of offshore riser which are affected by the wave current load and floating structure motion therefore equation 7 behaves strong nonlinear characteristics in addition λ t w p o a o p i a i ρ i a i u 2 is the improved lagrange multiplier taking the effects of hydrostatic pressure internal fluid velocity and axial deformation caused by circumferential stress the axial deformation is proportional to poisson s ratio into account the modified axial deformation constraint equation can be derived based on the assumption of small expansion deformation 10 1 2 r r 1 λ 1 2 υ p o a o p i a i ρ i a i u 2 e a 0 considering that the riser is subjected to the action of sea water and fluid hydrostatic pressure the hydrostatic internal and external pressures on the riser at different riser positions is defined compared with the external hydrostatic pressure it is necessary to think about the internal pressure of riser top end in this modified rod theory model the internal pressure of riser top end is set to be equivalent to the height of hydrostatic pressure for numerical calculation moreover the outer diameter weight per unit length and hydrodynamic coefficients of buoyancy section are different from the bare riser parameters in this study the winkler foundation model and modified coulomb friction model are employed to actually simulate the vertical and lateral riser seabed interaction respectively guo et al 2019 2 2 equivalent optimization of buoyancy section as illustrated in fig 4 in practical offshore engineering the buoyancy blocks are clamped on the lower half section of the riser to make the buoyancy and gravity act on the suspended riser together to form a waveform system layout so as to effectively decouple the kinematic relationship between the riser tdz and the floating structure and reduce the tension at the top of the riser buoyancy blocks are usually made of composite foams with low water absorbency and have low fluid separation characteristics in order to avoid the change of riser layout caused by the slippage of buoyancy blocks it is very necessary to ensure that the buoyancy blocks are tightly bound to the riser body in practical engineering in addition the buoyancy loss will occur after a certain service period of buoyancy blocks therefore the waveform layout of deepwater riser should be designed to meet the situation that the buoyancy loss of buoyancy block is about 10 in order to facilitate the theoretical analysis the riser lower half section with buoyancy blocks referred to as buoyancy section as depicted in fig 5 is treated equivalently and simplified as a riser structure with uniform internal and external diameters based on the equivalence principle of the hydrodynamic loads and buoyancy load per unit length for the buoyancy section the equivalent outer diameter d e equivalent weight w e and equivalent hydrodynamic coefficients c de and c τe for the buoyancy section can be expressed as follows orcina 2017 11 d e d f 2 d o 2 l f s f d o 2 12 w e w π 4 ρ f l f d f 2 d o 2 m f h g s f 13 c d e c d s f d e d f l f d o s f l f 14 c τ e 1 s f d e c τ n 4 d f 2 d o 2 c d t d f l f c d t d o s f l f the equivalent normal and tangential added mass coefficients for the buoyancy section can refer to the equivalent process of drag force coefficients 2 3 finite element discretization since the governing equations 7 and 10 show strong nonlinear characteristics galerkin method is adopted to discretize these partial differential equations which is simplified into a series of nonlinear ordinary differential equations in time domain in order to improve the computational efficiency of the governing equation for differential element the hermite cubic interpolating function a i s and quadratic interpolating function p m s are used to discretize the transient position of the riser and improved lagrangian multiplier therefore the position vector improved lagrangian multiplier distributed loads mass matrix and axial strain of offshore riser in three dimensional cartesian coordinate system can be approximately expressed by tensor summative criteria taking the position vector r as an example its tensor summation expression can be obtained 15 r n s t u i n t a i s n 1 3 i 1 4 16 u 1 n t r n 0 t u 2 n t l r n 0 t u 3 n t r n l t u 4 n t l r n l t it can be seen from the above formula that u in is actually the three dimensional space position vector and the product of tangent vector and element length at both ends of the differential element λ m is approximately the effective tension at the end nodes and midpoint of differential element fig 6 is a schematic diagram of parameter meanings for node variables u in and λ m of the riser differential element other node variables can be referred to λ m herein galerkin method is employed to calculate the integral of partial differential equations 7 and 10 along the length of the riser differential element by multiplying them by a i s and p m s respectively based on the sum expression of tensors the following ordinary differential equations could be derived 17 γ i k m m n j m u k j

numerical calculation process for each riser differential element its final governing equation can be described by matrix form a x b where the vector a is the stiffness matrix of differential element and the vector x contains 15 unknowns namely u 11 u 12 u 13 u 21 u 22 u 23 λ 1 λ 2 u 31 u 32 u 33 u 41 u 42 u 43 λ 3 integrating the matrix equations for k riser elements a global matrix equation group containing 15 8 k 1 unknowns a x b is established boundary constraints at both ends of deepwater riser are regarded as hinged constraints and the motion response of the floating structure is employed as the input boundary condition of the riser top end for numerical calculation since the global matrix equations behave strong nonlinear characteristics the unknown quantities such as riser coordinates and lagrange multiplier are estimated in advance then newton raphson method is adopted to conduct the iteration in riser static problem until the convergence criteria are met based on the calculation results of static analysis newmark β method and newton raphson method are employed in combination to acquire the dynamic response characteristics of deepwater riser 3 simple fatigue damage calculation fatigue is a progressive localized structural damage due to the initiation of a crack and its subsequent propagation when a structure is subjected to the cyclic loading and most structural failures are due to fatigue bai et al 2014 the stress variation along the cross section of offshore riser is very important for its fatigue damage calculation standard fatigue calculation is based on palmgren miner accumulative damage rule which calculates the each fatigue damage caused by alternating stress at different levels in the service life and then acquires the total accumulated fatigue damage by linear combination in general the total axial stress of metal tube is adopted to estimate the riser fatigue damage which is a linear combination of the direct tensile stress σ a contributed by wall tension t w and bending stress σ m contributed by bending moment m dnv rp f204 2010 in this work the global loads effective tension bending moment internal and external pressures acting on the offshore riser under service condition may be obtained from the global analyses for offshore riser dynamics then as illustrated in fig 7 the direct tensile stress σ a and maximum bending stress σ m can be calculated by wall tension and bending moment of offshore riser respectively 20 σ a t w a t σ m m d o 2 i the calculation and analysis methods of engineering structure s fatigue damage are mainly divided into two kinds 1 fatigue cumulative damage method i e s n curve method 2 fracture mechanics method so far most scholars employed s n curve to research the fatigue damage of marine riser and fracture mechanics method is mainly used for engineering critical assessment the s n curve describes the relationship between the fatigue strength s and number of stress cycles n when the material is damaged under the cyclic action of constant stress range s the cycle number experienced by the structure to reach fatigue failure is denoted as n to acquire the fatigue damage of offshore riser it is assumed that the riser material behavior can be well characterized by a s n equation as following 21 n a s m as shown in fig 7 it can be found that the bending stresses along the cross section of riser vary linearly along the vertical direction which is very different from the direct tensile stress distribution caused by wall tension according to s n curve the structural fatigue damage is closely related to structural stress range and stress cycle number therefore it is necessary to calculate the fatigue damage for the whole cross section and then pick up the maximum damage value as the final fatigue damage of this section in this paper to simplify the calculation 32 nodes along the inner and outer surfaces of the riser cross section see fig 7 are selected to carry out the fatigue damage analyses once the total axial stress ranges at these 32 nodes along the cross section of the riser are acquired the number of stress cycles can be counted by the rain flow counting method then palmgren miner rule combined with s n curve is adopted to evaluate the fatigue damage along offshore riser arc length under service condition 4 case study based on the research background of a sea area at a depth of 600 m three kinds of deepwater riser configurations namely catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser were established the proposed mathematical formulation was employed to study the fatigue damage optimization mechanism of deepwater riser based on lazy wave configuration arrangement the main parameters of deepwater riser and buoyancy block are described in tables 1 and 2 respectively the layout parameters of different riser configurations are depicted in table 3 since the heave motion of floating structure is comparatively significant for all seas wang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 and would increase the stress concentration in the sag bend and hog bend regions of lazy wave riser szczepanski et al 2018 a simple harmonic motion along y axis direction is imposed on the top of the riser to simulate the heave motion of floating structure in this study the power rule was used to describe the current profile the positive direction of ocean current was set along x axis and the power rule exponent was set as 7 in addition the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of seabed soil are chosen as 11 3 kn m2 and 10 0 kn m3 respectively the material constants a and m for s n curve can be obtained from experiments and are set as 4 23 1013 and 3 5 respectively bai et al 2015 4 1 motion response comparison of different riser configurations since the motion of floating structure is very significant to the dynamic response of offshore riser three riser layout configurations are selected and simple harmonic heave motions under different amplitudes heave period is 15 2 s and heave amplitudes are 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m respectively then are imposed to the top of offshore riser to well investigate the transmission process and motion characteristics of floating structure excitation along a deepwater riser the interference factors such as ocean currents are not taken into account in this section based on the above engineering example to carry out the dynamic response calculation of these three riser layout configurations the influence law of lazy wave configuration on the riser dynamic response and the decoupling mechanism of the floating structure motion in the riser touchdown zone are deeply explored besides the fatigue damage optimization mechanism of deepwater lazy wave risers based on multiple waveform serial arrangement is also well studied fig 8 shows the static riser configuration effective tension and bending moment comparisons of multiple lazy wave riser obtained from the improved slender rod model and orcaflex simulation orcina 2017 and fig 9 displays the corresponding dynamic top effective tension bottom effective tension and absolute maximum bending moment comparisons by these two approaches it can be observed from the figures that the riser global configuration effective tension and bending moment of deepwater riser calculated by the improved slender rod model are in good agreement with orcaflex finite element numerical simulation results which can fully verify the feasibility and accuracy of the theoretical model proposed in this paper figs 10 32 illustrate the axial motion normal motion effective tension wall tension bending moment axial stress and annual fatigue damage distributions of these three riser layout configurations under different heave amplitudes table 4 depicts the calculation results of riser dynamic responses and fatigue damage for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser under different heave amplitudes as shown in figs 10 and 11 the maximum axial velocity and acceleration for these three riser layout configurations would all occur at the top of the riser suffering from the heave excitation induced by floating structure the axial velocity and acceleration envelopes for catenary riser decline slowly along the riser suspended segment in sea water and decrease rapidly to zero when it reaches the tdz then fluctuate slightly along the flowline segment however the envelopes of axial velocity and acceleration for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser produce a large attenuation in the first sag bend segment by constructing the lazy wave configuration by comparing figs 10 and 12 and figs 11 and 13 it can be found that the riser normal movement law is significantly different from that of riser axial movement the maximum normal velocity and acceleration of these three riser layout configurations do not occur at the top of the riser i e at the external excitation source but are more severe than the top excitation response induced by floating structure especially for catenary riser under the condition of heave amplitude 4 0 m top excitation normal velocity and acceleration are 0 26 m s and 0 11 m s2 respectively the maximum normal velocities for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 1 95 m s 0 84 m s and 0 87 m s respectively while the maximum normal accelerations are 1 96 m s2 0 39 m s2 and 0 43 m s2 respectively form figs 12 and 13 the riser normal velocity and acceleration envelopes do not decrease along the suspended segment but keep increasing in the first sag bend segment the maximum normal values are far greater than the external excitation response at the riser top the maximum normal velocity and acceleration of catenary riser are located in the riser tdz while the maximum normal velocity and acceleration of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are generated in the first sag bend region it follows that through building lazy wave configuration the floating structure motion and the riser tdz motion can be decoupled successfully under the same service condition the dynamic effective tension effective tension range dynamic wall tension and wall tension range for catenary riser are significantly larger than those of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser see figs 14 17 it can be seen that the lazy wave configuration constructed by binding buoyancy blocks in the lower half of the riser can effectively reduce the dynamic tension and its range response at the top of offshore riser under the same heave excitation condition the dynamic tension and its range at the top of lazy wave riser are slightly larger than that of multiple lazy wave riser although the total length of the buoyancy sections for multiple wave riser increases by 100 m compared with that of lazy wave riser in this case study the increase in the length of 100 m buoyancy section seems to have no significant effect on the effective tension and wall tension of deepwater risers this is because the tension distribution along offshore riser is not only related to the length of buoyancy section but also closely related to the location of buoyancy section ruan et al 2014 when the whole buoyancy section is shifted towards the top region of the riser both effective tension and wall tension at the top end of the riser will decrease accordingly by comparing figs 14 and 16 it can be observed the maximum effective tension distribution curves under different heave excitations are similar to these of maximum wall tension due to the introduction of buoyancy blocks local tension peaks occur at the connections between buoyancy section and bare riser besides the effective tension range distribution curves are almost identical to the wall tension range distribution curve see figs 15 and 17 according to the calculation equation for wall tension t w t e p o a o p i a i ρ i a i u 2 the wall tension is the product of the combined action of effective tension hydrostatic external pressure and hydrostatic internal pressure as the hydrostatic external pressure and hydrostatic internal pressure are related to the water depth coordinate of riser node which changes very little the wall tension range is mainly dominant by the effective tension range through comparison it can be found that the riser tension range based on the lazy wave arrangement configuration drops significantly in the first sag bend segment and the riser tension range value is very small in the tdz however the tension range for catenary riser is still very large in the tdz which is only slightly less than that in the riser top region when the floating structure moves more and more severely the excessive tension range in the tdz for catenary riser may generate compression load which would lead to the global instability in this region moreover the tension range in the riser tdz will appear local peak which may be induced by the seabed vertical resistance as illustrated in fig 18 under the same riser dimension and hang off angle lazy wave riser arrangement can reduce the top tension through the introduction of buoyancy blocks however on the other hand the static local maximum bending moment of these two riser configurations is greater than that of catenary riser when the floating structure movement is not significant the dynamic amplification response of bending moment for catenary riser in the tdz is not obvious therefore its value is smaller than these of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser when the movement of floating structure becomes severe the lazy wave configuration can effectively decouple the motion response between the floating structure and riser tdz to slow down the riser normal movement in this area as a result the dynamic bending moment responses of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser will be much less than that of catenary riser displayed in figs 19 and 20 when the heave amplitude is 1 0 m the maximum dynamic bending moment for catenary riser is 41 71 kn m and occurs in the tdz meanwhile the maximum dynamic bending moments for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 57 78 kn m and 59 91 kn m respectively and doesn t happen in the tdz the local maximum dynamic bending moments in the tdz for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 52 17 kn m and 53 88 kn m respectively as shown in fig 19 with the increase of heave amplitude the maximum dynamic bending moment for catenary riser increases significantly while these for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser increase slowly under the action of 4 0 m heave amplitude the local maximum dynamic bending moments in the tdz for three types of riser arrangement configurations are 66 61 kn m 52 81 kn m and 54 42 kn m respectively see fig 20 under the premise of excluding the influence of ocean current on the riser mechanical properties classic catenary theory can be adopted to conduct the static analysis of deepwater riser yuan et al 2020 then the relationship between the top tension t top and local maximum bending moment m can be gained i e m e i w a t t o p sin θ t o p where w a is related to the riser dead weight fluid gravity in the riser and buoyancy force when the dimension and arrangement of the riser and buoyancy block are determined the top tension is inversely proportional to the static local maximum bending moment fig 21 shows the bending moment range distributions for three riser configurations under different heave movements it can be seen from the figure that the maximum bending moment range for catenary riser occurs in the tdz however for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser it mainly occurs in the first hog bend by comparing the maximum bending moment ranges for the three riser configurations shown in fig 22 the maximum bending moment range for catenary riser increases more significantly than these for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser furthermore when the floating structure movement is significant multiple lazy wave riser is the best lazy wave riser is the second and catenary riser is the last in terms of the bending moment range in the tdz see fig 23 with the increase of heave amplitude this phenomenon will become more and more obvious when the heave amplitude is 4 0 m the maximum bending moment ranges for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 46 50 kn m 8 32 kn m and 13 14 kn m respectively at the same time the local maximum bending moment ranges in the tdz for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are 6 65 kn m and 4 81 kn m it can be found that deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement can effectively reduce the response of the dynamic bending moment and its range in the touchdown zone as we all known the total axial stress of offshore riser is combined of the direct tensile stress σ a contributed by wall tension t w and bending stress σ m contributed by bending moment m dnv rp f204 2010 it can be seen from fig 24 that the maximum dynamic axial stress range distribution characteristics for the three riser layout configurations are very similar to these of maximum dynamic bending moment range distributions the maximum dynamic axial stress range for catenary riser occurs in the riser tdz while the maximum dynamic axial stress ranges for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser occur in the first hog bend region it can be found that for steel risers the axial stress of deepwater riser is mainly controlled by bending moment load with the increase of heave amplitude the maximum dynamic axial stress ranges for the three riser layout configurations increase almost linearly fig 25 but its growth rate for catenary riser is significantly higher than these of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser in addition as depicted in fig 26 with the continuous increase of heave amplitude the local maximum dynamic axial stress range in the tdz for lazy wave riser increases more significantly and gets closer and closer to its global maximum value in the meantime the local maximum dynamic axial stress range in the tdz for multiple lazy wave riser increases slowly the riser in the tdz is not only subjected to the cyclic loading of bending moment and tension load but also directly contacts with the seabed soil which may cause certain friction damage and further aggravate the fatigue damage in the region since the bending moment will cause different normal stresses at different positions of the riser cross section it is necessary to calculate the dynamic stress and range response at the typical positions of the riser cross section and finally acquire the maximum fatigue damage for this cross section fig 27 displays the dynamic axial stress ranges of 32 typical outer inner edge locations on the tdp cross section for three riser layout configurations the node numbers for these three riser layout configurations are 140 221 and 257 respectively in this figure the symbols outer and inner denote the outer and inner cross section respectively it can be seen from the figure that when the dynamic axial stress response of the riser is mainly determined by the bending moment load the maximum axial stress range on the riser cross section occurs at 0 and 180 namely the maximum bending moment stress locations once the axial stress range of offshore riser has been obtained its annual fatigue damage can be calculated by adopting s n curve and palmgren miner linear cumulative rule fig 28 illustrates the annual fatigue damage distributions for three riser layout configurations with the increasing heave amplitude the annual fatigue damages for three riser layout configurations would aggrandize under the same service condition the annual fatigue damage for catenary riser is significantly higher than these of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser especially in the riser tdz it can be observed that deepwater riser based on lazy wave layout configuration can optimize riser fatigue damage especially for the tdz through comparison it can be concluded that lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance followed by multiple lazy wave riser and catenary riser is the worst see fig 29 however for the riser tdz multiple lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance followed by lazy wave riser and catenary riser see fig 30 in short the fatigue damage optimization in the riser tdz would be effectively realized by constructing multiple lazy wave risers with more lazy wave shapes since the bending stiffness of the riser has a significant effect on the fatigue damage in the riser tdz five types of riser bending stiffnesses 4 61 102 n m2 4 61 103 n m2 4 61 104 n m2 4 61 105 n m2 and 4 61 106 n m2 are selected for calculation and analysis under the service condition of 4 0 m heave amplitude and then the anti fatigue damage performances of three riser configurations are well compared fig 31 displays the variation trends of maximum annual fatigue damage and local maximum annual fatigue damage in the tdz for the three riser configurations under different riser bending stiffness conditions as can be seen from the figure when the bending stiffness of the riser is continuously reduced the maximum annual fatigue damage of the three riser configurations is unremittingly aggravated especially in the tdz when the local maximum annual fatigue damage in the tdz intensifies to a certain extent the maximum annual fatigue damage location of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser will shift from the sag bend or hog bend region to the touchdown zone and the riser tdz will become the maximum fatigue damage location for the whole riser at the same time the maximum annual fatigue damage of multiple lazy wave riser is less than that of lazy wave riser therefore for flexible risers the anti fatigue performance of multiple lazy wave riser may be better than that of lazy wave riser the main reason for this phenomenon is that the decline of the riser bending stiffness leads to the increase of the riser dynamic curvature range especially in the tdz see fig 32 which further intensifies the dynamic axial stress range of the riser however due to the multilayer structure of flexible riser the stress distribution calculation on the cross section is very complex wang 2018 amaechi et al 2019 moreover lager seabed stiffness will also deteriorate the riser fatigue damage in the tdz which further reflects the fatigue damage resistance advantage of multiple lazy wave riser in the tdz 4 2 riser dynamic response analysis under ocean current considering that lazy wave riser configuration is extremely sensitive to ocean current the motion responses of three riser layout configurations under the action of simple harmonic heave motion with amplitude of 4 0 m and period of 15 2 s are well studied based on three current conditions current velocities at sea surface are 1 0 m s 0 m s and 1 0 m s to explore the influence of ocean current on deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement figs 33 39 display the static configuration maximum effective tension effective tension range maximum bending moment bending moment range dynamic axial stress range and annual fatigue damage distributions for three riser layout configurations under the action of different ocean current velocities table 5 shows the corresponding calculation results for three riser layout configurations under different current conditions as illustrated in fig 33 lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser are more sensitive to ocean current when current velocity varies from 1 0 m s to 1 0 m s the x coordinate of static tdp for catenary riser recedes from 265 86 m to 293 83 m meanwhile the x coordinates of static tdp for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser unexpectedly advances from 640 76 m to 629 85 m and from 857 46 m to 843 07 m respectively in addition by constructing two lazy wave shapes the height difference between the hog bend peak and sag bend trough can be greatly reduced thus improving the fluid transport environment in the riser as depicted in figs 34 and 35 the dynamic effective tension and its range of catenary riser is sensitive to ocean current while its influence on the dynamic effective tension of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave is diversified as can be seen from the figure maximum dynamic effective tensions of lazy wave riser in the top end are 372 98 kn 378 43 kn and 389 60 kn respectively under three ocean current conditions for multiple lazy wave risers these values are 360 08 kn 364 86 kn and 375 67 kn respectively it can be found that the impact of ocean current on the dynamic effective tension in the top region of deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement is not great but the effect for the riser tdz and flowline section is more significant figs 36 and 37 illustrate the maximum dynamic bending moment and its range distribution for the three riser configurations under different ocean current velocities it can be seen from the figure that ocean current has a highly significant impact on the dynamic bending moment and its range in the tdz for the three riser configurations when current velocity changes from 1 0 m s to 1 0 m s the maximum dynamic bending moment in the tdz for catenary riser decreases from 104 05 kn m to 49 32 kn m with a decrease of up to 53 meanwhile the maximum dynamic bending moments of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser in the tdz decrease from 103 25 kn m to 64 86 kn m and from 108 14 kn m to 68 74 kn m respectively furthermore the maximum dynamic bending moment range for catenary riser see fig 37 decreases from 70 88 kn m to 37 15 kn m with a decrease of up to 48 however the maximum dynamic bending moment range for lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser is the largest under the condition of 0 m s ocean current especially for the tdz by comparing the dynamic axial stress range and annual fatigue damage distributions for the three riser configurations under different current velocities in figs 38 and 39 it can be concluded that considering the influence of ocean current the anti fatigue performance of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser is better than that of catenary riser for the tdz the anti fatigue performance of multiple lazy wave riser is better than that of catenary riser and lazy wave riser 5 conclusions given the fact that lazy wave riser can reduce the riser top tension and decouple the movement between the floating structure and riser tdz by constructing lazy wave configuration the concept of deepwater lazy wave riser configuration based on multiple waveform serial arrangement i e multiple lazy wave riser is proposed in this paper then the slender rod theory is improved and employed to establish the calculation models for catenary riser lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser based on the calculation results the dynamic response and anti fatigue performance advantages of deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement under floating structure movement and ocean current are well investigated through comparison and analysis of the dynamic response and motion transfer path for the three riser configurations the following conclusions can be obtained 1 by constructing lazy wave configuration deepwater riser based on lazy wave arrangement can greatly attenuate the kinematic coupled response of the floating structure in the first sag bend section and effectively reduce the normal motion response of the riser tdz which could greatly optimize the dynamic bending moment and anti fatigue performance of the riser in the tdz 2 compared with lazy wave riser multiple lazy wave riser can reduce the height difference between the hog bend peak and sag bend trough and improve the fluid transport environment in the riser by constructing multiple lazy wave shapes 3 under the same service condition lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser have an increasingly significant advantage in the dynamic tension and bending moment response with strenuous floating structure movement especially for the tdz 4 the maximum annual fatigue damage of catenary riser mainly occurs in the tdz while the maximum annual fatigue damage of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser mainly happens in the sag bend or hog bend region for steel riser lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance followed by multiple lazy wave riser and catenary riser is the worst however for the riser tdz multiple lazy wave riser has the best fatigue performance 5 when the riser bending stiffness decreases continuously the maximum annual fatigue damage of lazy wave riser and multiple lazy wave riser may be transferred to the riser tdz therefore for flexible risers the anti fatigue performance of multiple lazy wave riser may be better than that of lazy

20836,the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to combined biaxial compression and lateral loads has not been widely investigated yet by experiments in this study both experimental and numerical analyses were performed to study the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of stiffened plates under the combined biaxial compression and lateral loads and the experimental set up provides reference for combined loads experiments the initial deformation of the experimental specimens has been measured by laser scanning technique and taken account in the nonlinear finite element analysis collapse modes have also been analyzed and compared and influences of the interaction of lateral and transverse loads on the ultimate strength have been investigated results show that lateral pressure would enhance the ultimate load carrying capacity when the lateral pressure restrained deformation and the collapse mode was the combination of local web buckling and lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners when transverse loads were dominant load components keywords stiffened plates ultimate strength biaxial compression experiments lateral pressure local web buckling lateral torsional buckling 1 introduction the ship bottom structures are mainly composed of stiffened plates which could not only maintain the ultimate strength of the bottom structure but also lighten the weight normally stiffened plates of ship bottom structure are usually bearing multiple direction combined loads including in plane and out of plane loads they come from the bending moment of the hull and the bottom water pressure as is known to us a container ship is subjected to longitudinal compression because of bending moments transverse compression due to outboard water pressure and lateral pressure on account of underwater pressure in bottom plates however it is not very clear yet to know how combined transverse and lateral loads would have an impact on the longitudinal ultimate load bearing capacity then for the purpose of comprehensively and accurately figuring the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened plates both the influence of biaxial loads and lateral pressure should be fully taken into account the stability of stiffened plates bearing longitudinal loads alone or additional lateral loads has been investigated widely for the past few years the ultimate strength of stiffened plates was researched from various perspectives and some results obtained by these methods match well with corresponding tests guedes soares and gordo 1996 derived a formula for evaluating the ultimate strength of plates under biaxial compressions and lateral loads taking the initial deformations and residual stresses as influential factors yao et al 1997 found the ultimate strength was almost independent of the loading sequence i e the effect of the loading sequence could be ignored then lateral and in plane loads were applied in different steps paik and kim 2002 studied the formula for calculating the ultimate strength of stiffened plate bearing bending and lateral loads and proposed that the ultimate strength of stiffened plates was determined by the minimum values of six buckling modes fujikubo et al 2005a 2005b analyzed the ultimate strength of continuous plate and stiffened plates bearing combined lateral and transverse loads respectively then found that membrane stresses would restrain the occurrence of buckling additionally nonlinear finite element analysis non linear fea method has been selected to study the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under the action of biaxial and lateral loads by paik and seo 2009a b then analyze the important factors including loading types and dimensions which might play an important role in the ultimate load carrying capacity of stiffened plates xu and guedes soares 2011 analyzed the influence of various kinds of designed models in the research of experiment set up including 1 span 1 1 spans 1 1 2 1 2 spans and 3 spans under biaxial loads whose boundary conditions were simply supported and clamped xu and guedes soares 2013a and 2013b performed wide and narrow stiffened panels experiment to obtain the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under axial compression and compared the results with those acquired by non linear fea whose initial deflection was introduced by displacement transducer xu et al 2017 found that tensile stresses exist when the lateral pressure acts on the plate whose edges were constrained and the tensile stresses have an impact on the ultimate load carrying capacity of stiffened plates subjected to combined loads shanmugam et al 2014 conducted tests on stiffened plates subjected to combined actions of longitudinal and lateral loads and proposed that plate slenderness ratio served as a key role in determining the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to such combined loads cui and wang 2020 performed experiments on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with an opening then compare the results with those acquired by non linear fea to conduct the failure mechanism of such kind of stiffened plates most ultimate strength of stiffened plates tests were conducted under uniaxial compressive loads or coupled with lateral pressures because the loading and boundary conditions are difficult to simulate in the experiment there are few biaxial compression experiments on stiffened plates however combined biaxial with lateral loads are closer to the real sea cases which could be able to obtain a more accurate ultimate strength performance of stiffened plates besides a more convincing influence of lateral and transverse loads on the ultimate load bearing capacity of stiffened plates could be obtained by comparison of numerical calculation and experiment based on experimental tests and the corresponding nonlinear finite element analysis the main objective of this research is to research the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to combined biaxial compressions and lateral pressure it is expected that both numerical and experimental analysis will bring insight into the mechanism of collapse and the ultimate load carrying capacity test devices for the ultimate strength of stiffened plates bearing biaxial compressions were designed for exploring the collapse behaviors of stiffened plates subjected to combined loads the influence of initial imperfection which was measured by laser scanning technique was taken into consideration in the numerical analysis and other typical equivalent initial deflections were also taken account in the numerical analysis for comparison with the experimental tests besides both simply supported conditions and clamped conditions were analyzed to distinguish the influence of different boundary conditions furthermore the influence of the lateral and transverse loads on the ultimate strength was analyzed 2 experimental set up 2 1 details of test specimens the typical stiffened plates used in the test refer to the typical double bottom structure of the ship which was subjected to combined biaxial compression and lateral loads the experimental models of the stiffened plate were usually designed into 1 2 1 2 spans or 1 2 1 1 2 spans according to the research by xu and guedes soares 2013a the purpose of such dimensions is to simulate the true boundaries although 1 2 1 1 2 span model supplies the influence of transverse components it needs a more complex device to deal with transverse boundaries at the same time the objective of this experiment considered biaxial compressions then it should also be loaded in transverse edges besides the practical dimensions of bottom stiffened plates experiments are not feasible to perform in the laboratory because of unachievable tooling design and limitation of hydraulic jacks to facilitate experiment tests under current laboratory conditions and purpose one span and one bay model was adopted and dimensions of the specimens were selected with an appropriate scale some simplifications were adopted in the specimens strong square tubes were adopted to achieve simplifying boundary condition in order to facilitate the application of transverse loads and stop the girders from tripping box girders were chosen to sever as longitudinal girder square steels with larger stiffness were installed at both ends of the longitudinal section in order to apply the longitudinal compressive load uniformly distributed along the cross section the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to biaxial compression and lateral pressure was the most important objective whereas the similarity between practical structures and specimens was not considered as mandatory requirements in the models design and slenderness radios were calculated by eq 1 ranging from 1 to 2 5 of β and ranging from 0 05 to 1 0 of λ were acceptable based on the investigation of zhang 2016 1 β b t p σ y e λ a π r σ y e r i a where β is the plate slenderness λ is the column slenderness of stiffened panel r is gyration radius of stiffener with attached plate a is the distance between two adjacent transverse frame length of stiffened plates b is the width of attached plate t p is the thickness of attached plate σ y is the yield stress of material e is the young s modulus of material a is the area of transverse section of stiffened panel i is the moment of inertia of stiffener with attached plate three stiffened plate specimens subjected to biaxial compression and uniform lateral loads were performed to study the load bearing capacity and the failure mechanism they were model 1 model 2 and model 3 respectively in this study the plate slenderness ratio of specimens was 1 801 and the stiffener slenderness ratio was 0 761 the sizes of the plates between two longitudinal stiffeners were both 600mm 160 3 mm i e the total sizes of the plates were both 600mm 480 3 mm the size of stiffener was 30 10 3 mm i e the web height of stiffener h w was 30 mm the web thickness of stiffener t w is 3 mm the flange plate width of stiffener b f is 10 mm and the flange thickness t f of stiffener 3 mm the dimension of square steel was 50 mm 50 mm 15 mm which was slightly taller than stiffeners considering that transverse loads should be applied at the same time the longitudinal box girder was installed with the size of 40 mm 30 mm 6 mm which was not only a longitudinal load bearing member but also used to impose transverse load the stiffened plate is derived from a 10 000teu container ship surrounded by strong support members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames since the design draught of the 10 000teu container ship is d 12 m the draught heights 0 d 1 2 d and d were selected to study the influence of the lateral pressure on the ultimate strength however only the draught height 1 2 d was adopted in the experiments and the other load cases were analyzed in the non linear finite element analysis the lateral pressure action was taken as 0 061 mpa which arouse from the water pressure at the draught of 6 m and is calculated by eq 2 2 p ρ g h where ρ is the sea water density 1025 k g m 3 g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the draught height 6 m all the test specimens were made of the same batch of q235 steel tension tests were conducted to obtain the tensile properties of the experimental structures under the room temperature 20 c load is applied in the form of 1 mm min with the aid of displacement control method the summary of specimens is shown in table 1 considering the difficulty to apply biaxial load proportionally and the condition of practical sea cases take the longitudinal loads as the major load the stiffened plate is derived from the ship bottom plate and the upward water pressure make convex deflection which would induce transverse compression stresses tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 and the transverse compressive stresses may affect the ultimate strength according to the investigation report of mol comfort class nk 2014 maritime bureau ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan 2015 then for the purpose of forming a proportional to the longitudinal loads the transverse loads were set as certain values in the experiment longitudinal loads arise from longitudinal bending which could be considered as the major load components then during the experiments the failure of the entire stricture was caused by longitudinal loads the summary of load cases is shown in table 2 these load cases were applied in three models respectively in order to eliminate the gap and release part of the residual stress the specimens were preloaded with a load of 5 t then the ultimate load capacity tests were carried out fig 1 shows the dimensions of test specimens and positions of strain displacement gauges there are forty eight strain gauges and three displacement gauges where g1 g48 represents the strain measure position and d1 d3 represents the displacement measure position g1 g30 measured the longitudinal strain of the longitudinal girder each longitudinal positions were placed with six strain gauges circumferentially and g31 g38 which located at the center or edges of plate measured the longitudinal strain of the plate g39 g42 were used to measure the longitudinal strain of longitudinal stiffener they were located at two sides of web and flange plate respectively besides in order to monitor the transverse compressive load g43 g48 were arranged to measure transverse strain furthermore there were three displacement gauges d1 was arranged at the center of stiffened plates to measure the lateral displacement of the center plate d2 was placed at the bottom of stiffener and d3 was placed at the center of the side plate and all the displacement gauges were placed at the longitudinal centerline of the stiffened plate the surface without stiffener is up and the surface with stiffener is down besides the upward and downward denote the deformation direction toward the opposite or consistent direction with lateral loads it is worth noting that all the gauges were placed at the concerning area such as predicted maximum stress areas 2 2 experimental layout and testing system the dimensions of experimental specimen edges would change when they were loaded i e the length of edges would not be fixed during the tests once the size of edges changed it would cause a loading conflict and the failure of experiments considering the longitudinal loads were the main load components in the actual load cases a feasible approach was applied to avoid the loading conflict the longitudinal loads were applied on the total area of longitudinal boundaries however the transverse loads were applied on the partial area of transverse edges during the experiments transverse loads were applied before longitudinal loads after the transverse loads were applied in the partial area of edges it would spare some space for longitudinal deformation and so as to escape from loading conflict based on the designed plan as is shown in fig 2 biaxial compressions were loaded with the help of four blocks which made it possible to guarantee the uniform loading and the load blocks would move straight on the slide in order to apply lateral pressure on the surface of plates uniformly a weight was adopted to assist experiments as shown in fig 2 a and the supplementary picture named as fig 2 d the weight was applied by the following steps first some sandbags were placed uniformly on the surface up and they were fully contacted with the surface of the specimen the sandbags were fully pressed so that there is almost no gap between the sandbags and the specimen and make sure the upper surface of the sandbags were flat then an auxiliary i beam which was used to place weights whose dimensions exceed the boundary of the specimen was put on the upside of sandbags finally the major weight was put on the surface of the i beam when the weight is pressed on i beam the sandbags would be more fully contacted with the specimen besides it should be mentioned that the total weight of weight i beam and sandbags provided the lateral pressure of 0 061 mpa the boundary of the specimen was restricted by hydraulic jacks and foundation besides there were four pairs of angle bar adopted to fix edges of the specimen and then the longitudinal edges of structures were restrained by angle bars connected with load blocks so there would not be out of plane displacement and deformation existing in the edges both displacement gauges and strain gauges were applied in the focus location 3 nonlinear finite element analysis non linear fea has been developed into a general method for ultimate strength analysis for the past few years in this research it was conducted with the computer code abaqus 6 13 and the element type was taken as s4r whose four nodes all own six degrees of freedom 3 1 finite element model and mesh sensitivity analysis first of all the accuracy of the modeling needs to be established before any other analysis because the mesh size will influence the final results to obtain more convincing numerical results the size of mesh should be fined enough however to keep the balance of computing capability and precision of results mesh sensitivity analysis of model is necessary to be performed in view of the acceptable mesh size set up in ref xu and guedes soares 2013c the numbers of tee bar mesh numbers were set as six in web and flange plate respectively besides the panel mesh numbers were set as ten then take the mesh number of panel between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners web and flange plate as the measurement of mesh refinement the plate under biaxial and lateral loads was selected to analyze the influence of the mesh sizes on the ultimate strength the peak values which were showed in fig 3 exhibited a stable state when the mesh number of the attached plate between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners was 16 elements 32 elements and 64 elements respectively and the mesh number of corresponding web was 3 elements 6 elements and 12 elements besides the mesh number of flange plate was 1 element 2 elements and 4 elements they were expressed in the form of coordinates 16 3 1 32 6 2 and 64 12 4 respectively the ultimate strengths of them were 835 70 kn 839 61 kn and 840 61 kn respectively considering the accuracy of results and appropriate computing abilities the mesh numbers of attached plate were selected as 32 at the same time the mesh numbers of flange plate were 2 which could also be able to capture the local buckling process the final element model was shown in fig 4 3 2 initial geometric imperfections initial imperfections produced in the process of fabrications and manufactures such as initial deflections are unavoidable the failure modes of plates subjected to biaxial compression at the ultimate state will be affected by initial deflection paik et al 2004 the residual stresses were not considered in the analysis which were partially released by preloading xu and guedes soares 2013b and 2013c as showed in fig 5 the actual initial geometric imperfections were measured by lasing scanning technique the distributed datum points were used to scan the surface of specimens according to the scanned data the 3d distributions of geometric imperfections were pictured in fig 6 the x axis direction in the figure is the longitudinal direction of plate y axis direction represents transverse direction z axial direction represents lateral direction the equivalent initial imperfection served as contrast is expressed as follows fujikubo et al 2005a initial deflection of the local plate panel w p l 3 w p l a 0 sin m π x a sin π y b column type initial deflection of stiffeners w s 4 w c b 0 sin π x a sin π y b sideways initial deflections of stiffeners v

is equal to 3 b c 0 h w is the maximum sideways initial deflection of panel stiffener the m is relevant to a b and denotes the number of buckling half waves which was selected the minimum number calculated by eq 6 6 a b m m 1 eqns 3 6 were used to calculate equivalent initial imperfection of stiffened plates with a 0 0 1 β 2 t for average imperfection level and a 0 0 025 β 2 t for slight level smith et al 1987 was analyzed for comparison with imperfection measured by laser technique b 0 c 0 0 0015 a kim et al 2018 the initial deflection measured by laser scanning technique included the first two types of initial deflection then the first two typical global initial deflection was also put together for comparison with that measured in the experiment statistics of the measured initial deflection and typical equivalent initial imperfection have been summarized in table 3 3 3 boundary conditions and load application as shown in fig 4 one span one bay model was selected to reflect the actual structural characteristics because the longitudinal boundaries were connected with two square cubes in the experiment which were strong enough the longitudinal boundaries were coupling with two reference points in the finite element model boundary conditions are essential to influence the ultimate strength in the numerical simulations then the boundary conditions were set as consistent as possible to the experiment and load conditions were also applied in two steps as for the boundary condition of load case 1 table 4 lateral pressure was applied in step 1 and then longitudinal loads were applied in step 2 as for the boundary condition of load case 2 and load case 3 table 5 lateral pressure and transverse loads were applied in step 1 and longitudinal loads were applied in step 2 however it is worth noting that the simulation boundary conditions were not perfect because of the simplified and idealized treatment boundaries were applied with equal displacement by coupling by xu and guedes soares 2012 denote u x u y and u z as the translational displacements in x y and z directions respectively and θ x θ y and θ z as the rotational displacements in x y and z directions respectively it should be noted that the surface of a b was coupling with the reference point 1 rp 1 the surface of c d was coupling with the reference point 2 rp 2 the surface of b 2 c 2 was coupling with the reference point 3 rp 3 and the surface of the a 2 d 2 was coupling with reference point 4 rp 4 the following are the boundary conditions of stiffened plate adopted in the finite element analysis the actual longitudinal and transverse boundaries were partially restrained i e the boundary conditions should fall in between the clamped conditions and the simply supported ones to study the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under lateral and biaxial loads and the influential degree of boundary conditions on the failure modes both simply supported boundary conditions and clamped boundary conditions were investigated for comparison paik et al 2009a b for boundaries simply supported there was no lateral deflection only but rotational were not restrained for boundaries clamped lateral deflection and rotational restraints were restrained totally 4 results and discussion as shown in fig 7 uniaxial tensile tests have been conducted in the testing system and the engineering stress strain curves were obtained by via of eq 7 the true stress strain curves were pictured to compare with the engineering stress strain curve the true yield strength was used in numerical analysis 7 ε t r u e l n 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g 4 1 experimental results both the variations of stress and out of plane displacement were analyzed to study the buckling sequence of local structures and buckling collapse modes and take g and d as strain gauge and displacement gauge respectively it should be noted that the change of lateral displacement was not monitored due to the slip of displacement gauges when the lateral load was applying the data obtained by displacement gauge were all recorded after the lateral pressure loaded 4 1 1 results of model 1 m1 as shown in fig 8 a the ultimate strength obtained in the experiment 1 was 845 67 kn and the displacement was 6 45 mm the results of the displacement gauges were shown in fig 9 during the period of preloading longitudinal load at the time of 470s 1091s the purpose of this process was to eliminate the gap and between the hydraulic cylinder and the specimen it could also eliminate part of the residual stress caused by welding at this stage it can be observed that the three displacement gauges behave the similar amplitude changes because of the preloading of 5 t load at the same time the lateral displacement at the measured place increased in the direction from down to up which means the directions of initial deformations at the position of three displacement gauges were opposite to the direction of lateral pressure the longitudinal compressive load increased from 0 kn to 200 kn during the period of 1091s 1350s and the lateral displacement and longitudinal displacement increased gradually at the same time then the longitudinal load was loaded by means of displacement during this period the lateral displacement and longitudinal displacement increased rapidly until the longitudinal load arrived at 845 6 kn the turning points appeared in the longitudinal and lateral displacement curves respectively i e the stiffened plate collapsed then the lateral displacement increased rapidly because the stiffened plate could no longer bear the lateral load the locations of the strain gauges were shown in fig 1 and the measured results of strain gauges were shown in fig 10 the results of measured strain at the position of up surface down surface and stiffener were shown in three coordinate systems when the longitudinal load arrived at the ultimate bearing capacity of the stiffened plate a further increase of loads caused large deformation of the plate turning points were observed in g34 and g36 which were caused by stress redistribution caused by local plastic deformation however g34 located at the up surface and g36 located at the down surface i e the directions of buckling deformation in the center plate and side plate were opposite as shown in fig 15 a and fig 15 b besides as a result of the dividing point between elastic and plastic strain was 1 277 10 3 local buckling area occurred plastic deformation in the center plate and that occurred elastic deformation in the side plate the similar phenomenon also occurred in model 2 and model 3 there was no turning point in g31 and g35 which were located at the edge of longitudinal girder the strain of them both increased rapidly because of the local yielding the difference was mainly owing to g31 and g35 were located at the junction of the plate and stiffener and they were impossible to buckle because of boundaries as for the strain gauges at the surface of stiffener the results of initial strain were positive because of the applied lateral pressure the strain curves of g39 and g42 which were located at the surface of web keep linear all the time however the strain curves of g40 and g41 which were located at the surface of flange plate began to decrease this phenomenon indicated that the web could still bear the load and there was no obvious deformation and the flange plate twisted which led to the occurrence of the turning point 4 1 2 results of model 2 m2 fig 8 b showed the ultimate load bearing capacity of m2 the ultimate strength obtained in the experiment 2 was 855 06 kn and the displacement was 5 65 mm the results of the displacement gauges were shown in fig 11 after the similar preload to eliminate the gap and part of residual stress generated by welding transverse load was applied linearly during the period of 684s 906s until the transverse load up to 200 kn and then propagated during this period both transverse displacement and lateral displacement increased in the opposite direction of the initial deflection then the longitudinal load was applied to 200 kn from the time of 906s and the longitudinal displacement and lateral displacement increased and then the longitudinal load was applied in the form of displacement load until the stiffened collapsed at this time the longitudinal load reached 855 06 kn after reaching the ultimate state the lateral displacement increased rapidly because of the existence of lateral load the measurement results of the strain gauges were shown in fig 12 when the longitudinal load was small strain of each gauges changed in a linear trend until the longitudinal load reached the ultimate load capacity the turning point occurred in g34 and g36 which were caused by stress redistribution due to local deformation however g34 located at the up surface and g36 located at the down surface i e the directions of buckling deformation in center plate and side plate were opposite which was consistent with fig 15 c and d there were no turning points in g31 and g35 which were located at the edge of the longitudinal girder the strain of them both increased rapidly because of the local yield the main reason for this difference was that g31 and g35 were located at the junction of the plate and stiffener and they were impossible to buckle because of boundaries the g33 and g37 were located at the edge of the panel which was also the junction of plate and stiffener and so there was no buckling as for the gauges at the surface of stiffener after the lateral pressure was loaded the initial strain was positive because the stiffener was stretched it is similar to model 1 the g39 and g42 which were located at the surface of web remained linear at the end of curve but the g40 and g41 which were located at the surface of flange plate began to decrease indicating that there was no obvious deformation in web while the flange plate twisted 4 1 3 results of model 3 m3 as shown in fig 8 c the ultimate strength obtained in the experiment 3 was 837 72 kn and the displacement was 6 51 mm the results of the displacement gauges were shown in fig 13 after preloading was applied for the similar purpose the transverse load increased to 250 kn and then propagated during this period the transverse displacement increased linearly and lateral displacement increased slightly from the time of 1378s the longitudinal load was applied to 200 kn and then applied in the form of displacement until the longitudinal load up to 837 72 kn the stiffened plate collapsed and could no longer bear loads then the lateral displacement increased rapidly the measurement results of strain gauge were shown in fig 14 under the longitudinal load each gauge behaved compressive strain when the longitudinal load arrived at ultimate load capacity the stiffened plate collapsed turning points could be observed in g36 and g38 which were both located at the down surface of plate i e the directions of buckling deformation in center plate and side plate were same which were consistent with fig 15 e and f as for g31 g35 g33 and g37 there were no turning points because these locations which were situated at the junction of plate and girder or stiffener yielded instead of buckling besides those strain located at the surface of stiffener was positive because of lateral pressure and then changed linearly which means the stiffener could able to bear loads 4 2 numerical simulation results by nonlinear finite element analysis with the aid of commercial software abaqus the corresponding numerical simulations based nonlinear finite element analysis were carried out to research the collapse modes of the stiffened plate subjected to combined biaxial compression and lateral loads the influence of different boundary conditions different initial deflections lateral loads and transverse loads was all analyzed by systematic comparison 4 2 1 finite element analysis results by taking the measured initial deflections into numerical models the ultimate strength of the relevant numerical analysis was investigated and the results were shown in fig 16 when the transverse load was 0 kn the ultimate strength calculated by the numerical model which introduced the measured initial deformation was 854 69 kn while the ultimate strength of m1 in the experiment was 845 67 kn i e the error was 1 07 when the transverse load was 200 kn the ultimate strength calculated by the numerical model which introduced the measured initial deformation was 848 88 kn while the ultimate strength of m2 in the experiment was 855 06 kn i e the error was 0 72 it should be noted that transverse load would lead to the change of longitudinal displacement because u x was not restricted when the transverse load was loading even it would result in the change of initial longitudinal loads when the transverse load was 250 kn the ultimate strength calculated by the numerical model which introduced the measured initial deformation was 832 60 kn while the ultimate strength of m3 in the experiment was 837 72 kn i e the error was 0 61 summary of the results obtained by experiment and finite element analysis were shown in table 6 in view of the inescapable uncertainties in the experiments the results obtained by nonlinear finite element analysis were acceptable i e the non linear fea could be used as an alternative method for ultimate strength assessment as shown in fig 17 at the ultimate state von mises stress distribution of three models were presented it could be observed that the zone entered plasticity at the center plate near the longitudinal boundaries and the side plate near the center both in the model 1 and model 2 which were slightly different from that in model 3 due to the increased transverse load as shown in fig 18 with the increase of transverse loads the plastic area at the center of the central plate increased gradually until all the center plate entered plasticity besides transverse loads would also affect the plastic area of the stiffener then with the out of plane deformation increased local tension increased finally this distinct deformation would hence unload the whole structure with respect to the out of plane deformations the most obvious deformations located at the center plate and situated at the 1 4 of the panel which was suitable for the three models in addition with the transverse load increased the maximum deformation increased in the center plate and the number of half wave showed a decreasing trend in the side plate the reason for this was the center plate yield caused by transverse load and at this time the longitudinal load increased slightly would result in the collapse of the whole structure additionally the half wave peaks of side plate are sharper than that of center plate and the reason for this was the side plates were supported by longitudinal girders which owned larger stiffness the collapse modes were shown in fig 19 the numerical results were consistent with experimental results in model 1 and model 2 but large deformation appeared in the longitudinal boundaries and center plate in model 3 it may be resulted from the concentrated initial deflection in the center plate 4 2 2 influence of different initial deflection and boundary conditions one of the indispensable roles in ultimate strength analysis was initial deflections then the different initial deflection included the typical equivalent initial deflection and measured were investigated and the magnitude of the deformation kept the same as the previous description as shown in fig 20 average denoted the equivalent type with average imperfection level slight denoted the equivalent type with slight imperfection level and laser denoted the type measured by experiment obviously ultimate strength of the equivalent initial deflection was lower than that of laser and experiments i e the ultimate strength of average and slight may underestimate the ultimate load carrying capacity besides the ultimate strength value of stiffened plate containing slight imperfection level was closer to the experimental results than that with the average level summary of the ultimate strength included different initial deflection were shown in table 7 as mentioned before the actual boundary conditions ought to fall between the clamped and the simply supported conditions then the difference in ultimate strength results caused by boundary conditions was explored and the load displacement curves were shown in fig 21 something worthwhile to be noted the ultimate strength may be underestimated or overestimated under the condition of simply supported or clamped while with the transverse load increased above 200 kn the ultimate strength may close to that of simply supported as is shown in table 8 the maximum difference of different transverse load and different boundary conditions was not lager than 2 9 i e the difference caused by boundary conditions was negligible 4 2 3 influence of the lateral pressure and transverse load fujikubo et al 2005b proposed that the ultimate strength of an unstiffened plate may be higher when lateral loads were present but it could also accelerate the yield of material and then reduce the ultimate strength of the unstiffened plate which depended on the failure modes however the results presented by xu et al 2017 enriched the influencing factors and proposed that the ultimate strength depended on the collapsed shape first distinguish the thick or thin plates by the plate slenderness for the thin plate of β 3 49 whose failure mode was symmetrical the lateral load would reduce the ultimate strength however the lateral pressure will delay the yielding of plate which would result in the load carrying capacity increasing for the thick plate of β 1 01 whose collapse modes were periodical as shown in fig 18 according to the results obtained without lateral loads the transverse load would result in the attached plate deformation increasing in the direction of the initial deformation the failure mode was the lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners as for the results obtained without transverse loads finding that it was sufficient to change the buckling direction of the center plate when the lateral load reached 0 061 mpa in other words when the transverse load was equal to 0 kn and the lateral pressure was equal to 0 061 mpa the buckling deformation of center plate changed from being consistent with the direction of initial deformation to be consistent with the direction of lateral pressure besides when the lateral pressure reached at 0 122 mpa a similar change was more obvious however when the lateral pressure was equal to 0 061 mpa it was not enough to change the direction of out of plane deformation partially caused by transverse loads that exceed 200 kn but the lateral pressure still restrained out of plane deformation but when the lateral pressure reached at 0 122 mpa the lateral pressure would eliminate the effect of initial deflection on the direction of deformation completely then with the increasing of transverse loads it would aggravate the deformation in the direction of lateral pressure firstly when the lateral load was less than 0 061 mpa the ultimate load bearing capacity was not always decreasing with the lateral pressure increased as shown in fig 18 when the transverse load ranged from 200 kn to 300 kn the center attached plate deformed to the up surface then the ultimate strength of stiffened plate increased as shown in fig 22 a because lateral pressure would restrain this deformation it was the lateral pressure that restrained deformation but not enough to change the direction of deformation which led to the increase in the ultimate strength compared with these load cases without lateral pressure however when the lateral load reached 0 122 mpa the ultimate strength would decrease significantly at this time the failure mode was similar to the overall buckling of the plating and stiffeners the lateral load was sufficient to change the direction of buckling deformation towards the direction of lateral loads in order to verify the lateral loads of 0 061 mpa were not enough to change the deformation trend but it can play a role in restraining the opposite lateral loads of 0 061 mpa were applied in the load conditions whose transverse loads were 200 kn 250 kn and 300 kn respectively if the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under reverse lateral pressure was lower than the ultimate strength under no lateral pressure and the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under no lateral pressure was lower than that under lateral pressure the suppression or aggravation effects exist as shown in fig 22 b the lateral pressure applied from down to up would decrease the ultimate strength i e opposite lateral pressure exacerbated the deformation and the lateral pressure applied form up to down would increase the ultimate strength i e lateral pressure suppressed deformation secondly when the transverse load was less than 200 kn and the lateral pressure was equal to 0 061 mpa the failure of stiffened plate was mainly caused by the buckling of attached plate and as shown in fig 22 a when the transverse loads were 50 kn or even 100 kn the ultimate strength of stiffened plate would increase slightly the reason for this was that the lower transverse loads enhanced the rigidity of boundary which resulted in strengthening the boundary s restraint on the plate frame and delayed the bucking deformation but it was worth noting that similar phenomena would occur in the presence of lateral pressure for example the out of plane deformation for fig 18 e was larger than that of fig 18 b because of the presence of transverse loads then the lateral pressure would have an effect on the increasing of ultimate strength this lateral pressure was not large enough to change the direction of deformation but the restrain on deformation would increase the ultimate strength besides when the transverse load was the main component the failure modes changed to the combination of local buckling of stiffener web and lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners after the collapse of plating then the ultimate strength of stiffened plate decreases sharply and the phenomenon of decreasing and failure modes was consistent with the experiment finally when the transverse load was large enough the failure mode was similar to that obtained only by transverse loads xu et al 2013 during this period most parts of the stiffened plate yielded due to the higher transverse loads then lower longitudinal loads contribute to the collapse of the stiffened plate 5 conclusion this research pays attention to the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under biaxial and lateral loads by means of experimental tests and numerical simulated analysis by comparison of experimental and numerical results both the ultimate strength of stiffened plate and failure modes were consistent and this kind of experimental set up would provide a reference for combined loads experiments the following conclusions can be drawn 1 according to the results of strain the edge of the panel yielded instead of buckling because of the influence of boundary and the deformation direction of the center plate was opposite to that of the side plate 2 considering the material properties initial deflection and boundary conditions of the structure the ultimate strength obtained by non linear fea was relatively close to that of experiments which confirmed the effectiveness of the nonlinear finite element analysis method 3 comparing the ultimate strength values of simply supported clamped and experimental conditions by non linear fea the maximum error of different boundary was 2 28 i e the influence of boundary conditions could be ignored comparing the initial deflection of measurement by laser and typical equivalent types the results of the slight level were closer to that of experimental measurement and the typical equivalent initial deflection of the average level may underestimate the ultimate strength 4 the longitudinal ultimate strength generally showed a decreasing trend as the lateral pressure increased however when the stiffened plate deformed opposite to the direction of lateral pressure the lateral pressure that restrained deformation but not enough to change the direction of deformation would lead to the increase in the ultimate strength 5 the longitudinal ultimate strength generally showed a decreasing trend as the transverse loads increased when the transverse loads were large enough but not account for the main components the failure modes were the combination of local buckling of the web and lateral torsional buckling of the stiffener the transverse loads would reduce the ultimate load capacity however when the transverse loads occupied the main loads the failure modes were similar to that caused by transverse load only credit authorship contribution statement hongyang ma methodology

20836,the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to combined biaxial compression and lateral loads has not been widely investigated yet by experiments in this study both experimental and numerical analyses were performed to study the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of stiffened plates under the combined biaxial compression and lateral loads and the experimental set up provides reference for combined loads experiments the initial deformation of the experimental specimens has been measured by laser scanning technique and taken account in the nonlinear finite element analysis collapse modes have also been analyzed and compared and influences of the interaction of lateral and transverse loads on the ultimate strength have been investigated results show that lateral pressure would enhance the ultimate load carrying capacity when the lateral pressure restrained deformation and the collapse mode was the combination of local web buckling and lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners when transverse loads were dominant load components keywords stiffened plates ultimate strength biaxial compression experiments lateral pressure local web buckling lateral torsional buckling 1 introduction the ship bottom structures are mainly composed of stiffened plates which could not only maintain the ultimate strength of the bottom structure but also lighten the weight normally stiffened plates of ship bottom structure are usually bearing multiple direction combined loads including in plane and out of plane loads they come from the bending moment of the hull and the bottom water pressure as is known to us a container ship is subjected to longitudinal compression because of bending moments transverse compression due to outboard water pressure and lateral pressure on account of underwater pressure in bottom plates however it is not very clear yet to know how combined transverse and lateral loads would have an impact on the longitudinal ultimate load bearing capacity then for the purpose of comprehensively and accurately figuring the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened plates both the influence of biaxial loads and lateral pressure should be fully taken into account the stability of stiffened plates bearing longitudinal loads alone or additional lateral loads has been investigated widely for the past few years the ultimate strength of stiffened plates was researched from various perspectives and some results obtained by these methods match well with corresponding tests guedes soares and gordo 1996 derived a formula for evaluating the ultimate strength of plates under biaxial compressions and lateral loads taking the initial deformations and residual stresses as influential factors yao et al 1997 found the ultimate strength was almost independent of the loading sequence i e the effect of the loading sequence could be ignored then lateral and in plane loads were applied in different steps paik and kim 2002 studied the formula for calculating the ultimate strength of stiffened plate bearing bending and lateral loads and proposed that the ultimate strength of stiffened plates was determined by the minimum values of six buckling modes fujikubo et al 2005a 2005b analyzed the ultimate strength of continuous plate and stiffened plates bearing combined lateral and transverse loads respectively then found that membrane stresses would restrain the occurrence of buckling additionally nonlinear finite element analysis non linear fea method has been selected to study the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under the action of biaxial and lateral loads by paik and seo 2009a b then analyze the important factors including loading types and dimensions which might play an important role in the ultimate load carrying capacity of stiffened plates xu and guedes soares 2011 analyzed the influence of various kinds of designed models in the research of experiment set up including 1 span 1 1 spans 1 1 2 1 2 spans and 3 spans under biaxial loads whose boundary conditions were simply supported and clamped xu and guedes soares 2013a and 2013b performed wide and narrow stiffened panels experiment to obtain the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under axial compression and compared the results with those acquired by non linear fea whose initial deflection was introduced by displacement transducer xu et al 2017 found that tensile stresses exist when the lateral pressure acts on the plate whose edges were constrained and the tensile stresses have an impact on the ultimate load carrying capacity of stiffened plates subjected to combined loads shanmugam et al 2014 conducted tests on stiffened plates subjected to combined actions of longitudinal and lateral loads and proposed that plate slenderness ratio served as a key role in determining the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to such combined loads cui and wang 2020 performed experiments on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with an opening then compare the results with those acquired by non linear fea to conduct the failure mechanism of such kind of stiffened plates most ultimate strength of stiffened plates tests were conducted under uniaxial compressive loads or coupled with lateral pressures because the loading and boundary conditions are difficult to simulate in the experiment there are few biaxial compression experiments on stiffened plates however combined biaxial with lateral loads are closer to the real sea cases which could be able to obtain a more accurate ultimate strength performance of stiffened plates besides a more convincing influence of lateral and transverse loads on the ultimate load bearing capacity of stiffened plates could be obtained by comparison of numerical calculation and experiment based on experimental tests and the corresponding nonlinear finite element analysis the main objective of this research is to research the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to combined biaxial compressions and lateral pressure it is expected that both numerical and experimental analysis will bring insight into the mechanism of collapse and the ultimate load carrying capacity test devices for the ultimate strength of stiffened plates bearing biaxial compressions were designed for exploring the collapse behaviors of stiffened plates subjected to combined loads the influence of initial imperfection which was measured by laser scanning technique was taken into consideration in the numerical analysis and other typical equivalent initial deflections were also taken account in the numerical analysis for comparison with the experimental tests besides both simply supported conditions and clamped conditions were analyzed to distinguish the influence of different boundary conditions furthermore the influence of the lateral and transverse loads on the ultimate strength was analyzed 2 experimental set up 2 1 details of test specimens the typical stiffened plates used in the test refer to the typical double bottom structure of the ship which was subjected to combined biaxial compression and lateral loads the experimental models of the stiffened plate were usually designed into 1 2 1 2 spans or 1 2 1 1 2 spans according to the research by xu and guedes soares 2013a the purpose of such dimensions is to simulate the true boundaries although 1 2 1 1 2 span model supplies the influence of transverse components it needs a more complex device to deal with transverse boundaries at the same time the objective of this experiment considered biaxial compressions then it should also be loaded in transverse edges besides the practical dimensions of bottom stiffened plates experiments are not feasible to perform in the laboratory because of unachievable tooling design and limitation of hydraulic jacks to facilitate experiment tests under current laboratory conditions and purpose one span and one bay model was adopted and dimensions of the specimens were selected with an appropriate scale some simplifications were adopted in the specimens strong square tubes were adopted to achieve simplifying boundary condition in order to facilitate the application of transverse loads and stop the girders from tripping box girders were chosen to sever as longitudinal girder square steels with larger stiffness were installed at both ends of the longitudinal section in order to apply the longitudinal compressive load uniformly distributed along the cross section the ultimate strength of stiffened plates subjected to biaxial compression and lateral pressure was the most important objective whereas the similarity between practical structures and specimens was not considered as mandatory requirements in the models design and slenderness radios were calculated by eq 1 ranging from 1 to 2 5 of β and ranging from 0 05 to 1 0 of λ were acceptable based on the investigation of zhang 2016 1 β b t p σ y e λ a π r σ y e r i a where β is the plate slenderness λ is the column slenderness of stiffened panel r is gyration radius of stiffener with attached plate a is the distance between two adjacent transverse frame length of stiffened plates b is the width of attached plate t p is the thickness of attached plate σ y is the yield stress of material e is the young s modulus of material a is the area of transverse section of stiffened panel i is the moment of inertia of stiffener with attached plate three stiffened plate specimens subjected to biaxial compression and uniform lateral loads were performed to study the load bearing capacity and the failure mechanism they were model 1 model 2 and model 3 respectively in this study the plate slenderness ratio of specimens was 1 801 and the stiffener slenderness ratio was 0 761 the sizes of the plates between two longitudinal stiffeners were both 600mm 160 3 mm i e the total sizes of the plates were both 600mm 480 3 mm the size of stiffener was 30 10 3 mm i e the web height of stiffener h w was 30 mm the web thickness of stiffener t w is 3 mm the flange plate width of stiffener b f is 10 mm and the flange thickness t f of stiffener 3 mm the dimension of square steel was 50 mm 50 mm 15 mm which was slightly taller than stiffeners considering that transverse loads should be applied at the same time the longitudinal box girder was installed with the size of 40 mm 30 mm 6 mm which was not only a longitudinal load bearing member but also used to impose transverse load the stiffened plate is derived from a 10 000teu container ship surrounded by strong support members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames since the design draught of the 10 000teu container ship is d 12 m the draught heights 0 d 1 2 d and d were selected to study the influence of the lateral pressure on the ultimate strength however only the draught height 1 2 d was adopted in the experiments and the other load cases were analyzed in the non linear finite element analysis the lateral pressure action was taken as 0 061 mpa which arouse from the water pressure at the draught of 6 m and is calculated by eq 2 2 p ρ g h where ρ is the sea water density 1025 k g m 3 g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the draught height 6 m all the test specimens were made of the same batch of q235 steel tension tests were conducted to obtain the tensile properties of the experimental structures under the room temperature 20 c load is applied in the form of 1 mm min with the aid of displacement control method the summary of specimens is shown in table 1 considering the difficulty to apply biaxial load proportionally and the condition of practical sea cases take the longitudinal loads as the major load the stiffened plate is derived from the ship bottom plate and the upward water pressure make convex deflection which would induce transverse compression stresses tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 and the transverse compressive stresses may affect the ultimate strength according to the investigation report of mol comfort class nk 2014 maritime bureau ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan 2015 then for the purpose of forming a proportional to the longitudinal loads the transverse loads were set as certain values in the experiment longitudinal loads arise from longitudinal bending which could be considered as the major load components then during the experiments the failure of the entire stricture was caused by longitudinal loads the summary of load cases is shown in table 2 these load cases were applied in three models respectively in order to eliminate the gap and release part of the residual stress the specimens were preloaded with a load of 5 t then the ultimate load capacity tests were carried out fig 1 shows the dimensions of test specimens and positions of strain displacement gauges there are forty eight strain gauges and three displacement gauges where g1 g48 represents the strain measure position and d1 d3 represents the displacement measure position g1 g30 measured the longitudinal strain of the longitudinal girder each longitudinal positions were placed with six strain gauges circumferentially and g31 g38 which located at the center or edges of plate measured the longitudinal strain of the plate g39 g42 were used to measure the longitudinal strain of longitudinal stiffener they were located at two sides of web and flange plate respectively besides in order to monitor the transverse compressive load g43 g48 were arranged to measure transverse strain furthermore there were three displacement gauges d1 was arranged at the center of stiffened plates to measure the lateral displacement of the center plate d2 was placed at the bottom of stiffener and d3 was placed at the center of the side plate and all the displacement gauges were placed at the longitudinal centerline of the stiffened plate the surface without stiffener is up and the surface with stiffener is down besides the upward and downward denote the deformation direction toward the opposite or consistent direction with lateral loads it is worth noting that all the gauges were placed at the concerning area such as predicted maximum stress areas 2 2 experimental layout and testing system the dimensions of experimental specimen edges would change when they were loaded i e the length of edges would not be fixed during the tests once the size of edges changed it would cause a loading conflict and the failure of experiments considering the longitudinal loads were the main load components in the actual load cases a feasible approach was applied to avoid the loading conflict the longitudinal loads were applied on the total area of longitudinal boundaries however the transverse loads were applied on the partial area of transverse edges during the experiments transverse loads were applied before longitudinal loads after the transverse loads were applied in the partial area of edges it would spare some space for longitudinal deformation and so as to escape from loading conflict based on the designed plan as is shown in fig 2 biaxial compressions were loaded with the help of four blocks which made it possible to guarantee the uniform loading and the load blocks would move straight on the slide in order to apply lateral pressure on the surface of plates uniformly a weight was adopted to assist experiments as shown in fig 2 a and the supplementary picture named as fig 2 d the weight was applied by the following steps first some sandbags were placed uniformly on the surface up and they were fully contacted with the surface of the specimen the sandbags were fully pressed so that there is almost no gap between the sandbags and the specimen and make sure the upper surface of the sandbags were flat then an auxiliary i beam which was used to place weights whose dimensions exceed the boundary of the specimen was put on the upside of sandbags finally the major weight was put on the surface of the i beam when the weight is pressed on i beam the sandbags would be more fully contacted with the specimen besides it should be mentioned that the total weight of weight i beam and sandbags provided the lateral pressure of 0 061 mpa the boundary of the specimen was restricted by hydraulic jacks and foundation besides there were four pairs of angle bar adopted to fix edges of the specimen and then the longitudinal edges of structures were restrained by angle bars connected with load blocks so there would not be out of plane displacement and deformation existing in the edges both displacement gauges and strain gauges were applied in the focus location 3 nonlinear finite element analysis non linear fea has been developed into a general method for ultimate strength analysis for the past few years in this research it was conducted with the computer code abaqus 6 13 and the element type was taken as s4r whose four nodes all own six degrees of freedom 3 1 finite element model and mesh sensitivity analysis first of all the accuracy of the modeling needs to be established before any other analysis because the mesh size will influence the final results to obtain more convincing numerical results the size of mesh should be fined enough however to keep the balance of computing capability and precision of results mesh sensitivity analysis of model is necessary to be performed in view of the acceptable mesh size set up in ref xu and guedes soares 2013c the numbers of tee bar mesh numbers were set as six in web and flange plate respectively besides the panel mesh numbers were set as ten then take the mesh number of panel between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners web and flange plate as the measurement of mesh refinement the plate under biaxial and lateral loads was selected to analyze the influence of the mesh sizes on the ultimate strength the peak values which were showed in fig 3 exhibited a stable state when the mesh number of the attached plate between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners was 16 elements 32 elements and 64 elements respectively and the mesh number of corresponding web was 3 elements 6 elements and 12 elements besides the mesh number of flange plate was 1 element 2 elements and 4 elements they were expressed in the form of coordinates 16 3 1 32 6 2 and 64 12 4 respectively the ultimate strengths of them were 835 70 kn 839 61 kn and 840 61 kn respectively considering the accuracy of results and appropriate computing abilities the mesh numbers of attached plate were selected as 32 at the same time the mesh numbers of flange plate were 2 which could also be able to capture the local buckling process the final element model was shown in fig 4 3 2 initial geometric imperfections initial imperfections produced in the process of fabrications and manufactures such as initial deflections are unavoidable the failure modes of plates subjected to biaxial compression at the ultimate state will be affected by initial deflection paik et al 2004 the residual stresses were not considered in the analysis which were partially released by preloading xu and guedes soares 2013b and 2013c as showed in fig 5 the actual initial geometric imperfections were measured by lasing scanning technique the distributed datum points were used to scan the surface of specimens according to the scanned data the 3d distributions of geometric imperfections were pictured in fig 6 the x axis direction in the figure is the longitudinal direction of plate y axis direction represents transverse direction z axial direction represents lateral direction the equivalent initial imperfection served as contrast is expressed as follows fujikubo et al 2005a initial

calculated by eq 6 6 a b m m 1 eqns 3 6 were used to calculate equivalent initial imperfection of stiffened plates with a 0 0 1 β 2 t for average imperfection level and a 0 0 025 β 2 t for slight level smith et al 1987 was analyzed for comparison with imperfection measured by laser technique b 0 c 0 0 0015 a kim et al 2018 the initial deflection measured by laser scanning technique included the first two types of initial deflection then the first two typical global initial deflection was also put together for comparison with that measured in the experiment statistics of the measured initial deflection and typical equivalent initial imperfection have been summarized in table 3 3 3 boundary conditions and load application as shown in fig 4 one span one bay model was selected to reflect the actual structural characteristics because the longitudinal boundaries were connected with two square cubes in the experiment which were strong enough the longitudinal boundaries were coupling with two reference points in the finite element model boundary conditions are essential to influence the ultimate strength in the numerical simulations then the boundary conditions were set as consistent as possible to the experiment and load conditions were also applied in two steps as for the boundary condition of load case 1 table 4 lateral pressure was applied in step 1 and then longitudinal loads were applied in step 2 as for the boundary condition of load case 2 and load case 3 table 5 lateral pressure and transverse loads were applied in step 1 and longitudinal loads were applied in step 2 however it is worth noting that the simulation boundary conditions were not perfect because of the simplified and idealized treatment boundaries were applied with equal displacement by coupling by xu and guedes soares 2012 denote u x u y and u z as the translational displacements in x y and z directions respectively and θ x θ y and θ z as the rotational displacements in x y and z directions respectively it should be noted that the surface of a b was coupling with the reference point 1 rp 1 the surface of c d was coupling with the reference point 2 rp 2 the surface of b 2 c 2 was coupling with the reference point 3 rp 3 and the surface of the a 2 d 2 was coupling with reference point 4 rp 4 the following are the boundary conditions of stiffened plate adopted in the finite element analysis the actual longitudinal and transverse boundaries were partially restrained i e the boundary conditions should fall in between the clamped conditions and the simply supported ones to study the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under lateral and biaxial loads and the influential degree of boundary conditions on the failure modes both simply supported boundary conditions and clamped boundary conditions were investigated for comparison paik et al 2009a b for boundaries simply supported there was no lateral deflection only but rotational were not restrained for boundaries clamped lateral deflection and rotational restraints were restrained totally 4 results and discussion as shown in fig 7 uniaxial tensile tests have been conducted in the testing system and the engineering stress strain curves were obtained by via of eq 7 the true stress strain curves were pictured to compare with the engineering stress strain curve the true yield strength was used in numerical analysis 7 ε t r u e l n 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g 4 1 experimental results both the variations of stress and out of plane displacement were analyzed to study the buckling sequence of local structures and buckling collapse modes and take g and d as strain gauge and displacement gauge respectively it should be noted that the change of lateral displacement was not monitored due to the slip of displacement gauges when the lateral load was applying the data obtained by displacement gauge were all recorded after the lateral pressure loaded 4 1 1 results of model 1 m1 as shown in fig 8 a the ultimate strength obtained in the experiment 1 was 845 67 kn and the displacement was 6 45 mm the results of the displacement gauges were shown in fig 9 during the period of preloading longitudinal load at the time of 470s 1091s the purpose of this process was to eliminate the gap and between the hydraulic cylinder and the specimen it could also eliminate part of the residual stress caused by welding at this stage it can be observed that the three displacement gauges behave the similar amplitude changes because of the preloading of 5 t load at the same time the lateral displacement at the measured place increased in the direction from down to up which means the directions of initial deformations at the position of three displacement gauges were opposite to the direction of lateral pressure the longitudinal compressive load increased from 0 kn to 200 kn during the period of 1091s 1350s and the lateral displacement and longitudinal displacement increased gradually at the same time then the longitudinal load was loaded by means of displacement during this period the lateral displacement and longitudinal displacement increased rapidly until the longitudinal load arrived at 845 6 kn the turning points appeared in the longitudinal and lateral displacement curves respectively i e the stiffened plate collapsed then the lateral displacement increased rapidly because the stiffened plate could no longer bear the lateral load the locations of the strain gauges were shown in fig 1 and the measured results of strain gauges were shown in fig 10 the results of measured strain at the position of up surface down surface and stiffener were shown in three coordinate systems when the longitudinal load arrived at the ultimate bearing capacity of the stiffened plate a further increase of loads caused large deformation of the plate turning points were observed in g34 and g36 which were caused by stress redistribution caused by local plastic deformation however g34 located at the up surface and g36 located at the down surface i e the directions of buckling deformation in the center plate and side plate were opposite as shown in fig 15 a and fig 15 b besides as a result of the dividing point between elastic and plastic strain was 1 277 10 3 local buckling area occurred plastic deformation in the center plate and that occurred elastic deformation in the side plate the similar phenomenon also occurred in model 2 and model 3 there was no turning point in g31 and g35 which were located at the edge of longitudinal girder the strain of them both increased rapidly because of the local yielding the difference was mainly owing to g31 and g35 were located at the junction of the plate and stiffener and they were impossible to buckle because of boundaries as for the strain gauges at the surface of stiffener the results of initial strain were positive because of the applied lateral pressure the strain curves of g39 and g42 which were located at the surface of web keep linear all the time however the strain curves of g40 and g41 which were located at the surface of flange plate began to decrease this phenomenon indicated that the web could still bear the load and there was no obvious deformation and the flange plate twisted which led to the occurrence of the turning point 4 1 2 results of model 2 m2 fig 8 b showed the ultimate load bearing capacity of m2 the ultimate strength obtained in the experiment 2 was 855 06 kn and the displacement was 5 65 mm the results of the displacement gauges were shown in fig 11 after the similar preload to eliminate the gap and part of residual stress generated by welding transverse load was applied linearly during the period of 684s 906s until the transverse load up to 200 kn and then propagated during this period both transverse displacement and lateral displacement increased in the opposite direction of the initial deflection then the longitudinal load was applied to 200 kn from the time of 906s and the longitudinal displacement and lateral displacement increased and then the longitudinal load was applied in the form of displacement load until the stiffened collapsed at this time the longitudinal load reached 855 06 kn after reaching the ultimate state the lateral displacement increased rapidly because of the existence of lateral load the measurement results of the strain gauges were shown in fig 12 when the longitudinal load was small strain of each gauges changed in a linear trend until the longitudinal load reached the ultimate load capacity the turning point occurred in g34 and g36 which were caused by stress redistribution due to local deformation however g34 located at the up surface and g36 located at the down surface i e the directions of buckling deformation in center plate and side plate were opposite which was consistent with fig 15 c and d there were no turning points in g31 and g35 which were located at the edge of the longitudinal girder the strain of them both increased rapidly because of the local yield the main reason for this difference was that g31 and g35 were located at the junction of the plate and stiffener and they were impossible to buckle because of boundaries the g33 and g37 were located at the edge of the panel which was also the junction of plate and stiffener and so there was no buckling as for the gauges at the surface of stiffener after the lateral pressure was loaded the initial strain was positive because the stiffener was stretched it is similar to model 1 the g39 and g42 which were located at the surface of web remained linear at the end of curve but the g40 and g41 which were located at the surface of flange plate began to decrease indicating that there was no obvious deformation in web while the flange plate twisted 4 1 3 results of model 3 m3 as shown in fig 8 c the ultimate strength obtained in the experiment 3 was 837 72 kn and the displacement was 6 51 mm the results of the displacement gauges were shown in fig 13 after preloading was applied for the similar purpose the transverse load increased to 250 kn and then propagated during this period the transverse displacement increased linearly and lateral displacement increased slightly from the time of 1378s the longitudinal load was applied to 200 kn and then applied in the form of displacement until the longitudinal load up to 837 72 kn the stiffened plate collapsed and could no longer bear loads then the lateral displacement increased rapidly the measurement results of strain gauge were shown in fig 14 under the longitudinal load each gauge behaved compressive strain when the longitudinal load arrived at ultimate load capacity the stiffened plate collapsed turning points could be observed in g36 and g38 which were both located at the down surface of plate i e the directions of buckling deformation in center plate and side plate were same which were consistent with fig 15 e and f as for g31 g35 g33 and g37 there were no turning points because these locations which were situated at the junction of plate and girder or stiffener yielded instead of buckling besides those strain located at the surface of stiffener was positive because of lateral pressure and then changed linearly which means the stiffener could able to bear loads 4 2 numerical simulation results by nonlinear finite element analysis with the aid of commercial software abaqus the corresponding numerical simulations based nonlinear finite element analysis were carried out to research the collapse modes of the stiffened plate subjected to combined biaxial compression and lateral loads the influence of different boundary conditions different initial deflections lateral loads and transverse loads was all analyzed by systematic comparison 4 2 1 finite element analysis results by taking the measured initial deflections into numerical models the ultimate strength of the relevant numerical analysis was investigated and the results were shown in fig 16 when the transverse load was 0 kn the ultimate strength calculated by the numerical model which introduced the measured initial deformation was 854 69 kn while the ultimate strength of m1 in the experiment was 845 67 kn i e the error was 1 07 when the transverse load was 200 kn the ultimate strength calculated by the numerical model which introduced the measured initial deformation was 848 88 kn while the ultimate strength of m2 in the experiment was 855 06 kn i e the error was 0 72 it should be noted that transverse load would lead to the change of longitudinal displacement because u x was not restricted when the transverse load was loading even it would result in the change of initial longitudinal loads when the transverse load was 250 kn the ultimate strength calculated by the numerical model which introduced the measured initial deformation was 832 60 kn while the ultimate strength of m3 in the experiment was 837 72 kn i e the error was 0 61 summary of the results obtained by experiment and finite element analysis were shown in table 6 in view of the inescapable uncertainties in the experiments the results obtained by nonlinear finite element analysis were acceptable i e the non linear fea could be used as an alternative method for ultimate strength assessment as shown in fig 17 at the ultimate state von mises stress distribution of three models were presented it could be observed that the zone entered plasticity at the center plate near the longitudinal boundaries and the side plate near the center both in the model 1 and model 2 which were slightly different from that in model 3 due to the increased transverse load as shown in fig 18 with the increase of transverse loads the plastic area at the center of the central plate increased gradually until all the center plate entered plasticity besides transverse loads would also affect the plastic area of the stiffener then with the out of plane deformation increased local tension increased finally this distinct deformation would hence unload the whole structure with respect to the out of plane deformations the most obvious deformations located at the center plate and situated at the 1 4 of the panel which was suitable for the three models in addition with the transverse load increased the maximum deformation increased in the center plate and the number of half wave showed a decreasing trend in the side plate the reason for this was the center plate yield caused by transverse load and at this time the longitudinal load increased slightly would result in the collapse of the whole structure additionally the half wave peaks of side plate are sharper than that of center plate and the reason for this was the side plates were supported by longitudinal girders which owned larger stiffness the collapse modes were shown in fig 19 the numerical results were consistent with experimental results in model 1 and model 2 but large deformation appeared in the longitudinal boundaries and center plate in model 3 it may be resulted from the concentrated initial deflection in the center plate 4 2 2 influence of different initial deflection and boundary conditions one of the indispensable roles in ultimate strength analysis was initial deflections then the different initial deflection included the typical equivalent initial deflection and measured were investigated and the magnitude of the deformation kept the same as the previous description as shown in fig 20 average denoted the equivalent type with average imperfection level slight denoted the equivalent type with slight imperfection level and laser denoted the type measured by experiment obviously ultimate strength of the equivalent initial deflection was lower than that of laser and experiments i e the ultimate strength of average and slight may underestimate the ultimate load carrying capacity besides the ultimate strength value of stiffened plate containing slight imperfection level was closer to the experimental results than that with the average level summary of the ultimate strength included different initial deflection were shown in table 7 as mentioned before the actual boundary conditions ought to fall between the clamped and the simply supported conditions then the difference in ultimate strength results caused by boundary conditions was explored and the load displacement curves were shown in fig 21 something worthwhile to be noted the ultimate strength may be underestimated or overestimated under the condition of simply supported or clamped while with the transverse load increased above 200 kn the ultimate strength may close to that of simply supported as is shown in table 8 the maximum difference of different transverse load and different boundary conditions was not lager than 2 9 i e the difference caused by boundary conditions was negligible 4 2 3 influence of the lateral pressure and transverse load fujikubo et al 2005b proposed that the ultimate strength of an unstiffened plate may be higher when lateral loads were present but it could also accelerate the yield of material and then reduce the ultimate strength of the unstiffened plate which depended on the failure modes however the results presented by xu et al 2017 enriched the influencing factors and proposed that the ultimate strength depended on the collapsed shape first distinguish the thick or thin plates by the plate slenderness for the thin plate of β 3 49 whose failure mode was symmetrical the lateral load would reduce the ultimate strength however the lateral pressure will delay the yielding of plate which would result in the load carrying capacity increasing for the thick plate of β 1 01 whose collapse modes were periodical as shown in fig 18 according to the results obtained without lateral loads the transverse load would result in the attached plate deformation increasing in the direction of the initial deformation the failure mode was the lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners as for the results obtained without transverse loads finding that it was sufficient to change the buckling direction of the center plate when the lateral load reached 0 061 mpa in other words when the transverse load was equal to 0 kn and the lateral pressure was equal to 0 061 mpa the buckling deformation of center plate changed from being consistent with the direction of initial deformation to be consistent with the direction of lateral pressure besides when the lateral pressure reached at 0 122 mpa a similar change was more obvious however when the lateral pressure was equal to 0 061 mpa it was not enough to change the direction of out of plane deformation partially caused by transverse loads that exceed 200 kn but the lateral pressure still restrained out of plane deformation but when the lateral pressure reached at 0 122 mpa the lateral pressure would eliminate the effect of initial deflection on the direction of deformation completely then with the increasing of transverse loads it would aggravate the deformation in the direction of lateral pressure firstly when the lateral load was less than 0 061 mpa the ultimate load bearing capacity was not always decreasing with the lateral pressure increased as shown in fig 18 when the transverse load ranged from 200 kn to 300 kn the center attached plate deformed to the up surface then the ultimate strength of stiffened plate increased as shown in fig 22 a because lateral pressure would restrain this deformation it was the lateral pressure that restrained deformation but not enough to change the direction of deformation which led to the increase in the ultimate strength compared with these load cases without lateral pressure however when the lateral load reached 0 122 mpa the ultimate strength would decrease significantly at this time the failure mode was similar to the overall buckling of the plating and stiffeners the lateral load was sufficient to change the direction of buckling deformation towards the direction of lateral loads in order to verify the lateral loads of 0 061 mpa were not enough to change the deformation trend but it can play a role in restraining the opposite lateral loads of 0 061 mpa were applied in the load conditions whose transverse loads were 200 kn 250 kn and 300 kn respectively if the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under reverse lateral pressure was lower than the ultimate strength under no lateral pressure and the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under no lateral pressure was lower than that under lateral pressure the suppression or aggravation effects exist as shown in fig 22 b the lateral pressure applied from down to up would decrease the ultimate strength i e opposite lateral pressure exacerbated the deformation and the lateral pressure applied form up to down would increase the ultimate strength i e lateral pressure suppressed deformation secondly when the transverse load was less than 200 kn and the lateral pressure was equal to 0 061 mpa the failure of stiffened plate was mainly caused by the buckling of attached plate and as shown in fig 22 a when the transverse loads were 50 kn or even 100 kn the ultimate strength of stiffened plate would increase slightly the reason for this was that the lower transverse loads enhanced the rigidity of boundary which resulted in strengthening the boundary s restraint on the plate frame and delayed the bucking deformation but it was worth noting that similar phenomena would occur in the presence of lateral pressure for example the out of plane deformation for fig 18 e was larger than that of fig 18 b because of the presence of transverse loads then the lateral pressure would have an effect on the increasing of ultimate strength this lateral pressure was not large enough to change the direction of deformation but the restrain on deformation would increase the ultimate strength besides when the transverse load was the main component the failure modes changed to the combination of local buckling of stiffener web and lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners after the collapse of plating then the ultimate strength of stiffened plate decreases sharply and the phenomenon of decreasing and failure modes was consistent with the experiment finally when the transverse load was large enough the failure mode was similar to that obtained only by transverse loads xu et al 2013 during this period most parts of the stiffened plate yielded due to the higher transverse loads then lower longitudinal loads contribute to the collapse of the stiffened plate 5 conclusion this research pays attention to the ultimate strength of stiffened plate under biaxial and lateral loads by means of experimental tests and numerical simulated analysis by comparison of experimental and numerical results both the ultimate strength of stiffened plate and failure modes were consistent and this kind of experimental set up would provide a reference for combined loads experiments the following conclusions can be drawn 1 according to the results of strain the edge of the panel yielded instead of buckling because of the influence of boundary and the deformation direction of the center plate was opposite to that of the side plate 2 considering the material properties initial deflection and boundary conditions of the structure the ultimate strength obtained by non linear fea was relatively close to that of experiments which confirmed the effectiveness of the nonlinear finite element analysis method 3 comparing the ultimate strength values of simply supported clamped and experimental conditions by non linear fea the maximum error of different boundary was 2 28 i e the influence of boundary conditions could be ignored comparing the initial deflection of measurement by laser and typical equivalent types the results of the slight level were closer to that of experimental measurement and the typical equivalent initial deflection of the average level may underestimate the ultimate strength 4 the longitudinal ultimate strength generally showed a decreasing trend as the lateral pressure increased however when the stiffened plate deformed opposite to the direction of lateral pressure the lateral pressure that restrained deformation but not enough to change the direction of deformation would lead to the increase in the ultimate strength 5 the longitudinal ultimate strength generally showed a decreasing trend as the transverse loads increased when the transverse loads were large enough but not account for the main components the failure modes were the combination of local buckling of the web and lateral torsional buckling of the stiffener the transverse loads would reduce the ultimate load capacity however when the transverse loads occupied the main loads the failure modes were similar to that caused by transverse load only credit authorship contribution statement hongyang ma methodology

20837,a well planned dive trajectory is the key for the trans media maneuver and flight control of morphing unmanned aerial underwater vehicles muauvs the main focus of this paper is the application of a watch based multi objective grey wolf optimizer mogwo to dive trajectory optimization problems a multi objective trajectory optimization model considering the change of sweep angle and static moment is developed and parameterized by the gauss pseudospectral method and a multi objective nonlinear programming problem is constructed to overcome the defect that in the mogwo the rest wolves blindly follow the best wolves the watch strategy is introduced which provides the wolves with the ability of independent exploration subsequently the watch based mogwo is employed to generate the pareto front which is compared with that obtained through other multi objective techniques the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is more reliable and can obtain more widely distributed non dominated solutions indicating that the watch based mogwo is effective and feasible in dealing with multi objective trajectory optimization problems with complex constraints in addition comparative studies on optimal trajectories demonstrated that the maneuverability and gliding ability of the muauv are improved through cooperation between the angle of attack bank angle and sweep angle keywords morphing unmanned aerial underwater vehicle trajectory optimization multi objective grey wolf optimizer gauss pseudospectral method pareto front 1 introduction morphing unmanned aerial underwater vehicles muauvs are a new type of vehicles that can navigate both in air and underwater and morph autonomously maintaining optimal aerodynamic or hydrodynamic performance chen et al 2019 ma et al 2018 yang et al 2015 as independent and integrated unmanned systems the application prospect of muauvs mainly lies in the combination of multi media operation and smooth transition between two environments feng et al 2019 muauvs have various flight environments and phases which enable optimal flight performance in different missions in view of the shape differences between unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs the morphing technology is considered as the best way to combine them on an integrated unmanned platform weisshaar 2013 the key to designing a muauv is to determine the shape of the wing and how it disappears feng et al 2017 to perform the trans media maneuver from air flight to underwater navigation the muauv needs to execute two phases dive and water entry which make the trajectory complicated a will planned trajectory particularly in the dive phase is the key to accomplishing the trans media maneuver flight control and trajectory tracking chai et al 2019 regarding the trajectory optimization problems the purpose is usually not to pursue the optimization of a single objective but to perform simultaneous multi objective optimization since these objectives are often contradictory compromises between individual objectives should be made 1 1 motivation the physical properties of air and water are very different affecting negatively the stability of the trajectory during the trans media maneuver ma et al 2020 the key to accomplishing multi media operation is to design a reasonable trajectory for the dive and water entry phases theoretically the trans media maneuver can be performed through numerous trajectories the aim of trajectory optimization is to select an optimal trajectory from a set of trajectories that meet the optimization objectives objectives such as minimum time duration and maximum cross range are selected based on the mission characteristics and the optimal trajectories determined based on different objectives often differ currently the trajectory optimization problems encountered in practice are usually multi objective optimization problems shirazi et al 2018 the traditional method is to break the multi objective optimization problem into one or a series of single objective optimization problems which has gradually become difficult to meet the engineering requirements not all objectives can be optimal at the same time since different objectives may be incomparable and contradictory compared to single objective optimization multi objective optimization can process multiple objectives at the same time and provide more effective potential solutions for decision makers moreover multi objective optimization can also provide a range of potential solutions for the multiple optimization objectives enabling the decision makers to analyze and find the essence of optimization problems 1 2 related work trajectory optimization problems are typically continuous time nonlinear optimal control problems with complex constraints trajectory optimization methods and techniques play a key role in solving this problem trajectory optimization methods include indirect methods i e first optimization and then discretization and direct methods i e first discretization and then optimization chai et al 2019 betts and huffman 2015 the indirect method provides high accuracy and solves the first order necessary conditions of the optimal solution in analytic form thus it is difficult to solve multi constraint optimization problems in the dive phase there are dynamic path terminal and actuator constraints and unstable initial values chai et al 2019 therefore it is inappropriate to use indirect methods in the planning and optimization of the dive trajectory on the other hand the direct method discretizes and parameterizes the continuous time trajectory optimization problem and directly optimizes the objectives numerically contrary to the indirect method it is much easier to utilize the direct method to solve the trajectory optimization problem among the direct methods considerable achievements have been made using the pseudospectral method many scholars have used the above method to optimize the trajectory of launch vehicles in the ascent phase rea 2001 common aero vehicles clarke 2003 spacecrafts taylor 2003 stanton 2003 benson 2005 soft lunar landing hawkins 2005 peng et al 2012 and martian atmosphere entry xiu 2014 both the indirect and direct methods require corresponding optimization techniques to derive the final solution of the trajectory optimization problem multi objective trajectory optimization problems have attracted significant attention since in recent years the number of optimization objectives has been significantly increased in ref ding et al 2017 the authors used a physical programming method to transform the multi objective trajectory optimization problem into a single objective one in ref hu et al 2017 fuzzy sets were employed to sort multiple optimization objectives based on their priority and proposed a multi objective trajectory optimization method with a generalized varying domain strategy the above method can obtain only one solution at a time and its main disadvantage is that the quality of the solution depends largely on the prior experience of the decision maker intelligent optimization algorithms have the advantages of strong robustness initial parameter insensitivity and fast convergence velocity and in recent years they have been applied to solve multi objective trajectory optimization problems in ref hu et al 2006 the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ⅱ nsga ⅱ was applied to optimize the reentry trajectory of a reusable launch vehicle in ref chai et al 2017a a constraint processing strategy was proposed extending the nsga ⅱ by introducing the violation of constraints the extended nsga ⅱ was employed to solve the multi objective trajectory optimization problem of an aeroassisted spacecraft in refs hu et al 2006 and chai et al 2017a the nsga ⅱ used a crowding distance mechanism to evaluate the diversity of the population where the larger the crowding distance the better the diversity of the population in ref chai et al 2018 three constraint handling algorithms were embedded into nsga iii some well distributed reference points were created and updated to guide the evolution direction and the multi objective trajectory optimization problem was solved with no fly zone constraints in ref chai et al 2017b an adaptive differential evolution algorithm was proposed which updates the mutation operator by introducing an adaptive strategy and guides the evolution process using a modified version of the game theory in ref feng et al 2020 a hybrid optimization strategy was proposed by combining an evolutionary algorithm and the collocation method their strategy was divided into two steps first the multi objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition moea d was used for multi objective optimization with less collocation points to obtain pareto front and pareto sets then the adaptive collocation method was used to finely optimize the initial solution to obtain a high precision trajectory in addition a mopso chai et al 2020 was employed to solve the overtaking trajectory of constrained autonomous vehicles and an archive is proposed to store and retrieve the optimal solutions which can be also used as an alternative for multi objective trajectory optimization of aircrafts in conclusion it has been demonstrated that the nsga ⅱ nsga iii and moea d find non dominated solutions based on evolution randomly generating the initial population in the solution space and then searching in the global solution space this way the quality of the solution does not depend on the initial values the high quality non dominated solution in mopso is transferred in the iteration through the archive and the moea d nsga ⅱ and nsga ⅰⅱ are transferred through the chromosome the complexity of moea d is relatively lower than that of nsga ⅱ in addition nsga ⅱ and nsga iii as advanced versions of the genetic algorithm ga inherit many of its operations such as selection crossover and mutation therefore many parameters need to be set and the experience obtained in each iteration is destroyed with the evolution 1 3 outline in this paper the trajectory planning and optimization of a muauv with variable sweep wing configuration in the dive phase has been investigated the muauv was regarded as a three rigid body system and three degree of freedom point mass equations were first developed in the trajectory optimization method the state and control variables were discretized in a set of gauss collocation points and approximated by the lagrange interpolation polynomial then the trajectory optimization problem was transformed into a nonlinear programming nlp problem subsequently a watch based multi objective grey wolf optimization mogwo is proposed the archive was used to store and retrieve the current optimal solution thus preserving the experience of high quality solutions gained in each iteration the global exploration ability and the diversity of the archive were improved by introducing the watch strategy finally the pareto front was generated and compared between the proposed method and other optimization techniques and comparative simulations on the time optimal and cross range optimal trajectories of the muauv were performed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the configuration and aerodynamics of the proposed muauv subsequently dynamics equations and trajectory optimization models including different types of constraints and objective functions in the dive phase are developed in section 3 section 4 provides a brief description of the gauss pseudospectral method the watch based mogwo is demonstrated in section 5 in section 6 the simulations are performed and the optimal trajectories are compared and finally section 7 draws the conclusions 2 configuration and aerodynamics the trans media maneuver includes the dive and water entry phases as shown in fig 1 in the dive phase the muauv transforms from the deployed wings configuration to the folded wings configuration by means of variable sweep wings in order to ensure the success of the trans media maneuver the terminal attitude should be adjusted to a proper range considering that the high initial water entry velocity will bring a large number of cavitation bubbles which will severely affect the stability of the trajectory during the trans media maneuver the terminal velocity during the dive phase needs to be reduced to a certain range the muauv proposed in this paper adopts a variable sweep wing to meet the requirements of both the aerial and underwater configurations the wings are deployed to provide lift during aerial motion and folded to reduce the drag during underwater navigation the underwater configuration of the muauv is similar to that of the 533 torpedo baldwin 1975 the muauv model is presented in fig 2 it is assumed that the muauv adopts the bank to turn btt mode that is the lift surface is turned to the desired direction by controlling the bank angle during the turn while the slip angle and lateral force are zero the angle of attack aoa varies from 6 to 18 and the sweep angle from 0 to 90 the grid of the aoa sweep angle is set at 1 intervals and the flight state in each node is used as the simulation condition the lift and drag coefficients at each node are obtained by missile datcom galbraith 2020 and subsequently cubic interpolation is performed the aerodynamic coefficients are presented in fig 3 3 problem formulation

lift respectively and f l x f l y and f l z denote the additional forces due to morphing due to the limitations in terminal velocity it is assumed that muauv does not provide thrust in the dive phase i e t 0 the aerodynamic force can be obtained by 2 x 1 2 ρ v 2 s c x α χ y 1 2 ρ v 2 s c y α χ where ρ denotes the air density s denotes the reference area and c x and c y denote the drag and lift coefficients respectively it can be seen in eqs 1 and 2 that the sweep angle is implied in the aerodynamic force and the aoa is included in both the dynamics and aerodynamic force equations compared to conventional uavs and uuvs the trajectory planning and optimization of muauvs is not only related to parameters such as flight state and aoa but also highly dependent on changes in the aerodynamic parameters the position of the muauv center of mass com changes based on the motion of the wings therefore the muauv cannot be regarded as a single rigid body system but as a three rigid body system comprising a fuselage and two wings when the two wings are folded synchronously the additional force can be expressed as tan et al 2019 3 f l s x cos α 0 0 t where s x is the static moment due to the change of the com position the static moment relative to the origin of the body fixed frame is s x r x d m where r x is the position of the muauv com in the body fixed frame compared to the single rigid body system the derivative of the static moment s x is added in the dynamic equation that is the change effect of the muauv com is introduced in the trajectory planning considering the limitations in the change rate of the aoa bank angle and sweep angle the control variables are set as u t α γ χ t and the state variables are set as x t x y z v θ ψ α γ χ t by adjusting the three control variables a three dimensional trajectory that can take various forms can be achieved 3 2 objective function to obtain the optimal control variables the objective function should be designed such that it can accurately evaluate the muauv task different objective functions can be selected for different tasks such as to a minimize time b maximize terminal velocity and c maximize the cross rang based on the task one or more objective functions can be selected in trajectory optimization the muauv has two extreme trans media maneuver methods the emergency trans media maneuver and the maximum cross range trans media maneuver if only one objective function is selected the two extreme methods cannot be evaluated correctly and accurately consequently in the dive phase two or more objective functions should be selected in general for the no thrust dive phase of the muauv the primary goal is to either minimize the dive time or maximize the cross range when the muauv faces a situation that can threaten its safety the primary objective should be to minimize the dive time so that the muauv can complete the dive and water entry phases in a minimum amount of time with the other objectives being relatively less important at the same time the flight time and the cross range are contradictory parameters if the flight time is optimized only the cross range may become shorter while if the cross range is optimized only the flight time may become longer therefore the objective functions selected in this paper are as follows 1 minimum flight time 4 min j 1 t 0 t f d t t f t 0 2 maximum cross range 5 min j 2 x f x 0 3 3 constraints in trajectory optimization the dynamic constraints boundary conditions path constraints and control variables constraints are mainly considered the dynamic constraints can be rewritten as 6 x t f t x t u t the boundary conditions mainly include the initial and terminal states in the dive phase of the muauv there are constraints on the terminal altitude and velocity the boundary constraints are given as eq 7 7 x t 0 x 0 y t 0 y 0 z t 0 z 0 v t 0 v 0 θ t 0 θ 0 ψ t 0 ψ 0 and x t f f r e e y t f y f z t f f r e e v f min v t f v f max θ f min θ t f θ f max ψ f min ψ t f ψ f max the path constraints mainly include load and velocity constraints in order to ensure the structural safety of the muauv the following path constraints need to be met during flight 8 n y t sin α cos γ y cos γ s x sin α cos γ m g n y max 9 v min v v max to avoid losing control of the muauv the amplitude and rate of the control variables should satisfy eq 10 10 α min α α max α α max γ min γ γ max γ γ max χ min χ χ max χ χ max a feasible trajectory is called the trajectory that meets the constraints in eq 6 10 the dive trajectory optimization problems can be described as finding the optimal control variables u t α γ χ t in order to minimize the objective function j 1 j 2 t under the above constraints 4 gauss pseudospectral method in gauss pseudospectral method gpm the state and control variables are discretized in a sets of legendre gauss collocation points and approximated by the lagrange interpolation polynomials the derivative of state variables can be obtained by differentiating the global interpolation polynomials thus the trajectory optimization problem is transformed into a nlp problem there are two steps in gpm 4 1 time discretization since the legendre gauss collocation points are distributed within the 1 1 interval it is necessary to shift the time interval t 0 t f to the 1 1 interval the affine transformation is introduced as eq 11 11 τ 2 t t f t 0 t f t 0 to discretize the continuous interval 1 1 n legendre gauss allocation points are selected and τ 0 1 and τ n 1 1 are set 12 1 τ 0 τ 1 τ 2 τ n τ n 1 1 where τ 1 τ n are the roots of the legendre polynomial p n τ and p n τ 1 2 n n d n d τ n τ 2 1 n p n τ n 1 p n τ τ 2 1 hence the dynamic constraints of eq 6 with respect to the τ field can be rewritten as 13 x τ t f t 0 2 f τ x τ u τ 4 2 state and control variable parameterization the state and control variables are approximated using n 1 lagrange interpolation polynomials l n τ 14 x τ x τ n 0 n l n τ

interpolation polynomials of the state and control variables with respect to τ respectively the n 1 lagrange interpolation polynomials l n τ n 0 n satisfy 16 l n τ m 1 n m 0 n m the derivative of the state variable can be approximated by differentiating the expression in eq 14 17 x τ x τ n 0 n l n τ x n τ n 0 n d n x n τ x τ m x τ m n 0 n l n τ m x n τ m n 0 n d n m x n τ m where d n m l n τ m 1 τ

constraints act on the gauss collocation point except for two boundary points thus it is necessary to impose additional constraints on these two boundary points 19 x 0 x τ 0 x n 1 x 0 t f t 0 2 n 1 n ω n f τ n x τ n u τ n where ω n denotes the weight corresponding to the gauss allocation point and ω n 2 1 τ n 2 p n 2 consequently the trajectory optimization problem in the continuous time domain is transformed into a nlp problem in discrete time the nlp problem can be addressed by identifying the proper variables x n l p x τ 1 x τ n u τ 1 u τ n t f to minimize the objective function j 1 j 2 t under the constraints determined in eq 6 10 5 multi objective grey wolf optimizer 5 1 grey wolf optimizer and multi objective grey wolf optimizer inspired by the hunting behavior of the grey wolves the grey wolf optimizer gwo has been proposed seyedali et al 2014 which imitates the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism in grey wolf populations the optimizer builds a model during the optimization process each grey wolf is regarded as a solution the wolves with the fittest second best and third best solutions are marked as alpha α beta β and delta δ respectively and the rest of the candidate solutions are marked as omega ω the ω wolves approach the position of the prey i e global optimal solution under the guidance of the α β and δ wolves the guiding equation is as follows 20 d p r e y t c x p r e y t x ω t 21 x ω t 1 1 3 p r e y α β δ x p r e y t a d p r e y t where x ω t is the position of the ω wolves x p r e y t is the guiding position of the prey i e the position of the α β and δ wolves a and c are guiding coefficients and 22 a 2 a r 1 a c 2 r 2 where a is a factor that decreases linearly from 2 to 0 with increasing number of iterations and r 1 and r 2 are random numbers within 0 1 in addition c determines the orientation of the new position relative to the α β and δ wolves and a determines whether the new location is close to or far from the α β and δ wolves a stronger global search ability to get away from or closer to the α β and δ wolves is indicated when a 1 or a 1 respectively in gwo the fittest second best and third best solutions of the objective function in each iteration are assigned to the α β and δ wolves in return while the positions of the ω wolves are updated according to the position of α β and δ ones since there is no greedy algorithm all wolves in the gwo are moving constantly thus the global search ability of the algorithm is stronger while its accuracy is slightly poor at the same time its local search ability is adjusted by a this way the global and local search abilities of the gwo are balanced mirjalili et al developed the gwo and proposed the mogwo seyedali et al 2016 which two incorporates improvements 1 an archive is employed to save and retrieve the non dominated pareto optimal solutions in each iteration which are updated and deleted according to certain rules e g if the archive is full 2 a leader selection method for multi objective optimization is introduced and the probability of each solution being selected is inversely proportional to the number of solutions in the archive different from the gwo there are no α β and δ wolves in the mogwo and all solutions are the fittest solution therefore the three best solutions are considered as the best wolves 5 2 improved mogwo and feasibility 5 2 1 motivation compared with most swarm intelligence algorithms gwo and mogwo provide faster convergence velocity precup et al 2017 however the probability of falling into local optimum is larger and their stability is insufficient sahoo and chandra 2017 more specifically the exploration ability of mogwo is insufficient and the selection strategy of solutions for improving its exploration ability depends on the initial values cui et al 2018 which makes the stability of mogwo insufficient based on the above analysis in this paper an improvement to extend the exploration ability of the mogwo is proposed it has been explained that both the gwo and mogwo use the best wolves to guide the rest ones to approach the optimal solution nevertheless the rest wolves tend to blindly follow the best ones and approach the non dominated solutions near their position and do not even care whether there are closer non dominated solutions around them in fact due to the presence of multiple non dominated solutions the rest wolves that are far away from the best ones may miss other non dominated solutions while they are following the best wolves if the rest wolves had the ability to explore independently the optimization efficiency of the mogwo would be improved significantly 5 2 2 watch based mogwo inspired by the optimization strategy of onlooker bees in the artificial bee colony abc algorithm karaboga and basturk 2008 the behavior of watch is introduced into the mogwo after the position of the rest wolves has been updated based on that of the best wolves the watch strategy is applied according to which the rest wolves watch the nearby position and evaluate their own position if there is a better or new position nearby the rest wolves will move to that position after updating the position the rest wolves will randomly watch a nearby position x s which is determined by 23 x w a t c h x 1 x 1 x dim x k r u b k l b k k r a n d 1 2 dim x i 0 i 1 2 dim a n d i k 24 x s x ω x w a t c h where r is a random number within 0 5 0 5 and dim is the number of optimization variables subsequently the two positions before and after the update are compared and if the new position dominates the old one it means that the new position is better if the new position and the old position do not dominate each other it means that the new position may be found then the wolf moves to the new position otherwise no operation is performed the mogwo can optimize multiple objective functions and obtain the complete pareto front and its distribution however the obtained result is a decision set and no method is provided for selecting specific decisions from it if no other auxiliary decision making methods are used the decision is selected from the decision set randomly 5 2 3 feasibility analysis the idea of the watch strategy is inspired by the action of onlooker bees in the abc algorithm in the improved mogwo the watch behavior plays the role of jumping out of the local optimum the best wolves play the role of local exploration and the rest wolves play the role of both local exploration and following the best wolves according to the analysis of the mogwo the watch strategy is feasible for the following reasons 1 in the optimization process the effect of the guidance of the best wolves eqs 20 and 21 is much greater than that of the watch strategy of the rest wolves eqs 23 and 24 the main function of the watch strategy is to find the non dominated solution near the rest wolves especially those far away from the best ones in order to improve the diversity of the archive consequently the guidance effect of the best wolves can be improved indirectly with the algorithm not being significantly affected 2 when falling into local optimum the rest and the candidate best wolves in the archive tend to concentrate near a non dominated solution and the guidance effect of the best wolves hardly makes the rest wolves update their positions nevertheless the watch strategy is not affected by this thus it can help the algorithm jump faster out of the local optimum 5 2 4 steps the exploration ability of the mogwo is improved by introducing the watch strategy and the steps of the improved mogwo are as follows step 1 input the maximum number of the archive n a and the number of the grey wolf population n g initialize a a and c and initialize the grey wolf population step 2 calculate the value of the objective functions find the non dominated solutions and input them in the archive step 3 update a a and c according to eq 22 step 4 select three best wolves from the archive using the roulette wheel method step 5 update the position of the rest wolves according to eqs 20 and 21 step 6 watch a nearby position based on eqs 23 and 24 and if the new position dominates or does not dominate the old one the wolf moves to the new position step 7 calculate the value of the objective functions of each wolf select the non dominated solutions in the rest wolves to compare with those in the archive and update the archive step 8 regroup the archive and if the number of solutions in the archive exceeds n a delete the extra solutions step 9 if the calculation time exceeds the maximum number of iterations all solutions in the archive are the optimization results of the mogwo otherwise return to step 3 6 simulations in this paper trajectory simulations with three different vehicles are performed which include muauv with variable sweep angle shape conventional uav with deployed wing shape and conventional uuv with folded wing shape the boundary conditions and constraints are given in table 1 where the sweep angles of the deployed and folded wing shapes were constant i e χ 0 χ 0 χ f 6 1 pareto front solutions the mogwo nsga ⅱ and watch based mogwo were used to solve the above mentioned multi objective nlp problems the results demonstrated that all three methods can successfully find a non dominated solution that satisfies the constraints and the objective functions in fig 4 there are four sets of pareto fronts as it can be seen in the pareto fronts obtained by the watch based mogwo and nsga ⅱ the non dominated solutions were relatively close to each other moreover the distribution uniformity of the non dominated solutions obtained by nsga ⅱ was better while the distribution range of the non dominated solutions obtained by the watch based mogwo was wider this indicates the applicability of the proposed watch based mogwo in solving multi objective trajectory optimization problems comparing the results obtained by the mogwo and watch based mogwo the pareto front obtained by the watch based mogwo almost covered the one obtained by the mogwo it can be observed that there were two different cases in the non dominated solution obtained by the mogwo one finds the pareto front successfully while the other falls into local optimum indicating the superiority of the watch based mogwo when falling into local optimum the archive is filled with a large number of similar solutions in the early iterations as a result all the rest wolves tend to concentrate near a non dominated solution in the archive the guiding effect of the best wolves hardly updates the position of the rest wolves by applying the watch strategy some new non dominated solutions are found and added to the archive which enhances the diversity of the archive and prevents the algorithm from falling into local optimum in order to ensure that the watch based mogwo can satisfy the trajectory optimization problem requirements further verification on the trajectory and its parameters was performed in the following section 6 2 simulation results with different objectives since the muauv dives without thrust there must be a maximum cross range and a minimum time until the terminal position is reached the multi objective trajectory optimization model and the watch based mogwo were tested in two different mission scenarios i e emergency trans media maneuver and maximum cross range trans media maneuver the trajectory characteristics and state and control variables of the three different shaped vehicles were compared since the results calculated by the watch based mogwo were discrete the trajectory parameters were processed by cubic spline interpolation 6 2 1 case 1 emergency trans media maneuver and time optimal trajectory table 2 presents the terminal states of the time optimal trajectory in the emergency trans media maneuver it can be observed that all three vehicles could reach the terminal state when reaching the terminal position which indicates the applicability of the watch based mogwo in solving trajectory optimization problems the muauv with variable sweep wing configuration could complete the dive phase faster than the vehicle with fixed sweep angle shape when the emergency trans media maneuver was performed the time optimal trajectories from the initial to the terminal position are demonstrated in fig 5 as it can be seen the time optimal dive trajectories were curved even the direction of the trajectory changed and there was a large displacement in the lateral plane for the dive phase in minimum flight time figs 6 and 7 a b show the history of velocity inclination angle and deflection angle of the trajectory respectively and fig 8 a c show the history of aoa bank angle and sweep angle respectively all the state variables were in the given range and no abrupt change in the state variables was observed as it can be seen in fig 6 the vehicle flies at high velocity to complete the dive phase in a minimum time to meet the constraints imposed on the vehicle the control variables oscillate within a certain range while the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle are controlled by adjusting the aoa and sweep angle in real time thus the vehicle is in an alternate state of acceleration deceleration acceleration the changes of velocity trajectory inclination angle aoa and sweep angle are well synchronized i e when the aoa and sweep angle increase the velocity and trajectory inclination angle increase correspondingly and vice versa however there is a short delay in the velocity and trajectory inclination angle which is attributed to that the aoa and the sweep angle are control variables relative to the velocity and trajectory inclination angle the same can be concluded for the relationship between the bank angle and the trajectory deflection angle the vehicle changes the direction of the lift surface through a large bank angle which induces a large scale maneuver in the lateral plane according to figs 6 8 the trajectory curvature was large the state variables changed sharply and the terminal velocity was at its maximum when the vehicle dived in minimum flight time during the no thrust dive phase and as the altitude decreased the vehicle should have been accelerating due to the action of gravity in fact due to the constraint on flight velocity the vehicle decelerated using aerodynamic force that is the longitudinal axis of the vehicle rotated around the velocity vector at the maximum allowable aoa fig 8 a and a lateral maneuver was performed finally the vehicle reached the terminal position accurately and all the state variables satisfied the constraints under the control of the aoa bank angle and sweep angle 6 2 2 case 2 maximum cross range trans media maneuver and cross range optimal trajectory table 3 presents the terminal states of the cross range optimal trajectory all three vehicles could reach the terminal state and the lateral terminal displacement was 0 compared to that of the vehicles with folded and deployed wing shapes the cross range of the muauv was the largest fig 9 demonstrates the cross range trajectory of the three different vehicles from the initial to the terminal position different from the time optimal trajectories the three cross range optimal trajectories were very smooth and almost no maneuvers were performed in the lateral plane in addition the characteristics of three cross range optimal trajectories were different for the vehicles with variable sweep angle and deployed wing shapes there was a climbing maneuver in the initial stage which was contrary to the common sense on dive maneuvers on the other hand the vehicle with the folded wing shape performed a direct dive maneuver as it can be seen in fig 10 the velocity of the vehicles with variable sweep angle and deployed wing shapes decreased gradually with increasing flight altitude when the flight altitude reached the maximum the velocity was in a minimum subsequently the vehicle began to dive and after a short adjustment its velocity remained stable for a long time and decreased to the preset minimum value at the end of the dive phase as it can be observed in fig 11 the trajectory inclination angle was positive during climbing and then became negative for a long time while the trajectory deflection angle was almost zero during the entire dive phase fig 12 demonstrates the variation curves of the aoa bank angle and sweep angle it can be seen that the three vehicles flew at a positive aoa the bank angle was almost zero and the sweep angle changed rapidly to 90 at the end of the dive phase as it can be seen in figs 10 12 the cross range optimal trajectory of the three vehicles was smooth and the state variables were stable different from the time optimal trajectory where deceleration through the aerodynamic force was employed the vehicles with variable sweep angle and deployed wing shapes decelerated through a gliding maneuver at a fixed aoa and velocity to increase the flight distance taking full advantage of the large lift to drag ratio in order to achieve a longer cross range the three vehicles performed no maneuver in the lateral plane based on the trajectory characteristics the cross range optimal trajectory of the muauv can be divided into three segments climbing segment gliding segment and terminal segment 1 climbing segment the muauv climbs at a small aoa and the flight altitude increases as the flight velocity decreases rapidly the aerodynamic force gradually decreases and vertical downward acceleration is developed when the vertical velocity is 0 the muauv is at the highest point of altitude i e the dive point the trajectory segment from the initial position to the dive point is called the climbing trajectory 2 gliding segment after a brief adjustment on attitude the muauv begins to glide from the dive point the muauv is in a quasi equilibrium state under the action of gravity lift and drag and the control and state variables are stable the position at the end of gliding is called the adjustment point and the trajectory segment from the dive point to the adjustment point is called the gliding trajectory the gliding segment is the main segment of the dive phase and its principal task is to make the muauv fly as far as possible 3 terminal segment this segment is an adjustment segment before the muauv enters the water and the altitude is very low the trajectory of the muauv is straightened to lengthen the cross range by increasing the aoa while the velocity first increases and then decreases to the minimum value with decreasing altitude the trajectory segment from the adjustment point to the terminal point is called the terminal trajectory 7 summary as it can be seen from the above two cases the two objectives are contradictory which means that when the best performance of one goal is pursued another goal will be inevitably sacrificed for instance when the minimum flight time is pursued the oscillation of the trajectory is intensified due to the deceleration approaches that use the aerodynamic force and lateral maneuvers while when the maximum cross range is pursued it should be taken for granted that the flight time will be longer the multi objective optimization result is a non dominated solution set and it does not come with a method for selecting a specific trajectory from the solution set the purpose of dive trajectory optimization is to make the muauv complete the trans media maneuver safely and reliably consequently the trajectory should be selected based on the task the purpose and the result of threat assessment 8 conclusions in this paper a watch based mogwo is presented which was employed to solve the multi objective dive trajectory optimization problem the pareto front obtained by the watch based mogwo was compared with that obtained by nsga ⅱ and mogwo the results revealed that the diversity of the archive was improved and the distribution range of the non dominated solutions obtained by the watch based mogwo was wider comparative simulations on the time optimal and cross range optimal trajectories of three different vehicles were performed and the results demonstrated that the muauv with variable sweep angle shape could control the aerodynamic state in real time by adjusting the aoa and sweep angle exhibiting stronger maneuverability and gliding ability to meet the path constraints imposed on the muauv deceleration approaches using the aerodynamic force and lengthening the distance were adopted in the time optimal and cross range optimal trajectory respectively consequently the obtained results demonstrated that the watch based mogwo is feasible and effective and can provide an alternative technique for trajectory planning and optimization credit authorship contribution statement guoming chen conceptualization

20837,a well planned dive trajectory is the key for the trans media maneuver and flight control of morphing unmanned aerial underwater vehicles muauvs the main focus of this paper is the application of a watch based multi objective grey wolf optimizer mogwo to dive trajectory optimization problems a multi objective trajectory optimization model considering the change of sweep angle and static moment is developed and parameterized by the gauss pseudospectral method and a multi objective nonlinear programming problem is constructed to overcome the defect that in the mogwo the rest wolves blindly follow the best wolves the watch strategy is introduced which provides the wolves with the ability of independent exploration subsequently the watch based mogwo is employed to generate the pareto front which is compared with that obtained through other multi objective techniques the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is more reliable and can obtain more widely distributed non dominated solutions indicating that the watch based mogwo is effective and feasible in dealing with multi objective trajectory optimization problems with complex constraints in addition comparative studies on optimal trajectories demonstrated that the maneuverability and gliding ability of the muauv are improved through cooperation between the angle of attack bank angle and sweep angle keywords morphing unmanned aerial underwater vehicle trajectory optimization multi objective grey wolf optimizer gauss pseudospectral method pareto front 1 introduction morphing unmanned aerial underwater vehicles muauvs are a new type of vehicles that can navigate both in air and underwater and morph autonomously maintaining optimal aerodynamic or hydrodynamic performance chen et al 2019 ma et al 2018 yang et al 2015 as independent and integrated unmanned systems the application prospect of muauvs mainly lies in the combination of multi media operation and smooth transition between two environments feng et al 2019 muauvs have various flight environments and phases which enable optimal flight performance in different missions in view of the shape differences between unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs the morphing technology is considered as the best way to combine them on an integrated unmanned platform weisshaar 2013 the key to designing a muauv is to determine the shape of the wing and how it disappears feng et al 2017 to perform the trans media maneuver from air flight to underwater navigation the muauv needs to execute two phases dive and water entry which make the trajectory complicated a will planned trajectory particularly in the dive phase is the key to accomplishing the trans media maneuver flight control and trajectory tracking chai et al 2019 regarding the trajectory optimization problems the purpose is usually not to pursue the optimization of a single objective but to perform simultaneous multi objective optimization since these objectives are often contradictory compromises between individual objectives should be made 1 1 motivation the physical properties of air and water are very different affecting negatively the stability of the trajectory during the trans media maneuver ma et al 2020 the key to accomplishing multi media operation is to design a reasonable trajectory for the dive and water entry phases theoretically the trans media maneuver can be performed through numerous trajectories the aim of trajectory optimization is to select an optimal trajectory from a set of trajectories that meet the optimization objectives objectives such as minimum time duration and maximum cross range are selected based on the mission characteristics and the optimal trajectories determined based on different objectives often differ currently the trajectory optimization problems encountered in practice are usually multi objective optimization problems shirazi et al 2018 the traditional method is to break the multi objective optimization problem into one or a series of single objective optimization problems which has gradually become difficult to meet the engineering requirements not all objectives can be optimal at the same time since different objectives may be incomparable and contradictory compared to single objective optimization multi objective optimization can process multiple objectives at the same time and provide more effective potential solutions for decision makers moreover multi objective optimization can also provide a range of potential solutions for the multiple optimization objectives enabling the decision makers to analyze and find the essence of optimization problems 1 2 related work trajectory optimization problems are typically continuous time nonlinear optimal control problems with complex constraints trajectory optimization methods and techniques play a key role in solving this problem trajectory optimization methods include indirect methods i e first optimization and then discretization and direct methods i e first discretization and then optimization chai et al 2019 betts and huffman 2015 the indirect method provides high accuracy and solves the first order necessary conditions of the optimal solution in analytic form thus it is difficult to solve multi constraint optimization problems in the dive phase there are dynamic path terminal and actuator constraints and unstable initial values chai et al 2019 therefore it is inappropriate to use indirect methods in the planning and optimization of the dive trajectory on the other hand the direct method discretizes and parameterizes the continuous time trajectory optimization problem and directly optimizes the objectives numerically contrary to the indirect method it is much easier to utilize the direct method to solve the trajectory optimization problem among the direct methods considerable achievements have been made using the pseudospectral method many scholars have used the above method to optimize the trajectory of launch vehicles in the ascent phase rea 2001 common aero vehicles clarke 2003 spacecrafts taylor 2003 stanton 2003 benson 2005 soft lunar landing hawkins 2005 peng et al 2012 and martian atmosphere entry xiu 2014 both the indirect and direct methods require corresponding optimization techniques to derive the final solution of the trajectory optimization problem multi objective trajectory optimization problems have attracted significant attention since in recent years the number of optimization objectives has been significantly increased in ref ding et al 2017 the authors used a physical programming method to transform the multi objective trajectory optimization problem into a single objective one in ref hu et al 2017 fuzzy sets were employed to sort multiple optimization objectives based on their priority and proposed a multi objective trajectory optimization method with a generalized varying domain strategy the above method can obtain only one solution at a time and its main disadvantage is that the quality of the solution depends largely on the prior experience of the decision maker intelligent optimization algorithms have the advantages of strong robustness initial parameter insensitivity and fast convergence velocity and in recent years they have been applied to solve multi objective trajectory optimization problems in ref hu et al 2006 the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ⅱ nsga ⅱ was applied to optimize the reentry trajectory of a reusable launch vehicle in ref chai et al 2017a a constraint processing strategy was proposed extending the nsga ⅱ by introducing the violation of constraints the extended nsga ⅱ was employed to solve the multi objective trajectory optimization problem of an aeroassisted spacecraft in refs hu et al 2006 and chai et al 2017a the nsga ⅱ used a crowding distance mechanism to evaluate the diversity of the population where the larger the crowding distance the better the diversity of the population in ref chai et al 2018 three constraint handling algorithms were embedded into nsga iii some well distributed reference points were created and updated to guide the evolution direction and the multi objective trajectory optimization problem was solved with no fly zone constraints in ref chai et al 2017b an adaptive differential evolution algorithm was proposed which updates the mutation operator by introducing an adaptive strategy and guides the evolution process using a modified version of the game theory in ref feng et al 2020 a hybrid optimization strategy was proposed by combining an evolutionary algorithm and the collocation method their strategy was divided into two steps first the multi objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition moea d was used for multi objective optimization with less collocation points to obtain pareto front and pareto sets then the adaptive collocation method was used to finely optimize the initial solution to obtain a high precision trajectory in addition a mopso chai et al 2020 was employed to solve the overtaking trajectory of constrained autonomous vehicles and an archive is proposed to store and retrieve the optimal solutions which can be also used as an alternative for multi objective trajectory optimization of aircrafts in conclusion it has been demonstrated that the nsga ⅱ nsga iii and moea d find non dominated solutions based on evolution randomly generating the initial population in the solution space and then searching in the global solution space this way the quality of the solution does not depend on the initial values the high quality non dominated solution in mopso is transferred in the iteration through the archive and the moea d nsga ⅱ and nsga ⅰⅱ are transferred through the chromosome the complexity of moea d is relatively lower than that of nsga ⅱ in addition nsga ⅱ and nsga iii as advanced versions of the genetic algorithm ga inherit many of its operations such as selection crossover and mutation therefore many parameters need to be set and the experience obtained in each iteration is destroyed with the evolution 1 3 outline in this paper the trajectory planning and optimization of a muauv with variable sweep wing configuration in the dive phase has been investigated the muauv was regarded as a three rigid body system and three degree of freedom point mass equations were first developed in the trajectory optimization method the state and control variables were discretized in a set of gauss collocation points and approximated by the lagrange interpolation polynomial then the trajectory optimization problem was transformed into a nonlinear programming nlp problem subsequently a watch based multi objective grey wolf optimization mogwo is proposed the archive was used to store and retrieve the current optimal solution thus preserving the experience of high quality solutions gained in each iteration the global exploration ability and the diversity of the archive were improved by introducing the watch strategy finally the pareto front was generated and compared between the proposed method and other optimization techniques and comparative simulations on the time optimal and cross range optimal trajectories of the muauv were performed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the configuration and aerodynamics of the proposed muauv subsequently dynamics equations and trajectory optimization models including different types of constraints and objective functions in the dive phase are developed in section 3 section 4 provides a brief description of the gauss pseudospectral method the watch based mogwo is demonstrated in section 5 in section 6 the simulations are performed and the optimal trajectories are compared and finally section 7 draws the conclusions 2 configuration and aerodynamics the trans media maneuver includes the dive and water entry phases as shown in fig 1 in the dive phase the muauv transforms from the deployed wings configuration to the folded wings configuration by means of variable sweep wings in order to ensure the success of the trans media maneuver the terminal attitude should be adjusted to a proper range considering that the high initial water entry velocity will bring a large number of cavitation bubbles which will severely affect the stability of the trajectory during the trans media maneuver the terminal velocity during the dive phase needs to be reduced to a certain range the muauv proposed in this paper adopts a variable sweep wing to meet the requirements of both the aerial and underwater configurations the wings are deployed to provide lift during aerial motion and folded to reduce the drag during underwater navigation the underwater configuration of the muauv is similar to that of the 533 torpedo baldwin 1975 the muauv model is presented in fig 2 it is assumed that the muauv adopts the bank to turn btt mode that is the lift surface is turned to the desired direction by controlling the bank angle during the turn while the slip angle and lateral force are zero the angle of attack aoa varies from 6 to 18 and the sweep angle from 0 to 90 the grid of the aoa sweep angle is set at 1 intervals and the flight state in each node is used as the simulation condition the lift and drag coefficients at each node are obtained by missile datcom galbraith 2020 and subsequently cubic interpolation is performed the aerodynamic coefficients are presented in fig 3 3 problem formulation 3 1 mathematical model for the definition of the reference frame and trajectory parameters please refer to ref li and fang 2005 the dynamics equation in the inertial frame is 1 x v cos θ cos ψ y v sin θ z v cos θ sin ψ v t cos α x m g sin θ f l x m θ t sin α cos γ y cos γ m g cos θ f l y m v ψ t sin α sin γ y sin γ f l z m v cos θ where x y z and v denote the position and velocity of the muauv respectively θ and ψ denote the inclination angle and deflection angle of the trajectory respectively α and γ denote the aoa and bank angle respectively m denotes the mass x and y denote the drag and lift respectively and f l x f l y and f l z denote the additional forces due to morphing due to the limitations in terminal velocity it is assumed that muauv does not provide thrust in the dive phase i e t 0 the aerodynamic force can be obtained by 2 x 1 2 ρ v 2 s c x α χ y 1 2 ρ v 2 s c y α χ where ρ denotes the air density s denotes the reference area and c x and c y denote the drag and lift coefficients respectively it can be seen in eqs 1 and 2 that the sweep angle is implied in the aerodynamic force and the aoa is included in both the dynamics and aerodynamic force equations compared to conventional uavs and uuvs the trajectory planning and optimization of muauvs is not only related to parameters such as flight state and aoa but also highly dependent on changes in the aerodynamic parameters the position of the muauv center of mass com changes based on the motion of the wings therefore the muauv cannot be regarded as a single rigid body system but as a three rigid body system comprising a fuselage and two wings when the two wings are folded synchronously the additional force can be expressed as tan et al 2019 3 f l s x cos α 0 0 t where s x is the static moment due to the change of the com position the static moment relative to the origin of the body fixed frame is s x r x d m where r x is the position of the muauv com in the body fixed frame compared to the single rigid body system the derivative of the static moment s x is added in the dynamic equation that is the change effect of the muauv com is introduced in the trajectory planning considering the limitations in the change rate of the aoa bank angle and sweep angle the control variables are set as u t α γ χ t and the state variables are set as x t x y z v θ ψ α γ χ t by adjusting the three control variables a three dimensional trajectory that can take various forms can be achieved 3 2 objective function to obtain the optimal control variables the objective function should be designed such that it can accurately evaluate the muauv task different objective functions can be selected for different tasks such as to a minimize time b maximize terminal velocity and c maximize the cross rang based on the task one or more objective functions can be selected in trajectory optimization the muauv has two extreme trans media maneuver methods the emergency trans media maneuver and the maximum cross range trans media maneuver if only one objective function is selected the two extreme methods cannot be evaluated correctly and accurately consequently in the dive phase two or more objective functions should be selected in general for the no thrust dive phase of the muauv the primary goal is to either minimize the dive time or maximize the cross range when the muauv faces a situation that can threaten its safety the primary objective should be to minimize the dive time so that the muauv can complete the dive and water entry phases in a minimum amount of time with the other objectives being relatively less important at the same time the flight time and the cross range are contradictory parameters if the flight time is optimized only the cross range may become shorter while if the cross range is optimized only the flight time may become longer therefore the objective functions selected in this paper are as follows 1 minimum flight time 4 min j 1 t 0 t f d t t f t 0 2 maximum cross range 5 min j 2 x f x 0 3 3 constraints in trajectory optimization the dynamic constraints boundary conditions path constraints and control variables constraints are mainly considered the dynamic constraints can be rewritten as 6 x t f t x t u t the boundary conditions mainly include the initial and terminal states in the dive phase of the muauv there are constraints on the terminal altitude and velocity the boundary constraints are given as eq 7 7 x t 0 x 0 y t 0 y 0 z t 0 z 0 v t 0 v 0 θ t 0 θ 0 ψ t 0 ψ 0 and x t f f r e e y t f y f z t f f r e e v f min v t f v f max θ f min θ t f θ f max ψ f min ψ t f ψ f max the path constraints mainly include load and velocity constraints in order to ensure the structural safety of the muauv the following path constraints need to be met during flight 8 n y t sin α cos γ y cos γ s x sin α cos γ m g n y max 9 v min v v max to avoid losing control of the muauv the amplitude and rate of the control variables should satisfy eq 10 10 α min α α max α α max γ min γ γ max γ γ max χ min χ χ max χ χ max a feasible trajectory is called the trajectory that meets the constraints in eq 6 10 the dive trajectory optimization problems can be described as finding the optimal control variables u t α γ χ t in order to minimize the objective function j 1 j 2 t under the above constraints 4 gauss pseudospectral method in gauss pseudospectral method gpm the state and control variables are discretized in a sets of legendre gauss collocation points and approximated by the lagrange interpolation polynomials the derivative of state variables can be obtained by differentiating the global interpolation polynomials thus the trajectory optimization problem is transformed into a nlp problem there are two steps in gpm 4 1 time discretization since the legendre gauss collocation points are distributed within the 1 1 interval it is necessary to shift the time interval t 0 t f to the 1 1 interval the affine transformation is introduced as eq 11 11 τ 2 t t f t 0 t f t 0 to discretize the continuous interval 1 1 n legendre gauss allocation points are selected and τ 0 1 and τ n 1 1 are set 12 1 τ 0 τ 1 τ 2 τ n τ n 1 1 where τ 1 τ n are the roots of the legendre polynomial p n τ and p n τ 1 2 n n d n d τ n τ 2 1 n p n τ n 1 p n τ τ 2 1 hence the dynamic constraints of eq 6 with respect to the τ field can be rewritten as 13 x τ t f t 0 2 f τ x τ u τ 4 2 state and control variable parameterization the state and control variables are approximated using n 1 lagrange interpolation polynomials l n τ 14 x τ x τ n 0 n l n τ x n τ l n τ n 0 n m n τ τ n τ m τ n 15 u τ u τ n 0 n l ˆ n τ u n τ l ˆ n τ n 0 n m n τ τ n τ m τ n where x τ and u τ are approximations of x τ and u τ respectively and l n τ and l ˆ n τ are lagrange interpolation polynomials of the state and control variables with respect to τ respectively the n 1 lagrange interpolation polynomials l n τ n 0 n satisfy 16 l n τ m 1 n m 0 n m the derivative of the state variable can be approximated by differentiating the expression in eq 14 17 x τ x τ n 0 n l n τ x n τ n 0 n d n x n τ x τ m x τ m n 0 n l n τ m x n τ m n 0 n d n m x n τ m where d n m l n τ m 1 τ n p n τ n p n τ n τ n τ m 1 τ m p n τ m p n τ m n m 1 τ n p n τ m 2 p n τ m 2 1 τ m p n τ m p n τ m n m by combining eqs 13 and 17 eq 18 can be obtained 18 n 0 n d n x n τ t f t 0 2 f τ x τ u τ all constraints act on the gauss collocation point except for two boundary points thus it is necessary to impose additional constraints on these two boundary points 19 x 0 x τ 0 x n 1 x 0 t f t 0 2 n 1 n ω n f τ n x τ n u τ n where ω n denotes the weight corresponding to the gauss allocation point and ω n 2 1 τ n 2 p n 2 consequently the trajectory optimization problem in the continuous time domain is transformed into a nlp problem in discrete time the nlp problem can be addressed by identifying the proper variables x n l p x τ 1 x τ n u τ 1 u τ n t f to minimize the objective function j 1 j 2 t under the constraints determined in eq 6 10 5 multi objective grey wolf optimizer 5 1 grey wolf optimizer and multi objective grey wolf optimizer inspired by the hunting behavior of the grey wolves the grey wolf optimizer gwo has been proposed seyedali et al 2014 which imitates the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism in grey wolf populations the optimizer builds a model during the optimization process each grey wolf is regarded as a solution the wolves with the fittest second best and third best solutions are marked as alpha α beta β and delta δ respectively and the rest of the candidate solutions are marked as omega ω the ω wolves approach the position of the prey i e global optimal solution under the guidance of the α β and δ wolves the guiding equation is as follows 20 d p r e y t c x p r e y t x ω t 21 x ω t 1 1 3 p r e y α β δ x p r e y t a d p r e y t where x ω t is the position of the ω wolves x p r e y t is the guiding position of the prey i e the position of the α β and δ wolves a and c are guiding coefficients and 22 a 2 a r 1 a c 2 r 2 where a is a factor that decreases linearly from 2 to 0 with increasing number of iterations and r 1 and r 2 are random numbers within 0 1 in addition c determines the orientation of the new position relative to the α β and δ wolves and a determines whether the new location is close to or far from the α β and δ wolves a stronger global search ability to get away from or closer to the α β and δ wolves is indicated when a 1 or a 1 respectively in gwo the fittest second best and third best solutions of the objective function in each iteration are assigned to the α β and δ wolves in return while the positions of the ω wolves are updated according to the position of α β and δ ones since there is no greedy algorithm all wolves in the gwo are moving constantly thus the global search ability of the algorithm is stronger while its accuracy is slightly poor at the same time its local search ability is adjusted by a this way the global and local search abilities of the gwo are balanced mirjalili et al developed the gwo and proposed the mogwo seyedali et al 2016 which two incorporates improvements 1 an archive is employed to save and retrieve the non dominated pareto optimal solutions in each iteration which are updated and deleted according to certain rules e g if the archive is full 2 a leader selection method for multi objective optimization is introduced and the probability of each solution being selected is inversely proportional to the number of solutions in the archive different from the gwo there are no α β and δ wolves in the mogwo and all solutions are the fittest solution therefore the three best solutions are considered as the best wolves 5 2 improved mogwo and feasibility 5 2 1 motivation compared with most swarm intelligence algorithms gwo and mogwo provide faster convergence velocity precup et al 2017 however the probability of falling into local optimum is larger and their stability is insufficient sahoo and chandra 2017 more specifically the exploration ability of mogwo is insufficient and the selection strategy of solutions for improving its exploration ability depends on the initial values cui et al 2018 which makes the stability of mogwo insufficient based on the above analysis in this paper an improvement to extend the exploration ability of the mogwo is proposed it has been explained that both the gwo and mogwo use the best wolves to guide the rest ones to approach the optimal solution nevertheless the rest wolves tend to blindly follow the best ones and approach the non dominated solutions near their position and do not even care whether there are closer non dominated solutions around them in fact due to the presence of multiple non dominated solutions the rest wolves that are far away from the best ones may miss other non dominated solutions while they are following the best wolves if the rest wolves had the ability to explore independently the optimization efficiency of the mogwo would be improved significantly 5 2 2 watch based mogwo inspired by the optimization strategy of onlooker bees in the artificial bee colony abc algorithm karaboga and basturk 2008 the behavior of watch is introduced into the mogwo after the position of the rest wolves has been updated based on that of the best wolves the watch strategy is applied according to which the rest wolves watch the nearby position and evaluate their own position if there is a better or new position nearby the rest wolves will move to that position after updating the position the rest wolves will randomly watch a nearby position x s which is determined by 23 x w a t c h x 1 x 1 x dim x k r u b k l b k k r a n d 1 2 dim x i 0 i 1 2 dim a n d i k 24 x s x ω x w a t c h where r is a random number within 0 5 0 5 and dim is the number of optimization variables subsequently the two positions before and after the update are compared and if the new position dominates the old one it means that the new position is better if the new position and the old position do not dominate each other it means that the new position may be found then the wolf moves to the new position otherwise no operation is performed the mogwo can optimize multiple objective functions and obtain the complete pareto front and its distribution however the obtained result is a decision set and no method is provided for selecting specific decisions from it if no other auxiliary decision making methods are used the decision is selected from the decision set randomly 5 2 3 feasibility analysis the idea of the watch strategy is inspired by the action of onlooker bees in the abc algorithm in the improved mogwo the watch behavior plays the role of jumping out of the local optimum the best wolves play the role of local exploration and the rest wolves play the role of both local exploration and following the best wolves according to the analysis of the mogwo the watch strategy is feasible for the following reasons 1 in the optimization process the effect of the guidance of the best wolves eqs 20 and 21 is much greater than that of the watch strategy of the rest wolves eqs 23 and 24 the main function of the watch strategy is to find the non dominated solution near the rest wolves especially those far away from the best ones in order to improve the diversity of the archive consequently the guidance effect of the best wolves can be improved indirectly with the algorithm not being significantly affected 2 when falling into local optimum the rest and the candidate best wolves in the archive tend to concentrate near a non dominated solution and the guidance effect of the best wolves hardly makes the rest wolves update their positions nevertheless the watch strategy is not affected by this thus it can help the algorithm jump faster out of the local optimum 5 2 4 steps the exploration ability of the mogwo is improved by introducing the watch strategy and the steps of the improved mogwo are as follows step 1 input the maximum number of the archive n a and the number of the grey wolf population n g initialize a a and c and initialize the grey wolf population step 2 calculate the value of the objective functions find the non dominated solutions and input them in the archive step 3 update a a and c according to eq 22 step 4 select three best wolves from the archive using the roulette wheel method step 5 update the position of the rest wolves according to eqs 20 and 21 step 6 watch a nearby position based on eqs 23 and 24 and if the new position dominates or does not dominate the old one the wolf moves to the new position step 7 calculate the value of the objective functions of each wolf select the non dominated solutions in the rest wolves to compare with those in the archive and update the archive step 8 regroup the archive and if the number of solutions in the archive exceeds n a delete the extra solutions step 9 if the calculation time exceeds the maximum number of iterations all solutions in the archive are the optimization results of the mogwo otherwise return to step 3 6 simulations in this paper trajectory simulations with three different vehicles are performed which include muauv with variable sweep angle shape conventional uav with deployed wing shape and conventional uuv with folded wing shape the boundary conditions and constraints are given in table 1 where the sweep angles of the deployed and folded wing shapes were constant i e χ 0 χ 0 χ f 6 1 pareto front solutions the mogwo nsga ⅱ and watch based mogwo were used to solve the above mentioned multi objective nlp problems the results demonstrated that all three methods can successfully find a non dominated solution that satisfies the constraints and the objective functions in fig 4 there are four sets of pareto fronts as it can be seen in the pareto fronts obtained by the watch based mogwo and nsga ⅱ the non dominated solutions were relatively close to each other moreover the distribution uniformity of the non dominated solutions obtained by nsga ⅱ was better while the distribution range of the non dominated solutions obtained by the watch based mogwo was wider this indicates the applicability of the proposed watch based mogwo in solving multi objective trajectory optimization problems comparing the results obtained by the mogwo and watch based mogwo the pareto front obtained by the watch based mogwo almost covered the one obtained by the mogwo it can be observed that there were two different cases in the non dominated solution obtained by the mogwo one finds the pareto front successfully while the other falls into local optimum indicating the superiority of the watch based mogwo when falling into local optimum the archive is filled with a large number of similar solutions in the early iterations as a result all the rest wolves tend to concentrate near a non dominated solution in the archive the guiding effect of the best wolves hardly updates the position of the rest wolves by applying the watch strategy some new non dominated solutions are found and added to the archive which enhances the diversity of the archive and prevents the algorithm from falling into local optimum in order to ensure that the watch based mogwo can satisfy the trajectory optimization problem requirements further verification on the trajectory and its parameters was performed in the following section 6 2 simulation results with different objectives since the muauv dives without thrust there must be a maximum cross range and a minimum time until the terminal position is reached the multi objective trajectory optimization model and the watch based mogwo were tested in two different mission scenarios i e emergency trans media maneuver and maximum cross range trans media maneuver the trajectory characteristics and state and control variables of the three different shaped vehicles were compared since the results calculated by the watch based mogwo were discrete the trajectory parameters were processed by cubic spline interpolation 6 2 1 case 1 emergency trans media maneuver and time optimal trajectory table 2 presents the terminal states of the time optimal trajectory in the emergency trans media maneuver it can be observed that all three vehicles could reach the terminal state when reaching the terminal position which indicates the applicability of the watch based mogwo in solving trajectory optimization problems the muauv with variable sweep wing configuration could complete the dive phase faster than the vehicle with fixed sweep angle shape when the emergency trans media maneuver was performed the time optimal trajectories from the initial to the terminal position are demonstrated in fig 5 as it can be seen the time optimal dive trajectories were curved even the direction of the trajectory changed and there was a large displacement in the lateral plane for the dive phase in minimum flight time figs 6 and 7 a b show the history of velocity inclination angle and deflection angle of the trajectory respectively and fig 8 a c show the history of aoa bank angle and sweep angle respectively all the state variables were in the given range and no abrupt change in the state variables was observed as it can be seen in fig 6 the vehicle flies at high velocity to complete the dive phase in a minimum time to meet the constraints imposed on the vehicle the control variables oscillate within a certain range while the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle are controlled by adjusting the aoa and sweep angle in real time thus the vehicle is in an alternate state of acceleration deceleration acceleration the changes of velocity trajectory inclination angle aoa and sweep angle are well synchronized i e when the aoa and sweep angle increase the velocity and trajectory inclination angle increase correspondingly and vice versa however there is a short delay in the velocity and trajectory inclination angle which is attributed to that the aoa and the sweep angle are control variables relative to the velocity and trajectory inclination angle the same can be concluded for the relationship between the bank angle and the trajectory deflection angle the vehicle changes the direction of the lift surface through a large bank angle which induces a large scale maneuver in the lateral plane according to figs 6 8 the trajectory curvature was large the state variables changed sharply and the terminal velocity was at its maximum when the vehicle dived in minimum flight time during the no thrust dive phase and as the altitude decreased the vehicle should have been accelerating due to the action of gravity in fact due to the constraint on flight velocity the vehicle decelerated using aerodynamic force that is the longitudinal axis of the vehicle rotated around the velocity vector at the maximum allowable aoa fig 8 a and a lateral maneuver was performed finally the vehicle reached the terminal position accurately and all the state variables satisfied the constraints under the control of the aoa bank angle and sweep angle 6 2 2 case 2 maximum cross range trans media maneuver and cross range optimal trajectory table 3 presents the terminal states of the cross range optimal trajectory all three vehicles could reach the terminal state and the lateral terminal displacement was 0 compared to that of the vehicles with folded and deployed wing shapes the cross range of the muauv was the largest fig 9 demonstrates the cross range trajectory of the three different vehicles from the initial to the terminal position different from the time optimal trajectories the three cross range optimal trajectories were very smooth and almost no maneuvers were performed in the lateral plane in addition the characteristics of three cross range optimal trajectories were different for the vehicles with variable sweep angle and deployed wing shapes there was a climbing maneuver in the initial stage which was contrary to the common sense on dive maneuvers on the other hand the vehicle with the folded wing shape performed a direct dive maneuver as it can be seen in fig 10 the velocity of the vehicles with variable sweep angle and deployed wing shapes decreased gradually with increasing flight altitude when the flight altitude reached the maximum the velocity was in a minimum subsequently the vehicle began to dive and after a short adjustment its velocity remained stable for a long time and decreased to the preset minimum value at the end of the dive phase as it can be observed in fig 11 the trajectory inclination angle was positive during climbing and then became negative for a long time while the trajectory deflection angle was almost zero during the entire dive phase fig 12 demonstrates the variation curves of the aoa bank angle and sweep angle it can be seen that the three vehicles flew at a positive aoa the bank angle was almost zero and the sweep angle changed rapidly to 90 at the end of the dive phase as it can be seen in figs 10 12 the cross range optimal trajectory of the three vehicles was smooth and the state variables were stable different from the time optimal trajectory where deceleration through the aerodynamic force was employed the vehicles with variable sweep angle and deployed wing shapes decelerated through a gliding maneuver at a fixed aoa and velocity to increase the flight distance taking full advantage of the large lift to drag ratio in order to achieve a longer cross range the three vehicles performed no maneuver in the lateral plane based on the trajectory characteristics the cross range optimal trajectory of the muauv can be divided into three segments climbing segment gliding segment and terminal segment 1 climbing segment the muauv climbs at a small aoa and the flight altitude increases as the flight velocity decreases rapidly the aerodynamic force gradually decreases and vertical downward acceleration is developed when the vertical velocity is 0 the muauv is at the highest point of altitude i e the dive point the trajectory segment from the initial position to the dive point is called the climbing trajectory 2 gliding segment after a brief adjustment on attitude the muauv begins to glide from the dive point the muauv is in a quasi equilibrium state under the action of gravity lift and drag and the control and state variables are stable the position at the end of gliding is called the adjustment point and the trajectory segment from the dive point to the adjustment point is called the gliding trajectory the gliding segment is the main segment of the dive phase and its principal task is to make the muauv fly as far as possible 3 terminal segment this segment is an adjustment segment before the muauv enters the water and the altitude is very low the trajectory of the muauv is straightened to lengthen the cross range by increasing the aoa while the velocity first increases and then decreases to the minimum value with decreasing altitude the trajectory segment from the adjustment point to the terminal point is called the terminal trajectory 7 summary as it can be seen from the above two cases the two objectives are contradictory which means that when the best performance of one goal is pursued another goal will be inevitably sacrificed for instance when the minimum flight time is pursued the oscillation of the trajectory is intensified due to the deceleration approaches that use the aerodynamic force and lateral maneuvers while when the maximum cross range is pursued it should be taken for granted that the flight time will be longer the multi objective optimization result is a non dominated solution set and it does not come with a method for selecting a specific trajectory from the solution set the purpose of dive trajectory optimization is to make the muauv complete the trans media maneuver safely and reliably consequently the trajectory should be selected based on the task the purpose and the result of threat assessment 8 conclusions in this paper a watch based mogwo is presented which was employed to solve the multi objective dive trajectory optimization problem the pareto front obtained by the watch based mogwo was compared with that obtained by nsga ⅱ and mogwo the results revealed that the diversity of the archive was improved and the distribution range of the non dominated solutions obtained by the watch based mogwo was wider comparative simulations on the time optimal and cross range optimal trajectories of three different vehicles were performed and the results demonstrated that the muauv with variable sweep angle shape could control the aerodynamic state in real time by adjusting the aoa and sweep angle exhibiting stronger maneuverability and gliding ability to meet the path constraints imposed on the muauv deceleration approaches using the aerodynamic force and lengthening the distance were adopted in the time optimal and cross range optimal trajectory respectively consequently the obtained results demonstrated that the watch based mogwo is feasible and effective and can provide an alternative technique for trajectory planning and optimization credit authorship contribution statement guoming chen conceptualization

20838,the diffraction problem of a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is studied in the framework of linear potential theory the system consists of a porous exterior cylinder and an impermeable interior cylinder which are connected by an impermeable top and bottom plate and a porous ring plate arranged below the free surface darcy s law is applied to the porous boundaries under the assumption of fine pores the velocity potential of the whole fluid domain is analytically derived by the method of variable separation and eigen function expansion the

of the system the ratio of the interior and exterior radii are discussed the results show that appropriate permeability and structural scale parameters can improve the hydrodynamic performance of the structure which will provide directive guidance for engineering design keywords linear potential theory wave diffraction truncated cylinder system porous ring plate hydrodynamic loads 1 introduction porous structures have extensive application prospects in the field of ocean engineering e g floating airport semi submersible platform breakwater net cage and etc due to their ability to reduce hydrodynamic loads acting on the coastal structures in recent decades researchers have carried out substantial theoretical and experimental studies on various types of porous structures especially the porous plate and porous cylinder the analytical solution of wave interaction with submerged porous plate was first given by chwang and wu 1994 where the method of eigen function expansion was used in the framework of linear potential theory the thickness of the porous plate was assumed to be zero and darcy s law was applied to the boundary condition of the plate their results showed that the porous plate with appropriate porosity could reduce the wave surface elevation near the plate which is similar to the behavior of wave absorbers later many scholars used this method to study various types of porous plate for example a pitching porous plate yip and chwang 1998 a submerged horizontal porous plate with a finite thickness liu et al 2012 etc the complex wave number is involved in the above problems for the purpose of avoiding the trouble of complex wave number some researchers liu et al 2011 liu and li 2011 cho and kim 2013 zhao et al 2017 used the method of expanding the vertical derivative of velocity potential along the radial direction to study the submerged plate a detailed review of the early work on the interaction between wave and a submerged plate can be found in yu 2002 on the other hand many researchers are interested in the interaction between the water wave and the porous cylinder wang and ren 1994 investigated the protective effect of the porous exterior cylinder on the impermeable interior cylinder in a concentric cylinder system the results show that the porous exterior cylinder can significantly reduce the hydrodynamic loads and wave run up of the interior cylinder williams and li 2000 researched an array of bottom mounted surface piercing porous cylinders the results further confirmed that the porous cylinder has stronger survivability than the impermeable cylinder to find the structure with better hydrodynamic performance many scholars park et al 2010 mandal et al 2013 park and koo 2015 ning et al 2017 sarkar and bora 2019 behera et al 2020 have studied various types of porous compound cylinder system it is worth noting that bao et al 2009 investigated a semi submerged porous circular cylinder which combines a porous plate with a porous cylinder later zhao et al 2010 studied the interaction of wave and a porous cylinder with an inner horizontal porous plate in theory and carried out a series of experiments in a wave basin it was found that the porous plate can make the wave dissipation more effectively their research is not the first case in which porous plates are combined with other wave absorbing structures wu and chwang 2002 studied the wave diffraction by a vertical cylinder with a porous ring plate liu et al 2007 examined the hydrodynamic loads of a perforated wall breakwater with a submerged horizontal porous plate their research showed that careful design of the size and porosity of the compound structures with plates will lead to significant reduction of hydrodynamic loads in this paper the wave diffraction from a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is studied the model consists of an interior cylinder an exterior porous cylinder a porous ring plate an impermeable top plate and an impermeable bottom plate the interior cylinder and exterior cylinder are connected by the impermeable top and bottom plate and a porous ring plate below the free water surface we assume that the ratio of the thickness of the porous ring plate and the exterior cylinder to the incident wavelength is very small so the thickness of them can be ignored this structure makes full use of the wave attenuation ability of the porous ring plate and the porous cylinder which is expected to obtain better hydrodynamic performance simultaneously the porous ring plate in this model adds another connection to the interior and exterior cylinders which can enhance the ability of the system to resist wave attack therefore compared with the composite truncated cylinder system without the ring plate this structure has better connection performance due to the reinforcement effect of the ring plate in this paper based on the linear potential theory the analytical solution of diffraction from a concentric porous truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is derived by the method of eigen function expansion according to the solution the influence of various wave parameters and structural parameters on wave load is studied the governing equations and boundary conditions are introduced in section 2 the derivation method of the diffraction analytical solution and the calculation method of the hydrodynamic loads are presented in section 3 some numerical results are given in section 4 the last section summarizes the conclusion of this paper 2 mathematical model and the boundary value problem the model of wave diffraction from a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is shown in fig 1 the exterior cylinder and the plate are porous while the rest of it is impermeable the seabed is considered flat and impermeable symbol a a 1 d 0 d and h represent the interior cylinder radius the exterior cylinder radius the draft of the porous ring plate the draft of the whole cylinder system and the static water depth respectively a cartesian coordinate system x y z and a cylindrical coordinate system r θ z are established at the center of the cylinder system on the undisturbed free surface the structure is subjected to a regular incident wave propagating along the positive direction of the x axis with a wave amplitude a and an angular frequency ω the problem is solved in the frame of linear wave theory meanwhile the fluid is considered to be homogeneous incompressible inviscid and the

discussions 4 1 validation the hydrodynamic loads on the structures were compared with the published results for some special cases to validate the analytical solution for the purpose of verifying the correctness of the calculation program under general conditions the permeability of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder is not infinite or infinitesimal a cylinder with a porous plate fixed inside was taken as an example which corresponds to the radius of the interior cylinder approach zero in fig 1 i e a a 1 0 01 the following parameters b 0 b 1 9 a 1 h 0 03 d 0 h 0 015 and d h 0 06 are chosen b q 2 π σ q k 0 q 0 1 indicate the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder respectively fig 2 shows the comparison between the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads calculated by the present model and another analytical solution by bao et al 2009 for a cylinder with a porous plate fixed inside the surge force and heave force are non dimensionalized by ρ g a a 1 2 and the pitch moment by ρ g a a 1 3 respectively a good agreement between the two models is observed from the comparison in fig 2 in order to verify the correctness of the theory and the stability of calculation program under the limit conditions we make adaptive degradation of the model and calculate two examples firstly to verify the program when the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate approaches infinity b 0 200 the case of a truncated porous cylinder was considered which corresponds to the case of a a 1 0 01 and b 0 200 in fig 1 the parameters b 1 9 a 1 h 0 03 and d h 0 06 are adopted fig 3 shows the comparison of the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads acting on the porous cylinder between the present results and the corresponding solution by zhao et al 2011 it can be seen from fig 3 that the agreement between present results and the predictions of zhao et al 2011 is very well the results also show that the ring plate can be seen completely permeable if b 0 is larger than 200 and then to verify the program when the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the exterior cylinder approaches infinitesimal b 1 0 a truncated impermeable cylinder was chosen the parameters a a 1 0 01 a 1 h 0 03 d h 0 06 b 0 200 and b 1 0 are selected fig 4 shows the comparison between the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads obtained from the present model and the results from zhao et al 2011 it is evident from fig 4 that the agreement between the present predictions and the results of zhao et al 2011 is excellent according to the above comparisons it can be concluded that the solution of wave diffraction from a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is reliable 4 2 parametric study following the above model validation the parametric studies were carried out to determine the effect of the dimensionless porous parameter b 0 the draft depth ratio of the plate d 0 h the draft depth ratio of the system d h and the ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 on the hydrodynamic loads acting on the structure for b 1 10 the influence of both the dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 and b 1 is discussed at last 4 2 1 effect of the dimensionless porous parameter b 0 in this section the influence of the dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 on the hydrodynamic loads is of interest the parameters a a 1 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 d 0 h 0 025 d h 0 5 and b 1 10 are fixed fig 5 shows the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different b 0 the black solid line in the figure indicates that the ring plate is impermeable to avoid the singularity of calculation the dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 of the impermeable ring plate is set to 0 001 it can be seen from fig 5 that the permeability of the ring plate has a significant influence on the amplitude and trend of the hydrodynamic curve of the cylinder system when the ring plate is porous on the one hand it can affect the peak value of surge force and pitch moment and their corresponding wavenumber on the other hand it can significantly reduce the amplitude of heave force on the structure which reflects the damping effect of the porous ring plate however in order to improve the survivability of the cylinder system in the ocean the permeability of the ring plate can only be increased to an appropriate extent otherwise the structure will bear greater surge force and pitch moment in the high frequency region meanwhile it can be seen from fig 5 that when the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate is greater than 40 multiple curves tend to overlap that is to say the influence of the permeability of the ring plate on hydrodynamic loads tends to be stable it can be concluded that the above mentioned horizontal porous ring plate has application prospects in reducing the large heave motion of the floating bodies 4 2 2 effect of the draft depth ratio of the plate d 0 h in this section the influence of the draft depth ratio of the plate d 0 h on the hydrodynamic loads is considered the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different d 0 h are shown in fig 6 as a comparison the hydrodynamic loads of the system without a ring plate for the case b 0 200 are also shown in the figure the parameters a a 1 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 d h 0 5 and b 1 10 are fixed for the system with a porous ring plate fixed inside it can be seen from fig 6 that the corresponding curve of d 0 h 0 375 almost coincides with that of the structure without the ring plate this phenomenon shows that when the draft depth of the ring plate d 0 h increases to a certain extent the influence of the ring plate on the hydrodynamic loads of the structure tends to disappear which is a consequence of the exponential decay of wave motion in the vertical direction it can also be seen from the figure that the peak value of surge force and pitch moment can be reduced by properly reducing the ring plate draft d 0 but the heave force borne by the structure in the low frequency region will increase 4 2 3 effect of the draft depth ratio of the system d h in this section the influence of the draft depth ratio of the system d h on the hydrodynamic loads is investigated the parameters a a 1 0 5 d 0 a 1 0 05 d 0 d 0 05 b 1 10 and b 0 20 were chosen fig 7 shows the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different d h it can be seen from fig 7 that the trend of different hydrodynamic curves does not change with the increase of d h with the increase of d h the peak value of surge force increases but the peak value of heave force and pitch moment decreases generally the draft depth ratio of the system d h has a little influence on the hydrodynamic loads 4 2 4 effect of the ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 in this section the influence of the ratio of the interior and exterior radii on the hydrodynamic loads is studied the parameters d 0 h 0 025 d h 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 and b 0 20 were fixed fig 8 shows the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 the extreme case of impermeable exterior cylinder b 1 0 is also shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that when a a 1 0 95 the curve of surge force and heave force of the system almost coincide with that of impermeable cylinder however the curve of pitch moment does not follow this principle it coincides with the impermeable cylinder curve at a a 1 0 7 when the ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 continues to increase the pitch moment increases almost in the whole frequency region this phenomenon may be related to the phase difference of the pitch moment components it also can be found that compared with the impermeable cylinder the system with a suitable ratio of the interior and exterior radii can significantly reduce the hydrodynamic amplitude of the structure 4 2 5 effect of the dimensionless porous parameter b 1 the hydrodynamic loads of a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is affected by both the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate b 0 and the exterior cylinder b 1 fig 9 shows the 3d surface of the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads with b 0 and b 1 for a a 1 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 d 0 h 0 025 d h 0 5 and k 0 a 1 1 0 it can be seen from fig 9 that there are large areas of the 3d surface that are flat and constant and the corresponding dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 and b 1 are large the smaller value of b 0 and b 1 the greater the influence on the hydrodynamic loads this shows that when the permeability of the structure increases to a certain extent the hydrodynamic loads reach to a saturation status to further discuss the saturation status the representative curves in fig 9 are extracted and plotted as figs 10 and 11 fig 10 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads of the structure with b 0 under different b 1 as can be seen from fig 10 the curve of b 1 1 is obviously different from the other curves when b 1 1 the model almost degenerates into an impermeable isolated cylinder and the wave hardly interacts with the interior cylinder and the ring plate when b 1 10 and above with the increase of b 0 the surge force and pitch moment gradually increase and tend to be stable the heave force continuously decreases until it tends to be stable and with the increase of b 1 the saturation point of the surge force moves to the right gradually while the saturation points of the heave force and pitch moment move to the left gradually fig 11 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads of the structure with b 1 under different b 0 it can be seen from fig 11 a with the increase of b 1 the surge force gradually decreases and tends to be stable with the increase of b 0 the saturation point moves to the left fig 11 b shows that the heave force is more strongly affected by the permeability of the ring plate with the increase of b 0 the value of b 1 corresponding to saturation point first decreases and then increases it can be seen from fig 11 c that when b 0 is small the pitch moment first decreases and then increases with the increase of b 1 and finally reaches the saturation status with the increase of b 0 the first decreasing trend of pitch moment gradually disappears and the position of saturation point gradually moves to the left based on the above results the hydrodynamic loads of such structures can be greatly reduced by making full use of the damping effect of permeable structures in the direction perpendicular to the incident wave 5 conclusions based on the linear potential theory the diffraction problem of a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is studied in this paper by using the method of variable separation and eigen function expansion the analytical solutions of velocity potential in each domain are derived the hydrodynamic loads of the structure are derived by the velocity potential finally this paper studies the influence of various parameters on the hydrodynamic performance of the structure which provides a reference for related design the numerical results show that the heave force of the structure can be significantly reduced by the ring plate with proper porosity however if the permeability of the ring plate is too large the structure will bear large surge force and pitch moment in the high frequency region the draft of the ring plate and the ratio of the interior and exterior radii have a great influence on the hydrodynamic loads of the structure the results show that the surge force and pitch moment of the structure can be significantly reduced by reducing the ring plate draft but the heave force will be increased at the same time compared with the impermeable cylinder the concentric cylinder system with a smaller interior cylinder radius has a better hydrodynamic performance it is also found that the influence of the structure draft depth on its hydrodynamic loads is relatively small in practical engineering application it is also necessary to consider the joint influence of the permeability of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder on the hydrodynamic loads of the structure in total the optimal hydrodynamic performance of the structure can be obtained by selecting the appropriate permeability of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder the draft of the ring plate the draft of the system and the ratio of the interior and exterior radii this type of structure cannot only be used as a breakwater but also as a wave energy device cage offshore structure support components and so on credit authorship contribution statement

porous structures have extensive application prospects in the field of ocean engineering e g floating airport semi submersible platform breakwater net cage and etc due to their ability to reduce hydrodynamic loads acting on the coastal structures in recent decades researchers have carried out substantial theoretical and experimental studies on various types of porous structures especially the porous plate and porous cylinder the analytical solution of wave interaction with submerged porous plate was first given by chwang and wu 1994 where the method of eigen function expansion was used in the framework of linear potential theory the thickness of the porous plate was assumed to be zero and darcy s law was applied to the boundary condition of the plate their results showed that the porous plate with appropriate porosity could reduce the wave surface elevation near the plate which is similar to the behavior of wave absorbers later many scholars used this method to study various types of porous plate for example a pitching porous plate yip and chwang 1998 a submerged horizontal porous plate with a finite thickness liu et al 2012 etc the complex wave number is involved in the above problems for the purpose of avoiding the trouble of complex wave number some researchers liu et al 2011 liu and li 2011 cho and kim 2013 zhao et al 2017 used the method of expanding the vertical derivative of velocity potential along the radial direction to study the submerged plate a detailed review of the early work on the interaction between wave and a submerged plate can be found in yu 2002 on the other hand many researchers are interested in the interaction between the water wave and the porous cylinder wang and ren 1994 investigated the protective effect of the porous exterior cylinder on the impermeable interior cylinder in a concentric cylinder system the results show that the porous exterior cylinder can significantly reduce the hydrodynamic loads and wave run up of the interior cylinder williams and li 2000 researched an array of bottom mounted surface piercing porous cylinders the results further confirmed that the porous cylinder has stronger survivability than the impermeable cylinder to find the structure with better hydrodynamic performance many scholars park et al 2010 mandal et al 2013 park and koo 2015 ning et al 2017 sarkar and bora 2019 behera et al 2020 have studied various types of porous compound cylinder system it is worth noting that bao et al 2009 investigated a semi submerged porous circular cylinder which combines a porous plate with a porous cylinder later zhao et al 2010 studied the interaction of wave and a porous cylinder with an inner horizontal porous plate in theory and carried out a series of experiments in a wave basin it was found that the porous plate can make the wave dissipation more effectively their research is not the first case in which porous plates are combined with other wave absorbing structures wu and chwang 2002 studied the wave diffraction by a vertical cylinder with a porous ring plate liu et al 2007 examined the hydrodynamic loads of a perforated wall breakwater with a submerged horizontal porous plate their research showed that careful design of the size and porosity of the compound structures with plates will lead to significant reduction of hydrodynamic loads in this paper the wave diffraction from a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is studied the model consists of an interior cylinder an exterior porous cylinder a porous ring plate an impermeable top plate and an impermeable bottom plate the interior cylinder and exterior cylinder are connected by the impermeable top and bottom plate and a porous ring plate below the free water surface we assume that the ratio of the thickness of the porous ring plate and the exterior cylinder to the incident wavelength is very small so the thickness of them can be ignored this structure makes full use of the wave attenuation ability of the porous ring plate and the porous cylinder which is expected to obtain better hydrodynamic performance simultaneously the porous ring plate in this model adds another connection to the interior and exterior cylinders which can enhance the ability of the system to resist wave attack therefore compared with the composite truncated cylinder system without the ring plate this structure has better connection performance due to the reinforcement effect of the ring plate in this paper based on the linear potential theory the analytical solution of diffraction from a concentric porous truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is derived by the method of eigen function expansion according to the solution the influence of various wave parameters and structural parameters on wave load is studied the governing equations and boundary conditions are introduced in section 2 the derivation method of the diffraction analytical solution and the calculation method of the hydrodynamic loads are presented in section 3 some numerical results are given in section 4 the last section summarizes the conclusion of this paper 2 mathematical model and the boundary value problem the model of wave diffraction from a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is shown in fig 1 the exterior cylinder and the plate are porous while the rest of it is impermeable the seabed is considered flat and impermeable symbol a a 1 d 0 d and h represent the interior cylinder radius the exterior cylinder radius the draft of the porous ring plate the draft of the whole cylinder system and the static water depth respectively a cartesian coordinate system x y z and a cylindrical coordinate system r θ z are established at the center of the cylinder system on the undisturbed free surface the structure is subjected to a regular incident wave propagating along the positive direction of the x axis with a wave amplitude a and an angular frequency ω the problem is solved in the frame of linear wave theory meanwhile the fluid is considered to be homogeneous incompressible inviscid and the motion irrotational subsequently the fluid can be described as complex velocity potential φ re ϕ r θ z e i ω t where re denotes the real part of a complex expression i the imaginary unit and ϕ the spatial potential then the time dependent term e i ω t can be removed from all the dynamic variables as shown in fig 1 the fluid is divided into three domains an exterior domain defined by ω 1 h z 0 a

viscosity of water the constant l q is the porosity coefficient with a dimension of length σ q ranges from 0 to infinity it means that the surface is completely impermeable when σ q 0 by contrast as σ

discussions 4 1 validation the hydrodynamic loads on the structures were compared with the published results for some special cases to validate the analytical solution for the purpose of verifying the correctness of the calculation program under general conditions the permeability of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder is not infinite or infinitesimal a cylinder with a porous plate fixed inside was taken as an example which corresponds to the radius of the interior cylinder approach zero in fig 1 i e a a 1 0 01 the following parameters b 0 b 1 9 a 1 h 0 03 d 0 h 0 015 and d h 0 06 are chosen b q 2 π σ q k 0 q 0 1 indicate the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder respectively fig 2 shows the comparison between the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads calculated by the present model and another analytical solution by bao et al 2009 for a cylinder with a porous plate fixed inside the surge force and heave force are non dimensionalized by ρ g a a 1 2 and the pitch moment by ρ g a a 1 3 respectively a good agreement between the two models is observed from the comparison in fig 2 in order to verify the correctness of the theory and the stability of calculation program under the limit conditions we make adaptive degradation of the model and calculate two examples firstly to verify the program when the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate approaches infinity b 0 200 the case of a truncated porous cylinder was considered which corresponds to the case of a a 1 0 01 and b 0 200 in fig 1 the parameters b 1 9 a 1 h 0 03 and d h 0 06 are adopted fig 3 shows the comparison of the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads acting on the porous cylinder between the present results and the corresponding solution by zhao et al 2011 it can be seen from fig 3 that the agreement between present results and the predictions of zhao et al 2011 is very well the results also show that the ring plate can be seen completely permeable if b 0 is larger than 200 and then to verify the program when the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the exterior cylinder approaches infinitesimal b 1 0 a truncated impermeable cylinder was chosen the parameters a a 1 0 01 a 1 h 0 03 d h 0 06 b 0 200 and b 1 0 are selected fig 4 shows the comparison between the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads obtained from the present model and the results from zhao et al 2011 it is evident from fig 4 that the agreement between the present predictions and the results of zhao et al 2011 is excellent according to the above comparisons it can be concluded that the solution of wave diffraction from a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is reliable 4 2 parametric study following the above model validation the parametric studies were carried out to determine the effect of the dimensionless porous parameter b 0 the draft depth ratio of the plate d 0 h the draft depth ratio of the system d h and the ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 on the hydrodynamic loads acting on the structure for b 1 10 the influence of both the dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 and b 1 is discussed at last 4 2 1 effect of the dimensionless porous parameter b 0 in this section the influence of the dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 on the hydrodynamic loads is of interest the parameters a a 1 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 d 0 h 0 025 d h 0 5 and b 1 10 are fixed fig 5 shows the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different b 0 the black solid line in the figure indicates that the ring plate is impermeable to avoid the singularity of calculation the dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 of the impermeable ring plate is set to 0 001 it can be seen from fig 5 that the permeability of the ring plate has a significant influence on the amplitude and trend of the hydrodynamic curve of the cylinder system when the ring plate is porous on the one hand it can affect the peak value of surge force and pitch moment and their corresponding wavenumber on the other hand it can significantly reduce the amplitude of heave force on the structure which reflects the damping effect of the porous ring plate however in order to improve the survivability of the cylinder system in the ocean the permeability of the ring plate can only be increased to an appropriate extent otherwise the structure will bear greater surge force and pitch moment in the high frequency region meanwhile it can be seen from fig 5 that when the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate is greater than 40 multiple curves tend to overlap that is to say the influence of the permeability of the ring plate on hydrodynamic loads tends to be stable it can be concluded that the above mentioned horizontal porous ring plate has application prospects in reducing the large heave motion of the floating bodies 4 2 2 effect of the draft depth ratio of the plate d 0 h in this section the influence of the draft depth ratio of the plate d 0 h on the hydrodynamic loads is considered the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different d 0 h are shown in fig 6 as a comparison the hydrodynamic loads of the system without a ring plate for the case b 0 200 are also shown in the figure the parameters a a 1 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 d h 0 5 and b 1 10 are fixed for the system with a porous ring plate fixed inside it can be seen from fig 6 that the corresponding curve of d 0 h 0 375 almost coincides with that of the structure without the ring plate this phenomenon shows that when the draft depth of the ring plate d 0 h increases to a certain extent the influence of the ring plate on the hydrodynamic loads of the structure tends to disappear which is a consequence of the exponential decay of wave motion in the vertical direction it can also be seen from the figure that the peak value of surge force and pitch moment can be reduced by properly reducing the ring plate draft d 0 but the heave force borne by the structure in the low frequency region will increase 4 2 3 effect of the draft depth ratio of the system d h in this section the influence of the draft depth ratio of the system d h on the hydrodynamic loads is investigated the parameters a a 1 0 5 d 0 a 1 0 05 d 0 d 0 05 b 1 10 and b 0 20 were chosen fig 7 shows the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different d h it can be seen from fig 7 that the trend of different hydrodynamic curves does not change with the increase of d h with the increase of d h the peak value of surge force increases but the peak value of heave force and pitch moment decreases generally the draft depth ratio of the system d h has a little influence on the hydrodynamic loads 4 2 4 effect of the ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 in this section the influence of the ratio of the interior and exterior radii on the hydrodynamic loads is studied the parameters d 0 h 0 025 d h 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 and b 0 20 were fixed fig 8 shows the variation of dimensionless hydrodynamic loads f 1 ρ g a a 1 2 f 3 ρ g a a 1 2 and f 5 ρ g a a 1 3 on the structure versus the dimensionless wavenumber k 0 a 1 for different ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 the extreme case of impermeable exterior cylinder b 1 0 is also shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that when a a 1 0 95 the curve of surge force and heave force of the system almost coincide with that of impermeable cylinder however the curve of pitch moment does not follow this principle it coincides with the impermeable cylinder curve at a a 1 0 7 when the ratio of the interior and exterior radii a a 1 continues to increase the pitch moment increases almost in the whole frequency region this phenomenon may be related to the phase difference of the pitch moment components it also can be found that compared with the impermeable cylinder the system with a suitable ratio of the interior and exterior radii can significantly reduce the hydrodynamic amplitude of the structure 4 2 5 effect of the dimensionless porous parameter b 1 the hydrodynamic loads of a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is affected by both the dimensionless porous effect parameter of the ring plate b 0 and the exterior cylinder b 1 fig 9 shows the 3d surface of the dimensionless hydrodynamic loads with b 0 and b 1 for a a 1 0 5 a 1 h 0 5 d 0 h 0 025 d h 0 5 and k 0 a 1 1 0 it can be seen from fig 9 that there are large areas of the 3d surface that are flat and constant and the corresponding dimensionless porous effect parameter b 0 and b 1 are large the smaller value of b 0 and b 1 the greater the influence on the hydrodynamic loads this shows that when the permeability of the structure increases to a certain extent the hydrodynamic loads reach to a saturation status to further discuss the saturation status the representative curves in fig 9 are extracted and plotted as figs 10 and 11 fig 10 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads of the structure with b 0 under different b 1 as can be seen from fig 10 the curve of b 1 1 is obviously different from the other curves when b 1 1 the model almost degenerates into an impermeable isolated cylinder and the wave hardly interacts with the interior cylinder and the ring plate when b 1 10 and above with the increase of b 0 the surge force and pitch moment gradually increase and tend to be stable the heave force continuously decreases until it tends to be stable and with the increase of b 1 the saturation point of the surge force moves to the right gradually while the saturation points of the heave force and pitch moment move to the left gradually fig 11 shows the variation of the hydrodynamic loads of the structure with b 1 under different b 0 it can be seen from fig 11 a with the increase of b 1 the surge force gradually decreases and tends to be stable with the increase of b 0 the saturation point moves to the left fig 11 b shows that the heave force is more strongly affected by the permeability of the ring plate with the increase of b 0 the value of b 1 corresponding to saturation point first decreases and then increases it can be seen from fig 11 c that when b 0 is small the pitch moment first decreases and then increases with the increase of b 1 and finally reaches the saturation status with the increase of b 0 the first decreasing trend of pitch moment gradually disappears and the position of saturation point gradually moves to the left based on the above results the hydrodynamic loads of such structures can be greatly reduced by making full use of the damping effect of permeable structures in the direction perpendicular to the incident wave 5 conclusions based on the linear potential theory the diffraction problem of a concentric truncated cylinder system with a porous ring plate fixed inside is studied in this paper by using the method of variable separation and eigen function expansion the analytical solutions of velocity potential in each domain are derived the hydrodynamic loads of the structure are derived by the velocity potential finally this paper studies the influence of various parameters on the hydrodynamic performance of the structure which provides a reference for related design the numerical results show that the heave force of the structure can be significantly reduced by the ring plate with proper porosity however if the permeability of the ring plate is too large the structure will bear large surge force and pitch moment in the high frequency region the draft of the ring plate and the ratio of the interior and exterior radii have a great influence on the hydrodynamic loads of the structure the results show that the surge force and pitch moment of the structure can be significantly reduced by reducing the ring plate draft but the heave force will be increased at the same time compared with the impermeable cylinder the concentric cylinder system with a smaller interior cylinder radius has a better hydrodynamic performance it is also found that the influence of the structure draft depth on its hydrodynamic loads is relatively small in practical engineering application it is also necessary to consider the joint influence of the permeability of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder on the hydrodynamic loads of the structure in total the optimal hydrodynamic performance of the structure can be obtained by selecting the appropriate permeability of the ring plate and the exterior cylinder the draft of the ring plate the draft of the system and the ratio of the interior and exterior radii this type of structure cannot only be used as a breakwater but also as a wave energy device cage offshore structure support components and so on credit authorship contribution statement

20839,this paper investigates the tracking control of the autonomous surface vessels asvs with the time varying disturbances while the echo state network esn accounts for the unknown dynamics in the model a model based event triggered control mbetc scheme is presented by using the compound learning technique which combines the learning of the esn and the estimation of the compound disturbance different from the existing compound learning the proposed scheme updates the estimates of the esn weights and the compound disturbances in an event triggered manner in which two novel prediction errors are involved in their update laws the values of prediction errors are obtained by using the online recorded data during the inter event time to solve the recently proposed problem of jumps of virtual control laws arising in the backstepping based event triggered control etc an event triggered adaptive model is established to generate the continuous estimates of the states and direct the control laws by the merit of etc the proposed scheme can importantly reduce the communication traffic in the measurement network compared with its continuous substitutes by the merit of online recorded data based compound learning the proposed scheme can achieve the good understanding of synthetic uncertainties all the errors in the closed loop system are proved to be semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sguub finally a numerical example corroborates the proposed scheme keywords model based event triggered control mbetc compound learning autonomous surface vessels 1 introduction intelligence and practicality are two perennial and attractive issues in the fields of control theory and application this trend was also apparent in the control of the asvs in recent years especially the solutions to some complex control problems in the generic nonlinear systems have been successfully extended to the asvs not to make an exhaustive survey the reader can find the application of the anti windup algorithms in shen et al 2020 and deng et al 2020a 2019a b the barrier lyapunov functions to ensure the state constraints in wang et al 2020a and qin et al 2020a b the prescribed performance control in li et al 2020a the reinforcement learning to achieve the optimal control performance in zheng et al 2020 the extended state observer to achieve the state recovery in liu et al 2019 2020 and so on nevertheless not all the control technologies can be easily incorporated into the asvs this is because of the different model structures between the asv and the generic nonlinear system which motivates the work in this paper conversely the implication of the proposed scheme in the generic nonlinear systems is worthy of attention as all the devices in an asv and their interactions compose a network a versatile and informative control scheme will lead to the network congestion in the context of customary time triggered signal sampling due to the limited bandwidth the network congestion will induce the undesired behaviors like packet dropouts disorder and delays wang et al 2020b which further deteriorates the control performance of the asv and even causes the instability the etc is deemed as a powerful tool to overcome the shortage of network congestion in which the signal sampling intermittently occurs at the certain situation recently plenty of researches were published towards the etc in diverse nonlinear systems such as the strict feedback system in wang et al 2020b c su et al 2019 cao et al 2018 sun et al 2020 szanto et al 2018 and li and yang 2018b the pure feedback system in li and yang 2018a the affine system in guo et al 2020b and narayanan et al 2019 the canonical system in wang et al 2019 while reviewing these literature the author found it a challenging issue to combine the well known backstepping method with the etc although this goal was achieved in wang et al 2020c su et al 2019 cao et al 2018 and sun et al 2020 the etc therein only functioned in the controller to actuator channel nevertheless the network congestion happens not only in the controller to actuator channel but also in the sensor to controller channel in a more terminological way the sensor to controller channel is reexpressed as the measurement network hereafter usually when the etc functions in the measurement network the saving of communication load is more remarkable nevertheless in the traditional backstepping design framework the renewal of states from the sensors will precipitate the virtual control laws into a sudden jump at the triggering instant and iteratively affect their values as the tracking errors between the states and the virtual control laws are involved in the stability analysis the jumps will affect the logicality of the control scheme this problem was first put forward as jumps of virtual control laws in deng et al 2020b and the formulaic definition will be given in section 2 although szanto et al 2018 and li and yang 2018b a fabricated the backstepping based event triggered controller in the measurement network this problem was not considered and the virtual control laws were deemed to be continuous therein as far as we know wang et al 2020b can solve the problem of jumps of virtual control laws by fabricating the virtual control laws ideally independent of the event triggered sampled states nevertheless it finally deduced a neural network nn based controller in which the control performance totally relied on the approximation performance of one nn as the direct adaptive control was used in the learning of the nn this controller may be not practical in our previous work of deng et al 2020b and deng and zhang 2020 the smooth substitutes were generated by the dynamic surface filters to replace the discontinuous virtual control laws this setup can solve the problem of jumps of virtual control laws but led to the difficulty in the parameter selection and the complexity in the stability proof to the author s knowledge there is no other report on solving the problem of jumps of virtual control laws as a result most of the etc of the asv only addressed the controller to actuator channel such as deng et al 2019a b li et al 2020b and jiao and wang 2016a b in liu et al 2020 an observer based etc for the asv is proposed which achieved the event triggered state sampling in the measurement network not limited in deng et al 2020b and deng and zhang 2020 the backstepping based etc of the asv in the measurement network is an open question another concern of this paper rests with the disposal of unknown dynamics and disturbances the approximators such as the nns wang and wang 2015 dai et al 2014 deng et al 2020c and the fuzzy logic systems flss tong et al 2016 2020 were widely used to approximate the unknown dynamics in the system which significantly increased the algorithmic flexibility nevertheless most of these researches used the tracking errors to update the approximator which led to the convergence of tracking errors but lost the interpretability of approximation xu et al 2014 recently the composite learning technique provided a solution to this question which can reconcile the tracking performance with the approximation precision the main difficulty of the composite learning consists in how to construct the prediction errors involved in the update of the approximator in xu et al 2014 pan et al 2013 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2017 and li et al 2016 the serial parallel models also the so called predictors were constructed to generate prediction errors nevertheless these traditional predictors relied heavily on the persistent excitation pe condition to realize the parameter convergence to release such a constraint pan et al 2016 pan and yu 2018 guo et al 2020a and xu et al 2018 developed the novel prediction errors by using the online recorded data such that only the weaker excitation condition termed interval excitation ie was required although the above researches of composite learning were devoted to guaranteeing the approximation precision of the unknown dynamics there left a problem on how to distinguish the unknown dynamics and the disturbances from each other that means the approximation performance will be degraded if the disturbances are not properly addressed xu et al 2019 to solve this problem it is called the compound learning to identify the disturbances and the unknown dynamics separately xu et al 2017 and xu 2018 integrated the disturbance observers dos with the serial parallel model based composite learning whereas xu et al 2019 integrated the dos with the online recorded data based composite learning moreover xu et al 2019 reached a meritorious conclusion that neither the approximator nor the do can accurately estimate their counterparts in the context of compound learning whereas the sum of them can accurately estimate the synthetic uncertainty in view of the control of the asvs there are no researches towards the compound learning at present as far as we know only liu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and deng and zhang 2020 employed the predictor based composite learning while reviewing these literature the author found that almost all of the composite learning was conducted in the continuous system if it is combined with the etc in the measurement network the learning of the approximator can only access the sensor signals in an event triggered manner as the previous continuous researches cannot be easily adapted how to design the event triggered composite or compound learning is left to be solved motivated by the above challenges this paper proposes a mbetc scheme for the trajectory tracking of the asv and the event triggered compound learning is designed for the identification of uncertainties an adaptive model was established at first which involves the esn the estimates of the compound disturbances and the event triggered samples an adaptive triggering condition is designed to guarantee the similarity between the adaptive model and the original model based on the adaptive model the backstepping based etc laws are derived the dynamic surface filters are employed to avoid the problem of complexity explosion for the compound learning the prediction errors are derived from both the adaptive model and the original model the online recorded data collected during the inter event time are employed to update the prediction errors at the triggering instant such that the estimates of the esn weights and the compound disturbances directed by the prediction errors are only renewed at the triggering instant and these estimates are kept by the zero order holders zohs during the inter event time in the premise of the bounded estimation errors the sguub of all the tracking errors are ensured the contributions of this work are mainly threefold 1 by the merit of the mbetc the communication load in the measurement network is largely reduced compared with the existing etc of the asvs by the merit of compound learning the better tracking performance is ensured compared with the tracking error based learning schemes of the asvs 2 by resorting to the adaptive model the virtual control laws are designed in a continuous way such that the problem of jumps of virtual control laws is circumvented without the complex analysis and parameter selection 3 this paper develops an event triggered compound learning technique which combines the compound learning with the etc by using the online recorded data during the inter event time this technique ensures the good learning performance to the synthetic uncertainties the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the preliminaries towards the model of the asv the esn some necessary inequalities and the definition of the problem of jumps of virtual control laws are introduced in section 3 the control design is carried out section 4 designs the triggering condition and analyzes the stability of the closed loop system in section 5 the simulations are conducted to substantiate the control scheme section 6 concludes the entire work appendix proves the bounded estimation errors of the compound learning uniformly in this paper t j denotes the triggering instant with j 0 t 0 is also the initial time of navigation denotes lim t t j from the right side denotes the euclidean norm of the vector tr denotes the trace of the square matrix 2 preliminaries 2 1 mathematical model according to qin et al 2020a b and jiao and wang 2016b the motions of an asv can be described by the following differential equations with 3 degrees of freedom in two frames 1 η j ψ υ m υ c υ υ d υ υ g η τ τ w where η x y ψ t includes the positional coordinates x y and the heading angle ψ in the earth frame υ u v r t includes the surge speed u the sway speed v and the yaw rate r in the body frame j ψ denotes the transformation matrix with the following structure j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 m r 3 3 denotes the known nonsingular inertia matrix procured from empirical equations c υ r 3 3 denotes the unknown centripetal and coriolis matrix d υ r 3 3

u w τ v w τ r w t denotes the vector of the external disturbances generated by waves and winds for simplicity let d m 1 τ and d w m 1 τ w then the lower equation of eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 υ d d w f η υ where f η υ m 1 c υ υ d υ υ g η describes the unknown dynamics of the system and d w f η υ describes the synthetic uncertainties to ensure the analyzability one assumption is made as follows assumption 1 xu et al 2019 the disturbances and their first order derivatives are bounded such that d w b d w and d w b d w always hold for two positive constants of b d w and b d w the control objective of this paper can be concluded as follows for a smooth reference signal η d design an etc scheme with the event triggered access to η and υ as well as the event triggered estimates of f η υ and d w in the controller such that η can asymptotically converge to the neighborhood of η d 2 2 esn approximation and inequalities the esn is an effective tool to learn the complex dynamics which can include both the jump and slow time varying components compared with the sigmoid networks it is more accurate to approximate a multiple inputs multiple outputs mimo system an esn is comprised of three layers namely the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer the hidden layer is described as a dynamic reservoir with the sparsely and randomly interconnected neurons with the l u dimensional input u and the l y dimensional output y the esn with a leaky integrator can be rewritten as 3 x c λ x f w u u w x x y w t x where x r l x denotes the vector of reservoir states c 0 and λ 0 are the time constant and the leaky rate respectively f denotes the l x dimensional activation function sigmoid type or gauss type w u r l x l u w x r l x l x and w r l x l y are weight matrices as the activation function f is bounded it is clear that x b x holds where b x is a positive constant in this paper w x and w u are preset before the learning the approximation ability of the esn can be written as the following lemma lemma 1 deng et al 2020c for any real continuous function f u r l u r l y defined in the compact set of u ω u r l u there is always the equation satisfying f u w t x ε where ε r l y is the vector of esn construction errors satisfying ε b ε and b ε can be an arbitrarily small positive constant the optimal weight matrix of w is determined as w arg min w ˆ r l x l y sup u ω u f u w ˆ t x to facilitate the analysis some important inequalities are presented as eq 4 by using the matrix knowledge 4 tr a t b tr b t a 2 tr a t b tr a t a tr b t b tr a t c a λ m a x c tr a t a λ m a x φ φ t n φ max φ 2 where a b and c are matrices λ m a x denotes the maximum eigenvalue φ is a vector n φ is the length of φ and φ denotes the absolute value of each element of φ 2 3 jumps of virtual control laws the problem of jumps of virtual control laws was formalized as follows considering the generalized n th order nonlinear strict feedback in xu et al 2019 the virtual control law in i th step preserved the form of α i h i ξ i t by using the continuous backstepping method where i 1 n 1 h i is a smooth function and ξ i ξ 1 ξ i t denotes the vector of states the reader can refer to xu et al 2019 for more model details let u c t h n ξ n t denote the continuous control signal in the last step of control in this subsection we reform the control laws therein by using the etc if the etc functions in the controller to actuator channel the real control law u a t equates to u c t j in the flow time of t t j t j 1 denote the tracking error as z i ξ i α i 1 for i 2 n denote the jumps of concerned variables at t j as δ ξ i ξ i t j ξ i t j δ α i α i t j α i t j and δ z i z i t j z i t j because δ ξ i 0 and δ α i 0 it is inferred that δ z i 0 if the etc functions in the measurement network namely the sensor to controller channel things are totally different in the flow time of t t j t j 1 it has α i t α i t j h i ξ i t j t j at the triggering instant of t j it infers that α i t j h i ξ i t j 1 t j 1 because ξ i t j ξ i t j 1 it is clear that α i t j α i t j then the formulaic definition of the problem of jumps of virtual control laws is given as definition 1 for the backstepping based etc of the nonlinear system in the measurement network the problem of jumps of virtual control laws implies δ α i 0 at the triggering instant as δ ξ i 0 holds it infers that δ z i 0 3 control design the framework of the proposed mbetc scheme is illuminated in fig 1 the dynamic reservoir is deemed to be co located with the sensor while the update laws and the adaptive model are deemed to be co located with the controller while the triggering condition is violated the switch is closed such that the states measured from the sensor and calculated in the dynamic reservoir will be transmitted to the zoh the values in the zoh will be overwritten by the new measured states and the new derived w ˆ and σ ˆ while the triggering condition is satisfied the switch is open this setup is easy to be achieved in practice the procedure of the control design is divided into three steps in this section 3 1 adaptive model according to lemma 1 the unknown dynamics in eq 2 can be expressed as f η υ w t x ε as neither ε nor b ε can be exactly known we cannot distinguish ε from d w in eq 2 the vector of compound disturbances is constructed as σ ε d w and eq 2 can be rewritten as υ d σ w t x the objective of compound learning rests with the identifications of w and σ denote the estimates of w and σ as w ˆ and σ ˆ respectively according to the model of the asv in eq 1 the adaptive model during the inter event time of t t j t j 1 is designed as 5 η ˆ j ψ t j υ ˆ k η η t j η ˆ υ ˆ d σ ˆ w ˆ t x t j k υ υ t j υ ˆ where k η r 3 3 and k υ r 3 3 are tuning parameter matrices to be designed later it should be noted that the adaptive model of eq 5 are reset at the triggering instant in which the states of η ˆ and υ ˆ keep continuous but in the right side of equal signs η t j x t j and υ t j are renewed then define η η η ˆ and υ υ υ ˆ by subtracting eq 5 from eq 1 the error system in t t j t j 1 is obtained as 6 η j ψ υ j ψ t j υ ˆ k η η t j η ˆ υ σ w t x w ˆ t x x t j k υ υ t j υ ˆ denote the sample errors as e η η t j η and e υ υ t j υ eq 6 can be further written as 7 η j ψ j ψ t j υ j ψ t j υ k η η k η e η υ σ w t x w ˆ t x x t j k υ υ k υ e υ 3 2 control laws denote the tracking error as η e η η d by invoking eq 1 and using the backstepping method the virtual control law is first designed as 8 α υ j t ψ ˆ k 1 η ˆ η d η d where k 1 r 3 3 is the tuning parameter matrix to be designed later remark 1 it is clear that all of the components in the virtual control law of eq 8 are continuous by using the adaptive model of eq 5 according to definition 1 the problem of jumps of virtual control laws is successfully circumvented in the proposed scheme in contrast the event sampled states were incorporated in the virtual control laws of deng et al 2020b szanto et al 2018 and li and yang 2018b a in which this problem must be considered failure to do so may lead to the instability and the illogical analysis in view of the differentiation of eq 8 the dynamic surface filter is employed to generate a substitute and avoid the problem of complexity explosion the filter is described as 9 c β β υ β υ α υ where c β is a time constant define q υ β υ α υ it has β υ q υ c β denote the tracking error as υ e υ β υ it has υ υ e q υ α υ differentiate η e along eq 1 it yields 10 η e j ψ ˆ α υ j ψ ˆ υ e j ψ ˆ q υ b η η d where b η j ψ j ψ ˆ υ by substituting eqs 8 to 10 it yields 11 η e k 1 η e k 1 η j ψ ˆ υ e j ψ ˆ q υ b η then by invoking eq 2 and using the backstepping method the actual control law is designed as 12 d k 2 υ ˆ β υ σ ˆ w ˆ t x t j j t ψ ˆ η ˆ η d β υ where k 2 r 3 3 is the tuning parameter matrix to be designed later differentiate υ e along eq 2 it has 13 υ e d σ w t x β υ by substituting eq 12 to eq 13 it renders 14 υ e k 2 υ e k 2 υ σ w t x w ˆ t x x t j j t ψ ˆ η e j t ψ ˆ η 3 3 event triggered compound learning according to the framework in fig 1 w ˆ and σ ˆ are only updated at the triggering instant the data collected in the inter event time can be used to update their values one online recorded data based prediction error at the triggering instant t j is designed as 15 s t j t j 1 t j υ w ˆ t x w ˆ t x t j 1 k υ υ t j 1 k υ υ ˆ σ ˆ dt υ t j υ t j 1 w ˆ t j 1 t ϕ t j w ˆ t j 1 t x t j 1 t j t j 1 k υ υ t j 1 t j t j 1 t j 1 t j σ ˆ k υ υ ˆ dt where ϕ t j t j 1 t j x dt it can be observed from eq 15 that all the required information is available at the triggering instant t j according to eq 6 it is known that 16 s t j t j 1 t j w t x σ dt w t ϕ t j ζ t j where ζ t j t j 1 t j σ dt it is inferred from eq 16 that the compound disturbances interfere in the identification of w according to gradient descent algorithm and eq 16 the update law of w ˆ is designed as 17 w ˆ t j l 1 w ˆ t j γ 1 ϕ t j s t t j t t j w ˆ w ˆ t j t t j t j 1 where l 1 w ˆ t j is the term to prevent w ˆ from parameter drift l 1 will be designed later and γ 1 0 represents the learning rate another prediction error to identify σ is designed as 18 z t j t j 1 t j υ d σ ˆ w ˆ t x dt υ t j υ t j 1 t j 1 t j d dt σ ˆ t j 1 t j t j 1 w ˆ t j 1 t ϕ t j where all the required information in eq 18 is available at the triggering instant according to eq 2 it is known that 19 z t j t j 1 t j σ w t x dt ζ t j σ ˆ t j 1 t j t j 1 w t ϕ it is inferred from eq 19 that the approximation errors of the esn interfere in the identification of σ according to the gradient descent algorithm and eq 19 the update law of σ ˆ is designed as 20 σ ˆ t j l 2 γ 2 t j t j 1 σ ˆ t j γ 2 z t j t t j σ ˆ σ ˆ t j t t j t j 1 where l 2 σ ˆ t j is the term to prevent the parameter drift of σ ˆ l 2 will be designed later and γ 2 0 represents the learning rate the event triggered update laws of eqs 17 and 20 can guarantee the boundedness of w and σ all along moreover the identification accuracy of w ˆ t x σ ˆ to f η υ d w depends on the length of inter event time the two facts will be proved in the appendix 4 triggering condition and stability analysis 4 1 triggering condition the triggering condition is designed to ensure the sguub of all the errors in the closed loop system select the lyapunov function as v 1 η t η 2 υ t υ 2 by differentiating v 1

select the lyapunov function as v v 1 v 2 by adding eqs 21 and 22 together the differential of v is obtained as 23 v η t k η 2 i 1 2 k 1 t k 1 η υ t k υ 1 2 k 2 t k 2 5 2 i υ η e t k 1 i ξ 2 b η b η t

a positive constant threshold it can be inferred that the left side of eq 24 equates to zero at t j and the next triggering instant t j 1 is determined while eq 24 is violated 4 2 stability analysis the main result of this paper is concluded as the following theorem theorem 1 assume all the states of the asv described by eq 1 are defined in a compact set namely ω s η υ η t η υ t υ b ω s where b ω s is a positive constant if the control law of eq 12 the update laws of eqs 17 and 20 as well as the triggering condition of eq 24 are employed all the tracking errors in the closed loop system are ensured to be sguub with the well tuned parameters the tracking errors can be stabilized to arbitrarily small values it means that η will converge to η d proof because all the states are defined in a compact set it is known that b η and α υ are bounded define the α υ 2 2 b α υ as is analyzed in the appendix it is known that σ 2 b σ and tr w t w b w hold all along the control process where b σ and b w are two constants according to the etc the inequality of eq 24 holds all along if we select k 1 i ξ b η b η t 2 0 k 2 5 i 2 0 0 c β 1 k η 2 i k 1 t k 1 2 0 and k υ k 2 t k 2 2 5 i 2 0 and substitute eqs 24 to 23 23 can be further simplified as 25 v a v b where a 2 min λ m i n k 1 i ξ b η b η t 2 λ m i n k 2 5 i 2 1 c β 1 λ m i n k η 2 i k 1 t k 1 2 λ m i n k υ k 2 t k 2 2 5 i 2 and λ m i n denotes the minimum eigenvalue b 1 2 ξ b α υ b σ n 3 b w μ it can inferred from eq 25 that 26 η e v 2 v v t 0 b a e t t 0 b a thus all the tracking errors are ensured to be sguub by increasing a η e can be stabilized to an arbitrarily small value the proof is completed remark 2 by increasing the eigenvalues of k η k υ k 1 k 2 and decreasing c β the convergence rate of v will be increased and the attractor of b a will be smaller whereas the inter event time will be shorten according to eq 24 according to the definition of b and eq 24 the larger μ will lead to the longer inter event time but the larger b a the larger γ 1 and γ 2 in eqs 17 and 20 will increase the learning rates of the update laws but impair the convergence of them at the same time the smaller l 1 and l 2 will prevent the update laws from drifting but decrease the identification accuracy the selection of all the parameters should conform to the actual needs of the control performance remark 3 different from deng et al 2019a b jiao and wang 2016a b wang et al 2020b li and yang 2018b and deng et al 2020b the proposed scheme does not need to set a dead zone operator or add an extra threshold in the triggering condition to prevent the accumulation of triggering instants namely zeno behavior because all the states are defined in a compact set it can be inferred from eq 1 that η and υ are bounded that means the growth rate of the left side of eq 24 is also bounded as the left side of eq 24 equates to zero at t j a specific period of time must be taken for it to increase from 0 to μ such that the zeno behavior is circumvented 5 simulation the simulation is based on the numerical calculation in the platform of matlab the 1 70 scaled replica of a supply ship called cybership ii is selected to be the experimental objective in this section which possesses the mass of 23 8 kg the length of 1 25 m and the breadth of 0 29 m this model has been widely used for algorithm validation in deng et al 2020b and qin et al 2020b a and the references therein with no repetition please refer to qin et al 2020b for the detailed hydrodynamics of eq 1 in our previous research of deng et al 2020a the simulated sea environment was established by using the wave and wind spectrums which caused the heavy computational burden this simulation adopts an easier way in which the second order markov process is employed to describe the disturbances in a normal sea state seeing eq 27 27 d w d w d w 0 2 ω where ω r 3 is a vector of gauss white noise variables independent of each other and with the variance of 1 as τ w m d w the evolution of disturbances in 200 s is presented in fig 2 it is observed that the curves of disturbances are similar with those generated in the simulated sea environment such that the fidelity is ensured besides assumption 1 is satisfied the reference signal of η d is set to be a sinusoid like trajectory generated by the following ideal kinematics in 200 s 28 x d u d cos ψ d y d u d sin ψ d ψ d r d u d 1 m s r d 0 1 sin 0 1 t rad s where the initial value of η d is set as 0 m 0 m 32 7 t the initial value of η in eq 1 is set as 5 m 5 m 90 t all the initial values of the other variables are set to be zeros the proposed event triggered compound learning scheme is abbreviated to et cl in the simulation two extra algorithms are set to be compared with the proposed scheme the time triggered compound learning scheme in xu et al 2019 is abbreviated to tt cl it should be noted that this algorithm is originally proposed for continuous systems to adapt to the numerical calculation it is incarnated in the time triggered form with the constant sampling period of 0 1s in this simulation in tt cl the compound learning is achieved through the update law for w using the online recorded data collected in 1s and a do to estimate σ which are designed as 29 w ˆ γ 1 ϕ t s t t l 1 w ˆ σ ˆ l 2 υ δ δ d w ˆ t x t σ ˆ where δ is an auxiliary variable the predictor based composite learning scheme in liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 and guo et al 2019 is adapted to the event triggered form and is abbreviated to et pl in this simulation from eq 7 it is known that the adaptive model of eq 5 works in the same way with the predictor or the so called serial parallel model because the online recorded data are not used the compound disturbance of σ cannot be estimated in this algorithm here the update law for w is reedited to 30 w ˆ t j l 1 w ˆ t j γ 1 ϕ t j υ t t j t t j w ˆ w ˆ t j t t j t j 1 uniformly used in the three schemes the tuning parameters are chosen as k 1 diag 0 5 0 5 0 5 k 2 diag 0 1 0 1 0 1 k η k υ diag 1 1 1 c β 0 1 l 1 l 2 0 1 γ 1 γ 2 0 2 and μ 0 2 the parameters of the esn is selected as c γ 1 w u 1 7 6 and w x 1 7 7 where 1 a b denotes the matrix composed of a b elements of 1 the activation function of f is selected as the gauss type where the centers are evenly distributed in 3 3 and the width is 10 then the results are obtained as follows the tracking trajectories of the asv with the three schemes in 200 s are shown in fig 3 although all the trajectories of the asv under three schemes can converge to the reference one it is clear that the tt cl has better tracking precision than the other two this is comprehensible as the tt cl can use the real time information fig 4 shows the evolution of control inputs the overshoot occurs at the initial stage due to the large η e although the control inputs of the three schemes have the similar varying trends the event triggered schemes have more obvious chattering due to the renewal of eq 12 at the triggering instants figs 5 7 demonstrate the learning performance of the threeschemes here the synthetic uncertainty is expressed as ϒ ϒ i denotes the i th row of it ϒ ˆ denotes the estimation of it and f ˆ denotes the w ˆ t x it is clear the tt cl in fig 5 has the best learning performance and the et cl in fig 7 has a satisfactory event triggered learning performance whereas the et pl in fig 6 fails to estimate ϒ as it cannot address the compound disturbance of σ and only employ the event triggered information fig 8 shows the update laws of w ˆ and σ ˆ they evolve in a event triggered manner and keep bounded all along following xu et al 2019 four indexes are fabricated to quantify the tracking and learning performance and they are 31 j e iae t 0 t η e dϱ j e itae t 0 t ϱ η e dϱ j c iae t 0 t w t x σ dϱ j c itae t 0 t ϱ w t x σ dϱ the values of these indexes are provided in table 1 and their evolution is shown in fig 9 it is obvious that the tt cl and et cl have slower growth and smaller values of these indexes than the et pl that means the improved tracking and learning performance are obtained through the compound learning compared with the tradictional predictor based learning fig 10 illustrates the accumulation of sampling times it is observed that the et cl and the et pl have the significant saving of communication resources than the tt cl their total sampling times are provided in table 1 it is found that the etc schemes only require nearly 10 communication sources of time triggered one fig 11 reveals the variance inside the triggering condition along time for et cl the left side of less than sign in eq 24 is marked as p t it is shown in fig 11 that p t will never go beyond the threshold of μ fig 12 shows the evolution of inter event time in et cl it is found that the longest inter event time is 2 s and the shortest one is the time triggered period of 0 1 s 6 conclusion this paper proposes a mbetc scheme for the tracking of the asvs the event triggered compound learning is developed to offset the synthetic uncertainties including the unknown dynamics and the environmental disturbances an adaptive model renewed by the event triggered data is established at first and the control laws are derived later by using the continuous states generated in the adaptive model this setup can successfully solve the problem of jumps of virtual controls arising in the backstepping based etc in the measurement network seeing definition 1 for the compound learning two novel prediction errors are constructed and involved in the update laws by using the online recorded data collected during the inter event time the estimates of the esn weights and the compound disturbances are updated at the triggering instants and held by the zoh during the inter event time the simulation validates the improved tracking and learning performance of the proposed event triggered compound learning scheme compared with

grows at the fastest rate during the inter event time such that v c t j v c t v c t j 1 always holds in t t j t j 1 thus we can conclude that v c keeps bounded all along and is sguub by max b c a c b σ t m a x a c b c a c 1 b σ 2 t m a x 2 2 a c 2 in the entire time domain the proof is completed it can be observed that the larger t m a x will make a c smaller and b c larger thus a long inter event

20839,this paper investigates the tracking control of the autonomous surface vessels asvs with the time varying disturbances while the echo state network esn accounts for the unknown dynamics in the model a model based event triggered control mbetc scheme is presented by using the compound learning technique which combines the learning of the esn and the estimation of the compound disturbance different from the existing compound learning the proposed scheme updates the estimates of the esn weights and the compound disturbances in an event triggered manner in which two novel prediction errors are involved in their update laws the values of prediction errors are obtained by using the online recorded data during the inter event time to solve the recently proposed problem of jumps of virtual control laws arising in the backstepping based event triggered control etc an event triggered adaptive model is established to generate the continuous estimates of the states and direct the control laws by the merit of etc the proposed scheme can importantly reduce the communication traffic in the measurement network compared with its continuous substitutes by the merit of online recorded data based compound learning the proposed scheme can achieve the good understanding of synthetic uncertainties all the errors in the closed loop system are proved to be semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sguub finally a numerical example corroborates the proposed scheme keywords model based event triggered control mbetc compound learning autonomous surface vessels 1 introduction intelligence and practicality are two perennial and attractive issues in the fields of control theory and application this trend was also apparent in the control of the asvs in recent years especially the solutions to some complex control problems in the generic nonlinear systems have been successfully extended to the asvs not to make an exhaustive survey the reader can find the application of the anti windup algorithms in shen et al 2020 and deng et al 2020a 2019a b the barrier lyapunov functions to ensure the state constraints in wang et al 2020a and qin et al 2020a b the prescribed performance control in li et al 2020a the reinforcement learning to achieve the optimal control performance in zheng et al 2020 the extended state observer to achieve the state recovery in liu et al 2019 2020 and so on nevertheless not all the control technologies can be easily incorporated into the asvs this is because of the different model structures between the asv and the generic nonlinear system which motivates the work in this paper conversely the implication of the proposed scheme in the generic nonlinear systems is worthy of attention as all the devices in an asv and their interactions compose a network a versatile and informative control scheme will lead to the network congestion in the context of customary time triggered signal sampling due to the limited bandwidth the network congestion will induce the undesired behaviors like packet dropouts disorder and delays wang et al 2020b which further deteriorates the control performance of the asv and even causes the instability the etc is deemed as a powerful tool to overcome the shortage of network congestion in which the signal sampling intermittently occurs at the certain situation recently plenty of researches were published towards the etc in diverse nonlinear systems such as the strict feedback system in wang et al 2020b c su et al 2019 cao et al 2018 sun et al 2020 szanto et al 2018 and li and yang 2018b the pure feedback system in li and yang 2018a the affine system in guo et al 2020b and narayanan et al 2019 the canonical system in wang et al 2019 while reviewing these literature the author found it a challenging issue to combine the well known backstepping method with the etc although this goal was achieved in wang et al 2020c su et al 2019 cao et al 2018 and sun et al 2020 the etc therein only functioned in the controller to actuator channel nevertheless the network congestion happens not only in the controller to actuator channel but also in the sensor to controller channel in a more terminological way the sensor to controller channel is reexpressed as the measurement network hereafter usually when the etc functions in the measurement network the saving of communication load is more remarkable nevertheless in the traditional backstepping design framework the renewal of states from the sensors will precipitate the virtual control laws into a sudden jump at the triggering instant and iteratively affect their values as the tracking errors between the states and the virtual control laws are involved in the stability analysis the jumps will affect the logicality of the control scheme this problem was first put forward as jumps of virtual control laws in deng et al 2020b and the formulaic definition will be given in section 2 although szanto et al 2018 and li and yang 2018b a fabricated the backstepping based event triggered controller in the measurement network this problem was not considered and the virtual control laws were deemed to be continuous therein as far as we know wang et al 2020b can solve the problem of jumps of virtual control laws by fabricating the virtual control laws ideally independent of the event triggered sampled states nevertheless it finally deduced a neural network nn based controller in which the control performance totally relied on the approximation performance of one nn as the direct adaptive control was used in the learning of the nn this controller may be not practical in our previous work of deng et al 2020b and deng and zhang 2020 the smooth substitutes were generated by the dynamic surface filters to replace the discontinuous virtual control laws this setup can solve the problem of jumps of virtual control laws but led to the difficulty in the parameter selection and the complexity in the stability proof to the author s knowledge there is no other report on solving the problem of jumps of virtual control laws as a result most of the etc of the asv only addressed the controller to actuator channel such as deng et al 2019a b li et al 2020b and jiao and wang 2016a b in liu et al 2020 an observer based etc for the asv is proposed which achieved the event triggered state sampling in the measurement network not limited in deng et al 2020b and deng and zhang 2020 the backstepping based etc of the asv in the measurement network is an open question another concern of this paper rests with the disposal of unknown dynamics and disturbances the approximators such as the nns wang and wang 2015 dai et al 2014 deng et al 2020c and the fuzzy logic systems flss tong et al 2016 2020 were widely used to approximate the unknown dynamics in the system which significantly increased the algorithmic flexibility nevertheless most of these researches used the tracking errors to update the approximator which led to the convergence of tracking errors but lost the interpretability of approximation xu et al 2014 recently the composite learning technique provided a solution to this question which can reconcile the tracking performance with the approximation precision the main difficulty of the composite learning consists in how to construct the prediction errors involved in the update of the approximator in xu et al 2014 pan et al 2013 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2017 and li et al 2016 the serial parallel models also the so called predictors were constructed to generate prediction errors nevertheless these traditional predictors relied heavily on the persistent excitation pe condition to realize the parameter convergence to release such a constraint pan et al 2016 pan and yu 2018 guo et al 2020a and xu et al 2018 developed the novel prediction errors by using the online recorded data such that only the weaker excitation condition termed interval excitation ie was required although the above researches of composite learning were devoted to guaranteeing the approximation precision of the unknown dynamics there left a problem on how to distinguish the unknown dynamics and the disturbances from each other that means the approximation performance will be degraded if the disturbances are not properly addressed xu et al 2019 to solve this problem it is called the compound learning to identify the disturbances and the unknown dynamics separately xu et al 2017 and xu 2018 integrated the disturbance observers dos with the serial parallel model based composite learning whereas xu et al 2019 integrated the dos with the online recorded data based composite learning moreover xu et al 2019 reached a meritorious conclusion that neither the approximator nor the do can accurately estimate their counterparts in the context of compound learning whereas the sum of them can accurately estimate the synthetic uncertainty in view of the control of the asvs there are no researches towards the compound learning at present as far as we know only liu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and deng and zhang 2020 employed the predictor based composite learning while reviewing these literature the author found that almost all of the composite learning was conducted in the continuous system if it is combined with the etc in the measurement network the learning of the approximator can only access the sensor signals in an event triggered manner as the previous continuous researches cannot be easily adapted how to design the event triggered composite or compound learning is left to be solved motivated by the above challenges this paper proposes a mbetc scheme for the trajectory tracking of the asv and the event triggered compound learning is designed for the identification of uncertainties an adaptive model was established at first which involves the esn the estimates of the compound disturbances and the event triggered samples an adaptive triggering condition is designed to guarantee the similarity between the adaptive model and the original model based on the adaptive model the backstepping based etc laws are derived the dynamic surface filters are employed to avoid the problem of complexity explosion for the compound learning the prediction errors are derived from both the adaptive model and the original model the online recorded data collected during the inter event time are employed to update the prediction errors at the triggering instant such that the estimates of the esn weights and the compound disturbances directed by the prediction errors are only renewed at the triggering instant and these estimates are kept by the zero order holders zohs during the inter event time in the premise of the bounded estimation errors the sguub of all the tracking errors are ensured the contributions of this work are mainly threefold 1 by the merit of the mbetc the communication load in the measurement network is largely reduced compared with the existing etc of the asvs by the merit of compound learning the better tracking performance is ensured compared with the tracking error based learning schemes of the asvs 2 by resorting to the adaptive model the virtual control laws are designed in a continuous way such that the problem of jumps of virtual control laws is circumvented without the complex analysis and parameter selection 3 this paper develops an event triggered compound learning technique which combines the compound learning with the etc by using the online recorded data during the inter event time this technique ensures the good learning performance to the synthetic uncertainties the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the preliminaries towards the model of the asv the esn some necessary inequalities and the definition of the problem of jumps of virtual control laws are introduced in section 3 the control design is carried out section 4 designs the triggering condition and analyzes the stability of the closed loop system in section 5 the simulations are conducted to substantiate the control scheme section 6 concludes the entire work appendix

right side denotes the euclidean norm of the vector tr denotes the trace of the square matrix 2 preliminaries 2 1 mathematical model according to qin et al 2020a b and jiao and wang 2016b the motions of an asv can be described by the following differential equations with 3 degrees of freedom in two frames 1 η j ψ υ m υ c υ υ d υ υ g η τ τ w where η x y ψ t includes the positional coordinates x y and the heading angle ψ in the earth frame υ u v r t includes the surge speed u the sway speed v and the yaw rate r in the body frame j ψ denotes the transformation matrix with the following structure j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 m r 3 3 denotes the known nonsingular inertia matrix procured from empirical equations c υ r 3 3 denotes the unknown centripetal and coriolis matrix d υ r 3 3

u w τ v w τ r w t denotes the vector of the external disturbances generated by waves and winds for simplicity let d m 1 τ and d w m 1 τ w then the lower equation of eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 υ d d w f η υ where f η υ m 1 c υ υ d υ υ g η describes the unknown dynamics of the system and d w f η υ describes the synthetic uncertainties to ensure the analyzability one assumption is made as follows assumption 1 xu et al 2019 the disturbances and their first order derivatives are bounded such that d w b d w and d w b d w always hold for two positive constants of b d w and b d w the control objective of this paper can be concluded as follows for a smooth reference signal η d design an etc scheme with the event triggered access to η and υ as well as the event triggered estimates of f η υ and d w in the controller such that η can asymptotically converge to the neighborhood of η d 2 2 esn approximation and inequalities the esn is an effective tool to learn the complex dynamics which can include both the jump and slow time varying components compared with the sigmoid networks it is more accurate to approximate a multiple inputs multiple outputs mimo system an esn is comprised of three layers namely the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer the hidden layer is described as a dynamic reservoir with the sparsely and randomly interconnected neurons with the l u dimensional input u and the l y dimensional output y the esn with a leaky integrator can be rewritten as 3 x c λ x f w u u w x x y w t x where x r l x denotes the vector of reservoir states c 0 and λ 0 are the time constant and the leaky rate respectively f denotes the l x dimensional activation function sigmoid type or gauss type w u r l x l u w x r l x l x and w r l x l y are weight matrices as the activation function f is bounded it is clear that x b x holds where b x is a positive constant in this paper w x and w u are preset before the learning the approximation ability of the esn can be written as the following lemma lemma 1 deng et al 2020c for any real continuous function f u r l u r l y defined in the compact set of u ω u r l u there is always the equation satisfying f u w t x ε where ε r l y is the vector of esn construction errors satisfying ε b ε and b ε can be an arbitrarily small positive constant the optimal weight matrix of w is determined as w arg min w ˆ r l x l y sup u ω u f u w ˆ t x to facilitate the analysis some important inequalities are presented as eq 4 by using the matrix knowledge 4 tr a t b tr b t a 2 tr a t b tr a t a tr b t b tr a t c a λ m a x c tr a t a λ m a x φ φ t n φ max φ 2 where a b and c are matrices λ m a x denotes the maximum eigenvalue φ is a vector n φ is the length of φ and φ denotes the absolute value of each element of φ 2 3 jumps of virtual control laws the problem of jumps of virtual control laws was formalized as follows considering the generalized n th order nonlinear strict feedback in xu et al 2019 the virtual control law in i th step preserved the form of α i h i ξ i t by using the continuous backstepping method where i 1 n 1 h i is a smooth function and ξ i ξ 1 ξ i t denotes the vector of states the reader can refer to xu et al 2019 for more model details let u c t h n ξ n t denote the continuous control signal in the last step of control in this subsection we reform the control laws therein by using the etc if the etc functions in the controller to actuator channel the real control law u a t equates to u c t j in the flow time of t t j t j 1 denote the tracking error as z i ξ i α i 1 for i 2 n denote the jumps of concerned variables at t j as δ ξ i ξ i t j ξ i t j δ α i α i t j α i t j and δ z i z i t j z i t j because δ ξ i 0 and δ α i 0 it is inferred that δ z i 0 if the etc functions in the measurement network namely the sensor to controller channel things are totally different in the flow time of t t j t j 1 it has α i t α i t j h i ξ i t j t j at the triggering instant of t j it infers that α i t j h i ξ i t j 1 t j 1 because ξ i t j ξ i t j 1 it is clear that α i t j α i t j then the formulaic definition of the problem of jumps of virtual control laws is given as definition 1 for the backstepping based etc of the nonlinear system in the measurement network the problem of jumps of virtual control laws implies δ α i 0 at the triggering instant as δ ξ i 0 holds it infers that δ z i 0 3 control design the framework of the proposed mbetc scheme is illuminated in fig 1 the dynamic reservoir is deemed to be co located with the sensor while the update laws and the adaptive model are deemed to be co located with the controller while the triggering condition is violated the switch is closed such that the states measured from the sensor and calculated in the dynamic reservoir will be transmitted to the zoh the values in the zoh will be overwritten by the new measured states and the new derived w ˆ and σ ˆ while the triggering condition is satisfied the switch is open this setup is easy to be achieved in practice the procedure of the control design is divided into three steps in this section 3 1 adaptive model according to lemma 1 the unknown dynamics in eq 2 can be expressed as f η υ w t x ε as neither ε nor b ε can be exactly known we cannot distinguish ε from d w in eq 2 the vector of compound disturbances is constructed as σ ε d w and eq 2 can be rewritten as υ d σ w t x the objective of compound learning rests with the identifications of w and σ denote the estimates of w and σ as w ˆ and σ ˆ respectively according to the model of the asv in eq 1 the adaptive model during the inter event time of t t j t j 1 is designed as 5 η ˆ j ψ t j υ ˆ k η η t j η ˆ υ ˆ d σ ˆ w ˆ t x t j k υ υ t j υ ˆ where k η r 3 3 and k υ r 3 3 are tuning parameter matrices to be designed later it should be noted that the adaptive model of eq 5 are reset at the triggering instant in which the states of η ˆ and υ ˆ keep continuous but in the right side of equal signs η t j x t j and υ t j are renewed then define η η η ˆ and υ υ υ ˆ by subtracting eq 5 from eq 1 the error system in t t j t j 1 is obtained as 6 η j ψ υ j ψ t j υ ˆ k η η t j η ˆ υ σ w t x w ˆ t x x t j k υ υ t j υ ˆ denote the sample errors as e η η t j η and e υ υ t j υ eq 6 can be further written as 7 η j ψ j ψ t j υ j ψ t j υ k η η k η e η υ σ w t x w ˆ t x x t j k υ υ k υ e υ 3 2 control laws denote the tracking error as η e η η d by invoking eq 1 and using the backstepping method the virtual control law is first designed as 8 α υ j t ψ ˆ k 1 η ˆ η d η d where k 1 r 3 3 is the tuning parameter matrix to be designed later remark 1 it is clear that all of the components in the virtual control law of eq 8 are continuous by using the adaptive model of eq 5 according to definition 1 the problem of jumps of virtual control laws is successfully circumvented in the proposed scheme in contrast the event sampled states were incorporated in the virtual control laws of deng et al 2020b szanto et al 2018 and li and yang 2018b a in which this problem must be considered failure to do so may lead to the instability and the illogical analysis in view of the differentiation of eq 8 the dynamic surface filter is employed to generate a substitute and avoid the problem of complexity explosion the filter is described as 9 c β β υ β υ α υ where c β is a time constant define q υ β υ α υ it has β υ q υ c β denote the tracking error as υ e υ β υ it has υ υ e q υ α υ differentiate η e along eq 1 it yields 10 η e j ψ ˆ α υ j ψ ˆ υ e j ψ ˆ q υ b η η d where b η j ψ j ψ ˆ υ by substituting eqs 8 to 10 it yields 11 η e k 1 η e k 1 η j ψ ˆ υ e j ψ ˆ q υ b η then by invoking eq 2 and using the backstepping method the actual control law is designed as 12 d k 2 υ ˆ β υ σ ˆ w ˆ t x t j j t ψ ˆ η ˆ η d β υ where k 2 r 3 3 is the tuning parameter matrix to be designed later differentiate υ e along eq 2 it has 13 υ e d σ w t x β υ by substituting eq 12 to eq 13 it renders 14 υ e k 2 υ e k 2 υ σ w t x w ˆ t x x t j j t ψ ˆ η e j t ψ ˆ η 3 3 event triggered compound learning according to the framework in fig 1 w ˆ and σ ˆ are only updated at the triggering instant the data collected in the inter event time can be used to update their values one online recorded data based prediction error at the triggering instant t j is designed as 15 s t j t j 1 t j υ w ˆ t x w ˆ t x t j 1 k υ υ t j 1 k υ υ ˆ σ ˆ dt υ t j υ t j 1 w ˆ t j 1 t ϕ t j w ˆ t j 1 t x t j 1 t j t j 1 k υ υ t j 1 t j t j 1 t j 1 t j σ ˆ k υ υ ˆ dt where ϕ t j t j 1 t j x dt it can be observed from eq 15 that all the required information is available at the triggering instant t j according to eq 6 it is known that 16 s t j t j 1 t j w t x σ dt w t ϕ t j ζ t j where ζ t j t j 1 t j σ dt it is inferred from eq 16 that the compound disturbances interfere in the identification of w according to gradient descent algorithm and eq 16 the update law of w ˆ is designed as 17 w ˆ t j l 1 w ˆ t j γ 1 ϕ t j s t t j t t j w ˆ w ˆ t j t t j t j 1 where l 1 w ˆ t j is the term to prevent w ˆ from parameter drift l 1 will be designed later and γ 1 0 represents the learning rate another prediction error to identify σ is

according to eq 2 it is known that 19 z t j t j 1 t j σ w t x dt ζ t j σ ˆ t j 1 t j t j 1 w t ϕ it is inferred from eq 19 that the approximation errors of the esn interfere in the identification of σ

prevent the parameter drift of σ ˆ l 2 will be designed later and γ 2 0 represents the learning rate the event triggered update laws of eqs 17 and 20 can guarantee the boundedness of w and σ all along moreover the identification accuracy of w ˆ t x σ ˆ to f η υ d w depends on the length of inter event time the two facts will be proved in the appendix 4 triggering condition and stability analysis 4

select the lyapunov function as v v 1 v 2 by adding eqs 21 and 22 together the differential of v is obtained as 23 v η t k η 2 i 1 2 k 1 t k 1 η υ t k υ 1 2 k 2 t k 2 5 2 i υ η e t k 1 i ξ 2 b η b η t

a positive constant threshold it can be inferred that the left side of eq 24 equates to zero at t j and the next triggering instant t j 1 is determined while eq 24 is violated 4 2 stability analysis the main result of this paper is concluded as the following theorem theorem 1 assume all the states of the asv described by eq 1 are defined in a compact set namely ω s η υ η t η υ t υ b ω s where b ω s is a positive constant if the control law of eq 12 the update laws of eqs 17 and 20 as well as the triggering condition of eq 24 are employed all the tracking errors in the closed loop system are ensured to be sguub with the well tuned parameters the tracking errors can be stabilized to arbitrarily small values it means that η will converge to η d proof because all the states are defined in a compact set it is known that b η and α υ are bounded define the α υ 2 2 b α υ as is analyzed in the appendix it is known that σ 2 b σ and tr w t w b w hold all along the control process where b σ and b w are two constants according to the etc the inequality of eq 24 holds all along if we select k 1 i ξ b η b η t 2 0 k 2 5 i 2 0 0 c β 1 k η 2 i k 1 t k 1 2 0 and k υ k 2 t k 2 2 5 i 2 0 and substitute eqs 24 to 23 23 can be further simplified as 25 v a v b where a 2 min λ m i n k 1 i ξ b η b η t 2 λ m i n k 2 5 i 2 1 c β 1 λ m i n k η 2 i k 1 t k 1 2 λ m i n k υ k 2 t k 2 2 5 i 2 and λ m i n denotes the minimum eigenvalue b 1 2 ξ b α υ b σ n 3 b w μ it can inferred from eq 25 that 26 η e v 2 v v t 0 b a e t t 0 b a thus all the tracking errors are ensured to be sguub by increasing a η e can be stabilized to an arbitrarily small value the proof is completed remark 2 by increasing the eigenvalues of k η k υ k 1 k 2 and decreasing c β the convergence rate of v will be increased and the attractor of b a will be smaller whereas the inter event time will be shorten according to eq 24 according to the definition of b and eq 24 the larger μ will lead to the longer inter event time but the larger b a the larger γ 1 and γ 2 in eqs 17 and 20 will increase the learning rates of the update laws but impair the convergence of them at the same time the smaller l 1 and l 2 will prevent the update laws from drifting but decrease the identification accuracy the selection of all the parameters should conform to the actual needs of the control performance remark 3 different from deng et al 2019a b jiao and wang 2016a b wang et al 2020b li and yang 2018b and deng et al 2020b the proposed scheme does not need to set a dead zone operator or add an extra threshold in the triggering condition to prevent the accumulation of triggering instants namely zeno behavior because all the states are defined in a compact set it can be inferred from eq 1 that η and υ are bounded that means the growth rate of the left side of eq 24 is also bounded as the left side of eq 24 equates to zero at t j a specific period of time must be taken for it to increase from 0 to μ such that the zeno behavior is circumvented 5 simulation the simulation is based on the numerical calculation in the platform of matlab the 1 70 scaled replica of a supply ship called cybership ii is selected to be the experimental objective in this section which possesses the mass of 23 8 kg the length of 1 25 m and the breadth of 0 29 m this model has been widely used for algorithm validation in deng et al 2020b and qin et al 2020b a and the references therein with no repetition please refer to qin et al 2020b for the detailed hydrodynamics of eq 1 in our previous research of deng et al 2020a the simulated sea environment was established by using the wave and wind spectrums which caused the heavy computational burden this simulation adopts an easier way in which the second order markov process is employed to describe the disturbances in a normal sea state seeing eq 27 27 d w d w d w 0 2 ω where ω r 3 is a vector of gauss white noise variables independent of each other and with the variance of 1 as τ w m d w the evolution of disturbances in 200 s is presented in fig 2 it is observed that the curves of disturbances are similar with those generated in the simulated sea environment such that the fidelity is ensured besides assumption 1 is satisfied the reference signal of η d is set to be a sinusoid like trajectory generated by the following ideal kinematics in 200 s 28 x d u d cos ψ d y d u d sin ψ d ψ d r d u d 1 m s r d 0 1 sin 0 1 t rad s where the initial value of η d is set as 0 m 0 m 32 7 t the initial value of η in eq 1 is set as 5 m 5 m 90 t all the initial values of the other variables are set to be zeros the proposed event triggered compound learning scheme is abbreviated to et cl in the simulation two extra algorithms are set to be compared with the proposed scheme the time triggered compound learning scheme in xu et al 2019 is abbreviated to tt cl it should be noted that this algorithm is originally proposed for continuous systems to adapt to the numerical calculation it is incarnated in the time triggered form with the constant sampling period of 0 1s in this simulation in tt cl the compound learning is achieved through the update law for w using the online recorded data collected in 1s and a do to estimate σ which are designed as 29 w ˆ γ 1 ϕ t s t t l 1 w ˆ σ ˆ l 2 υ δ δ d w ˆ t x t σ ˆ where δ is an auxiliary variable the predictor based composite learning scheme in liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 and guo et al 2019 is adapted to the event triggered form and is abbreviated to et pl in this simulation from eq 7 it is known that the adaptive model of eq 5 works in the same way with the predictor or the so called serial parallel model because the online recorded data are not used the compound disturbance of σ cannot be estimated in this algorithm here the update law for w is reedited to 30 w ˆ t j l 1 w ˆ t j γ 1 ϕ t j υ t t j t t j w ˆ w ˆ t j t t j t j 1 uniformly used in the three schemes the tuning parameters are chosen as k 1 diag 0 5 0 5 0 5 k 2 diag 0 1 0 1 0 1 k η k υ diag 1 1 1 c β 0 1 l 1 l 2 0 1 γ 1 γ 2 0 2 and μ 0 2 the parameters of the esn is selected as c γ 1 w u 1 7 6 and w x 1 7 7 where 1 a b denotes the matrix composed of a b elements of 1 the activation function of f is selected as the gauss type where the centers are evenly distributed in 3 3 and the width is 10 then the results are obtained as follows the tracking trajectories of the asv with the three schemes in 200 s are shown in fig 3 although all the trajectories of the asv under three schemes can converge to the reference one it is clear that the tt cl has better tracking precision than the other two this is comprehensible as the tt cl can use the real time information fig 4 shows the evolution of control inputs the overshoot occurs at the initial stage due to the large η e although the control inputs of the three schemes have the similar varying trends the event triggered schemes have more obvious chattering due to the renewal of eq 12 at the triggering instants figs 5 7 demonstrate the learning performance of the threeschemes here the synthetic uncertainty is expressed as ϒ ϒ i denotes the i th row of it ϒ ˆ denotes the estimation of it and f ˆ denotes the w ˆ t x it is clear the tt cl in fig 5 has the best learning performance and the et cl in fig 7 has a satisfactory event triggered learning performance whereas the et pl in fig 6 fails to estimate ϒ as it cannot address the compound disturbance of σ and only employ the event triggered information fig 8 shows the update laws of w ˆ and σ ˆ they evolve in a event triggered manner and keep bounded all along following xu et al 2019 four indexes are fabricated to quantify the tracking and learning performance and they are 31 j e iae t 0 t η e dϱ j e itae t 0 t ϱ η e dϱ j c iae t 0 t w t x σ dϱ j c itae t 0 t ϱ w t x σ dϱ the values of these indexes are provided in table 1 and their evolution is shown in fig 9 it is obvious that the tt cl and et cl have slower growth and smaller values of these indexes than the et pl that means the improved tracking and learning performance are obtained through the compound learning compared with the tradictional predictor based learning fig 10 illustrates the accumulation of sampling times it is observed that the et cl and the et pl have the significant saving of communication resources than the tt cl their total sampling times are provided in table 1 it is found that the etc schemes only require nearly 10 communication sources of time triggered one fig 11 reveals the variance inside the triggering condition along time for et cl the left side of less than sign in eq 24 is marked as p t it is shown in fig 11 that p t will never go beyond the threshold of μ fig 12 shows the evolution of inter event time in et cl it is found that the longest inter event time is 2 s and the shortest one is the time triggered period of 0 1 s 6 conclusion this paper proposes a mbetc scheme for the tracking of the asvs the event triggered compound learning is developed to offset the synthetic uncertainties including the unknown dynamics and the environmental disturbances an adaptive model renewed by the event triggered data is established at first and the control laws are derived later by using the continuous states generated in the adaptive model this setup can successfully solve the problem of jumps of virtual controls arising in the backstepping based etc in the measurement network seeing definition 1 for the compound learning two novel prediction errors are constructed and involved in the update laws by using the online recorded data collected during the inter event time the estimates of the esn weights and the compound disturbances are updated at the triggering instants and held by the zoh during the inter event time the simulation validates the improved tracking and learning performance of the proposed event triggered compound learning scheme compared with the traditional predictor based learning scheme in the future we will embark on adapting this algorithm to the more generic nonlinear systems such as the strict feedback system and the pure feedback

the length of ϕ select the lyapunov function of σ as v σ σ t σ then by referring to eqs 4 19 and 20 the jump of v σ at the triggering instant t j can be expressed as a 2 δ v σ σ t σ ˆ t j t σ σ ˆ t j

to have the longest value of t m a x it is reasonable that n 1 n 2 and ζ are all bounded and ζ 2 has the upper bound of b ζ 0 the tuning principle of the parameters in the update laws of eqs 17 and 20

eq a 3 can be rewritten as δ v c a c v c b c denote the difference of v c between t j and t j 1 as θ v c v c t j 1 v c t j considering the variance of v c in the inter event time which is induced by the variance of σ it is inferred that θ v c δ v c σ t t j 1 σ t j 1 σ t j t σ t j as d w is bounded and ε can be deemed as a slow time varying component it is tenable to assume that σ b σ where b σ is a positive constant because the variance of σ in t t j t j 1 can be described by σ t σ t j t j t σ dt the following inequality is satisfied a 5 σ t j 1 σ t j b σ t j 1 t j σ t j b σ t m a x it can be inferred from eq a 5 that a 6 σ t t j 1 σ t j 1 σ t j t σ t j σ t j 1 2 σ t j 2 2 σ t j b σ t m a x b σ 2 t m a x 2 2 b σ t m a x v c δ v c b σ 2 t m a x 2 by adding eq a 6 to δ v c one can obtain a interconnected system as a 7 θ v c a c v c 2 b σ t m a x v c δ v c b c b σ 2 t m a x 2 δ v c a c v c b c from the second inequality of eq a 7 it is known that δ v c 0 for v c t j b c a c in this case the first inequality in eq a 7 can be written as θ v c a c v c 2 b σ t m a x v c b c b σ 2 t m a x 2 by solving this inequality it renders θ v c 0 for v c t j b σ t m a x a c b c a c 1 b σ 2 t m a x 2 2 a c 2 synthesizing these two thresholds it finally has θ v c 0 for v c t j max b c a c b σ t m a x a c b c a c 1 b σ 2 t m a x 2 2 a c 2 according to eq a 6 it means that we have already assumed v c grows at the fastest rate during the inter event time such that v c t j v c t v c t j 1 always holds in t t j t j 1 thus we can conclude that v c keeps bounded all along and is sguub by max b c a c b σ t m a x a c b c a c 1 b σ 2 t m a x 2 2 a c 2 in the entire time domain the proof is completed it can be observed that the larger t m a x will make a c smaller and b c larger thus a long inter event time will decrease the learning accuracy and retard the convergence speed of identification
