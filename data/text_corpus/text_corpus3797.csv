materials and methods 2 1 study area and time series data acquisition five north temperate lakes located within the northern highland american legion state forest vilas county north central wisconsin usa were studied including the allequash lake al big muskellunge lake bm crystal lake cr sparking lake sp and trout lake tr as shown in fig 1 with detailed information of five lakes such as the surface area depth and locations etc listed in table 1 these lakes are well monitored by the north temperate lakes long term ecological research ntl lter program surface chlorophyll a concentration of the five lakes was measured biweekly by fluorometer td 700 turner san jose us and the data used in this study was collected from may 1986 to october 2014 https lter limnology wisc edu about overview fig 2 since the long term time series of surface chlorophyll a concentration was not always evenly distributed across the entire time period due to monitoring system maintain we firstly resampled the original biweekly dataset to generate a monthly dataset by using the spline function in matlab software the resampled monthly dataset contains 342 months data of chlorophyll a concentration for each lake and was used as the working database for this study monthly mei values for the same time period of may 1986 october 2014 as the index of climatic oscillation in this study were downloaded from the noaa website https www esrl noaa gov psd enso mei table html fig 2 generally high positive mei values represent strong el niño events i e warm enso phase and high negative mei values represent strong la niña event i e cold enso phase 2 2 time series analysis methods 2 2 1 hilbert huang transformation hht in this study the monthly time series of surface chlorophyll a concentrations for the five ntls and the monthly time series of mei were analyzed by the eemd ht approach individually normally hht consists of two stages empirical mode decomposition emd that divide the original time series into several time series that are independent with each other namely intrinsic mode functions imfs and hilbert transformation ht to generate the hilbert spectrum and marginal spectrum huang et al 1998 1 emd it began with fitting the local maximum and minimum values of original time series by using two cubic splines the difference between the original time series and the mean values of the two cubic splined time series was defined as the first imf if meets the criterion i e standard deviation should be between 0 2 and 0 3 provided by huang et al 1998 otherwise the fitting process was repeated until this criterion was satisfied after the first imf was defined the difference between the original time series and the first imf was used to detect the rest of imfs finally a monotonic time series was left and defined as the residual series specifically instantaneous periods were calculated by instantaneous frequency abnormal values of instantaneous periods were removed by pauta criteria li et al 2016 after that the duncan multiple range test was employed to detect the difference between the various imfs and various time series as an inner comparison by using spss 16 0 software since the emd process would cause the mode mixing problems in many cases wu and huang 2009 the ensemble emd eemd was used instead of emd in this study the modified process was as following 1 add a white noise time series into the original time series 2 apply the emd process to decompose the white noise added time series into imfs 3 repeat the steps 1 2 with different white noise time series added 4 calculate the mean values of all the imfs generated by the above steps which was defined as the final imfs 2 ht it transformed each imfs into an analytical function for constructing the hilbert spectrum which showed the time frequency amplitude energy variance characteristics of original time series in a time frequency domain with a hilbert spectrum the marginal spectrum was calculated as the cumulative amplitude distribution across frequencies statistics of the eemd results of all the 5 chl time series and 1 mei time series were calculated including the time period for each imfs from imf 1 to imf 7 for each time series represented as mean se the variance for each imfs duncan multiple range test was used to detect the difference between these time period of each imfs for cross comparison between the 6 time series and p 0 05 was considered as significant 2 2 2 wavelet analysis wavelet coherence analysis was performed to explore the inter response relationship between the monthly time series of surface chlorophyll a concentration for each of the 5 lakes and the monthly time series of enso mei on matlab software following the methods described in grinsted et al 2004 and cazelles et al 2008 briefly the two original time series were first transformed by morlet wavelet function into time frequency domain where the period variability of the original time series can be detected in various frequencies secondly the two transformed series were cross wavelet transformed to get the cross wavelet spectrum thirdly the coherency wavelet values were calculated in the time frequency domain using the individual wavelet spectrum to normalize the cross wavelet spectrum high coherency value represents for co variation of the two original time series finally in complement to wavelet analysis we used phase analysis to characterize the association between time series the phase difference provided information on the sign of the relationship i e in phase or out of phase the phase was computed based on the imaginary and the real part of the wavelet transform of the time series and the phase difference was based on the imaginary and the real part of the wavelet co spectrum between two time series 2 3 intuitive association analysis local polynomial regression fitting method was employed to fit the annual mean chl in the five ntls against mei values the method took advantages of a moving window that only searched for neighbor data and assigned various weights to the data by considering the distances for fitting the intuitive association analyses were processed on r software 3 results 3 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition for each of the five chl and the enso mei time series fig 2 seven imfs and a residual signal were generated by the eemd method of hht fig 3 the oscillation time periods of the chl and enso time series were calculated with the statistical results of cross comparison shown in table 2 similar patterns were found for the six time series that the frequencies of time series decreased from imf1 to imf7 and residuals were monotonic series all the imfs are oscillating across the whole series due to the larger standard deviation compared to the mean values interestingly based on the duncan multiple range test the imfs of the chlorophyll a concentration of all the five lakes are the same to those of the mei p 0 05 especially for the high frequency imfs the only exceptions are for the lower frequency imfs i e imf 5 and imf 6 of al imf 4 imf 6 of bm etc which are significant different from those of mei p 0 05 the residual components showed the long time trend of original series specifically the residual of mei is monotone decreasing at the rate of 4 5214e 4 month 1 which is coincide to the chl time series of the bm decreasing rate of 0 0024 mg l 1 month 1 sp decreasing rate of 0 0071 mg l 1 month 1 and tr decreasing rate of 0 0012 mg l 1 month 1 however the residuals of the chl time series of al and cr lake are monotone increasing for the same time period which are 0 0065 and 0 0054 mg l 1 month 1 respectively 3 2 hilbert spectra and marginal spectra time frequency energy variance distribution of the chl and enso mei time series for the five ntls were further calculated in the time frequency domain fig 4 for all the 6 time series continuous and stable instantaneous frequencies were distributed in low frequency regions 0 03 cycle month i e larger than 33 months per cycle only few discrete and oscillating instantaneous frequencies located in relatively higher frequency regions 0 03 0 1 cycle month i e 10 33 months per cycle the energy variance concentrated in both frequency regions 0 0 1 cycle month i e larger than 10 months per cycle especially for the mei however some discrete energy points were still detected in the high frequency regions of the spectra 0 1 cycle month i e smaller than 10 months per cycle as a cumulative amplitude distribution the marginal spectra would allow a better visualization about the amplitude energy variance characteristics of the time series fig 4 all marginal spectra showed decreasing trends similar to the results of hilbert huang spectra high energy variance distributions were found at the low frequency region 0 0 03 cycle month i e larger than 33 months per cycle especially for the al tr and mei time series for bm cr and sp lakes peak energy variance also existed at higher frequency regions 3 3 wavelet coherency analysis wavelet coherency spectra showed a strong coherency between enso mei and the chl for the five ntls with a periodicity of 64 month fig 5 the phase of chl and mei exhibited time lag of 22 24 11 15 24 27 23 24 17 18 months for the al bm cr sp tr lakes respectively notably the variation of phase differences between enso mei and the chl time series around the band of 64 months became more and more coherent in recent years for the al bm sp and tr lakes furthermore for these lakes the variation of phase differences experienced a cycle of small large small fig 5 3 4 intuitive association between annual average chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes and mei annual average chlorophyll a concentrations and mei values were calculated for scatter plotting fig 6 although the range of chl seems to be controlled by the phosphorous supplies in these lakes table 1 the enso mei put a severe influence on the chl in addition to the nutrients with the mei value increasing chlorophyll a concentration in the ntls experienced a general trend of decreasing increasing decreasing except for the cr lake the inflection points located around mei value of 0 and 1 respectively specifically the chlorophyll a concentration of cr lake has a trend of increasing decreasing increasing decreasing with the inflection points at mei values of 0 0 5 and 1 respectively interestingly the annual average chlorophyll a concentration in the lakes were relatively low when the positive mei values was high mei values of 1 1 5 which represent strong el niño events in those years and the annual average chlorophyll a concentration tended to be either stable or increase when the negative mei value was high i e mei values 1 which represents strong la niña event comparing to the normal years 4 discussions 4 1 periodicity and synchronization of the chl and mei time series in ntls since the relationship between chlorophyll a concentrations chl and climatic oscillations mei is rather complicated michalak 2016 the state of the art time frequency analysis was employed to explore the periodicity and synchronization between them results confirmed the same significant periodic bands during the same time period and responses of the five northern temperature lakes were almost synchronized for instance the eemd results indicated that the high frequency periods imfs especially for periods around 5 and 13 months band table 2 of ntls exhibited no differences to those of mei showing a significant synchronization of the global climatic oscillations and the chlorophyll a p 0 05 although previous studies documented close correlations between chl and climate oscillation i e pdo nao etc martinez et al 2009 straile and adrian 2000 watanabe et al 2005 to our best knowledge our study is one of the first researches to reveal a clear periodicity and synchronization between them hilbert huang spectra and marginal spectra further showed the similarities of variations in chl and mei continuous and high energy variance fluctuations existed in low frequency region of all the time series with a similar variation pattern fig 4 however the discrete fluctuations existed in high frequency region of the chl in all five lakes but not for mei showing that enso mei cannot fully explain the chlorophyll a variation in lakes a possible explanation could be that algae growth is a complex process not only driven by the climate oscillations but also influenced by lots of other environmental factors i e nutrients etc borsuk et al 2004 interestingly the fluctuations in high frequency region of chl are especially higher in the bm cr and sp lake fig 4 which are all seepage lakes we speculate that since the seepage lakes do not have an inlet or an outlet they commonly reflect groundwater levels and rainfall patterns and therefore probably may fluctuate seasonally much more than the drainage lakes the al and tr lakes in our study cedergren 1977 the drainage lakes usually respond slower to the changes in the atmospheric deposition patterns gerson et al 2016 the fact that the drainage lakes usually have higher nutrient levels and more diverse fishery than seepage lakes could also benefit the maintenance of a stable primary productivity wavelet approaches can help answer some of the fundamental questions associated with climate variability and chlorophyll a concentration fluctuations by taking into account the non stationary nature of these time series and the possible occurrence of transient states our results indicated that chlorophyll a concentration and mei climatic oscillation index were closely associated to each other at least statistically and that these associations appeared transiently in some periods fig 5 first it s really interesting that periodic modes of 64 months were found in chl and mei series similar to our findings several aquatic organisms have been reported to fluctuate in a certain periodic mode for instance jellyfish populations undergo worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20 y periodicity condon et al 2013 chlorophyll a in the surface mixed layer of the western north pacific followed a clear oscillation of 20 8 years from 1971 to 2000 watanabe et al 2005 the mode of 64 months 5 3 years is about 1 4 of the 20 y periodicity which not only falls into the oscillation of 20 y but also shows a better resolution of oscillation analysis using the advanced time frequency methods second we identified time intervals which showed that the chl and mei time series co varied at 64 months modes i e from 1984 to 2014 for cr and tr lakes from 1993 to 2001 for al and sp lakes and from 1984 to 1993 and then from 1996 to 2009 for bm lake third phase analysis demonstrated that the link between mei and chlorophyll a concentration in the recent years became stronger showing an increasing synchronization between them similar to our findings using a coupled climate model the global warming has also been previously proved to be accelerated by carbon cycle feedbacks between climate and the biosphere cox et al 2000 the clear periodicity and synchronization between chl and enso mei would provide a valid theoretical basis for the forecasting and early warning of habs in lakes by the advanced time frequency techniques which has been successfully applied in lakes and reservoirs in us and china xiao et al 2017 4 2 relating the phytoplankton dynamics in ntls to climatic oscillation enso the climate variability is known to affect the primary production in aquatic environment and vice versa behrenfeld et al 2006 cox et al 2000 it s naturally understood and widely documented that the oscillations of oceanic phytoplankton were climate driven either in basin scale martinez et al 2009 or in more specific case studies derot et al 2015 nevertheless much less knowledge is known for the freshwater ecosystem due to lack of long term observations and the long distance and isolation of continental lakes to the oceans gerten and adrian 2002 although modelling approach has unrevealed that the climate change will negatively affect the transparency of temperate shallow lakes and result in a higher summer chlorophyll a concentration and stronger summer dominance of cyanobacteria mooij et al 2007 the experimental investigations are still rare our results showed that comparing to the normal years the chl in the ntls were relatively lower during strong el niño events and tended to be either stable or increased during strong la niña events fig 3 similar to our findings climatically driven changes in phytoplankton abundance in european freshwaters became obvious after a series of mild winters in the late 1980s and early 1990s gerten and adrian 2002 the strong el niño event has been associated with colder temperature conversely strong la niña event is associated with warmer temperature shabbar and khandekar 1996 therefore the shorter ice covers and thus the better light conditions can promote the algal growth causing higher chlorophyll a concentration and earlier blooms e g the heiligensee lake gerten and adrian 2002 furthermore the climate change would affect the transparency and then the mixing depths of small lakes which will alter their dissolved organic carbon and chlorophyll a concentrations in canadian shield lakes fee et al 1996 additionally the temperature and wind speed would also greatly contribute in advancing the onset time of cyanobacterial bloom and extending its duration for instance in lake tai with sufficient nutrient loadings zhang et al 2012 although exploring the teleconnection between phytoplankton dynamics in ntls and global climatic oscillation is quite challenging our results suggested that the oscillations of chl in ntls were driven by enso similar to the observations of marine ecosystem for instance in the western north pacific ocean the weakening of mixed layer stability was found to restrain the biological activity which resulted in a strong negative correlation between chl and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo watanabe et al 2005 specifically in 1997 1998 a very strong el niño event occurred and a significance decreasing of chlorophyll a was documented in california current system kahru and mitchell 2000 and both the chlorophyll a and chlorophyll specific primary productivity were reduced in the equatorial pacific ocean during el niño event the in 1991 1992 barber et al 1996 given consideration to the patterns showing in this study and previous researches it seems like the climatically driven oscillations of phytoplankton dynamics are following certain global principles in both the marine and freshwater environments however it s also clear that evidences of how the severity or occurrence of water quality extremes i e habs could be directly related to the variations in climate is still lacking michalak 2016 comparing to the marine environment the cases of freshwater environments could be much more complicated due to their diverse eutrophic levels natural and geographic conditions and biogeochemical processes for instance different intrinsic patterns were found in eemd results residual of mei was monotone increasing which is same to 3 of the ntls however the al and cr lakes showed opposite tendency hinted again the complexity of the primary productivity in the lake ecosystems research efforts are needed to further explore the regional specific patterns under the global synchronization of chl to climatic oscillations 5 conclusions phytoplankton bloom dynamics are complex and influenced by various parameters through nonlinear and stochastic relations the state of the art time frequency analysis techniques i e ensemble empirical mode decomposition hilbert huang spectrum and wavelet analysis fit the data mining of the inter variations between chlorophyll a concentrations and climatic oscillations perfectly although their dynamics belongs to many different scales clear periodicity and synchronization could be found for the chlorophyll a concentrations and enso mei time series in ntls the climatically driven oscillations of the chlorophyll a concentrations in ntls showed similar pattern to those reported in marine ecosystem however probably in a much more complicated manner our explorations to the teleconnection between the chlorophyll a concentrations and climatic oscillations in lakes would serve as a solid theoretical basis for the

series into several time series that are independent with each other namely intrinsic mode functions imfs and hilbert transformation ht to generate the hilbert spectrum and marginal spectrum huang et al 1998 1 emd it began with fitting the local maximum and minimum values of original time series by using two cubic splines the difference between the original time series and the mean values of the two cubic splined time series was defined as the first imf if meets the criterion i e standard deviation should be between 0 2 and 0 3 provided by huang et al 1998 otherwise the fitting process was repeated until this criterion was satisfied after the first imf was defined the difference between the original time series and the first imf was used to detect the rest of imfs finally a monotonic time series was left and defined as the residual series specifically instantaneous periods were calculated by instantaneous frequency abnormal values of instantaneous periods were removed by pauta criteria li et al 2016 after that the duncan multiple range test was employed to detect the difference between the various imfs and various time series as an inner comparison by using spss 16 0 software since the emd process would cause the mode mixing problems in many cases wu and huang 2009 the ensemble emd eemd was used instead of emd in this study the modified process was as following 1 add a white noise time series into the original time series 2 apply the emd process to decompose the white noise added time series into imfs 3 repeat the steps 1 2 with different white noise time series added 4 calculate the mean values of all the imfs generated by the above steps which was defined as the final imfs 2 ht it transformed each imfs into an analytical function for constructing the hilbert spectrum which showed the time frequency amplitude energy variance characteristics of original time series in a time frequency domain with a hilbert spectrum the marginal spectrum was calculated as the cumulative amplitude distribution across frequencies statistics of the eemd results of all the 5 chl time series and 1 mei time series were calculated including the time period for each imfs from imf 1 to imf 7 for each time series represented as mean se the variance for each imfs duncan multiple range test was used to detect the difference between these time period of each imfs for cross comparison between the 6 time series and p 0 05 was considered as significant 2 2 2 wavelet analysis wavelet coherence analysis was performed to explore the inter response relationship between the monthly time series of surface chlorophyll a concentration for each of the 5 lakes and the monthly time series of enso mei on matlab software following the methods described in grinsted et al 2004 and cazelles et al 2008 briefly the two original time series were first transformed by morlet wavelet function into time frequency domain where the period variability of the original time series can be detected in various frequencies secondly the two transformed series were cross wavelet transformed to get the cross wavelet spectrum thirdly the coherency wavelet values were calculated in the time frequency domain using the individual wavelet spectrum to normalize the cross wavelet spectrum high coherency value represents for co variation of the two original time series finally in complement to wavelet analysis we used phase analysis to characterize the association between time series the phase difference provided information on the sign of the relationship i e in phase or out of phase the phase was computed based on the imaginary and the real part of the wavelet transform of the time series and the phase difference was based on the imaginary and the real part of the wavelet co spectrum between two time series 2 3 intuitive association analysis local polynomial regression fitting method was employed to fit the annual mean chl in the five ntls against mei values the method took advantages of a moving window that only searched for neighbor data and assigned various weights to the data by considering the distances for fitting the intuitive association analyses were processed on r software 3 results 3 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition for each of the five chl and the enso mei time series fig 2 seven imfs and a residual signal were generated by the eemd method of hht fig 3 the oscillation time periods of the chl and enso time series were calculated with the statistical results of cross comparison shown in table 2 similar patterns were found for the six time series that the frequencies of time series decreased from imf1 to imf7 and residuals were monotonic series all the imfs are oscillating across the whole series due to the larger standard deviation compared to the mean values interestingly based on the duncan multiple range test the imfs of the chlorophyll a concentration of all the five lakes are the same to those of the mei p 0 05 especially for the high frequency imfs the only exceptions are for the lower frequency imfs i e imf 5 and imf 6 of al imf 4 imf 6 of bm etc which are significant different from those of mei p 0 05 the residual components showed the long time trend of original series specifically the residual of mei is monotone decreasing at the rate of 4 5214e 4 month 1 which is coincide to the chl time series of the bm decreasing rate of 0 0024 mg l 1 month 1 sp decreasing rate of 0 0071 mg l 1 month 1 and tr decreasing rate of 0 0012 mg l 1 month 1 however the residuals of the chl time series of al and cr lake are monotone increasing for the same time period which are 0 0065 and 0 0054 mg l 1 month 1 respectively 3 2 hilbert spectra and marginal spectra time frequency energy variance distribution of the chl and enso mei time series for the five ntls were further calculated in the time frequency domain fig 4 for all the 6 time series continuous and stable instantaneous frequencies were distributed in low frequency regions 0 03 cycle month i e larger than 33 months per cycle only few discrete and oscillating instantaneous frequencies located in relatively higher frequency regions 0 03 0 1 cycle month i e 10 33 months per cycle the energy variance concentrated in both frequency regions 0 0 1 cycle month i e larger than 10 months per cycle especially for the mei however some discrete energy points were still detected in the high frequency regions of the spectra 0 1 cycle month i e smaller than 10 months per cycle as a cumulative amplitude distribution the marginal spectra would allow a better visualization about the amplitude energy variance characteristics of the time series fig 4 all marginal spectra showed decreasing trends similar to the results of hilbert huang spectra high energy variance distributions were found at the low frequency region 0 0 03 cycle month i e larger than 33 months per cycle especially for the al tr and mei time series for bm cr and sp lakes peak energy variance also existed at higher frequency regions 3 3 wavelet coherency analysis wavelet coherency spectra showed a strong coherency between enso mei and the chl for the five ntls with a periodicity of 64 month fig 5 the phase of chl and mei exhibited time lag of 22 24 11 15 24 27 23 24 17 18 months for the al bm cr sp tr lakes respectively notably the variation of phase differences between enso mei and the chl time series around the band of 64 months became more and more coherent in recent years for the al bm sp and tr lakes furthermore for these lakes the variation of phase differences experienced a cycle of small large small fig 5 3 4 intuitive association between annual average chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes and mei annual average chlorophyll a concentrations and mei values were calculated for scatter plotting fig 6 although the range of chl seems to be controlled by the phosphorous supplies in these lakes table 1 the enso mei put a severe influence on the chl in addition to the nutrients with the mei value increasing chlorophyll a concentration in the ntls experienced a general trend of decreasing increasing decreasing except for the cr lake the inflection points located around mei value of 0 and 1 respectively specifically the chlorophyll a concentration of cr lake has a trend of increasing decreasing increasing decreasing with the inflection points at mei values of 0 0 5 and 1 respectively interestingly the annual average chlorophyll a concentration in the lakes were relatively low when the positive mei values was high mei values of 1 1 5 which represent strong el niño events in those years and the annual average chlorophyll a concentration tended to be either stable or increase when the negative mei value was high i e mei values 1 which represents strong la niña event comparing to the normal years 4 discussions 4 1 periodicity and synchronization of the chl and mei time series in ntls since the relationship between chlorophyll a concentrations chl and climatic oscillations mei is rather complicated michalak 2016 the state of the art time frequency analysis was employed to explore the periodicity and synchronization between them results confirmed the same significant periodic bands during the same time period and responses of the five northern temperature lakes were almost synchronized for instance the eemd results indicated that the high frequency periods imfs especially for periods around 5 and 13 months band table 2 of ntls exhibited no differences to those of mei showing a significant synchronization of the global climatic oscillations and the chlorophyll a p 0 05 although previous studies documented close correlations between chl and climate oscillation i e pdo nao etc martinez et al 2009 straile and adrian 2000 watanabe et al 2005 to our best knowledge our study is one of the first researches to reveal a clear periodicity and synchronization between them hilbert huang spectra and marginal spectra further showed the similarities of variations in chl and mei continuous and high energy variance fluctuations existed in low frequency region of all the time series with a similar variation pattern fig 4 however the discrete fluctuations existed in high frequency region of the chl in all five lakes but not for mei showing that enso mei cannot fully explain the chlorophyll a variation in lakes a possible explanation could be that algae growth is a complex process not only driven by the climate oscillations but also influenced by lots of other environmental factors i e nutrients etc borsuk et al 2004 interestingly the fluctuations in high frequency region of chl are especially higher in the bm cr and sp lake fig 4 which are all seepage lakes we speculate that since the seepage lakes do not have an inlet or an outlet they commonly reflect groundwater levels and rainfall patterns and therefore probably may fluctuate seasonally much more than the drainage lakes the al and tr lakes in our study cedergren 1977 the drainage lakes usually respond slower to the changes in the atmospheric deposition patterns gerson et al 2016 the fact that the drainage lakes usually have higher nutrient levels and more diverse fishery than seepage lakes could also benefit the maintenance of a stable primary productivity wavelet approaches can help answer some of the fundamental questions associated with climate variability and chlorophyll a concentration fluctuations by taking into account the non stationary nature of these time series and the possible occurrence of transient states our results indicated that chlorophyll a concentration and mei climatic oscillation index were closely associated to each other at least statistically and that these associations appeared transiently in some periods fig 5 first it s really interesting that periodic modes of 64 months were found in chl and mei series similar to our findings several aquatic organisms have been reported to fluctuate in a certain periodic mode for instance jellyfish populations undergo worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20 y periodicity condon et al 2013 chlorophyll a in the surface mixed layer of the western north pacific followed a clear oscillation of 20 8 years from 1971 to 2000 watanabe et al 2005 the mode of 64 months 5 3 years is about 1 4 of the 20 y periodicity which not only falls into the oscillation of 20 y but also shows a better resolution of oscillation analysis using the advanced time frequency methods second we identified time intervals which showed that the chl and mei time series co varied at 64 months modes i e from 1984 to 2014 for cr and tr lakes from 1993 to 2001 for al and sp lakes and from 1984 to 1993 and then from 1996 to 2009 for bm lake third phase analysis demonstrated that the link between mei and chlorophyll a concentration in the recent years became stronger showing an increasing synchronization between them similar to our findings using a coupled climate model the global warming has also been previously proved to be accelerated by carbon cycle feedbacks between climate and the biosphere cox et al 2000 the clear periodicity and synchronization between chl and enso mei would provide a valid theoretical basis for the forecasting and early warning of habs in lakes by the advanced time frequency techniques which has been successfully applied in lakes and reservoirs in us and china xiao et al 2017 4 2 relating the phytoplankton dynamics in ntls to climatic oscillation enso the climate variability is known to affect the primary production in aquatic environment and vice versa behrenfeld et al 2006 cox et al 2000 it s naturally understood and widely documented that the oscillations of oceanic phytoplankton were climate driven either in basin scale martinez et al 2009 or in more specific case studies derot et al 2015 nevertheless much less knowledge is known for the freshwater ecosystem due to lack of long term observations and the long distance and isolation of continental lakes to the oceans gerten and adrian 2002 although modelling approach has unrevealed that the climate change will negatively affect the transparency of temperate shallow lakes and result in a higher summer chlorophyll a concentration and stronger summer dominance of cyanobacteria mooij et al 2007 the experimental investigations are still rare our results showed that comparing to the normal years the chl in the ntls were relatively lower during strong el niño events and tended to be either stable or increased during strong la niña events fig 3 similar to our findings climatically driven changes in phytoplankton abundance in european freshwaters became obvious after a series of mild winters in the late 1980s and early 1990s gerten and adrian 2002 the strong el niño event has been associated with colder temperature conversely strong la niña event is associated with warmer temperature shabbar and khandekar 1996 therefore the shorter ice covers and thus the better light conditions can promote the algal growth causing higher chlorophyll a concentration and earlier blooms e g the heiligensee lake gerten and adrian 2002 furthermore the climate change would affect the transparency and then the mixing depths of small lakes which will alter their dissolved organic carbon and chlorophyll a concentrations in canadian shield lakes fee et al 1996 additionally the temperature and wind speed would also greatly contribute in advancing the onset time of cyanobacterial bloom and extending its duration for instance in lake tai with sufficient nutrient loadings zhang et al 2012 although exploring the teleconnection between phytoplankton dynamics in ntls and global climatic oscillation is quite challenging our results suggested that the oscillations of chl in ntls were driven by enso similar to the observations of marine ecosystem for instance in the western north pacific ocean the weakening of mixed layer stability was found to restrain the biological activity which resulted in a strong negative correlation between chl and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo watanabe et al 2005 specifically in 1997 1998 a very strong el niño event occurred and a significance decreasing of chlorophyll a was documented in california current system kahru and mitchell 2000 and both the chlorophyll a and chlorophyll specific primary productivity were reduced in the equatorial pacific ocean during el niño event the in 1991 1992 barber et al 1996 given consideration to the patterns showing in this study and previous researches it seems like the climatically driven oscillations of phytoplankton dynamics are following certain global principles in both the marine and freshwater environments however it s also clear that evidences of how the severity or occurrence of water quality extremes i e habs could be directly related to the variations in climate is still lacking michalak 2016 comparing to the marine environment the cases of freshwater environments could be much more complicated due to their diverse eutrophic levels natural and geographic conditions and biogeochemical processes for instance different intrinsic patterns were found in eemd results residual of mei was monotone increasing which is same to 3 of the ntls however the al and cr lakes showed opposite tendency hinted again the complexity of the primary productivity in the lake ecosystems research efforts are needed to further explore the regional specific patterns under the global synchronization of chl to climatic oscillations 5 conclusions phytoplankton bloom dynamics are complex and influenced by various parameters through nonlinear and stochastic relations the state of the art time frequency analysis techniques i e ensemble empirical mode decomposition hilbert huang spectrum and wavelet analysis fit the data mining of the inter variations between chlorophyll a concentrations and climatic oscillations perfectly although their dynamics belongs to many different scales clear periodicity and synchronization could be found for the chlorophyll a concentrations and enso mei time series in ntls the climatically driven oscillations of the chlorophyll a concentrations in ntls showed similar pattern to those reported in marine ecosystem however probably in a much more complicated manner our explorations to the teleconnection between the chlorophyll a concentrations and climatic oscillations in lakes would serve as a solid theoretical basis for the

18986,in this study we present a sequential electrochemical process for integral treatment of anaerobic sludge combining for the first time electrochemical peroxidation ecp and electro fenton ef in the first step ecp consisting of h2o2 assisted electrocoagulation with fe electrodes was applied as a conditioning and stabilizing method whose synergistic electrocoagulation fenton oxidation effects considerably reduced the cod toc and total suspended solids tss by 89 3 75 4 and 85 6 respectively under optimized conditions initial ph of 5 h2o2 fe2 dose ratio of 5 15 38 ma cm 2 and 2 h treatment furthermore total coliforms were completely killed within the first hour of treatment in the second step ef was successfully applied to mineralize the remaining organic fraction in the liquid effluent after dewatering achieving 91 6 and 87 2 of cod and toc removal respectively after 4 h of treatment under optimal conditions ph 3 and 25 ma cm 2 while almost total cod and toc removal was attained in 8 h the fe sludge generated at the end of the ecp treatment was easily dewatered by filtration and 20 9 g of nutrient rich dry sludge were produced the overall cost of the ecp ef treatment was s 0 05 l 1 sludge the combined effects of coagulation and fenton oxidation during ecp revealed that the treatment efficiency is strongly dependent on the rheological properties of the sludge sample graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic sludge electrochemical peroxidation electrocoagulation electro fenton wastewater treatment 1 introduction the agricultural and agro industrial sectors produce enormous amounts of wastewater entailing potentially severe pollution issues food processing wastewater treatment is generally conducted by systems composed of conventional physicochemical and biological units aerobic and anaerobic where treatment is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of sludge requiring further treatment and disposal christensen et al 2015 the annual production of waste sludge is estimated at about 45 million dry tons per year q zhang et al 2017a out of which the usa europe and china contribute together 18 4 million dry tons mateo sagasta et al 2015 because sludge treatment and disposal is difficult and expensive sludge management represents over 60 of the total cost of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps zhou et al 2014 sludge is generally composed of microbial cells extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by bacteria representing 80 of the mass content recalcitrant pollutants and water free and bound zhou et al 2014 bound water entrapped within the eps confers high viscosity to the sludge limiting its dewaterability and settling liu and fang 2003 the great challenge of sludge treatment is indeed to reduce water content so it can be managed as a solid sludge treatment consists of different steps thickening stabilization to decrease sludge mass conditioning to increase dewaterability dewatering to minimize sludge volume and final disposal or reuse dewatering is a crucial step impacting directly on transportation and disposal costs christensen et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 incineration landfilling and land application are the most commonly used sludge disposal options q zhang et al 2017a for land application wastewater sludge is an excellent source of nutrients for agricultural production nevertheless it is generally loaded with human pathogens that represent an important health threat lowman et al 2013 consequently disinfection is compulsory when developing sludge treatment technologies conventional physicochemical and biological treatment technologies have shown limited performance due to the complexity of the sludge advanced oxidation processes aops have been used as potent conditioning methods due to their capability to disrupt sludge flocs and degrade extracellular polymeric substances thus enhancing dewaterability wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 however some aops e g ozonation and ultrasound are still limited to tertiary treatment applications due to their high energy and chemical demand wang et al 2017 electrocoagulation ec is a powerful electrochemical technology that has found diverse applications for the treatment of highly polluted industrial wastewater hakizimana et al 2017 during ec the electrochemical production of coagulants from a sacrificial anode promotes contaminant agglomeration and precipitation both al and fe electrodes have given satisfactory performances however fe has the advantage of being non toxic and cheaper than al hakizimana et al 2017 the formation of fe oh 3 species by dissolution of an fe anode follows eqs 1 and 2 while h2 evolves at the cathode according to eq 3 ec with fe anodes has been coupled to the chemical fenton process by external addition of h2o2 which promotes oh based oxidation of organic pollutants in addition to the coagulation mechanism this process is known as electrochemical peroxidation ecp chiarenzelli et al 2001 ecp has been applied for the degradation of refractory organics in wastewater via oh such as industrial wastewater kumar et al 2018 wastewater from a paper recycling plant moussavi and aghanejad 2014 and pretreated coke wastewater ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 nonetheless the coagulation effect has generally been neglected and poorly investigated 1 fe fe2 2e 2 4fe2 10h2o o2 g 4fe oh 3 s 8h 3

huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 sirés et al 2014 these environmentally friendly methods are characterized by the in situ generation of oh and the lack of secondary sludge formation moreover they operate under mild conditions and can economically outcompete other aops cañizares et al 2009 the electro fenton process ef is one of the most widespread eaops and relies on the generation of oh in the bulk solution by means of the fenton s reaction eq 4 the cathodic production of the fenton s reagent h2o2 and fe2 on carbonaceous electrodes is favoured in acidic solutions containing catalytic amounts of fe2 ions according to eqs 5 and 6 brillas et al 2009 sirés and brillas 2017 in addition ef efficiency can be enhanced when it is coupled to anodic oxidation ao by using a powerful boron

technologies represent promising options for wastewater treatment especially for decentralised systems cid et al 2018 in fact electrochemical methods have already been applied to sludge dewatering and stabilization but results were not conclusive and organic matter removal remained low bureau et al 2012 li et al 2016 in this context this work presents a sequential treatment strategy based on electrochemical technologies for integral treatment of thick and viscous anaerobic sludge this kind of sludge generally presents poorer dewaterability than waste activated sludge zhang et al 2015 in the first step sludge conditioning and stabilization was performed by means of ecp with optimization of the main operating parameters influencing the process initial ph h2o2 fe2 ratio and current the synergistic effects of coagulation and oxidation during ecp of viscous sludge were investigated in detail for the first time in the second stage ef was used to achieve complete mineralization of the remaining organic fraction in the wastewater separated from the sludge an economic assessment is presented in the last section the ecp ef process is proposed as an efficient cost effective and sustainable solution for integral sludge remediation to the best of our knowledge there is no report in the literature of such a comprehensive sludge treatment capable of delivering an effluent with minimal amounts of organic matter suitable for reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and characteristics the sludge sample originated from a local poultry farm in singapore which generates approximately 150 tons per day of anaerobic sludge requiring proper attention before disposal samples were collected and stored in polypropylene containers at 4 c the chemical characterization of the raw sample is presented in table 1 it contains very high chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solid tss 2 2 experimental setup prior to electrolysis k2so4 0 1 m was added to the sample as supporting electrolyte and the ph was adjusted to the desired value using h2so4 all experiments were conducted in a batch glass electrolytic reactor with 0 5 l capacity powered by a hameg 7042 5 power supply germany for ec and ecp trials two mild steel plate electrodes 5 6 5 0 5 cm referred to as fe electrodes in the text were positioned in the middle of the cell facing each

this section is to investigate the best strategy for sludge conditioning aiming at disrupting the floc structure of the sludge for this purpose three experimental strategies were explored i ec with fe electrodes ii peroxi coagulation pc using a graphite cathode and a fe anode and iii ecp the electrolysis tests were performed at 500 ma corresponding to 15 4 ma cm 2 and the tss cod and toc removal efficiencies are presented in fig 1 the control experiment with h2o2 but without external current evidence the low oxidative power of h2o2 in the absence of fe2 the results further show limited tss cod and toc removal efficiencies by ec and pc while the best removal yields were achieved with ecp 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 of tss cod and toc removal efficiency respectively these results can be explained by the complexity of the sludge sample high content of organic matter and suspended solids as well as low filterability in the case of ec the coagulation process promoted by the electrochemical release of fe3 ions was not efficient enough to disrupt the polymeric materials break down microbial cells and induce proper coagulation this behaviour is similar to that reported by zhen et al 2013 for pc two issues were encountered first due to the high viscosity of the sample limitations in o2 mass transport towards the cathode resulted in low electrochemical production of h2o2 on the surface of graphite eq 5 which restrained the formation of oh via the fenton s reaction eq 4 second the pc experiment was conducted at ph 5 because of the nature of the sample acidification requiring huge amounts of h2so4 and time owing to acid hydrolysis reactions neyens et al 2003 consequently the rate of the fenton s reaction was slow at this ph value due to the limited availability of fe3 fe2 ions in solution indeed it is well known that the fenton s reaction has an optimal operating ph of around 3 according to fe3 ions speciation in solution pignatello et al 2006 yet one pc experiment was performed at ph 3 results not shown and the removal efficiencies were not significantly improved pointing out that the physicochemical properties of the sample high viscosity more than the slow kinetics of the fenton s reaction at ph 5 were the main factors limiting the efficacy of ef thus it was demonstrated that the electrochemical production of h2o2 on graphite electrodes during pc is not suitable for highly polluted anaerobic sludge with high viscosity with respect to ecp the external addition of h2o2 h2o2 fe2 5 significantly enhanced the removal efficiency resulting in a dramatic improvement as compared to ec experiments in fact oh produced from eq 4 oxidized the organic material eps composed mainly of polysaccharides proteins and dna humic like substances lipids and cell membranes phospholipids and amino acids ultimately provoking cell disruption and sludge floc disintegration yu et al 2018 this process released the bound water and exposed the cellular material eps to further oh attacks leading to mineralization of small molecules such as amino acids carbohydrates proteins peptides alcohols epoxides and carboxylic acids erden and filibeli 2010 neyens et al 2004 additionally it has been reported that the cleavage of macromolecules during oh oxidation in the fenton process diminishes the strength of sludge flocs resulting in a decrease of viscosity pham et al 2010 in this way sludge conditioning and stabilization was effectuated by an intricate coagulation fenton s oxidation process coagulation contributed to 41 and 37 of cod and toc removal efficiencies respectively only slightly lower than fenton oxidation which accounted for 48 and 38 of cod and toc removal respectively fig 1 fe oxyhydoxy precipitates assisted the destabilization of the sludge flocs by compression of the double layer of colloidal particles charge neutralization and entrapment in the fe coagulants harif et al 2012 then one fraction of the organic material eps cells and by products from oh cleavage was removed by adsorption and complexation on fe hydroxides species that precipitated following flocculation moreno casillas et al 2007 the oxidation and coagulation mechanisms taking place during ecp are schematized in fig 2 while the inset panel shows the production of fe coagulants and oh in the ecp reactor the inset panel in fig 1 depicts the visual appearance of the samples throughout the experimental period 3 2 ecp optimization taking into account preliminary experiments ecp was selected as the most suitable conditioning and stabilizing method optimization was then carried out with relation to the main parameters affecting ecp performance namely ph current and h2o2 fe2 ratio 3 2 1 effect of current density current density is a key operating parameter affecting the performance of electrochemical processes by controlling the rate of electrochemical reactions in the case of ec and related processes it is particularly important as current is directly linked to the release of fe2 ions eq 1 which generally follows the faraday s law in general fe2 is quickly oxidized as the ph increases eq 2 forming fe oh 3 as the main coagulant species lakshmanan et al 2009 the amount of fe oh 3 species in solution then determines the coagulation efficiency garcia segura et al 2017 in this work no fe2 was detected in solution after 2 h of ecp which can be accounted for by the progressive increase of ph constant stirring and the presence of h2o2 in addition current controls the cathodic evolution of h2 eq 3 which entails an increase of ph during electrolysis when h2o2 is used ecp the amount of dissolved fe2 fe 3 also determines the production of oh through the fenton s reaction eq 4 thus the performance of ecp was investigated at different current values 3 08 ma cm 2 15 38 ma cm 2 and 30 77 ma cm 2 with initial ph 5 and h2o2 fe2 5 following preliminary tests results are presented in fig 3 showing that ecp performance improved as current increased from 3 08 ma cm 2 to 15 38 ma cm 2 with the latter value giving the best tss cod and toc removal efficiencies of 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 respectively this behaviour can be explained by the increase of fe2 ions with current density according to the faraday s law thus a higher coagulant dose enhanced the coagulation efficiency while at the same time more fe2 fe3 free ions in solution increased oh production and consequently improved the efficiency of fenton oxidation however the application of a higher current value 30 77 ma cm 2 did not result in further efficiency improvement owing to i the higher reaction rate of h2o2 decomposition at the anode eqs 11 and 12 ii coagulant overdosing that can modify the charge of aggregates causing their redispersion and decreasing the coagulation flocculation efficiency harif and adin 2011 and most importantly iii an excess of fe2 ions promoting the competitive waste reactions 13 and 14 consuming oh in detriment of organics oxidation with eq 13 having a higher kinetic constant k13 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 than eq 14 k 2 7 10 3 s 1 for the unimolecular decomposition of fe3 hydroxyperoxy complexes formed as intermediates brillas et al 2009 pignatello et al 2006 moreover the rise in current density accompanied by higher potential entails heat generation and higher energy consumption and thus the optimal current density of 15 38 ma cm 2 was selected for further experiments 11 h2o2 ho2 h e 12 ho2 o2 h e 13 fe2 oh fe3 ho 14 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 3 2 2 effect of ph ph plays a fundamental role in ecp as it affects iron speciation in solution as well as the complexation and redox cycling between fe ions brillas et al 2009 lakshmanan et al 2009 the aqueous chemistry of fe species determines both coagulation efficiency and the reactivity of the fenton s reaction to examine the effect of ph a series of experiments with ph ranging from 3 to 8 with 8 being the initial ph of the sludge sample were conducted under current of 15 38 ma cm 2 and h2o2 fe2 5 the results depicted in fig 4 show that ecp displayed the best efficiency under slightly acidic conditions ph 5 with 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 of tss cod and toc removal efficiencies respectively even though fenton based processes generally operate optimally in acidic medium ph between 2 and 4 pignatello et al 2006 sirés and brillas 2017 during ecp the performance is governed by both fenton s oxidation and ec it is known that ph values ranging from 5 to 8 favour the precipitation of fe oh 3 species and thus ec efficiency lakshmanan et al 2009 in this way under acidic conditions ph 3 coagulation efficiency dropped which had a dramatic impact on ecp performance on the other hand at higher ph ph 8 the rate constant of the fenton s reaction was significantly diminished as fe2 fe3 species were scarcely available in the solution hence hindering the production of oh and decreasing ecp performance furthermore the oxidation potential of oh in alkaline conditions is lower than in acidic solutions 1 90 v vs she at ph 7 vs 2 8 v vs she at ph 3 burbano et al 2005 thus ph 5 was the optimal value that favoured both coagulation and fenton s oxidation these findings demonstrate that fenton s oxidation alone could not deal with the high amount of tss efficiently and ec alone was hindered by the high organic content of the sludge yet a synergy between both processes made effective treatment possible in order to understand the efficiency of the fenton s reaction at ph 5 during ecp it is important to keep in mind that although the fenton s reaction performs optimally at acidic values it can also take place at higher ph values but with slower kinetics because of the lower reactivity of hydrolysed fe3 species furthermore organic substances play a significant role in the complexation of fe ions both in aqueous phase and on the surface of amorphous aggregates at different ph values fe complexes in solution at near neutral ph values promote the activation of h2o2 and o2 to form oh and or high valence fe oxidizing species ferrates fe iv eq 15 that contribute to the oxidation of organics belanzoni et al 2009 de luca et al 2014 moreover fe species on the surface of coagulant particles can promote heterogeneous fenton like reactions in a wide ph range wang et al 2016 organic ligands also intervene in the reduction of fe3 to fe2 to maintain the catalytic cycle of the fenton process bolobajev et al 2015 fukuchi et al 2014 15 fe2 l h2o2 fe3 l oh oh these results contrast with previous works that reported that 3 was the optimal ph for ecp under the argument that oh oxidation was the prevailing degradation mechanism akyol et al 2013 guan et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 it should be noted here that the above mentioned works dealt with non viscous wastewater with low content of organic matter and suspended solids where the coagulation effect on organics was not taken into account these discrepancies show that ecp performance strongly depends on the physicochemical properties of the waste material and the contribution of the dominant degradation mechanisms under optimal operating conditions 3 2 3 effect of h2o2 fe2 ratio h2o2 is crucial in fenton based processes because oh formation is directly dependent upon fe2 and h2o2 concentrations in general the efficiency increases as the h2o2 fe2 ratio rises but the optimal ratio depends on the characteristics of the effluent and the experimental conditions akyol et al 2013 moussavi and aghanejad 2014 pilli et al 2015 thus the effect of h2o2 concentration h2o2 fe2 ratio of 1 5 and 10 was evaluated under current density of 15 38 ma cm 2 and ph 5 the results show that the removal efficiency was slightly higher at h2o2 fe2 5 fig 5 moreover the properties of the fe sludge obtained at the end of the 2 h treatment were also affected by the amount of h2o2 the dewaterability evaluation of the fe sludge in terms of sludge filterability showed that fe sludge obtained with h2o2 fe2 1 had lower filterability 38 8 s ml 1 than the sludge obtained with h2o2 fe2 5 18 7 s ml 1 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the greater level of mineralization of organic matter attained with greater concentrations of oh formed at higher h2o2 to fe2 ratios in this way the degradation of organic material eps and other macromolecules with h2o2 fe2 1 was less efficient and bigger molecules with higher molecular weight were still present in solution lower mineralization degree which impacted the rheological properties of the sample reflected in a higher resistance to filtration on the contrary lower molecular weight compounds were formed with the 5 ratio resulting in fe sludge with higher dewaterability as expected the difference in organic composition between samples at different h2o2 fe2 ratios was not reflected in the cod and toc values the effect of polymeric substances on sludge morphology and compatibility has been reported in past investigations erdincler and vesilind 2000 finally at h2o2 fe2 10 higher amounts of h2o2 resulted in decreased efficiency owing to parasitic reactions that do not contribute to the oxidation of organics mainly waste consumption of oh by excess h2o2 according to eq 16 additionally at a concentration higher than the optimum value h2o2 may self decompose to h2o and o2 leading to reduced oh production following eq 17 h2o2 is also decomposed via its oxidation at the anode following eqs 11 and 12 16 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 17 2h2o2 o2 h2o 3 2 4 fe sludge cake properties after 2 h of ecp treatment under optimal conditions ph 5 15 38 ma cm 2 of current and h2o2 fe2 5 the settled fe sludge cake was vacuum filtered after adjusting the ph to 9 dried at 105 c and further analysed 21 90 g of dry dewatered sludge were obtained whose chemical composition is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the sludge cake contained high amounts or organic carbon ppo4 nnh4 and no3 as an indication of good fertilizing properties these ionic species precipitated with the coagulants furthermore the analysis of heavy metals table s1 revealed that all the species that were measured were below the permissible levels for agricultural soil established by the european legislation table s1 as expected fe was present in the sludge at high concentration of 44 98 mg g 1 however the beneficial use of fe biosolids in land and agricultural applications has been reported brown et al 2012 moreover ec sludge with high contents of al or fe has also shown potential as pigments construction materials and ceramic membranes tang and shih 2014 besides the chemical properties of the sludge it is worthy of note that sludge dewatering was significantly increased by ecp filterability increased from 2815 63 s ml 1 initially to 18 7 s ml 1 after 2 h of ecp resulting in a negligible amount of dry solid that needs to be disposed only 21 90 g of dry sludge out of 400 ml of sample 3 4 ef post treatment ecp alone was able to achieve tss cod and toc removal yields of 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 respectively however the filtrate obtained after dewatering still contained a high concentration of cod and toc 2800 2 and 1287 8 mg l 1 respectively accordingly the remaining effluent was further treated by means of ef using a bdd anode and a carbon brush cathode the aim was to make use of the outstanding ef capacity to mineralize organic pollutants as stated in previous studies lin et al 2017 mousset et al 2017 olvera vargas et al 2014 the sample was acidified to ph 3 prior to ef experiments interestingly the fenton s reaction was catalysed by the remnant amount of fe2 fe3 ions from the ecp process 7 35 mg l 1 which was close to the optimal amount of fe2 catalyst generally reported for ef between 3 58 and 17 93 mg l 1 garcia rodriguez et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2018 the use of the remaining fe ions in solution following ec as source of catalyst was reported in earlier works on coupled ec ef systems anfruns estrada et al 2017 thiam et al 2014 fig 6 depicts the optimization of current density for cod and toc removal during ef as expected the concentration of organic matter decreased with time due to the oxidative attack of oh formed i homogeneously through the fenton s reaction eq 4 and ii heterogeneously on the bdd surface according to eq 7 the performance increased with current density up to 25 ma cm 2 with respect to the anode surface but further increase to 37 5 ma cm 2 did not result in any further enhancement this behaviour is simply explained by the non oxidative waste reactions promoted at higher current values the reduction of h2o2 and the evolution of h2 competing with h2o2 formation at the cathode and the evolution of o2 at the anode detrimental to bdd oh production olvera vargas et al 2014 sopaj et al 2016 following 4 h treatment under optimal current density 25 ma cm 2 the remaining cod and toc contents after ecp were reduced by 90 and 63 respectively representing an overall removal efficiency of 99 10 and 93 18 for cod and toc respectively as compared to the initial sample it is worth mentioning that the solution became clear after only 2 h of ef remarkably after 8 h of ef the cod and toc were reduced to 22 6 and 16 3 mg l 1 respectively more than 99 of the initial sample as a reference the cod was reduced to below 50 mg l 1 after 6 h of ef allowing discharge in controlled watercourse as regulated by the nea of singapore the overall evolution of cod and toc during the sequential ecp ef process 2 h ecp plus 4 h ef is displayed in fig 7 alongside photographs of the sample at various treatment stages table 3 summarizes the main results obtained with the integrated ecp ef process 90 tss was removed by ecp while the rest was removed by ef overall 90 of tss removal regarding nitrogenous species it can be seen that the amount of no3 decreased during the first hour of ecp owing to its precipitation with fe oh 3 coagulants followed by a progressive increase until a final concentration of 262 1 mg l 1 was attained after 8 h of ef treatment in contrast nh4 n increased sharply in the first hour of ecp reaching 2250 2 mg l 1 then decreased after 2 h of ecp due to the coagulation flocculation process aoudj et al 2017 during ef nh4 n increased progressively reaching 1890 3 mg l 1 after 8 h the increase of no3 and nh4 n was due to the continuous disintegration of nitrogen rich compounds such as proteins nucleic acids and urea promoted by unselective oh attack regarding po4 3 a great fraction was precipitated during the ecp process reaching a low concentration of 78 6 mg l 1 after 2 h po4 3 concentration then increased during ef due to the continuous mineralization of the remaining organic substances such as phospholipids present in membrane cells the release and accumulation of inorganic ions during ef following the mineralization of organics containing heteroatoms such as n p s and cl is well documented dirany et al 2012 olvera vargas et al 2014 the final effluent can be seen as an important source of p and n nutrient recovery could be achieved for example by chemical or electrochemical precipitation with magnesium to form struvite fertilizer kruk et al 2014 t zhang et al 2017b finally the analysis of total coliforms revealed that the integrated ecp ef process was equally efficient for disinfection coliforms were totally removed following the first hour of ecp and no more coliforms were detected during the consecutive treatment stages the analysis of the solid cake obtained after ecp did not show any coliform colonies either this is a remarkable finding if land application is considered for final disposal these results demonstrate the synergistic effect of ec and fenton s oxidation to disrupt cells and promote the mineralization of the organic material released and are in agreement with previous works that have stated the disinfection capability of eaops anfruns estrada et al 2017 cotillas et al 2018 3 5 cost evaluation and comparison the cost for the overall ecp ef treatment was estimated according to the method described in section 2 4 the total cost per litre of sludge including conditioning ph adjustment and na2so4 addition ecp sludge dewatering precipitation of iron excess at ph 9 and vacuum filtration dry sludge disposal ef post treatment 4 h and final neutralization was estimated to be s 0 036 l 1 us 0 027 l 1 as observed in fig 8 a the chemical costs represent the largest percentage 64 while power sludge management and anode consumption costs account for the remaining fraction 29 6 and 2 respectively the cost breakdown for each stage depicted in fig 8b indicates that the intermediate operations conditioning and sludge management corresponded to 19 and 7 respectively of course it should be reminded here that these calculations are based on a bench scale system larger prototypes may require higher energy costs than chemical costs owing to higher current inputs needed for larger electrode surfaces in order to maintain the optimal current density el naas et al 2016 the comparison of different sludge treatment technologies is complicated firstly because treatment depends on the characteristics of the sludge and secondly because of the properties and fate of the final sludge and or effluent conditioning methods based on aops are generally applied as pretreatment techniques aiming at improving the efficiency of anaerobic digestion by reducing tss and increasing the biodegradability wang et al 2017 remarkably the ecp ef process proposed in this work is a comprehensive treatment strategy yielding a small amount of dry sludge and clean liquid water with minimal content of organic matter the dry sludge rich in organic and inorganic nutrients and free of hazardous pathogens is suitable for land application for sustainable nutrient management gude and gnaneswar 2015 it is already known that eaops for wastewater treatment can outcompete other aops in terms of cost efficiency cañizares et al 2009 and here we show that the same premises are applicable to sludge treatment for example the full scale ozonation pre treatment of waste activated sludge was required around 1 30 per ton of tss and only reduced the production of dry sludge by 10 in a wwtp romero et al 2015 in contrast we estimate the cost of our ecp ef system at 2 10 per ton of tss with the production of dry sludge reduced by 94 5 based on the data reported by li et al 2016 on the treatment of was by ec electrochemically activated persulfate at lab scale the cost was around us 4 76 l 1 sludge vs us 0 026 l 1 sludge for ecp ef in this study which they claimed to be 42 14 cheaper than conventional fenton even if these approximations should be taken with care they provide a general idea of the potential and economic advantages of the proposed ecp ef system for comprehensive treatment of digested sludge finally the ecp ef process disclosed in this study shows excellent potential as a small scale decentralised treatment with which water could be reused for non potable purposes on site water recycling electrochemical systems of this kind have been recently implemented to treat toilet wastewater followed by reuse for flushing cid et al 2018 4 conclusions in this study a sequential electrochemical treatment was applied to treat anaerobic sludge from a poultry farm the recommended two step integrated ecp ef treatment consisted in i 2 h ecp at ph 5 current density of 15 38 ma cm 2 and h2o2 fe2 5 followed by ii 8 h ef treatment of the effluent recovered after dewatering at ph 3 and 25 ma cm 2 during the ecp stage the sludge was efficiently destabilized and conditioned by the synergistic effects of electrocoagulation and fenton oxidation which enhanced the dewaterability and reduced the amount of sludge only 21 9 g of dry fe sludge rich in c n and p produced the residual effluent after dewatering was subjected to ef during which the excess of organic matter was efficiently mineralized by means of oh the effluent after 2 h ecp and 8 h ef contained only 24 6 and 16 3 mg l 1 of cod and toc respectively the estimated total operational treatment cost was s 0 036 l 1 sludge in conclusion this promising ecp ef process is presented as a sustainable alternative for comprehensive sludge remediation capable of producing a reduced volume of solid sludge suitable for land application while the recovered water is amenable to discharge or reuse acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the singapore ministry of education academic research fund tier 1 wbs

18986,in this study we present a sequential electrochemical process for integral treatment of anaerobic sludge combining for the first time electrochemical peroxidation ecp and electro fenton ef in the first step ecp consisting of h2o2 assisted electrocoagulation with fe electrodes was applied as a conditioning and stabilizing method whose synergistic electrocoagulation fenton oxidation effects considerably reduced the cod toc and total suspended solids tss by 89 3 75 4 and 85 6 respectively under optimized conditions initial ph of 5 h2o2 fe2 dose ratio of 5 15 38 ma cm 2 and 2 h treatment furthermore total coliforms were completely killed within the first hour of treatment in the second step ef was successfully applied to mineralize the remaining organic fraction in the liquid effluent after dewatering achieving 91 6 and 87 2 of cod and toc removal respectively after 4 h of treatment under optimal conditions ph 3 and 25 ma cm 2 while almost total cod and toc removal was attained in 8 h the fe sludge generated at the end of the ecp treatment was easily dewatered by filtration and 20 9 g of nutrient rich dry sludge were produced the overall cost of the ecp ef treatment was s 0 05 l 1 sludge the combined effects of coagulation and fenton oxidation during ecp revealed that the treatment efficiency is strongly dependent on the rheological properties of the sludge sample graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic sludge electrochemical peroxidation electrocoagulation electro fenton wastewater treatment 1 introduction the agricultural and agro industrial sectors produce enormous amounts of wastewater entailing potentially severe pollution issues food processing wastewater treatment is generally conducted by systems composed of conventional physicochemical and biological units aerobic and anaerobic where treatment is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of sludge requiring further treatment and disposal christensen et al 2015 the annual production of waste sludge is estimated at about 45 million dry tons per year q zhang et al 2017a out of which the usa europe and china contribute together 18 4 million dry tons mateo sagasta et al 2015 because sludge treatment and disposal is difficult and expensive sludge management represents over 60 of the total cost of conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps zhou et al 2014 sludge is generally composed of microbial cells extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by bacteria representing 80 of the mass content recalcitrant pollutants and water free and bound zhou et al 2014 bound water entrapped within the eps confers high viscosity to the sludge limiting its dewaterability and settling liu and fang 2003 the great challenge of sludge treatment is indeed to reduce water content so it can be managed as a solid sludge treatment consists of different steps thickening stabilization to decrease sludge mass conditioning to increase dewaterability dewatering to minimize sludge volume and final disposal or reuse dewatering is a crucial step impacting directly on transportation and disposal costs christensen et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 incineration landfilling and land application are the most commonly used sludge disposal options q zhang et al 2017a for land application wastewater sludge is an excellent source of nutrients for agricultural production nevertheless it is generally loaded with human pathogens that represent an important health threat lowman et al 2013 consequently disinfection is compulsory when developing sludge treatment technologies conventional physicochemical and biological treatment technologies have shown limited performance due to the complexity of the sludge advanced oxidation processes aops have been used as potent conditioning methods due to their capability to disrupt sludge flocs and degrade extracellular polymeric substances thus enhancing dewaterability wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 however some aops e g ozonation and ultrasound are still limited to tertiary treatment applications due to their high energy and chemical demand wang et al 2017 electrocoagulation ec is a powerful electrochemical technology that has found diverse applications for the treatment of highly polluted industrial wastewater hakizimana et al 2017 during ec the electrochemical production of coagulants from a sacrificial anode promotes contaminant agglomeration and precipitation both al and fe electrodes have given satisfactory performances however fe has the advantage of being non toxic and cheaper than al hakizimana et al 2017 the formation of fe oh 3 species by dissolution of an fe anode follows eqs 1 and 2 while h2 evolves at the cathode according to eq 3 ec with fe anodes has been coupled to the chemical fenton process by external addition of h2o2 which promotes oh based oxidation of organic pollutants in addition to the coagulation mechanism this process is known as electrochemical peroxidation ecp chiarenzelli et al 2001 ecp has been applied for the degradation of refractory organics in wastewater via oh such as industrial wastewater kumar et al 2018 wastewater from a paper recycling plant moussavi and aghanejad

huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 sirés et al 2014 these environmentally friendly methods are characterized by the in situ generation of oh and the lack of secondary sludge formation moreover they operate under mild conditions and can economically outcompete other aops cañizares et al 2009 the electro fenton process ef is one of the most widespread eaops and relies on the generation of oh in the bulk solution by means of the fenton s reaction eq 4 the cathodic production of the fenton s reagent h2o2 and fe2 on carbonaceous electrodes is favoured in acidic solutions containing catalytic amounts of fe2 ions according to eqs 5 and 6 brillas et al 2009 sirés and brillas 2017 in addition ef efficiency can be enhanced when it is coupled to anodic oxidation ao by using a powerful boron

technologies represent promising options for wastewater treatment especially for decentralised systems cid et al 2018 in fact electrochemical methods have already been applied to sludge dewatering and stabilization but results were not conclusive and organic matter removal remained low bureau et al 2012 li et al 2016 in this context this work presents a sequential treatment strategy based on electrochemical technologies for integral treatment of thick and viscous anaerobic sludge this kind of sludge generally presents poorer dewaterability than waste activated sludge zhang et al 2015 in the first step sludge conditioning and stabilization was performed by means of ecp with optimization of the main operating parameters influencing the process initial ph h2o2 fe2 ratio and current the synergistic effects of coagulation and oxidation during ecp of viscous sludge were investigated in detail for the first time in the second stage ef was used to achieve complete mineralization of the remaining organic fraction in the wastewater separated from the sludge an economic assessment is presented in the last section the ecp ef process is proposed as an efficient cost effective and sustainable solution for integral sludge remediation to the best of our knowledge there is no report in the literature of such a comprehensive sludge treatment capable of delivering an effluent with minimal amounts of organic matter suitable for reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and characteristics the sludge sample originated from a local poultry farm in singapore which generates approximately 150 tons per day of anaerobic sludge requiring proper attention before disposal samples were collected and stored in polypropylene containers at 4 c the chemical characterization of the raw sample is presented in table 1 it contains very high chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solid tss 2 2 experimental setup prior to electrolysis k2so4 0 1 m was added to the sample as supporting electrolyte and the ph was adjusted to the desired value using h2so4 all experiments were conducted in a batch glass electrolytic reactor with 0 5 l capacity powered by a hameg 7042 5 power supply germany for ec and ecp trials two mild steel plate electrodes 5 6 5 0 5 cm referred to as fe electrodes in the text were positioned in the middle of the cell facing each

this section is to investigate the best strategy for sludge conditioning aiming at disrupting the floc structure of the sludge for this purpose three experimental strategies were explored i ec with fe electrodes ii peroxi coagulation pc using a graphite cathode and a fe anode and iii ecp the electrolysis tests were performed at 500 ma corresponding to 15 4 ma cm 2 and the tss cod and toc removal efficiencies are presented in fig 1 the control experiment with h2o2 but without external current evidence the low oxidative power of h2o2 in the absence of fe2 the results further show limited tss cod and toc removal efficiencies by ec and pc while the best removal yields were achieved with ecp 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 of tss cod and toc removal efficiency respectively these results can be explained by the complexity of the sludge sample high content of organic matter and suspended solids as well as low filterability in the case of ec the coagulation process promoted by the electrochemical release of fe3 ions was not efficient enough to disrupt the polymeric materials break down microbial cells and induce proper coagulation this behaviour is similar to that reported by zhen et al 2013 for pc two issues were encountered first due to the high viscosity of the sample limitations in o2 mass transport towards the cathode resulted in low electrochemical production of h2o2 on the surface of graphite eq 5 which restrained the formation of oh via the fenton s reaction eq 4 second the pc experiment was conducted at ph 5 because of the nature of the sample acidification requiring huge amounts of h2so4 and time owing to acid hydrolysis reactions neyens et al 2003 consequently the rate of the fenton s reaction was slow at this ph value due to the limited availability of fe3 fe2 ions in solution indeed it is well known that the fenton s reaction has an optimal operating ph of around 3 according to fe3 ions speciation in solution pignatello et al 2006 yet one pc experiment was performed at ph 3 results not shown and the removal efficiencies were not significantly improved pointing out that the physicochemical properties of the sample high viscosity more than the slow kinetics of the fenton s reaction at ph 5 were the main factors limiting the efficacy of ef thus it was demonstrated that the electrochemical production of h2o2 on graphite electrodes during pc is not suitable for highly polluted anaerobic sludge with high viscosity with respect to ecp the external addition of h2o2 h2o2 fe2 5 significantly enhanced the removal efficiency resulting in a dramatic improvement as compared to ec experiments in fact oh produced from eq 4 oxidized the organic material eps composed mainly of polysaccharides proteins and dna humic like substances lipids and cell membranes phospholipids and amino acids ultimately provoking cell disruption and sludge floc disintegration yu et al 2018 this process released the bound water and exposed the cellular material eps to further oh attacks leading to mineralization of small molecules such as amino acids carbohydrates proteins peptides alcohols epoxides and carboxylic acids erden and filibeli 2010 neyens et al 2004 additionally it has been reported that the cleavage of macromolecules during oh oxidation in the fenton process diminishes the strength of sludge flocs resulting in a decrease of viscosity pham et al 2010 in this way sludge conditioning and stabilization was effectuated by an intricate coagulation fenton s oxidation process coagulation contributed to 41 and 37 of cod and toc removal efficiencies respectively only slightly lower than fenton oxidation which accounted for 48 and 38 of cod and toc removal respectively fig 1 fe oxyhydoxy precipitates assisted the destabilization of the sludge flocs by compression of the double layer of colloidal particles charge neutralization and entrapment in the fe coagulants harif et al 2012 then one fraction of the organic material eps cells and by products from oh cleavage was removed by adsorption and complexation on fe hydroxides species that precipitated following flocculation moreno casillas et al 2007 the oxidation and coagulation mechanisms taking place during ecp are schematized in fig 2 while the inset panel shows the production of fe coagulants and oh in the ecp reactor the inset panel in fig 1 depicts the visual appearance of the samples throughout the experimental period 3 2 ecp optimization taking into account preliminary experiments ecp was selected as the most suitable conditioning and stabilizing method optimization was then carried out with relation to the main parameters affecting ecp performance namely ph current and h2o2 fe2 ratio 3 2 1 effect of current density current density is a key operating parameter affecting the performance of electrochemical processes by controlling the rate of electrochemical reactions in the case of ec and related processes it is particularly important as current is directly linked to the release of fe2 ions eq 1 which generally follows the faraday s law in general fe2 is quickly oxidized as the ph increases eq 2 forming fe oh 3 as the main coagulant species lakshmanan et al 2009 the amount of fe oh 3 species in solution then determines the coagulation efficiency garcia segura et al 2017 in this work no fe2 was detected in solution after 2 h of ecp which can be accounted for by the progressive increase of ph constant stirring and the presence of h2o2 in addition current controls the cathodic evolution of h2 eq 3 which entails an increase of ph during electrolysis when h2o2 is used ecp the amount of dissolved fe2 fe 3 also determines the production of oh through the fenton s reaction eq 4 thus the performance of ecp was investigated at different current values 3 08 ma cm 2 15 38 ma cm 2 and 30 77 ma cm 2 with initial ph 5 and h2o2 fe2 5 following preliminary tests results are presented in fig 3 showing that ecp performance improved as current increased from 3 08 ma cm 2 to 15 38 ma cm 2 with the latter value giving the best tss cod and toc removal efficiencies of 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 respectively this behaviour can be explained by the increase of fe2 ions with current density according to the faraday s law thus a higher coagulant dose enhanced the coagulation efficiency while at the same time more fe2 fe3 free ions in solution increased oh production and consequently improved the efficiency of fenton oxidation however the application of a higher current value 30 77 ma cm 2 did not result in further efficiency improvement owing to i the higher reaction rate of h2o2 decomposition at the anode eqs 11 and 12 ii coagulant overdosing that can modify the charge of aggregates causing their redispersion and decreasing the coagulation flocculation efficiency harif and adin 2011 and most importantly iii an excess of fe2 ions promoting the competitive waste reactions 13 and 14 consuming oh in detriment of organics oxidation with eq 13 having a higher kinetic constant k13 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 than eq 14 k 2 7 10 3 s 1 for the unimolecular decomposition of fe3 hydroxyperoxy complexes formed as intermediates brillas et al 2009 pignatello et al 2006 moreover the rise in current density accompanied by higher potential entails heat generation and higher energy consumption and thus the optimal current density of 15 38 ma cm 2 was selected for further experiments 11 h2o2 ho2 h e 12 ho2 o2 h e 13 fe2 oh fe3 ho 14 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 3 2 2 effect of ph ph plays a fundamental role in ecp as it affects iron speciation in solution as well as the complexation and redox cycling between fe ions brillas et al 2009 lakshmanan et al 2009 the aqueous chemistry of fe species determines both coagulation efficiency and the reactivity of the fenton s reaction to examine the effect of ph a series of experiments with ph ranging from 3 to 8 with 8 being the initial ph of the sludge sample were conducted under current of 15 38 ma cm 2 and h2o2 fe2 5 the results depicted in fig 4 show that ecp displayed the best efficiency under slightly acidic conditions ph 5 with 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 of tss cod and toc removal efficiencies respectively even though fenton based processes generally operate optimally in acidic medium ph between 2 and 4 pignatello et al 2006 sirés and brillas 2017 during ecp the performance is governed by both fenton s oxidation and ec it is known that ph values ranging from 5 to 8 favour the precipitation of fe oh 3 species and thus ec efficiency lakshmanan et al 2009 in this way under acidic conditions ph 3 coagulation efficiency dropped which had a dramatic impact on ecp performance on the other hand at higher ph ph 8 the rate constant of the fenton s reaction was significantly diminished as fe2 fe3 species were scarcely available in the solution hence hindering the production of oh and decreasing ecp performance furthermore the oxidation potential of oh in alkaline conditions is lower than in acidic solutions 1 90 v vs she at ph 7 vs 2 8 v vs she at ph 3 burbano et al 2005 thus ph 5 was the optimal value that favoured both coagulation and fenton s oxidation these findings demonstrate that fenton s oxidation alone could not deal with the high amount of tss efficiently and ec alone was hindered by the high organic content of the sludge yet a synergy between both processes made effective treatment possible in order to understand the efficiency of the fenton s reaction at ph 5 during ecp it is important to keep in mind that although the fenton s reaction performs optimally at acidic values it can also take place at higher ph values but with slower kinetics because of the lower reactivity of hydrolysed fe3 species furthermore organic substances play a significant role in the complexation of fe ions both in aqueous phase and on the surface of amorphous aggregates at different ph values fe complexes in solution at near neutral ph values promote the activation of h2o2 and o2 to form oh and or high valence fe oxidizing species ferrates fe iv eq 15 that contribute to the oxidation of organics belanzoni et al 2009 de luca et al 2014 moreover fe species on the surface of coagulant particles can promote heterogeneous fenton like reactions in a wide ph range wang et al 2016 organic ligands also intervene in the reduction of fe3 to fe2 to maintain the catalytic cycle of the fenton process bolobajev et al 2015 fukuchi et al 2014 15 fe2 l h2o2 fe3 l oh oh these results contrast with previous works that reported that 3 was the optimal ph for ecp under the argument that oh oxidation was the prevailing degradation mechanism akyol et al 2013 guan et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 it should be noted here that the above mentioned works dealt with non viscous wastewater with low content of organic matter and suspended solids where the coagulation effect on organics was not taken into account these discrepancies show that ecp performance strongly depends on the physicochemical properties of the waste material and the contribution of the dominant degradation mechanisms under optimal operating conditions 3 2 3 effect of h2o2 fe2 ratio h2o2 is crucial in fenton based processes because oh formation is directly dependent upon fe2 and h2o2 concentrations in general the efficiency increases as the h2o2 fe2 ratio rises but the optimal ratio depends on the characteristics of the effluent and the experimental conditions akyol et al 2013 moussavi and aghanejad 2014 pilli et al 2015 thus the effect of h2o2 concentration h2o2 fe2 ratio of 1 5 and 10 was evaluated under current density of 15 38 ma cm 2 and ph 5 the results show that the removal efficiency was slightly higher at h2o2 fe2 5 fig 5 moreover the properties of the fe sludge obtained at the end of the 2 h treatment were also affected by the amount of h2o2 the dewaterability evaluation of the fe sludge in terms of sludge filterability showed that fe sludge obtained with h2o2 fe2 1 had lower filterability 38 8 s ml 1 than the sludge obtained with h2o2 fe2 5 18 7 s ml 1 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the greater level of mineralization of organic matter attained with greater concentrations of oh formed at higher h2o2 to fe2 ratios in this way the degradation of organic material eps and other macromolecules with h2o2 fe2 1 was less efficient and bigger molecules with higher molecular weight were still present in solution lower mineralization degree which impacted the rheological properties of the sample reflected in a higher resistance to filtration on the contrary lower molecular weight compounds were formed with the 5 ratio resulting in fe sludge with higher dewaterability as expected the difference in organic composition between samples at different h2o2 fe2 ratios was not reflected in the cod and toc values the effect of polymeric substances on sludge morphology and compatibility has been reported in past investigations erdincler and vesilind 2000 finally at h2o2 fe2 10 higher amounts of h2o2 resulted in decreased efficiency owing to parasitic reactions that do not contribute to the oxidation of organics mainly waste consumption of oh by excess h2o2 according to eq 16 additionally at a concentration higher than the optimum value h2o2 may self decompose to h2o and o2 leading to reduced oh production following eq 17 h2o2 is also decomposed via its oxidation at the anode following eqs 11 and 12 16 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 17 2h2o2 o2 h2o 3 2 4 fe sludge cake properties after 2 h of ecp treatment under optimal conditions ph 5 15 38 ma cm 2 of current and h2o2 fe2 5 the settled fe sludge cake was vacuum filtered after adjusting the ph to 9 dried at 105 c and further analysed 21 90 g of dry dewatered sludge were obtained whose chemical composition is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the sludge cake contained high amounts or organic carbon ppo4 nnh4 and no3 as an indication of good fertilizing properties these ionic species precipitated with the coagulants furthermore the analysis of heavy metals table s1 revealed that all the species that were measured were below the permissible levels for agricultural soil established by the european legislation table s1 as expected fe was present in the sludge at high concentration of 44 98 mg g 1 however the beneficial use of fe biosolids in land and agricultural applications has been reported brown et al 2012 moreover ec sludge with high contents of al or fe has also shown potential as pigments construction materials and ceramic membranes tang and shih 2014 besides the chemical properties of the sludge it is worthy of note that sludge dewatering was significantly increased by ecp filterability increased from 2815 63 s ml 1 initially to 18 7 s ml 1 after 2 h of ecp resulting in a negligible amount of dry solid that needs to be disposed only 21 90 g of dry sludge out of 400 ml of sample 3 4 ef post treatment ecp alone was able to achieve tss cod and toc removal yields of 85 6 89 3 and 75 4 respectively however the filtrate obtained after dewatering still contained a high concentration of cod and toc 2800 2 and 1287 8 mg l 1 respectively accordingly the remaining effluent was further treated by means of ef using a bdd anode and a carbon brush cathode the aim was to make use of the outstanding ef capacity to mineralize organic pollutants as stated in previous studies lin et al 2017 mousset et al 2017 olvera vargas et al 2014 the sample was acidified to ph 3 prior to ef experiments interestingly the fenton s reaction was catalysed by the remnant amount of fe2 fe3 ions from the ecp process 7 35 mg l 1 which was close to the optimal amount of fe2 catalyst generally reported for ef between 3 58 and 17 93 mg l 1 garcia rodriguez et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2018 the use of the remaining fe ions in solution following ec as source of catalyst was reported in earlier works on coupled ec ef systems anfruns estrada et al 2017 thiam et al 2014 fig 6 depicts the optimization of current density for cod and toc removal during ef as expected the concentration of organic matter decreased with time due to the oxidative attack of oh formed i homogeneously through the fenton s reaction eq 4 and ii heterogeneously on the bdd surface according to eq 7 the performance increased with current density up to 25 ma cm 2 with respect to the anode surface but further increase to 37 5 ma cm 2 did not result in any further enhancement this behaviour is simply explained by the non oxidative waste reactions promoted at higher current values the reduction of h2o2 and the evolution of h2 competing with h2o2 formation at the cathode and the evolution of o2 at the anode detrimental to bdd oh production olvera vargas et al 2014 sopaj et al 2016 following 4 h treatment under optimal current density 25 ma cm 2 the remaining cod and toc contents after ecp were reduced by 90 and 63 respectively representing an overall removal efficiency of 99 10 and 93 18 for cod and toc respectively as compared to the initial sample it is worth mentioning that the solution became clear after only 2 h of ef remarkably after 8 h of ef the cod and toc were reduced to 22 6 and 16 3 mg l 1 respectively more than 99 of the initial sample as a reference the cod was reduced to below 50 mg l 1 after 6 h of ef allowing discharge in controlled watercourse as regulated by the nea of singapore the overall evolution of cod and toc during the sequential ecp ef process 2 h ecp plus 4 h ef is displayed in fig 7 alongside photographs of the sample at various treatment stages table 3 summarizes the main results obtained with the integrated ecp ef process 90 tss was removed by ecp while the rest was removed by ef overall 90 of tss removal regarding nitrogenous species it can be seen that the amount of no3 decreased during the first hour of ecp owing to its precipitation with fe oh 3 coagulants followed by a progressive increase until a final concentration of 262 1 mg l 1 was attained after 8 h of ef treatment in contrast nh4 n increased sharply in the first hour of ecp reaching 2250 2 mg l 1 then decreased after 2 h of ecp due to the coagulation flocculation process aoudj et al 2017 during ef nh4 n increased progressively reaching 1890 3 mg l 1 after 8 h the increase of no3 and nh4 n was due to the continuous disintegration of nitrogen rich compounds such as proteins nucleic acids and urea promoted by unselective oh attack regarding po4 3 a great fraction was precipitated during the ecp process reaching a low concentration of 78 6 mg l 1 after 2 h po4 3 concentration then increased during ef due to the continuous mineralization of the remaining organic substances such as phospholipids present in membrane cells the release and accumulation of inorganic ions during ef following the mineralization of organics containing heteroatoms such as n p s and cl is well documented dirany et al 2012 olvera vargas et al 2014 the final effluent can be seen as an important source of p and n nutrient recovery could be achieved for example by chemical or electrochemical precipitation with magnesium to form struvite fertilizer kruk et al 2014 t zhang et al 2017b finally the analysis of total coliforms revealed that the integrated ecp ef process was equally efficient for disinfection coliforms were totally removed following the first hour of ecp and no more coliforms were detected during the consecutive treatment stages the analysis of the solid cake obtained after ecp did not show any coliform colonies either this is a remarkable finding if land application is considered for final disposal these results demonstrate the synergistic effect of ec and fenton s oxidation to disrupt cells and promote the mineralization of the organic material released and are in agreement with previous works that have stated the disinfection capability of eaops anfruns estrada et al 2017 cotillas et al 2018 3 5 cost evaluation and comparison the cost for the overall ecp ef treatment was estimated according to the method described in section 2 4 the total cost per litre of sludge including conditioning ph adjustment and na2so4 addition ecp sludge dewatering precipitation of iron excess at ph 9 and vacuum filtration dry sludge disposal ef post treatment 4 h and final neutralization was estimated to be s 0 036 l 1 us 0 027 l 1 as observed in fig 8 a the chemical costs represent the largest percentage 64 while power sludge management and anode consumption costs account for the remaining fraction 29 6 and 2 respectively the cost breakdown for each stage depicted in fig 8b indicates that the intermediate operations conditioning and sludge management corresponded to 19 and 7 respectively of course it should be reminded here that these calculations are based on a bench scale system larger prototypes may require higher energy costs than chemical costs owing to higher current inputs needed for larger electrode surfaces in order to maintain the optimal current density el naas et al 2016 the comparison of different sludge treatment technologies is complicated firstly because treatment depends on the characteristics of the sludge and secondly because of the properties and fate of the final sludge and or effluent conditioning methods based on aops are generally applied as pretreatment techniques aiming at improving the efficiency of anaerobic digestion by reducing tss and increasing the biodegradability wang et al 2017 remarkably the ecp ef process proposed in this work is a comprehensive treatment strategy yielding a small amount of dry sludge and clean liquid water with minimal content of organic matter the dry sludge rich in organic and inorganic nutrients and free of hazardous pathogens is suitable for land application for sustainable nutrient management gude and gnaneswar 2015 it is already known that eaops for wastewater treatment can outcompete other aops in terms of cost efficiency cañizares et al 2009 and here we show that the same premises are applicable to sludge treatment for example the full scale ozonation pre treatment of waste activated sludge was required around 1 30 per ton of tss and only reduced the production of dry sludge by 10 in a wwtp romero et al 2015 in contrast we estimate the cost of our ecp ef system at 2 10 per ton of tss with the production of dry sludge reduced by 94 5 based on the data reported by li et al 2016 on the treatment of was by ec electrochemically activated persulfate at lab scale the cost was around us 4 76 l 1 sludge vs us 0 026 l 1 sludge for ecp ef in this study which they claimed to be 42 14 cheaper than conventional fenton even if these approximations should be taken with care they provide a general idea of the potential and economic advantages of the proposed ecp ef system for comprehensive treatment of digested sludge finally the ecp ef process disclosed in this study shows excellent potential as a small scale decentralised treatment with which water could be reused for non potable purposes on site water recycling electrochemical systems of this kind have been recently implemented to treat toilet wastewater followed by reuse for flushing cid et al 2018 4 conclusions in this study a sequential electrochemical treatment was applied to treat anaerobic sludge from a poultry farm the recommended two step integrated ecp ef treatment consisted in i 2 h ecp at ph 5 current density of 15 38 ma cm 2 and h2o2 fe2 5 followed by ii 8 h ef treatment of the effluent recovered after dewatering at ph 3 and 25 ma cm 2 during the ecp stage the sludge was efficiently destabilized and conditioned by the synergistic effects of electrocoagulation and fenton oxidation which enhanced the dewaterability and reduced the amount of sludge only 21 9 g of dry fe sludge rich in c n and p produced the residual effluent after dewatering was subjected to ef during which the excess of organic matter was efficiently mineralized by means of oh the effluent after 2 h ecp and 8 h ef contained only 24 6 and 16 3 mg l 1 of cod and toc respectively the estimated total operational treatment cost was s 0 036 l 1 sludge in conclusion this promising ecp ef process is presented as a sustainable alternative for comprehensive sludge remediation capable of producing a reduced volume of solid sludge suitable for land application while the recovered water is amenable to discharge or reuse acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the singapore ministry of education academic research fund tier 1 wbs

18987,in wastewater recycle for potable purposes virus removal is the most critical issue from the public health stand point therefore the regulatory agency sets minimum virus removal efficiencies that must be met by combining multiple treatment processes in most potable reuse processes reverse osmosis ro plays a critical role by removing salts viruses dissolved organic matters etc it has been reported that ro removes viruses at over 6 log efficiencies but it receives no more than 2 log credits from regulatory agencies due to the lack of sensitive integrity monitoring technologies better than conductivity based technologies in recent years fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring fmim has drawn special attention because of its simplicity capability of continuous monitoring and the high resolution lab and field studies have shown fmim can provide around 4 log resolution for commercially available ro membranes in this study potential and limitation of current fmim technology are reviewed further ideas to improve the resolution beyond 4 log are suggested graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane integrity wastewater recycle potable wastewater reuse virus removal reverse osmosis 1 introduction freshwater shortages have been worsening in many parts of the world in recent decades as consequence unconventional waters are being used as potable water e g municipal or industrial wastewaters low quality river lake or pond waters etc though currently available technologies can produce potable water from nearly any type of waters concerns are remaining on potential pathogenic contamination that can cause public health crisis in potable reuse of secondary effluent most of the existing systems are based on microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf followed by reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation process aop trussell et al 2017 steinle darling et al 2015 shu et al 2014 in those systems mf uf targets mainly suspended solids while ro targets soluble species such as salts and soluble organics aop serves as a polishing step removing residual trace organics and pathogens additional unit processes such as ozone biofilter thermal treatment degassing uv treatment chlorination chloramination etc can be added to enhance the treatment efficiency while meeting the minimum pathogen removal requirements in the us potable wastewater reuse is tightly regulated by regulatory agencies of each state grevatt 2017 all states mandate potable reuse plants to meet minimum pathogen removal criteria e g 12 log virus 10 log cryptosporidium and 10 log giardia in california state regulatory agencies award removal credits to each unit process for each pathogen based on the capability of removing pathogen and the capability of monitoring the process combining all the credits given to each unit process for each pathogen total removal credits must be equal or greater than the minimum removal criteria under this regulatory structure it is crucial to obtain the maximum pathogen removal credits that each unit process deserves for two reasons 1 redundant pathogen removal credits are necessary to avoid shutting down the whole system when any unit process fails and 2 capital costs can be minimized by avoiding redundant unit processes of which sole purpose is securing pathogen removal credits in potable wastewater reuse processes ro plays a central role by providing a nonporous barrier that can remove not only nanoparticles but also soluble contaminants it has been known that ro can remove residual pathogens at a very high efficiency of over 6 log jacangelo et al 2017 mi et al 2004 but ro does not receive the credits it deserves from the regulatory agencies due to the lack of sensitive monitoring technologies today electrical conductivity ec is being used as a mean to estimate membrane integrity but due to the low salt rejection efficiencies ro is eligible to only up to 2 log removal credits for all pathogens therefore it is imperative to come up with more sensitive ro membrane integrity monitoring technologies various methods have been studied based on the rejection efficiencies of sulfate total organic carbon toc sucrose natural fluorescence artificial fluorescent tracers etc sulfate based method provides substantially greater resolution than conductivity based method 3 log vs 2 log but extra sulfate needs to be dosed to ro feed to secure at least 0 1 mg l in ro permeate for accurate measurement kruithof et al 2001 the added sulfate can cause calcium and barium sulfate scales in the system in addition it is difficult to realize continuous monitoring system because there are no readily available inline sulfate sensors toc based methods can provide only slightly better resolution than conductivity based methods up to 2 5 log but it requires costly toc analyzer and laborious instrument maintenance to guarantee the accuracy ostarcevic et al 2018 sucrose or sucralose can provide 2 5 3 5 log resolution but the injected sucrose sucralose to ro can cause biofouling at the required dosages of 300 600 mg l trussell et al 2017 while none of the methods discussed in above paragraph do not provide decisive advantages over conductivity based methods fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring fmim provides clear advantages fmim not only provides high resolution of up to 4 log but also is capable of real time continuous membrane integrity monitoring carstea et al 2018 trussell et al 2017 pype et al 2016 it is also economical because solid state inline fluorometers are commercially available and they do not require heavy maintenance trussell et al 2017 in this paper potential and limitation of fmim technology are reviewed by reviewing the fluorescence leaking mechanisms in ro potential methods to improve the resolution of fmim are also suggested 2 fundamentals of ro membrane 2 1 rejection mechanisms the dense polyamide layer on the top of ro membrane consists of linear and crosslinked polymeric chains through which water molecules permeate there are two types of water channels on polyamide layer namely intramolecular spaces with a size of 2 1 2 4 å and intermolecular spaces with a size of 3 5 4 5 å kim et al 2005 therefore molecules substantially larger than intermolecular spaces can hardly pass ro membrane due to the steric hindrance meanwhile charged species are easily rejected by polyamide layer regardless of their sizes due to dielectric exclusion yaroshchuk 2000 as a charged species in liquid approaches to a liquid solid interface a same kind of bound charge is induced in the solid surface if dielectric constants of liquid and solids are different as illustrated in fig 1 since dielectric constants of water and polyamide are very different i e 80 vs 2 3 charged species in water phase tend to be expelled from the polyamide surface alongside the magnitude of dielectric exclusion is proportional to ionic charges that multivalent ions are repelled more strongly than monovalent ions 2 2 rejection efficiencies of various species as discussed in the previous section only smaller species than intermolecular spaces can pass ro membrane but if they are electrically charged they are mostly rejected by dielectric exclusion mechanism for example sodium ions are much smaller than intramolecular spaces in polyamide layer e g 2 4 å marcus 1988 vs 3 5 4 5 å but they are rejected typically at 99 efficiencies meanwhile divalent ions are rejected better than monovalent ions since the magnitude of dielectric exclusion is proportional to charges for example magnesium ions are smaller than sodium ions 2 07 å vs 2 4 å but their rejection efficiency is greater i e 99 6 vs 99 2 in seawater desalination ludwig 2010 in theory any species larger than intermolecular spaces of polyamide layer are rejected 100 regardless of their charges but it has been observed that many large molecules can pass ro membranes to some extent as shown in fig 2 yoon 2016 for example sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 are slightly larger than intermolecular spaces e g 4 8 å for both ions marcus 1988 and they have charges but rejection efficiencies are not 100 meanwhile amino tris methylene phosphonic acid or atmp are more unlikely to pass ro membrane because it is much larger than sulfate and phosphate but the rejection efficiency of atmp is still not 100 but 99 98 rhodamine wt and trasar dye which is a nalco water s proprietary fluorescent tracer are larger than atmp with molecular weights of 567 da and 610 da respectively and both have net negative charges ostarcevic et al 2018 but their rejection efficiencies are not better than atmp s in other lab scale studies surawanvijit et al 2015 frenkel et al 2014 mi et al 2004 lozier et al 2003 similar rejection efficiencies have been observed with various fluorescent tracers although leakages through mechanical parts can be rigorously controlled by using small scale plate and frame modules the slight leakage of around 0 02 even in rigorously controlled lab tests suggests the existence of defects in membrane itself especially the little or no differences in rejection efficiencies among variously sized species suggest that there are large enough defects that allow all species to pass at a same rate since the diffusive transport of the molecules larger than atmp through the small intermolecular space is highly unlikely convective transport through defects is considered the dominant mechanism of leak in fact rhodamine wt is at least 4 times larger than intermolecular spaces e g 20 1 å vs 3 5 4 5 å frenkel et al 2014 as will be discussed in the next section some extent of membrane defects is inevitable from the practical standpoint because defects are in a trade off relation with membrane s water permeability 2 3 defects in ro membrane today virtually all ro membranes used in potable reuse applications are based on thin film composite tfc technology where membrane consists of nonwoven polyester layer in the bottom nanoporous polysulfone layer in the middle and nonporous polyamide layer on to top in tfc membrane the property of polysulfone layer directly affects the membrane performance because it provides a foundation for polyamide layer misdan et al 2013 huang and mccutcheon 2015 polysulfone layer should provide even and smooth surface to polyamide thin film it also needs to be highly porous to minimize hydraulic resistance while pores are small enough to minimize the intrusion of polyamide solution during the interfacial polymerization the nominal pore size of the polysulfone middle layer is 0 015 μm or so dupont 2018 but some extent of pore size distribution and defects are inevitable after polysulfone layer is casted on polyester fabric very thin polyamide layer with well less than 0 1 μm thickness is casted by dipping it in polymeric amine and then diisocyanate solutions before being heat treated pinnau and freeman 1999 in this process the areas with excessively large pores or defects are particularly prone to develop defects because dilute polyamide solutions can penetrate polysulfone layer by capillary suction force as depicted in fig 3 simultaneously varying extents of cracks can develop when solvents are evaporating from the dilute polyamide coating solution depending on curing condition the nature and the concentration of surfactants added in casting solution existence of impurities etc yoo et al 2018 mansourpanah et al 2009 tang et al 2009 singh et al 2006 defects of tfc membrane can be minimized by increasing the depth of polyamide layer in membrane manufacturing thicker polyamide layer not only has a less chance of developing cracks but also can cover up some of the defects in polysulfone middle layer seawater membranes are known to have thicker polyamide layer than brackish water membranes to provide an extra high salt rejection efficiency therefore they have a greater fluorescence dye rejection efficiency according to a side by side test yoon 2016 trasar dye rejection efficiency of seawater membranes is greater than brackish water membrane s e g 99 996 vs 99 98 from the salt passage perspective seawater membrane s fluorescent tracer passage is only 1 5 of brackish water membrane s e g 0 004 vs 0 02 the thick polyamide layer can improve salt rejection efficiency but salt rejection efficiency is generally in trade off relation with water permeability because thick polyamide layer causes high hydraulic resistance that in turn necessitates high operating pressures therefore the highest salt rejection efficiency cannot be achieved simultaneously with the highest water permeability commercial ro membranes are optimized to achieve acceptable salt rejection efficiencies and water permeabilities simultaneously for the market they are targeted 2 4 dynamic membrane effect in mf and uf filtration some extent of membrane fouling is unavoidable because contaminants are carried to membrane surface by the convective flow that permeates through membrane if defects exist in membrane surface contaminant transportation is particularly fast near the defects because hydraulic resistances are low in those regions moderately sized defects are quickly sealed by the contaminants while gel or cake layer is formed across the membrane surface gel layer is also called dynamic membrane because it can act as a separation layer the dynamic membrane plays important role particularly in mf uf because gel layer has smaller effective pore sizes than the actual membrane yoon 2015 as a result virus rejection efficiencies of mf and uf are almost equal at 4 log despite the vastly different pore sizes e g 0 03 μm vs 0 45 μm hirani et al 2010 the similar dynamic membrane effects exist in ro when membranes are clean unhindered convective flow carries contaminants toward defects as defects are plugged up by nom and other contaminants convective flows through the defects gradually slow down and rejection efficiency increases subsequently gel layer is formed over the membrane surface as depicted in fig 4 and behave as dynamic membrane though gel layers are not an efficient barrier for tiny ionic species because it lacks a strong dielectric exclusion mechanism discussed in section 2 1 1 but it can reject larger species partially or fully e g fluorescent tracer viruses soluble polymeric materials etc in a pilot study lozier et al 2003 prefiltered secondary effluent was treated using ro membranes with 10 100 μm pinholes it was observed that pinholes did not affect virus rejection efficiencies as long as they did not penetrate the whole membrane sheets this observation suggests that the polysulfone middle layer can reject viruses when polyamide layer is damaged if pinholes penetrate deeper through polysulfone layer and reach polyester backing material contaminants in secondary effluent can seal them quickly and stop the convective leaks in the same study even if pinholes penetrated the whole membrane sheet virus rejection efficiency was eventually recovered to the original level dynamic membrane can also affect the rejection efficiency of smaller species than virus when chlorine damaged membranes were used in a field test salts and trasar dye rejection efficiencies were initially 1 02 log and 1 37 log respectively unpublished data but they increased gradually to 1 25 log and 3 70 log respectively in 6 h as shown in fig 5 the gradual improvements of rejection efficiencies are attributed to the defects sealed gradually by the contaminants in feed water in a linear scale salts rejection increased by 3 85 from 90 55 to 94 40 while trasar dye rejection increased by 4 22 from 95 76 to 99 98 it is considered that trasar dye rejection increased more than salts rejection because gel layer rejects more tracers than salts due to the size differences 2 5 use of surrogates to determine minimum pathogen removal the size of smallest enteric virus is around 20 nm in theory none of pathogens can pass non porous ro membranes because viruses are far larger than the intramolecular spaces of polyamide layer of which size ranges at 3 5 4 5 å kim et al 2005 therefore viruses can leak through ro membrane only when there are defects larger than 20 nm in membrane o rings or glue lines of membrane element if defects are large enough to pass virus they also allow any species smaller than virus to pass freely therefore conservative virus rejection efficiencies can be estimated based on the rejection efficiencies of salts fluorescent tracers sugars etc log removal value lrv is typically used to rate the removal capability of ro in wastewater recycle and is defined as eq 1 1 lrv log 10 c p e r m c f e e d where c f e e d and c p e r m are the concentrations of the species in interest in feed and permeate and c p e r m c f e e d equals to the passage rate according to this equation the tracer rejection efficiency 99 98 shown in fig 2 corresponds to 3 7 log while sodium rejection efficiency 99 61 corresponds to 2 4 log indeed these lrvs are much lower than virus ms2 phage based lrv observed in the field i e 6 log lozier et al 2003 3 fmim based on natural background fluorescence 3 1 source of natural background fluorescence naturally occurring waters contain low level organic contaminants called humic and fulvic acids produced during the degradation of plants and animal remains by random biological and chemical reactions those organics with random molecular structures are known to have fluorescent properties in broad ranges of excitation emission wavelengths sierra et al 2005 raw sewages also contain various organics with fluorescent properties e g polysaccharides proteins oils grease recalcitrant organics artificial colors and brighteners from food and laundry products riboflavin etc fig 6 shows an eem matrices of river water and raw sewage which are obtained by monitoring the emission strengths at a range of wavelengths at various excitation wavelength henderson et al 2009 five key fluorescence peaks have been identified e g peak a humic like eem 237 260 nm 400 500 nm peak b tyrosine like eem 225 237 nm 309 321 nm peak c1 c2 humic like eem 300 370 nm 400 500 nm peak t1 tryptophan like eem 275 nm 340 nm and peak t2 tryptophan like eem 225 237 nm 340 381 nm hudson et al 2007 valencia et al 2013 henderson et al 2009 mladenov et al 2018 fluorescence rejection efficiencies of ro membrane can be calculated by comparing the intensities of one or more peaks in feed and permeate eem charts 3 2 characteristics of ro feed water in potable wastewater reuse in potable wastewater reuse biologically treated sewage or wastewater called secondary effluent is filtered by using one or more of mf uf membranes multimedia sand filters cartridge bag filter etc to meet the minimum silt density index sdi requirement for ro membrane elements despite the prefiltration soluble organics with fluorescent properties are not filtered and fed to ro singh et al 2009 therefore minimum virus rejection efficiencies by ro can be estimated based on the rejection efficiency of those fluorescent soluble organics while secondary effluent contains various soluble organics originated from microorganisms molecules larger than 20 kda are mostly removed by mf membranes with 0 45 μm nominal pore sizes hong et al 2018 as a result majority of the molecules contained in ro feed water are smaller than 4 8 kda and a substantial portion of them are smaller than 0 5 kda in fact membranes are known to remove much smaller species than their pore sizes in practical conditions because the cake gel layer formed on membrane surface provides a much tighter filtration surface than the actual membrane as discussed in section 2 4 in other studies jang et al 2006 2007 submerged mf membranes rated at 0 4 μm removed soluble organics larger than 40 kda from activated sludge when the organics contained in mf permeate was analyzed multiple peaks were observed in the molecular weight distribution curve at 260 da 350 da 600 da and 1000 da which represented 81 of the total soluble organics in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod 3 3 use of background fluorescence for ro membrane integrity monitoring as discussed in section 3 1 ro feed water originated from recycled wastewater has natural background fluorescence the extent of membrane integrity can be estimated by comparing fluorescence peaks in feed and permeate eem charts according to pilot studies in the field pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 background fluorescence based rejection efficiencies range between 96 and 99 5 or 1 4 log to 2 3 log in municipal wastewater recycle processes depending on the peaks chosen in eem charts the ro membranes used and the filtration conditions this extent of rejection efficiency is only comparable to the salt rejection efficiency measured by ec it is considered that the low rejection of background fluorescence is because a large portion of organics contained in a filtered secondary effluent are smaller than 0 5 kda as discussed in section 3 2 fig 7 shows eem charts of 50 times diluted ro feed water and ro permeate with no dilution where peaks i ii and iii represent humic like organics pype et al 2013 it was found that the rejection efficiency based on region ii was the highest at 99 5 while region iii 99 2 and region i 98 9 follow the same trend was observed when the experiments were repeated in other location these observations suggest that the organics causing region ii are the largest while those causing region i are the smallest if membrane integrity is monitored based on the rejection efficiency of the largest background organics in feed and permeate greater resolution can be achieved in a study pype et al 2013 large background organics were separated from small ones by using size exclusion chromatography sec before fluorescence was measured at eem peaks of 305 nm 385 and 335 nm 440 nm much greater rejection efficiencies of 99 9 were obtained from both peaks 3 4 potential and limitations of using natural fluorescence the resolutions of natural background fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring is largely equivalent to those of total organic carbon toc based methods pype et al 2013 trussell et al 2017 but fluorescence based methods are more practical it is because inline fluorescence analyzers do not require any moving parts or reagents which makes them more cost effective and maintenance friendly than toc analyzers however a few limitations are noteworthy most noticeably the resolution of natural fluorescence based method is not much greater than that of simpler conductivity based methods e g 1 4 2 3 log vs 1 5 2 log pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 if sec is combined with fluorescence monitoring as discussed in the previous section 3 log resolution can be obtained but greater capital and operating expenses are expected natural fluorescence based methods are also affected by the extent of pretreatment before ro if advanced oxidations e g ozone uv h2o2 etc are employed to polish secondary effluent before ro background fluorescence can decline below the threshold necessary to secure strong enough fluorescence in permeate for example depending on the extent of ozonation background fluorescence in ro feed fluctuated between 1 and 5 μg l as trasar dye in potable wastewater reuse trussell et al 2017 if background fluorescence is 1 μg l as trasar dye and rejection efficiency is 99 5 permeate will contain only 5 ng l as trasar dye which might be prone to large measurement errors lastly the strength of natural fluorescence is not consistent because it varies depending on the quality and quantity of organics contained in secondary effluent it has been well known that activated sludge process is vulnerable to upset conditions depending on water temperature organic loading existence of toxic chemicals in influent dissolved oxygen etc yoon 2015 therefore accuracy and resolution of natural fluorescence based fmim can be a concern although no long term observations throughout all seasons of a year have been reported 4 fmim based on fluorescent tracers 4 1 advantages of using fluorescent tracers the low resolution of natural fluorescence based fmim can be overcome by using artificial fluorescent tracers in this method sufficient signal strengths can be secured in both feed and permeate streams regardless of the water quality in addition fluorescent tracers provide a better resolution because their rejection efficiencies are greater than background fluorescence e g up to 4 log vs 1 4 2 3 log trussell et al 2017 pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 the high tracer rejection efficiency is a consequence of the monodisperse nature of fluorescent tracers with high molecular weights 4 2 desired properties of fluorescent tracer in potable wastewater reuse the most critical requirement for fluorescent tracers is the ability of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for potable water nsf60 certification and for discharge to surface water bodies npdes permit lozier et al 2003 while the dosage of fluorescent tracer should remain below the maximum limit allowed it should be sufficient to provide necessary signal strengths in ro permeate to determine accurate lrv it is also important that the excitation and emission peaks of fluorescent tracers are not overlapped with the peaks of background organics shown in figs 6 and 7 to minimize the interferences from the background fluorescence high quantum yield is desired to quantify fluorescent tracers at ultralow concentrations because minimizing tracer dosages is critical for economical application in addition fluorescence should not be affected substantially at the ranges of ph temperature and ionic strengths commonly found in reuse applications frenkel et al 2014 also negatively charged tracers are preferred to avoid any potential charge interactions with negatively charged antiscalants nom membrane surfaces etc they also should be compatible with biocides that might be present in ro feed water e g chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxides dbnpa etc surawanvijit et al 2015 finally invisible fluorescent tracers under sunlight at the concentration in ro concentrate are strongly preferred from the public perception standpoint 4 3 background fluorescence effect and necessary tracer dosage the background fluorescence in ro feed water negatively influence the resolution of fmim it is because rejection efficiencies of nom are on average lower than fluorescent tracers by more than 1 log e g 1 4 2 3 log vs 3 5 4 0 log trussell et al 2017 pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 in four different potable reuse trial sites background fluorescence in ro feed was found widely different at 0 84 1 5 6 8 and 9 5 μg l as trasar dye respectively mainly depending on the methods used in pretreatment unpublished data due to the lower rejection efficiencies of background organics observed lrv with fluorescent tracers tends to decline as background fluorescence increases this limitation can be overcome by using extra fluorescent tracers to overwhelm the background fluorescence as discussed below the impact of the background fluorescence on lrv δ l r v can be calculated by subtracting apparent lrv from tracer only lrv 2 δ l r v l o g 10 1 ε d c d 1 ε n c n 1 ε d c d c n where ε d and ε n are rejection efficiencies of fluorescent tracer and natural fluorescent organics respectively c d and c n are fluorescence from tracers and background organics ppb respectively in ro feed water if tracer dosage is 50 ppb and its rejection efficiency is 99 98 lrv is 3 70 according to eq 1 but if background organics in ro feed water is 5 ppb as tracer equivalent and their rejection efficiency is 99 7 δ l r v is 0 36 and as a result apparent lrv becomes 3 34 3 70 0 36 the necessary tracer dosage c d to achieve a target lrv l r v t under the presence of background fluorescence c n in ro feed water can be calculated using eq 3 3 c d 1 ε n 10 l r v t 1 ε d 10 l r v t c n where l r v t must be lower than the intrinsic tracer rejection efficiency for the same conditions used in above paragraph if l r v t is 3 5 log necessary tracer dosage c d becomes 115 ppb at this condition permeate fluorescence is 0 038 ppb as tracer where 23 ppb is contributed by tracer and 15 ppb by natural background fluorescence in fmim enough fluorescence must be present in ro permeate to secure necessary measurement accuracy fluorometers can detect fluorescence above the minimum detection limit but the accuracy is not guaranteed near that due to signal drifting and flow cell fouling in real world application therefore much greater tracer concentrations are necessary in ro permeate than the minimum detection limit the necessary fluorescent tracer dosages can be calculated as eq 4 4 c d α x 1 ε a where x is a lower detection limit of permeate fluorometer α is a multiplication factor to secure enough permeate fluorescence and ε a is an assumed average fluorescence rejection efficiency if the detection limit is 0 01 ppb multiplication factor is 10 and average rejection efficiency is 99 98 then required tracer dosage becomes 500 ppb it is apparent from the equation that the lower detection limit of permeate fluorometer is proportional to the necessary tracer dosages in addition stability and reliability of permeate fluorometer determines multiplication factor α and in turn affect the tracer dosage therefore the detection limit and the signal stability of fluorometer are the critical factor affecting the economics of fmim currently the state of the art inline fluorometers provide the lower detection limit of 0 01 ppb and 0 0004 ppb for rhodamine wt and trasar dye respectively trussell et al 2017 4 4 fluorescent tracer rejection by various ro membranes table 1 summarizes lrv of trasar dye obtained with various membranes where spiral wound elements were used unless marked otherwise yoon 2016 if same membranes were used for both lab and field tests e g company a ro1 and company b ro1 lrv tends to be slightly lower in the field perhaps due to a greater water recovery in larger scale systems in fact it is noticeable from eq 1 that lrv decreases as water recovery increases because c p e r m increases as feed water is concentrated in the table it is also noticeable that lrv rarely exceeds 4 log for all brackish water membranes even at the lab tests performed with a plate and frame module where the chances of leakage through misplaced mechanical parts are low all other lab tests performed under different settings with different tracers also have demonstrated around 4 log lrv with commercial brackish water ro membranes lozier et al 2003 frenkel et al 2014 surawanvijit et al 2015 the differences in lrv among commercial ro membranes are likely from the different degree of defects developed during manufacturing processes this is especially true for those three membranes tested under an identical condition using a plate and frame module in a linear scale the tracer passage of the average performing ro membrane is 0 03 if salts passage of the same ro membrane is 0 5 it includes 0 03 of leak through defects because salts can pass the same defects tracers pass at a same rate since that extent of leak 0 03 is not substantial in desalination presence of defect in ro membrane has not drawn substantial attention seawater membrane company a ro1 has greater lrv for fluorescent tracers 4 38 log than brackish water membrane as shown in table 1 it is because seawater membranes have tighter separation layer to produce drinking water out of highly saline water low fouling membranes for brackish water company d ro2 also showed greater lrv 4 25 log than comparable membranes potentially due to the coat layer casted on polyamide layer to mitigate membrane fouling both seawater membranes and low fouling brackish water membranes are probable to reject viruses better than regular brackish water membranes but thorough empirical studies are yet to be performed 4 5 comparison of fmim with different methods ms2 phages are commonly used as a surrogate to simulate enteric virus rejection because they are non pathogenic and similarly sized with the smallest enteric viruses fig 8 shows lrv of ms2 phage trasar dye and salts obtained from a pilot ro system treating filtered secondary effluent with intact ro membranes ms2 phage trasar dye and salts showed 6 5 log 3 6 log and 2 0 log performances respectively jacangelo et al 2017 interestingly when defective membranes with surface scratch or glue line leak are used ms2 phage rejections does not decrease but trasar dye and salts rejections decline slightly this suggests that the artificially induced defects are sealed by the gel layer that can reject large species like ms2 phage meanwhile much smaller species like trasar dye and salts still can pass the gel layer for the membranes with chlorine damage salt rejection is less than 0 1 log but trasar dye rejection is 1 6 log and ms2 phage rejection is almost 5 log when feed water leaks to permeate due to damaged o ring ms2 phage rejection is lower than those for trasar dye and salts but it is likely caused by the empirical error in virus counting since the permeate contains 106 counts ml when lrv is 1 more than 1000 times dilution is necessary for proper virus counting but such extreme dilution is prone to cause large errors due to particles settling unrepresentative sampling etc fig 9 shows the long term observation of trasar dye toc and ec based lrvs in a potable wastewater reuse demonstration plant trussell et al 2017 secondary effluent was filtered by uf before being fed to ro and water recovery was maintained 80 90 lrvs were calculated by comparing tracer concentrations in the feed and in the combined permeate from first and second stages marked as train permeate dosages of trasar dye was varied between 0 04 and 0 1 mg l as indicated in figure as results lrvs of trasar dye toc and salts were observed at 3 5 log 2 5 log and 1 7 log respectively toc rejection of 2 5 log is close to the high end of the natural fluorescence rejection efficiencies observed in many different sites as discussed in section 3 3 the background fluorescence negatively affects fluorescent tracer based lrv as discussed in section 4 3 this is because background fluorescence is less efficiently rejected by ro than fluorescent tracers if tracer dosage is reduced the dominance of tracer in lrv determination will decline and so does apparent lrv as can be calculated using eq 2 in fig 9 however the observed lrv decreased only slightly e g 0 1 0 2 log while fluorescent tracer dosage is reduced to approximately a half from 0 1 mg l to 0 04 0 05 mg l it is considered that the marginal lrv drop is due to the ozone and biological aerated filter baf used before ro to polish secondary effluent as a result background fluorescence was only 1 2 μg l as trasar dye in ro feed which was substantially lower than typical levels without such pretreatment e g 5 10 μg l 5 path forward to exceed the 4 log barrier 5 1 improving membrane integrity as discussed in section 4 4 the maximum lrv obtained with fmim is around 4 log for commercially available ro membranes in all lab scale studies published lozier et al 2003 mi et al 2004 frenkel et al 2014 surawanvijit et al 2015 yoon 2016 the slight leak of fluorescent tracer in the order of 0 01 is considered to occur in membrane itself because substantial leakages through mechanical breaches are unlikely in those tightly controlled lab scale experiments if fact it is technically hard to avoid defects when polyamide layer is casted on polysulfone layer to reduce defects in membrane manufacturing a few potential methods have been suggested as shown in section 2 3 polyamide solution can intrude into large pores formed in polysulfone layer this issue can be mitigated by using ultrahigh molecular weight polyamides when casting the separation layer if the polyamide chain dimension is larger than the largest pores of the polysulfone layer polymers hardly intrude into pores since typical polymers have coil diameters between 20 and 50 nm the optimum pore size of support membranes is smaller than about 30 nm rezac and koros 1992 however it is not easy to completely avoid a pore size distribution in polysulfone layer and eliminate any pores larger than the dimension of the polyamides other potential solution is adding a gutter layer in between polyamide and polysulfone layers yoo et al 2018 gutter layers not only provide a smooth foundation for thin film polyamide layer but also provide channels to transport water to polysulfone layer lundy and cabasso 1989 the internal network of pores in gutter layer helps entire membrane surface area to function by allowing water to permeate through the areas below which no pores exist in the underlying polysulfone layer ideally gutter layers must be much more porous than polyamide layer that they should not cause additional filtration resistance a protective layer coated on the top of polyamide layer can also help mitigate defects by plugging them up yoo et al 2018 thin film polyvinyl alcohol pva based protective layers have been used for commercial ro membranes in recent decade tang et al 2009 kim and lee 2006 hachisuka and ikeda 2001 but their main purpose is to improve membrane s antifouling properties in theory protective layer reduces surface charges so that charge interaction with membrane foulants are minimized in addition pva layer makes the membrane surface smoother that initial foulant attachment can be discouraged to some extent myung et al 2005 low fouling membranes have a potential of rejecting fluorescent tracers better than regular membranes due to the additional coating layer but they have not been studied thoroughly to date other than one example shown in table 1 5 2 use of tagged surrogates most ro membranes are capable of over 6 log virus rejections but fmim can assure only up to 4 log kitis et al 2003 lozier et al 2003 mi et al 2004 surawanvijit et al 2015 yoon 2016 it is because fmim is relying on much smaller surrogates than virus in fact the smallest viruses are around 20 nm but rhodamine wt is only 1 10 of the size at 2 01 nm frenkel et al 2014 the resolution of fmim can be improved by using large fluorescence tagged nanoparticles lozier et al 2003 fluorosphere is a microsphere with 20 nm diameter and is made by grafting fluorescent tagged polycarboxylates to polystyrene nanoparticles if there are no interferences from the background fluorescence it can be detected down to 50 ng l in a bench test intact ro membranes rejected microspheres at a greater than 5 6 log efficiencies fluorescence tagged nanoparticles should be smaller than smallest viruses to provide more conservative lrv than actual virus rejection efficiencies fluorescence tagged nanoparticles are promising in obtaining high resolution but it can potentially cause membrane fouling according to eq 4 at least 5 mg l of microspheres are necessary to obtain 6 log resolution assuming detection limit x is 50 ng l multiplication factor α is 10 the dosage of microsphere 5 mg l is high enough to cause colloidal fouling no studies have been published demonstrating ro membrane fouling by tagged nanoparticles but mf membrane fouling has been reported when tagged silica nanoparticles with 0 5 0 7 μm were dosed to mf with 0 25 μm pore size choi et al 2011 filtration resistance increased by around 10 due to the deposition of microspheres the colloidal fouling can be minimized by increasing the negative charges of tagged nanoparticles highly negatively charged nanoparticles with fluorescent tags would have less tendency to deposit on membrane due to the repulsion among themselves and with the membrane surface fluorescence tagged polymers with large enough molecular sizes can be also used to improve the resolution of fmim to improve the signal strength to dosage ratio multiple fluorescent moieties need to be tagged on one polymer strong negative charges are also necessary to minimize membrane fouling in fact polymers with strong negative charges have been successfully used as antiscalants in ro for decades e g polyacrylic acids polymaleic acids and their derivatives rahman 2013 if fluorescent moieties are tagged on those polymers with molecular weights of a few thousands to a few tens of thousands da they can provide much greater resolutions than 4 log 6 common misunderstandings 6 1 fmim is for leak detection fmim is often considered a technology for detecting leak in ro but this perception stems from the idea that there is a defining moment of ro system starts to leak as discussed above however all ro systems always leak small soluble species as well as viruses due to the defects in membrane itself and the breaches in filtration system therefore what fmim does is estimating the level of integrity based on the extent of fluorescence leaks from regulators viewpoint the quantified membrane integrity expressed as lrv can be considered a conservative virus removal efficiency if smaller species than viruses are used as a surrogate from a practical viewpoint leaking can be arbitrarily defined as a condition in which surrogate compounds pass through membrane at a greater rate than a preset threshold but that is not a rigorous leak detection 6 2 salts rejection efficiency can be correlated with virus rejection efficiency salts rejection efficiencies are lower than virus rejection efficiencies if membrane elements are intact and ro systems have no breaches but it is much easier to measure salts rejections than virus rejections therefore if correlations exist between those two virus rejection efficiency can be projected based on easily measurable salts rejection efficiencies likewise virus rejection can be projected based on fluorescent tracer rejection however there are no rigorous correlations among different membrane integrity monitoring methods conceptually correlations may exist between different methods if the loss of integrity is a consequence of gradual ageing of membrane and there are variously sized defects in any given time in the early phase of ageing existing defects start to grow while new small defects emerge increasingly more salts and virus can pass through the growing defects but salts passage is always greater than virus passage due to their smaller sizes if the lrvs of salts and virus are observed over time it may appear salts and virus rejections are linearly correlated in fact when membranes with varying degree of chlorine damage was used salts and virus rejections appeared to be correlated linearly antony et al 2016 in that study virus rejections appeared 3 times greater than salt rejections in log scale for example l log salt rejection corresponded to 3 log virus rejection and 2 log salt rejection to 6 log virus rejection from regulatory stand point however no such correlations are recognized because one catastrophic event can immediately break those correlations for example a rising differential pressure beyond the threshold can cause a telescoping of membrane elements especially when water channels are plugged up by particulates as a result a segment of glue line can be broken and all contaminants can leak through it at a same rate if so virus based lrv drops much greater than salts based lrv due to the nature of logarithmic scale and as a result the initial correlation becomes invalid therefore no rigorous correlations exist among different membrane integrity methods in real world 6 3 fmim can determine substantially beyond 4 lrv for commercial ro membranes there are literature suggesting that fmim provides much greater than 4 log resolution with commercial ro membranes e g 6 log kumar et al 2007 ostarcevic et al 2018 however it is unlikely that commercial ro membranes can reject fluorescent tracers at such a high efficiency in fact no lab tests have shown anything significantly beyond 4 lrv even though experimental conditions can be rigorously controlled lozier et al 2003 mi et al 2004 frenkel et al 2014 surawanvijit et al 2015 yoon 2016 in addition commercial ro membranes are prone to have defects when ultrathin polyamide layers are casted to obtain high water permeability due to the optimization principle between salts rejection and water permeability as discussed in section 4 4 some levels of defects are inevitable it is difficult to know the exact causes of the extremely high lrv reported in few literature without knowing detailed experimental conditions and the protocols used for data analyses but instrumental errors misinterpretation of detection limit improper experimental protocol mishandling of errors etc are potentially the culprits in one example if permeate sample is taken too early before fluorescent tracer concentration reaches a steady state in permeate lrv can be overestimated due to the underestimated tracer passage this error is more likely when tracer has positive charges that encourage the tracer to adsorb on negatively charged membrane and hence it takes longer to reach a steady state in other example if tracer concentration in permeate is close to the detection limit of fluorometer and the fluorometer is not rigorously calibrated tracer passage can be substantially underestimated 7 conclusions currently available commercial ro membranes can reject viruses at above 6 log efficiencies but there are no inline methods that can prove it in real time continuously various methods have been studied but fmim draws special attention due to its practicality and the capability of providing high lrv up to 4 log the main cause of the slight fluorescence leak is believed to be the defects formed on membrane surface during the manufacturing processes the resolution of fmim can be improved by reducing the defects in membrane to some extent but there is an inherent limitation because occurrence of defects is in tradeoff relation with water permeability of the membrane it can be also improved by using larger surrogates than the fluorescent tracers based on single dye molecule e g fluorescence tagged water soluble polymers or nanoparticles by combining the new and larger fluorescent tracers with improved ro membranes with less defects fluorescent fmim can achieve above 6 log resolution that only virus challenge tests can do today abbreviations aop advanced oxidation process atmp amino tris

18987,in wastewater recycle for potable purposes virus removal is the most critical issue from the public health stand point therefore the regulatory agency sets minimum virus removal efficiencies that must be met by combining multiple treatment processes in most potable reuse processes reverse osmosis ro plays a critical role by removing salts viruses dissolved organic matters etc it has been reported that ro removes viruses at over 6 log efficiencies but it receives no more than 2 log credits from regulatory agencies due to the lack of sensitive integrity monitoring technologies better than conductivity based technologies in recent years fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring fmim has drawn special attention because of its simplicity capability of continuous monitoring and the high resolution lab and field studies have shown fmim can provide around 4 log resolution for commercially available ro membranes in this study potential and limitation of current fmim technology are reviewed further ideas to improve the resolution beyond 4 log are suggested graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane integrity wastewater recycle potable wastewater reuse virus removal reverse osmosis 1 introduction freshwater shortages have been worsening in many parts of the world in recent decades as consequence unconventional waters are being used as potable water e g municipal or industrial wastewaters low quality river lake or pond waters etc though currently available technologies can produce potable water from nearly any type of waters concerns are remaining on potential pathogenic contamination that can cause public health crisis in potable reuse of secondary effluent most of the existing systems are based on microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf followed by reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation process aop trussell et al 2017 steinle darling et al 2015 shu et al 2014 in those systems mf uf targets mainly suspended solids while ro targets soluble species such as salts and soluble organics aop serves as a polishing step removing residual trace organics and pathogens additional unit processes such as ozone biofilter thermal treatment degassing uv treatment chlorination chloramination etc can be added to enhance the treatment efficiency while meeting the minimum pathogen removal requirements in the us potable wastewater reuse is tightly regulated by regulatory agencies of each state grevatt 2017 all states mandate potable reuse plants to meet minimum pathogen removal criteria e g 12 log virus 10 log cryptosporidium and 10 log giardia in california state regulatory agencies award removal credits to each unit process for each pathogen based on the capability of removing pathogen and the capability of monitoring the process combining all the credits given to each unit process for each pathogen total removal credits must be equal or greater than the minimum removal criteria under this regulatory structure it is crucial to obtain the maximum pathogen removal credits that each unit process deserves for two reasons 1 redundant pathogen removal credits are necessary to avoid shutting down the whole system when any unit process fails and 2 capital costs can be minimized by avoiding redundant unit processes of which sole purpose is securing pathogen removal credits in potable wastewater reuse processes ro plays a central role by providing a nonporous barrier that can remove not only nanoparticles but also soluble contaminants it has been known that ro can remove residual pathogens at a very high efficiency of over 6 log jacangelo et al 2017 mi et al 2004 but ro does not receive the credits it deserves from the regulatory agencies due to the lack of sensitive monitoring technologies today electrical conductivity ec is being used as a mean to estimate membrane integrity but due to the low salt rejection efficiencies ro is eligible to only up to 2 log removal credits for all pathogens therefore it is imperative to come up with more sensitive ro membrane integrity monitoring technologies various methods have been studied based on the rejection efficiencies of sulfate total organic carbon toc sucrose natural fluorescence artificial fluorescent tracers etc sulfate based method provides substantially greater resolution than conductivity based method 3 log vs 2 log but extra sulfate needs to be dosed to ro feed to secure at least 0 1 mg l in ro permeate for accurate measurement kruithof et al 2001 the added sulfate can cause calcium and barium sulfate scales in the system in addition it is difficult to realize continuous monitoring system because there are no readily available inline sulfate sensors toc based methods can provide only slightly better resolution than conductivity based methods up to 2 5 log but it requires costly toc analyzer and laborious instrument maintenance to guarantee the accuracy ostarcevic et al 2018 sucrose or sucralose can provide 2 5 3 5 log resolution but the injected sucrose sucralose to ro can cause biofouling at the required dosages of 300 600 mg l trussell et al 2017 while none of the methods discussed in above paragraph do not provide decisive advantages over conductivity based methods fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring fmim provides clear advantages fmim not only provides high resolution of up to 4 log but also is capable of real time continuous membrane integrity monitoring carstea et al 2018 trussell et al 2017 pype et al 2016 it is also economical because solid state inline fluorometers are commercially available and they do not require heavy maintenance trussell et al 2017 in this paper potential and limitation of fmim technology are reviewed by reviewing the fluorescence leaking mechanisms in ro potential methods to improve the resolution of fmim are also suggested 2 fundamentals of ro membrane 2 1 rejection mechanisms the dense polyamide layer on the top of ro membrane consists of linear and crosslinked polymeric chains through which water molecules permeate there are two types of water channels on polyamide layer namely intramolecular spaces with a size of 2 1 2 4 å and intermolecular spaces with a size of 3 5 4 5 å kim et al 2005 therefore molecules substantially larger than intermolecular spaces can hardly pass ro membrane due to the steric hindrance meanwhile charged species are easily rejected by polyamide layer regardless of their sizes due to dielectric exclusion yaroshchuk 2000 as a charged species in liquid approaches to a liquid solid interface a same kind of bound charge is induced in the solid surface if dielectric constants of liquid and solids are different as illustrated in fig 1 since dielectric constants of water and polyamide are very different i e 80 vs 2 3 charged species in water phase tend to be expelled from the polyamide surface alongside the magnitude of dielectric exclusion is proportional to ionic charges that multivalent ions are repelled more strongly than monovalent ions 2 2 rejection efficiencies of various species as discussed in the previous section only smaller species than intermolecular spaces can pass ro membrane but if they are electrically charged they are mostly rejected by dielectric exclusion mechanism for example sodium ions are much smaller than intramolecular spaces in polyamide layer e g 2 4 å marcus 1988 vs 3 5 4 5 å but they are rejected typically at 99 efficiencies meanwhile divalent ions are rejected better than monovalent ions since the magnitude of dielectric exclusion is proportional to charges for example magnesium ions are smaller than sodium ions 2 07 å vs 2 4 å but their rejection efficiency is greater i e 99 6 vs 99 2 in seawater desalination ludwig 2010 in theory any species larger than intermolecular spaces of polyamide layer are rejected 100 regardless of their charges but it has been observed that many large molecules can pass ro membranes to some extent as shown in fig 2 yoon 2016 for example sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 are slightly larger than intermolecular spaces e g 4 8 å for both ions marcus 1988 and they have charges but rejection efficiencies are not 100 meanwhile amino tris methylene phosphonic acid or atmp are more unlikely to pass ro membrane because it is much larger than sulfate and phosphate but the rejection efficiency of atmp is still not 100 but 99 98 rhodamine wt and trasar dye which is a nalco water s proprietary fluorescent tracer are larger than atmp with molecular weights of 567 da and 610 da respectively and both have net negative charges ostarcevic et al 2018 but their rejection efficiencies are not better than atmp s in other lab scale studies surawanvijit et al 2015 frenkel et al 2014 mi et al 2004 lozier et al 2003 similar rejection efficiencies have been observed with various fluorescent tracers although leakages through mechanical parts can be rigorously controlled by using small scale plate and frame modules the slight leakage of around 0 02 even in rigorously controlled lab tests suggests the existence of defects in membrane itself especially the little or no differences in rejection efficiencies among variously sized species suggest that there are large enough defects that allow all species to pass at a same rate since the diffusive transport of the molecules larger than atmp through the small intermolecular space is highly unlikely convective transport through defects is considered the dominant mechanism of leak in fact rhodamine wt is at least 4 times larger than intermolecular spaces e g 20 1 å vs 3 5 4 5 å frenkel et al 2014 as will be discussed in the next section some extent of membrane defects is inevitable from the practical standpoint because defects are in a trade off relation with membrane s water permeability 2 3 defects in ro membrane today virtually all ro membranes used in potable reuse applications are based on thin film composite tfc technology where membrane consists of nonwoven polyester layer in the bottom nanoporous polysulfone layer in the middle and nonporous polyamide layer on to top in tfc membrane the property of polysulfone layer directly affects the membrane performance because it provides a foundation for polyamide layer misdan et al 2013 huang and mccutcheon 2015 polysulfone layer should provide even and smooth surface to polyamide thin film it also needs to be highly porous to minimize hydraulic resistance while pores are small enough to minimize the intrusion of polyamide solution during the interfacial polymerization the nominal pore size of the polysulfone middle layer is 0 015 μm or so dupont 2018 but some extent of pore size distribution and defects are inevitable after polysulfone layer is casted on polyester fabric very thin polyamide layer with well less than 0 1 μm thickness is casted by dipping it in polymeric amine and then diisocyanate solutions before being heat treated pinnau and freeman 1999 in this process the areas with excessively large pores or defects are particularly prone to develop defects because dilute polyamide solutions can penetrate polysulfone layer by capillary suction force as depicted in fig 3 simultaneously varying extents of cracks can develop when solvents are evaporating from the dilute polyamide coating solution depending on curing condition the nature and the concentration of surfactants added in casting solution existence of impurities etc yoo et al 2018 mansourpanah et al 2009 tang et al 2009 singh et al 2006 defects of tfc membrane can be minimized by increasing the depth of polyamide layer in membrane manufacturing thicker polyamide layer not only has a less chance of developing cracks but also can cover up some of the defects in polysulfone middle layer seawater membranes are known to have thicker polyamide layer than brackish water membranes to provide an extra high salt rejection efficiency therefore they have a greater fluorescence dye rejection efficiency according to a side by side test yoon 2016 trasar dye rejection efficiency of seawater membranes is greater than brackish water membrane s e g 99 996 vs 99 98 from the salt passage perspective seawater membrane s fluorescent tracer passage is only 1 5 of brackish water membrane s e g 0 004 vs 0 02 the thick polyamide layer can improve salt rejection efficiency but salt rejection efficiency is generally in trade off relation with water permeability because thick polyamide layer causes high hydraulic resistance that in turn necessitates high operating pressures therefore the highest salt rejection efficiency cannot be achieved simultaneously with the highest water permeability commercial ro membranes are optimized to achieve acceptable salt rejection efficiencies and water permeabilities simultaneously for the market they are targeted 2 4 dynamic membrane effect in mf and uf filtration some extent of membrane fouling is unavoidable because contaminants are carried to membrane surface by the convective flow that permeates through membrane if defects exist in membrane surface contaminant transportation is particularly fast near the defects because hydraulic resistances are low in those regions moderately sized defects are quickly sealed by the contaminants while gel or cake layer is formed across the membrane surface gel layer is also called dynamic membrane because it can act as a separation layer the dynamic membrane plays important role particularly in mf uf because gel layer has smaller effective pore sizes than the actual membrane yoon 2015 as a result virus rejection efficiencies of mf and uf are almost equal at 4 log despite the vastly different pore sizes e g 0 03 μm vs 0 45 μm hirani et al 2010 the similar dynamic membrane effects exist in ro when membranes are clean unhindered convective flow carries contaminants toward defects as defects are plugged up by nom and other contaminants convective flows through the defects gradually slow down and rejection efficiency increases subsequently gel layer is formed over the membrane surface as depicted in fig 4 and behave as dynamic membrane though gel layers are not an efficient barrier for tiny ionic species because it lacks a strong dielectric exclusion mechanism discussed in section 2 1 1 but it can reject larger species partially or fully e g fluorescent tracer viruses soluble polymeric materials etc in a pilot study lozier et al 2003 prefiltered secondary effluent was treated using ro membranes with 10 100 μm pinholes it was observed that pinholes did not affect virus rejection efficiencies as long as they did not penetrate the whole membrane sheets this observation suggests that the polysulfone middle layer can reject viruses when polyamide layer is damaged if pinholes penetrate deeper through polysulfone layer and reach polyester backing material contaminants in secondary effluent can seal them quickly and stop the convective leaks in the same study even if pinholes penetrated the whole membrane sheet virus rejection efficiency was eventually recovered to the original level dynamic membrane can also affect the rejection efficiency of smaller species than virus when chlorine damaged membranes were used in a field test salts and trasar dye rejection efficiencies were initially 1 02 log and 1 37 log respectively unpublished data but they increased gradually to 1 25 log and 3 70 log respectively in 6 h as shown in fig 5 the gradual improvements of rejection efficiencies are attributed to the defects sealed gradually by the contaminants in feed water in a linear scale salts rejection increased by 3 85 from 90 55 to 94 40 while trasar dye rejection increased by 4 22 from 95 76 to 99 98 it is considered that trasar dye rejection increased more than salts rejection because gel layer rejects more tracers than salts due to the size differences 2 5 use of surrogates to determine minimum pathogen removal the size of smallest enteric virus is around 20 nm in theory none of pathogens can pass non porous ro membranes because viruses are far larger than the intramolecular spaces of polyamide layer of which size ranges at 3 5 4 5 å kim et al 2005 therefore viruses can leak through ro membrane only when there are defects larger than 20 nm in membrane o rings or glue lines of membrane element if defects are large enough to pass virus they also allow any species smaller than virus to pass freely therefore conservative virus rejection efficiencies can be estimated based on the rejection efficiencies of salts fluorescent tracers sugars etc log removal value lrv is typically used to rate the removal capability of ro in wastewater recycle and is defined as eq 1 1 lrv log 10 c p e r m c f e e d where c f e e d and c p e r m are the concentrations of the species in interest in feed and permeate and c p e r m c f e e d equals to the passage rate according to this equation the tracer rejection efficiency 99 98 shown in fig 2 corresponds to 3 7 log while sodium rejection efficiency 99 61 corresponds to 2 4 log indeed these lrvs are much lower than virus ms2 phage based lrv observed in the field i e 6 log lozier et al 2003 3 fmim based on natural background fluorescence 3 1 source of natural background fluorescence naturally occurring waters contain low level organic contaminants called humic and fulvic acids produced during the degradation of plants and animal remains by random biological and chemical reactions those organics with random molecular structures are known to have fluorescent properties in broad ranges of excitation emission wavelengths sierra et al 2005 raw sewages also contain various organics with fluorescent properties e g polysaccharides proteins oils grease recalcitrant organics artificial colors and brighteners from food and laundry products riboflavin etc fig 6 shows an eem matrices of river water and raw sewage which are obtained by monitoring the emission strengths at a range of wavelengths at various excitation wavelength henderson et al 2009 five key fluorescence peaks have been identified e g peak a humic like eem 237 260 nm 400 500 nm peak b tyrosine like eem 225 237 nm 309 321 nm peak c1 c2 humic like eem 300 370 nm 400 500 nm peak t1 tryptophan like eem 275 nm 340 nm and peak t2 tryptophan like eem 225 237 nm 340 381 nm hudson et al 2007 valencia et al 2013 henderson et al 2009 mladenov et al 2018 fluorescence rejection efficiencies of ro membrane can be calculated by comparing the intensities of one or more peaks in feed and permeate eem charts 3 2 characteristics of ro feed water in potable wastewater reuse in potable wastewater reuse biologically treated sewage or wastewater called secondary effluent is filtered by using one or more of mf uf membranes multimedia sand filters cartridge bag filter etc to meet the minimum silt density index sdi requirement for ro membrane elements despite the prefiltration soluble organics with fluorescent properties are not filtered and fed to ro singh et al 2009 therefore minimum virus rejection efficiencies by ro can be estimated based on the rejection efficiency of those fluorescent soluble organics while secondary effluent contains various soluble organics originated from microorganisms molecules larger than 20 kda are mostly removed by mf membranes with 0 45 μm nominal pore sizes hong et al 2018 as a result majority of the molecules contained in ro feed water are smaller than 4 8 kda and a substantial portion of them are smaller than 0 5 kda in fact membranes are known to remove much smaller species than their pore sizes in practical conditions because the cake gel layer formed on membrane surface provides a much tighter filtration surface than the actual membrane as discussed in section 2 4 in other studies jang et al 2006 2007 submerged mf membranes rated at 0 4 μm removed soluble organics larger than 40 kda from activated sludge when the organics contained in mf permeate was analyzed multiple peaks were observed in the molecular weight distribution curve at 260 da 350 da 600 da and 1000 da which represented 81 of the total soluble organics in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod 3 3 use of background fluorescence for ro membrane integrity monitoring as discussed in section 3 1 ro feed water originated from recycled wastewater has natural background fluorescence the extent of membrane integrity can be estimated by comparing fluorescence peaks in feed and permeate eem charts according to pilot studies in the field pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 background fluorescence based rejection efficiencies range between 96 and 99 5 or 1 4 log to 2 3 log in municipal wastewater recycle processes depending on the peaks chosen in eem charts the ro membranes used and the filtration conditions this extent of rejection efficiency is only comparable to the salt rejection efficiency measured by ec it is considered that the low rejection of background fluorescence is because a large portion of organics contained in a filtered secondary effluent are smaller than 0 5 kda as discussed in section 3 2 fig 7 shows eem charts of 50 times diluted ro feed water and ro permeate with no dilution where peaks i ii and iii represent humic like organics pype et al 2013 it was found that the rejection efficiency based on region ii was the highest at 99 5 while region iii 99 2 and region i 98 9 follow the same trend was observed when the experiments were repeated in other location these observations suggest that the organics causing region ii are the largest while those causing region i are the smallest if membrane integrity is monitored based on the rejection efficiency of the largest background organics in feed and permeate greater resolution can be achieved in a study pype et al 2013 large background organics were separated from small ones by using size exclusion chromatography sec before fluorescence was measured at eem peaks of 305 nm 385 and 335 nm 440 nm much greater rejection efficiencies of 99 9 were obtained from both peaks 3 4 potential and limitations of using natural fluorescence the resolutions of natural background fluorescence based membrane integrity monitoring is largely equivalent to those of total organic carbon toc based methods pype et al 2013 trussell et al 2017 but fluorescence based methods are more practical it is because inline fluorescence analyzers do not require any moving parts or reagents which makes them more cost effective and maintenance friendly than toc analyzers however a few limitations are noteworthy most noticeably the resolution of natural fluorescence based method is not much greater than that of simpler conductivity based methods e g 1 4 2 3 log vs 1 5 2 log pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 if sec is combined with fluorescence monitoring as discussed in the previous section 3 log resolution can be obtained but greater capital and operating expenses are expected natural fluorescence based methods are also affected by the extent of pretreatment before ro if advanced oxidations e g ozone uv h2o2 etc are employed to polish secondary effluent before ro background fluorescence can decline below the threshold necessary to secure strong enough fluorescence in permeate for example depending on the extent of ozonation background fluorescence in ro feed fluctuated between 1 and 5 μg l as trasar dye in potable wastewater reuse trussell et al 2017 if background fluorescence is 1 μg l as trasar dye and rejection efficiency is 99 5 permeate will contain only 5 ng l as trasar dye which might be prone to large measurement errors lastly the strength of natural fluorescence is not consistent because it varies depending on the quality and quantity of organics contained in secondary effluent it has been well known that activated sludge process is vulnerable to upset conditions depending on water temperature organic loading existence of toxic chemicals in influent dissolved oxygen etc yoon 2015 therefore accuracy and resolution of natural fluorescence based fmim can be a concern although no long term observations throughout all seasons of a year have been reported 4 fmim based on fluorescent tracers 4 1 advantages of using fluorescent tracers the low resolution of natural fluorescence based fmim can be overcome by using artificial fluorescent tracers in this method sufficient signal strengths can be secured in both feed and permeate streams regardless of the water quality in addition fluorescent tracers provide a better resolution because their rejection efficiencies are greater than background fluorescence e g up to 4 log vs 1 4 2 3 log trussell et al 2017 pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 the high tracer rejection efficiency is a consequence of the monodisperse nature of fluorescent tracers with high molecular weights 4 2 desired properties of fluorescent tracer in potable wastewater reuse the most critical requirement for fluorescent tracers is the ability of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for potable water nsf60 certification and for discharge to surface water bodies npdes permit lozier et al 2003 while the dosage of fluorescent tracer should remain below the maximum limit allowed it should be sufficient to provide necessary signal strengths in ro permeate to determine accurate lrv it is also important that the excitation and emission peaks of fluorescent tracers are not overlapped with the peaks of background organics shown in figs 6 and 7 to minimize the interferences from the background fluorescence high quantum yield is desired to quantify fluorescent tracers at ultralow concentrations because minimizing tracer dosages is critical for economical application in addition fluorescence should not be affected substantially at the ranges of ph temperature and ionic strengths commonly found in reuse applications frenkel et al 2014 also negatively charged tracers are preferred to avoid any potential charge interactions with negatively charged antiscalants nom membrane surfaces etc they also should be compatible with biocides that might be present in ro feed water e g chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxides dbnpa etc surawanvijit et al 2015 finally invisible fluorescent tracers under sunlight at the concentration in ro concentrate are strongly preferred from the public perception standpoint 4 3 background fluorescence effect and necessary tracer dosage the background fluorescence in ro feed water negatively influence the resolution of fmim it is because rejection efficiencies of nom are on average lower than fluorescent tracers by more than 1 log e g 1 4 2 3 log vs 3 5 4 0 log trussell et al 2017 pype et al 2013 singh et al 2015 in four different potable reuse trial sites background fluorescence in ro feed was found widely different at 0 84 1 5 6 8 and 9 5 μg l as trasar dye respectively mainly depending on the methods used in pretreatment unpublished data due to the lower rejection efficiencies of background organics observed lrv with fluorescent tracers tends to decline as background fluorescence increases this limitation can be overcome by using extra fluorescent tracers to overwhelm the background fluorescence as discussed below the impact of the background fluorescence on lrv δ l r v can be calculated by subtracting apparent lrv from tracer only lrv 2 δ l r v l o g 10 1 ε d c d 1 ε n c n 1 ε d c d c n where ε d and ε n are rejection efficiencies of fluorescent tracer and natural fluorescent organics respectively c d and c n are fluorescence from tracers and background organics ppb respectively in ro feed water if tracer dosage is 50 ppb and its rejection efficiency is 99 98 lrv is 3 70 according to eq 1 but if background organics in ro feed water is 5 ppb as tracer equivalent and their rejection efficiency is 99 7 δ l r v is 0 36 and as a result apparent lrv becomes 3 34 3 70 0 36 the necessary tracer dosage c d to achieve a target lrv l r v t under the presence of background fluorescence c n in ro feed water can be calculated using eq 3 3 c d 1 ε n 10 l r v t 1 ε d 10 l r v t c n where l r v t must be lower than the intrinsic tracer rejection efficiency for the same conditions used in above paragraph if l r v t is 3 5 log necessary tracer dosage c d becomes 115 ppb at this condition permeate fluorescence is 0 038 ppb as tracer where 23 ppb is contributed by tracer and 15 ppb by natural background fluorescence in fmim enough fluorescence must be present in ro permeate to secure necessary measurement accuracy fluorometers can detect fluorescence above the minimum detection limit but the accuracy is not guaranteed near that due to signal drifting and flow cell fouling in real world application therefore much greater tracer concentrations are necessary in ro permeate than the minimum detection limit the necessary fluorescent tracer dosages can be calculated as eq 4 4 c d α x 1 ε a where x is a lower detection limit of permeate fluorometer α is a multiplication factor to secure enough permeate fluorescence and ε a is an assumed average fluorescence rejection efficiency if the detection limit is 0 01 ppb multiplication factor is 10 and average rejection efficiency is 99 98 then required tracer dosage becomes 500 ppb it is apparent from the equation that the lower detection limit of permeate fluorometer is proportional to the necessary tracer dosages in addition stability and reliability of permeate fluorometer determines multiplication factor α and in turn affect the tracer dosage therefore the detection limit and the signal stability of fluorometer are the critical factor affecting the economics of fmim currently the state of the art inline fluorometers provide the lower detection limit of 0 01 ppb and 0 0004 ppb for rhodamine wt and trasar dye respectively trussell et al 2017 4 4 fluorescent tracer rejection by various ro membranes table 1 summarizes lrv of trasar dye obtained with various membranes where spiral wound elements were used unless marked otherwise yoon 2016 if same membranes were used for both lab and field tests e g company a ro1 and company b ro1 lrv tends to be slightly lower in the field perhaps due to a greater water recovery in larger scale systems in fact it is noticeable from eq 1 that lrv decreases as water recovery increases because c p e r m increases as feed water is concentrated in the table it is also noticeable that lrv rarely exceeds 4 log for all brackish water membranes even at the lab tests performed with a plate and frame module where the chances of leakage through misplaced mechanical parts are low all other lab tests performed under different settings with different tracers also have demonstrated around 4 log lrv with commercial brackish water ro membranes lozier et al 2003 frenkel et al 2014 surawanvijit et al 2015 the differences in lrv among commercial ro membranes are likely from the different degree of defects developed during manufacturing processes this is especially true for those three membranes tested under an identical condition using a plate and frame module in a linear scale the tracer passage of the average performing ro membrane is 0 03 if salts passage of the same ro membrane is 0 5 it includes 0 03 of leak through defects because salts can pass the same defects tracers pass at a same rate since that extent of leak 0 03 is not substantial in desalination presence of defect in ro membrane has not drawn substantial attention seawater membrane company a ro1 has greater lrv for fluorescent tracers 4 38 log than brackish water membrane as shown in table 1 it is because seawater membranes have tighter separation layer to produce drinking water out of highly saline water low fouling membranes for brackish water company d ro2 also showed greater lrv 4 25 log than comparable membranes potentially due to the coat layer casted on polyamide layer to mitigate membrane fouling both seawater membranes and low fouling brackish water membranes are probable to reject viruses better than regular brackish water membranes but thorough empirical studies are yet to be performed 4 5 comparison of fmim with different methods ms2 phages are commonly used as a surrogate to simulate enteric virus rejection because they are non pathogenic and similarly sized with the smallest enteric viruses fig 8 shows lrv of ms2 phage trasar dye and salts obtained from a pilot ro system treating filtered secondary effluent with intact ro membranes ms2 phage trasar dye and salts showed 6 5 log 3 6 log and 2 0 log performances respectively jacangelo et al 2017 interestingly when defective membranes with surface scratch or glue line leak are used ms2 phage rejections does not decrease but trasar dye and salts rejections decline slightly this suggests that the artificially induced defects are sealed by the gel layer that can reject large species like ms2 phage meanwhile much smaller species like trasar dye and salts still can pass the gel layer for the membranes with chlorine damage salt rejection is less than 0 1 log but trasar dye rejection is 1 6 log and ms2 phage rejection is almost 5 log when feed water leaks to permeate due to damaged o ring ms2 phage rejection is lower than those for trasar dye and salts but it is likely caused by the empirical error in virus counting since the permeate contains 106 counts ml when lrv is 1 more than 1000 times dilution is necessary for proper virus counting but such extreme dilution is prone to cause large errors due to particles settling unrepresentative sampling etc fig 9 shows the long term observation of trasar dye toc and ec based lrvs in a potable wastewater reuse demonstration plant trussell et al 2017 secondary effluent was filtered by uf before being fed to ro and water recovery was maintained 80 90 lrvs were calculated by comparing tracer concentrations in the feed and in the combined permeate from first and second stages marked as train permeate dosages of trasar dye was varied between 0 04 and 0 1 mg l as indicated in figure as results lrvs of trasar dye toc and salts were observed at 3 5 log 2 5 log and 1 7 log respectively toc rejection of 2 5 log is close to the high end of the natural fluorescence rejection efficiencies observed in many different sites as discussed in section 3 3 the background fluorescence negatively affects fluorescent tracer based lrv as discussed in section 4 3 this is because background fluorescence is less efficiently rejected by ro than fluorescent tracers if tracer dosage is reduced the dominance of tracer in lrv determination will decline and so does apparent lrv as can be calculated using eq 2 in fig 9 however the observed lrv decreased only slightly e g 0 1 0 2 log while fluorescent tracer dosage is reduced to approximately a half from 0 1 mg l to 0 04 0 05 mg l it is considered that the marginal lrv drop is due to the ozone and biological aerated filter baf used before ro to polish secondary effluent as a result background fluorescence was only 1 2 μg l as trasar dye in ro feed which was substantially lower than typical levels without such pretreatment e g 5 10 μg l 5 path forward to exceed the 4 log barrier 5 1 improving membrane integrity as discussed in section 4 4 the maximum lrv obtained with fmim is around 4 log for commercially available ro membranes in all lab scale studies published lozier et al 2003 mi et al 2004 frenkel et al 2014 surawanvijit et al 2015 yoon 2016 the slight leak of fluorescent tracer in the order of 0 01 is considered to occur in membrane itself because substantial leakages through mechanical breaches are unlikely in those tightly controlled lab scale experiments if fact it is technically hard to avoid defects when polyamide layer is casted on polysulfone layer to reduce defects in membrane manufacturing a few potential methods have been suggested as shown in section 2 3 polyamide solution can intrude into large pores formed in polysulfone layer this issue can be mitigated by using ultrahigh molecular weight polyamides when casting the separation layer if the polyamide chain dimension is larger than the largest pores of the polysulfone layer polymers hardly intrude into pores since typical polymers have coil diameters between 20 and 50 nm the optimum pore size of support membranes is smaller than about 30 nm rezac and koros 1992 however it is not easy to completely avoid a pore size distribution in polysulfone layer and eliminate any pores larger than the dimension of the polyamides other potential solution is adding a gutter layer in between polyamide and polysulfone layers yoo et al 2018 gutter layers not only provide a smooth foundation for thin film polyamide layer but also provide channels to transport water to polysulfone layer lundy and cabasso 1989 the internal network of pores in gutter layer helps entire membrane surface area to function by allowing water to permeate through the areas below which no pores exist in the underlying polysulfone layer ideally gutter layers must be much more porous than polyamide layer that they should not cause additional filtration resistance a protective layer coated on the top of polyamide layer can also help mitigate defects by plugging them up yoo et al 2018 thin film polyvinyl alcohol pva based protective layers have been used for commercial ro membranes in recent decade tang et al 2009 kim and lee 2006 hachisuka and ikeda 2001 but their main purpose is to improve membrane s antifouling properties in theory protective layer reduces surface charges so that charge interaction with membrane foulants are minimized in addition pva layer makes the membrane surface smoother that initial foulant attachment can be discouraged to some extent myung et al 2005 low fouling membranes have a potential of rejecting fluorescent tracers better than regular membranes due to the additional coating layer but they have not been studied thoroughly to date other than one example shown in table 1 5 2 use of tagged surrogates most ro membranes are capable of over 6 log virus rejections but fmim can assure only up to 4 log kitis et al 2003 lozier et al 2003 mi et al 2004 surawanvijit et al 2015 yoon 2016 it is because fmim is relying on much smaller surrogates than virus in fact the smallest viruses are around 20 nm but rhodamine wt is only 1 10 of the size at 2 01 nm frenkel et al 2014 the resolution of fmim can be improved by using large fluorescence tagged nanoparticles lozier et al 2003 fluorosphere is a microsphere with 20 nm diameter and is made by grafting fluorescent tagged polycarboxylates to polystyrene nanoparticles if there are no interferences from the background fluorescence it can be detected down to 50 ng l in a bench test intact ro membranes rejected microspheres at a greater than 5 6 log efficiencies fluorescence tagged nanoparticles should be smaller than smallest viruses to provide more conservative lrv than actual virus rejection efficiencies fluorescence tagged nanoparticles are promising in obtaining high resolution but it can potentially cause membrane fouling according to eq 4 at least 5 mg l of microspheres are necessary to obtain 6 log resolution assuming detection limit x is 50 ng l multiplication factor α is 10 the dosage of microsphere 5 mg l is high enough to cause colloidal fouling no studies have been published demonstrating ro membrane fouling by tagged nanoparticles but mf membrane fouling has been reported when tagged silica nanoparticles with 0 5 0 7 μm were dosed to mf with 0 25 μm pore size choi et al 2011 filtration resistance increased by around 10 due to the deposition of microspheres the colloidal fouling can be minimized by increasing the negative charges of tagged nanoparticles highly negatively charged nanoparticles with fluorescent tags would have less tendency to deposit on membrane due to the repulsion among themselves and with the membrane surface fluorescence tagged polymers with large enough molecular sizes can be also used to improve the resolution of fmim to improve the signal strength to dosage ratio multiple fluorescent moieties need to be tagged on one polymer strong negative charges are also necessary to minimize membrane fouling in fact polymers with strong negative charges have been successfully used as antiscalants in ro for decades e g polyacrylic acids polymaleic acids and their derivatives rahman 2013 if fluorescent moieties are tagged on those polymers with molecular weights of a few thousands to a few tens of thousands da they can provide much greater resolutions than 4 log 6 common misunderstandings 6 1 fmim is for leak detection fmim is often considered a technology for detecting leak in ro but this perception stems from the idea that there is a defining moment of ro system starts to leak as discussed above however all ro systems always leak small soluble species as well as viruses due to the defects in membrane itself and the breaches in filtration system therefore what fmim does is estimating the level of integrity based on the extent of fluorescence leaks from regulators viewpoint the quantified membrane integrity expressed as lrv can be considered a conservative virus removal efficiency if smaller species than viruses are used as a surrogate from a practical viewpoint leaking can be arbitrarily defined as a condition in which surrogate compounds pass through membrane at a greater rate than a preset threshold but that is not a rigorous leak detection 6 2 salts rejection efficiency can be correlated with virus rejection efficiency salts rejection efficiencies are lower than virus rejection efficiencies if membrane elements are intact and ro systems have no breaches but it is much easier to measure salts rejections than virus rejections therefore if correlations exist between those two virus rejection efficiency can be projected based on easily measurable salts rejection efficiencies likewise virus rejection can be projected based on fluorescent tracer rejection however there are no rigorous correlations among different membrane integrity monitoring methods conceptually correlations may exist between different methods if the loss of integrity is a consequence of gradual ageing of membrane and there are variously sized defects in any given time in the early phase of ageing existing defects start to grow while new small defects emerge increasingly more salts and virus can pass through the growing defects but salts passage is always greater than virus passage due to their smaller sizes if the lrvs of salts and virus are observed over time it may appear salts and virus rejections are linearly correlated in fact when membranes with varying degree of chlorine damage was used salts and virus rejections appeared to be correlated linearly antony et al 2016 in that study virus rejections appeared 3 times greater than salt rejections in log scale for example l log salt rejection corresponded to 3 log virus rejection and 2 log salt rejection to 6 log virus rejection from regulatory stand point however no such correlations are recognized because one catastrophic event can immediately break those correlations for example a rising differential pressure beyond the threshold can cause a telescoping of membrane elements especially when water channels are plugged up by particulates as a result a segment of glue line can be broken and all contaminants can leak through it at a same rate if so virus based lrv drops much greater than salts based lrv due to the nature of logarithmic scale and as a result the initial correlation becomes invalid therefore no rigorous correlations exist among different membrane integrity methods in real world 6 3 fmim can determine substantially beyond 4 lrv for commercial ro membranes there are literature suggesting that fmim provides much greater than 4 log resolution with commercial ro membranes e g 6 log kumar et al 2007 ostarcevic et al 2018 however it is unlikely that commercial ro membranes can reject fluorescent tracers at such a high efficiency in fact no lab tests have shown anything significantly beyond 4 lrv even though experimental conditions can be rigorously controlled lozier et al 2003 mi et al 2004 frenkel et al 2014 surawanvijit et al 2015 yoon 2016 in addition commercial ro membranes are prone to have defects when ultrathin polyamide layers are casted to obtain high water permeability due to the optimization principle between salts rejection and water permeability as discussed in section 4 4 some levels of defects are inevitable it is difficult to know the exact causes of the extremely high lrv reported in few literature without knowing detailed experimental conditions and the protocols used for data analyses but instrumental errors misinterpretation of detection limit improper experimental protocol mishandling of errors etc are potentially the culprits in one example if permeate sample is taken too early before fluorescent tracer concentration reaches a steady state in permeate lrv can be overestimated due to the underestimated tracer passage this error is more likely when tracer has positive charges that encourage the tracer to adsorb on negatively charged membrane and hence it takes longer to reach a steady state in other example if tracer concentration in permeate is close to the detection limit of fluorometer and the fluorometer is not rigorously calibrated tracer passage can be substantially underestimated 7 conclusions currently available commercial ro membranes can reject viruses at above 6 log efficiencies but there are no inline methods that can prove it in real time continuously various methods have been studied but fmim draws special attention due to its practicality and the capability of providing high lrv up to 4 log the main cause of the slight fluorescence leak is believed to be the defects formed on membrane surface during the manufacturing processes the resolution of fmim can be improved by reducing the defects in membrane to some extent but there is an inherent limitation because occurrence of defects is in tradeoff relation with water permeability of the membrane it can be also improved by using larger surrogates than the fluorescent tracers based on single dye molecule e g fluorescence tagged water soluble polymers or nanoparticles by combining the new and larger fluorescent tracers with improved ro membranes with less defects fluorescent fmim can achieve above 6 log resolution that only virus challenge tests can do today abbreviations aop advanced oxidation process atmp amino tris

can be converted into electric and calorific energy anaerobic digestion also produces a residue called digestate composed of materials that have not been converted into biogas and is generally spread on fields to improve soil fertility digestates are characterized by a high nitrogen content mainly found under two forms inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen thanks to the high nitrogen content of the digestate it can advantageously replace mineral fertilizers and when farms perform their own anaerobic digestion it helps them to become autonomous in nitrogen inputs alburquerque et al 2012 müller stöver et al 2016 to optimize agricultural exploitation of digestates better knowledge of nitrogen transformations that take place during anaerobic digestion is required to be able to control nitrogen characteristics of digestates for specific agricultural needs indeed the composition of the influent and design criteria vary from one anaerobic digestion unit to another and can strongly impact the nitrogen characteristics of the digestate bareha et al 2018 to allow the efficient agricultural exploitation of digestates predicting the nitrogen composition of the digestate starting from the composition of the influent and the operating and design parameters of the digester is consequently important various models have been developed to monitor and predict biogas production during anaerobic digestion and in addition to assess the inorganic nitrogen content of the digestate angelidaki et al 1999 1993 the best known and most frequently cited is the iwa anaerobic digestion model n 1 batstone et al 2002 a mechanistic model that simulates the main processes that occur during anaerobic digestion the model includes five steps disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the model which was originally developed for the anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge showed limitations when the influent contained solid organic waste vavilin et al 2008 since in this case hydrolysis is strongly limited by the physical structure of the organic matter the model was then considerably modified to enable simulation of the biodegradability of specific wastes such as manures and lignocellulosic residues the modifications were mainly made in the disintegration and hydrolysis steps as these are considered to be the limiting steps in anaerobic digestion vavilin et al 2008 modifications to the disintegration step involved considering several pools of composite organic matter with different disintegration kinetics several authors kouas et al 2015 mottet et al 2013 poggio et al 2016 used this strategy to simulate methane production in agricultural anaerobic digestion units other studies use an extended van soest analysis to characterize substrates and calculate adm1 input state variables biernacki et al 2013 koch et al 2010 as highlighted by biernacki et al 2013 default parameters for disintegration and hydrolysis kinetics can be used to obtain an estimation of biogas production adequate for preliminary design of an industrial plant however specific calibration of these kinetic parameters is generally required to simulate methane production with a complete accuracy the hydrolysis of complex compounds is strongly limited by their bioaccessibility bioaccessible organic matter refers to the compounds in the substrates that microorganisms can access for intra or extracellular biodegradation a modified eps fractionation was developed to assess the bioaccessibility of complex compounds bareha et al 2018 jimenez et al 2015 this method uses successive chemical extractions with increasingly alkaline solvents as extractants and ends with a strong acid extraction it results in the fractionation of the organic matter in the substrate into fractions with different bioaccessibility the modified eps fractionation has been successfully used to predict organic carbon and nitrogen biodegradability during anaerobic digestion bareha et al 2018 jimenez et al 2017 jimenez et al 2014 used this fractionation method to determine the input variables of the adm1 model to successfully predict methane production in batch experiments however the fractionation method has never been implemented in adm1 for the prediction of the nitrogen characteristics of the digestate ammonium concentration organic nitrogen properties as a function of the characteristics of the substrates and of the design and operating parameters the aim of this study was to develop a modified adm1 model that accounts for a bioaccessibility based set of state variables to accurately simulate the fate of nitrogen during anaerobic digestion without losing the ability to accurately simulate methane and ammonium production and without requiring individual calibration for each different substrate the nitrogen properties of the digestate that need to be predicted are ammonium and organic nitrogen contents and their bioaccessibility to this end the anaerobic biodegradation of two substrates representative of the substrate typology of bareha et al 2018 were monitored to investigate the changes in each fraction determined by the modified eps fractionation method based on these results transformation processes for these fractions were determined and implemented in adm1 the modified adm1 renamed admacc was then calibrated on the two substrates and was evaluated by comparing the results obtained on a set of substrates not used to develop the model this validation step allowed the quantification of the quality of the predictions obtained with the proposed model without individual calibration for each specific substrate 2 material and methods 2 1 substrates eight different substrates were collected from agricultural anaerobic digestion plants in brittany france the substrates collected were representative of the typologies based on the nh4 tkn ratio highlighted by bareha et al 2018 nh4 tkn 30 and nh4 tkn 30 these authors showed that this criterion has to be taken into account to predict organic nitrogen biodegradability based on the modified eps fractionation substrates with a low nh4 tkn hereafter g1 substrates showed high protein biodegradability and conversely substrates with a high nh4 tkn ratio hereafter g2 substrates showed low protein biodegradability the sampled substrates and their characteristics are listed in table 1 all the samples were ground in a knife mill r15v v robotcoupe and stored at 20 c samples for elemental analysis were ground in a ball mill dangoumill prolabo 2 2 physical chemical characterization total solids ts volatile solids vs total chemical oxygen demand cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total ammonia nitrogen were measured using standard methods apha 2005 for total organic carbon toc an extraction step with water was first achieved and each fraction was differently analyzed toc of the obtained liquid phase was analyzed using a liquid toc analyzer toc l cph shimatzu from total carbon and inorganic carbon estimates by acidifying the sample to ph3 with hydrochloric acid and analyzing the produced gas analysis toc of the solid phase was determined using a solid elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermofisher from total carbon sample was dried at 105 c and inorganic carbon analysis sample was mineralized at 480 c as dissolved co2 is mainly contained in the liquid phase this methodology ensures that it was not considered as organic carbon due to its volatilization during the mineralization step bmp and anmp were monitored according to vedrenne et al 2008 and bareha et al 2018 2 3 organic matter fractionation modified eps fractionation modified eps fractionation is based on successive alkaline extractions ending with strong acid extraction it allows the split the organic matter in the substrate into four fractions with different bioaccessibility this fractionation based on the eps fractionation developed by jimenez et al 2017 extractions were performed on 0 5 g of raw sample and combined centrifugation and filtration were implemented to separate the extracted fraction and the remaining pellet this method separates the organic matter into four fractions described below sol the first step of the protocol consisted in two successive extractions of the sample with 30 ml of a saline solution of cacl2 10 mm at 30 c under stirring 300 rpm for 1 h this fraction contains soluble molecules such as sugars amino acids and small proteins that are easily bioaccessible it can contain long chain fatty acids which are less dense than water and remain with the extracted fraction during centrifugation prot the pellet remaining from the first step was washed four times with 30 ml of a basic solution of naoh 10 mm nacl 10 mm at 30 c and under stirring 300 rpm for 15 min the remaining pellet was washed four times with 30 ml of a strong basic solution of naoh 0 1 m at 30 c under stirring 300 rpm for 1 h the molecules extracted during this step are mostly proteins exopolymeric substances and nucleic acids the bioaccessibility of these materials is not limited by the lignocellulosic structure of the organic matter holo the pellet remaining from the previous step was washed three times with 25 ml of a strong acid solution of h2so4 72 w w at 30 c under stirring at 300 rpm for 3 h this step is used to extract holocellulose materials due to the properties of the modified eps fractionation non holocellulosic materials physically entrapped in holocellulose proteins lipids are also extracted during this step hence this fraction contains slightly bioaccessible materials whose bioaccessibility is limited by the holocellulose structure of the organic matter lign this fraction contains the most recalcitrant material and is calculated by subtracting the total mass extracted from the original mass of the sample non lignin material such as holocellulose and proteins are also present in this fraction due to the physical lignin barrier surrounding these molecules this fraction contains very poorly bioaccessible materials the organic carbon and total nitrogen content in each fraction except lign fraction were measured in the extracts using a toc l analyzer shimadzu and by carbon and nitrogen balance for lign fraction between the raw sample and the sum of the extractible fractions protein and non protein cod content in the fractions were determined using equations 1 and 2 1 protein f r a c t i o n gcod kg 1 tkn fraction n h 4 fraction 0 007 moln kgcod 1 14 gn moln 1 where 0 007 moln kgcod 1 is the mean n content

batstone et al 2002 nitrogen content of proteins can vary depending on the origin of proteins which could induce deviations for protein non protein fractionation the impact of uncertainty for this fractionation will be evaluated during model evaluation all extractions and measurements on extracts were performed in triplicate 2 4 experimental set up batch experiments were designed to investigate carbon and nitrogen transformations in the substrate during anaerobic digestion five 1 l bottles were filled with the centrifuged inoculum and the substrate for a mix volume of 750 ml characterizations of the initial mixtures are available in supplementary data b the inoculum used for this test was sampled in a continuously stirred 93 l tank reactor at 38 c with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days this reactor was used for codigestion of pig slurry and horse feed with an organic loading rate of 2 5 gvs m 3 d 1 the sampled inoculum was centrifuged at 12100 g at ambient temperature for 20 min and the supernatant was removed to reduce the initial ammonium concentration the remaining pellet was suspended in a khco3 10 g l 1 nahco3 10 g l 1 solution to preserve sufficient buffering capacity in the batch and to prevent inhibition due to acidification during incubation substrates were ground in a knife mill r15v v robotcoupe physical chemical characteristics of the raw and centrifuged inoculum are presented in table 2 an inoculum substrate ratio of 0 3 gvs gvs 1 was targeted i e a dry matter content of each sample was incubated in five different bottles at 38 c and during the experiment bottles were stopped at different times until methane production reached the bmp of the substrate biogas production was monitored with a volumetric gas counter within laboratory designed it is mainly constituted of a tipping bucket in a water bath specific calibration was achieved before each experiment biogas composition was analyzed by gas chromatography agilent vfa volatile fatty acids production was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography with uv spectroscopy and an evaporation light scattering detector elsd physical chemical characterizations as detailed in section 2 2 were monitored at each stop time to check mass balances on cod and tkn the bioaccessibility of the organic carbon and nitrogen was monitored using the modified eps fractionation method 2 5 modeling batch experiments 2 5 1 model construction the model was developed following a structured method the model developed was based on adm1 and bioaccessibility considerations were added in the definition of the input state variables by including modified eps fractions in the organic matter fractionation the developed model was renamed admacc the methodology was divided into four steps step 1 determination of carbon and nitrogen transformation in batch tests two batch tests incubating cattle feed waste cf and bovine slurry bs were used to investigate the fate of the fractions resulting from modified eps fractionation during anaerobic digestion the choice of these substrates was based on the typologies determined by bareha et al 2018 these authors reported that biodegradability and bioaccessibility were linked differently depending on the substrate typology g1 for nh4 tkn 30 g2 for nh4 tkn 30 changes in non protein and protein content in the fractions presented in section 2 3 enabled assumptions to be made concerning the transformations of these compounds if there was no accumulation of these molecules in the fraction it was considered as a simple hydrolysis however the accumulations in the fraction revealed the presence of more complex processes hence this kind of fraction was considered as an intermediate fraction produced by the degradation of one or several other fractions and then consumed except for inert accumulations step 2 new variables added to the model new variables were defined based on the observations made in step 1 x variables are used for compounds that required a hydrolysis step for degradation and s variables for monomers these variables were defined from the modified eps fractionation and new processes were associated with the variables kinetic models associated with the processes were determined according to the results of the batch tests these variables were added to the adm1 model to obtain a new state variable set including bioaccessibility considerations to be used as inputs step 3 calibration of admacc on the results from batch tests the new model admacc was manually calibrated on a substrate set representing the two types of substrates used by bareha et al 2018 cf and bs new kinetic rates associated with the new variables were calibrated along with the stoichiometry of inert production calibration was evaluated and if the experimental results were accurately simulated the model proceeded to the next step step 4 model evaluation the calibrated model was then evaluated on a validation set of substrates that contained substrates representing the two typologies used by bareha et al 2018 grass silage gs oats o and faba beans fb as g1 substrates oat silage os pig slurry ps and bovine manure bm as g2 substrates this step enabled validation of the processes and of the stoichiometry associated with the new variables implemented the calibrated kinetic rates obtained in step 3 were also validated during this step the model was implemented in scilab5 5 2 and solved using ordinary differential equation solver ode package odepack solver isoda 2 5 2 proposed modifications to the adm1 input state variable set the model used to simulate the batch experiments admacc is a modified adm1 with major modifications to the disintegration step the complex compartment xc was replaced by variables that take the bioaccessibility of protein and non protein compounds into account fig 1 illustrates the main modifications made to the adm1 input state variable set for admacc composite fraction xc polymer fractions carbohydrates xch lipids xli and proteins xpr and particulate inerts xi were removed and replaced by bioaccessibility based fractionation particulate organic matter was divided into protein and non protein hydrolysable fractions protein and non protein hydrolysable fractions were qualified according to their different degrees of bioaccessibility according to modified eps fractionation which led to seven particulate hydrolysable fractions for each fraction a biodegradable and an inert fraction were considered particulate inert organic matter xi was also divided into protein and non protein inert fractions with different degrees of bioaccessibility according to modified eps fractionation the detailed modeling of bioaccessibility of inert fractions is not required to simulate biogas production and organic nitrogen mineralization during anaerobic digestion however it enables the detailed prediction of the bioaccessibility of residual organic carbon and nitrogen in the digestate which may be useful when combining admacc with other agronomic or composting models acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes were considered in admacc following adm1 and the associated variables were also kept in the new model soluble inert was broken down into three compartments biomass decay production of inert amino acids and inert non protein compounds 2 5 3 model initialization table 3 details the method used to determine the initial value of each state variable for each substrate based on the results of modified eps fractionation the biodegradability determined in the batch experiments and the results of the physical chemical analyses particulate inert xi prot p and xi prot c were assumed as not initially present and produced during the biodegradation of the xprot p and xprot c fractions soluble inert si sol p si sol c and si bio were also assumed as not initially present and produced during the biodegradation of the xprot p xprot c and biomass fractions inert non protein and inert proteins for xi lign c xi holo c xi lign p and xi holo p variables were also determined in batch tests by measuring the cod remaining in lign and holo after 50 days of incubation biodegradable protein content for variables xlign p and xholo p were determined by subtracting inert protein content in the respectively lign and holo fractions of the mix and expressed in gcod l 1 the protein variables were initially measured from total nitrogen tn in the fractions considering a nitrogen content of protein n protein of 0 007 moln gcod 1 batstone et al 2002 biodegradable non protein compounds in xlign c and xholo c were determined by subtracting the concentrations of inert non protein inert protein and biodegradable protein compounds in respectively the lign and holo fractions and expressed in gcod l 1 xprot c and xprot p were determined by subtracting biomass cod from the prot fraction the saa variable was calculated from total nitrogen tn concentration in sol considering a n aa of 0 007 moln gcod 1 batstone et al 2002 sva sbu spro and sac were measured by hplc in the sol fraction lcfa sfa variable was taken from a database fisgativa et al 2018 and assumed to be part of the sol fraction monosaccharides a ssu variable were assumed to be negligible the soluble particulate non protein compound xsol c was determined by difference between cod of sol fraction and cod of saa sfa ssu sva sbu spro and sac active biomass xsu h2 was determined by simulating the reactor in which the inoculum was sampled using adm1acc under the operating conditions reported in section 2 4 the reactor was simulated for a period of 1 000 days to ensure a stabilization period of more than three times its hrt the final biomass concentrations were considered as the biomass concentrations in the raw inoculum see supplementary data a the quantity of each active biomass in the batch tests was calculated considering a centrifugation capture rate equal to that observed for total cod capture percentage of 90 complying with jimenez et al 2015 active biomass is supposed to be extracted with prot fraction during the modified eps fractionation section 2 3 then it was deducted from prot fraction obtained as detailed in section 2 3 before its repartition into xprot c and xprot n see table 3 2 5 4 model calibration to support following subsections a general scheme of the new model admacc processes is provided fig 5 hydrolysis decay stoichiometry and the kinetics of the admacc model were calibrated manually on a calibration dataset composed of two substrates cattle feed waste cf and bovine slurry bs the stoichiometry and kinetic parameters newly added to the model are listed in table 4 all first order parameters k monod contois maximum specific uptake rates km half saturation coefficients ks were calibrated on the pattern of each associated compound monitored during the batch test except for decay rates which were set to 0 04 d 1 according to girault et al 2011 stoichiometric parameters for hydrolysis f product substrate and decay processes and carbon c i and nitrogen n i content for si and particulate variables xlign c xholo c xprot c were also calibrated on the same batch tests using cod toc measured on the non protein content in the fractions stoichiometric parameters concerning acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were implemented according to batstone et al 2002 ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 kinetic and stoichiometric parameters associated to the degradation of each variable were manually adjusted to allow a suitable modeling of its degradation trend observed during batch experiments no calibration was specifically achieved to improve the simulation of

of correlation r2 was used to determine the correlation between observed and simulated values and the predictability of the model 3 results 3 1 the fate of nitrogen considering modified eps fractionation batch reactor monitoring the aim of this part of the study was to understand the fate of bioaccessibility based fractions during anaerobic digestion in order to propose modifications of the adm1 general process scheme two substrates cf and bs were used for this purpose protein and non protein compounds were considered separately in each fraction due to the variations in the c n ratio during incubation fig 2 shows changes in the c n ratio in cf fig 2a and bs fig 2b depending on the substrate and on the fractions the c n ratio ranged from 3 14 to 39 in addition the c n ratio varied significantly in most of the fractions during anaerobic digestion consequently proteins were distinguished from the other compounds to be able to simulate these variations in c n during incubation 3 1 1 transformation of particulate material fig 3 shows the changes in protein and non protein content of the lign holo and prot fractions of cf and bs in cf the protein content of lign and holo decreased by respectively 94 cod fig 3a and by 38 cod fig 3c before leveling off in bs the protein content of lign remained stable at 4 5 gcod l 1 fig 3b however the protein content of holo decreased by 43 cod like in cf fig 3d changes in non protein content in the lign fig 3a and holo fig 3b fractions also revealed a decrease followed by stabilization with respectively 78 cod and 37 cod drops in cf and 6 cod and 54 cod drops respectively in bs no accumulation of protein and non protein compounds was observed in the lign and holo fractions during incubation depending on the substrate typology protein and non protein content in fractions varied significantly before leveling off or remained stable throughout the incubation period these results revealed that the lign and holo fractions were mostly composed of inert compounds that were already present in the raw substrate and were not produced during anaerobic digestion indeed the lign and holo fractions contained compounds entrapped in lignocellulosic and holocellulose materials that are reported to be the most recalcitrant fractions during anaerobic digestion due to their poor bioaccessibility tian et al 2017 in addition the results showed lower biodegradability of the lign fraction in bs than in cf this observation was linked to the type of substrate all g1 substrates also showed a decreasing trend in lign protein and non protein content whereas g2 substrates showed less significant changes in these compounds in this fraction data not shown in g1 substrates the breakdown of part of the lignocellulosic structures during anaerobic digestion made the biodegradable compounds present in large quantities in g1 substrates bioaccessible in g2 substrates no significant breakdown of lignocellulose was observed during anaerobic digestion due to the biological transformations that happened prior to incubation bareha et al 2018 and consequently only non bioaccessible compounds remained in the lign fraction for the prot fraction fig 3e and f shows an almost 100 decrease in non protein concentration in cf and a 39 decrease in bs this decrease is the result of the transformation of non protein compounds by hydrolysis but despite this decrease visible accumulation of protein compounds occurred in both substrates at approximately the same rate 1 gcod l 1 during the first 20 days after this peak the protein concentration in prot fraction decreased to reach a final value of 2 6 gcod l 1 in cf and of 1 3 gcod l 1 in bs prot extraction targets bacteria and exopolymeric substances associated to bacteria using an alkali solution muller et al 2014 prasad maharjan and ferenci 2003 the hypothesis retained to explain this transient accumulation of cod in prot fraction was an increase in biomass the decrease in protein content in the prot fraction at the end of the incubation periods fig 3 was consequently attributed to biomass decay combined with degradation of the compounds supplied by the substrate monitoring of protein and non protein concentration in lign holo and prot enabled their transformation processes to be identified these transformation processes were added to the admacc model and are presented in fig 5 except for the accumulation of biomass in the prot fraction no transient accumulation of protein or non protein compounds was observed in lign x lign c x lign n holo x holo c x holo n or prot x prot c hence the only transformation that has to be taken into account is hydrolysis and the products are directly transferred to the sol fraction xsol c and xsol n nor does any transfer between the above mentioned fractions need to be considered as these compounds are specific all the hydrolysis processes described in this section are extracellular processes that not induce direct biomass growth batstone et al 2002 vavilin et al 2008 1996 hydrolysis is assumed to follow first order kinetics as the process is mainly limited by the bioaccessibility of the compounds rather than by biomass growth 3 1 2 transformations of soluble material the sol fraction was considered as the fraction that contains soluble materials including carbohydrate monomers lipids amino acids and vfas fig 4 shows changes in the sol c and n fractions in addition to changes in the propionate and acetate concentrations in the sol fraction and cumulated methane and ammonium production in cf accumulation of soluble materials in the sol c fraction was observed during the first 20 days followed by a decrease until a stable value was reached fig 4a in bs fig 4b the accumulation was smaller even though a lag phase was observed during the first days of incubation that could be due to the equilibrium between the production and degradation of the sol c fraction the slight accumulation of vfas that occurred during this period contributed only slightly to the accumulation of cod in the sol c fraction indeed vfas reached maximum concentrations i of 0 6 gcod l 1 propionate and of 1 gcod l 1 acetate in cf ii 0 17 gcod l 1 propionate and 0 45 gcod l 1 acetate in bs fig 4c and d hence accumulation of sol c was mainly due to the transient accumulation of other soluble compounds 6 6 gcod l 1 on the 7th day in cf from the hydrolysis of less bioaccessible materials lign holo and prot fractions thus for modeling it is assumed that these compounds need hydrolysis to produce monomers sugar and lcfas consequently it was assumed that all the products of the hydrolysis of xlign c xholo c and xprot c are transferred to the soluble non protein polymer fraction xsol c as the materials contained in xsol c are particulate soluble they can be considered as easily bioaccessible materials that are transformed through hydrolysis process to produce monomers to simulate xsol c biodegradation first order kinetic can be adequate as it was already used to describe hydrolysis process of the previous fractions however as the xsol c fraction is composed by soluble particulate materials easily bioaccessible hydrolysis of this material could also be more likely limited by biomass growth and biomass colonization vavilin et al 2008 thus contois kinetics was assumed for the hydrolysis of xsol c as hydrolysis and acidogenesis are achieved by same groups of bacteria wang et al 2018 no specific hydrolytic biomass was considered and hydrolysis was considered as limited by the sum of monosaccharides and lcfa acidogenic biomass this reaction leads to the production of monomers without nitrogen sugars ssu and in a more marginal part lcfas sfa biodegradation in sol n during the first days fig 4a and b was as expected visually correlated with ammonium production fig 4e and f expressing the deamination phenomena that occur during acidogenesis of amino acids as described in adm1 and in the literature ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 in addition no transient accumulation of sol n was observed hence in contrast to non protein compounds the products of the hydrolysis of xlign p xholo p and xprot p were directly transformed into amino acids and transferred to the saa fraction consequently mineralization of organic nitrogen is assumed to be mainly limited by hydrolysis of the upstream fractions xlign p xholo p and xprot p transformations of soluble materials acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were considered as intracellular transformations following monod kinetics as described in adm1 3 1 3 inert production fig 4a and b shows the accumulation of non biodegradable sol n compounds at the end of incubation the same kind of phenomenon was observed for sol c in bs although to a lesser extent this can be explained by the production of inert soluble materials during anaerobic digestion that can result from degradation of non soluble materials in the substrates and decayed biomass according to adm1 batstone et al 2002 disintegration of decayed biomass is assumed to lead to the production of particulate and soluble inert materials in addition to biodegradable ones however default parameters of adm1 highlight that decay rates 0 02 d 1 are generally more than 10 time less than decayed biomass disintegration and hydrolysis rates 0 4 d 1 and 0 1 0 25 d 1 respectively thus decay is the rate limiting step in the biodegradation of biomass fractions and to simplify the model only decay was considered in admacc and decayed biomasses are directly transferred to soluble biodegradable monomers ssu saa and sfa and inert materials si sol c si sol n xi prot p and xi prot c in addition inert production by the prot fraction may be the result of the degradation of organic matter from the substrates particularly g2 substrates such as livestock manure or silage indeed the specificity of prot extraction is the alkaline solvent used according to jimenez et al 2015 this leads to the extraction of complex protein humic and fulvic acid like compounds these acids are highly recalcitrant to biodegradation due to their high degree of complexity such as their composition functional groups and molecular conformation qualls 2004 according to their physical chemical properties humic and fulvic acids are also partially water soluble maccarthy 1976 the results obtained for soluble nitrogen and carbonated compounds revealed accumulation of these molecules after the 10th day fig 4a and b the hypothesis retained to explain this accumulation of soluble nitrogen and carbonated molecules is that humic and fulvic acids like compounds in prot faction are solubilized during digestion hence partial production of soluble inerts was assumed for xprot c and xprot p si sol c and si sol n respectively the impact of this hypothesis on inert production will be evaluated during model validation below the kinetic model of biomass decay in adm1 was retained and followed first order kinetics batstone et al 2002 to summarize the previous sections modifications to the adm1 general scheme are depicted in fig 5 and the associated petersen matrix can be found in supplementary data c based on all these experimental results and the general process inferred the admacc model was calibrated on the biodegradability tests described in the previous section 3 2 model calibration admacc was calibrated on cf and bs batch tests fig 6 show simulation results for cumulated ammonium and methane production using contois kinetic initial fractionation and detailed simulation results for protein and non protein contents of the lign holo prot and sol fractions are available in supplementary data d and e r2 correlation coefficients are presented for each figure and showed good calibration for ammonium and methane production in both substrates the protein and non protein contents in each fraction also calibrated well with r2 values which ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 3 2 1 calibration of stoichiometric parameters table 5 lists the stoichiometric and parameter values used for calibration stoichiometric parameters for the hydrolysis of xprot p the hydrolysis of xprot c and biomass decay were calibrated for cf and bs calibration of xprot p stoichiometry showed that for the cf substrate f saa xprot p was 0 2 meaning that only 20 of the fraction was biodegradable and converted into saa table 5 the remainder 80 of xprot p was transferred to the inert fraction of prot xi prot p these stoichiometric parameters were similar for the bs substrate this similarity highlights the fact that non biodegradable proteins are not substrate dependent but inoculum dependent the amount of inoculum added to the biodegradability test was the same in each test consequently the nitrogen soluble inert molecules produced during anaerobic digestion with both substrates were humic acid like substances solubilized from the biomass regarding xprot c hydrolysis the stoichiometry differed between cf and bs substrates in the cf substrate f xsol c xprot c and f si c xprot c were respectively 1 and 0 meaning that all xprot c fractions are biodegradable conversely in the bs substrate all non protein compounds were directly transferred to the soluble inert carbon f si c xprot c 1 this stoichiometric parameter was the only difference between the two substrates representing g1 substrates in cf and g2 substrates in bs this result can be explained by the transformations that occurred before sampling cf was used fresh whereas bs had been stored for several weeks in a slurry tank with no aeration system biodegradation takes place during storage møller et al 2004 consequently in bs non protein biodegradable compounds contained in the prot fraction were previously transformed during storage the remaining materials were recalcitrant materials transferred to si sol c biomass disintegration stoichiometry was similar in the two substrates with 50 of the disintegration products transferred to the inert compartment 20 in soluble si and 30 in particulate xi prot p the rest of the disintegrated materials resulting from biomass decay were distributed in saa sfa and ssu with the same distribution as with adm1 inert production was 15 higher than that found with adm1 however as reported by batstone et al 2002 in adm1 this parameter is estimated for activated sludge and can thus vary widely depending on the type of biomass 3 2 2 calibration of the kinetic parameters the calibration of parameters relative to transformation of particulate and soluble compounds are listed in table 6 except xsol c and compared with the default values in adm1 batstone et al 2002 3 2 2 1 constant calibration of first order hydrolysis kinetics calibration of first order hydrolysis kinetics considering hydrolysable protein and carbon content resulted in lower values for the lign fraction than for the holo fraction in cf the first order kinetic rate for xlign p was 0 07 d 1 while for xholo p it was 0 25 d 1 in bs the first order kinetic rate for xlign p was 0 10 d 1 and for xholo p it was 0 15 d 1 the same trend was observed for the difference between k hyd xlign c and k hyd xholo c these results revealed a significant difference in bioaccessibility between the holo fraction and the lign fraction since the lign fraction is the least bioaccessible part of organic matter defined by eps fractionation jimenez et al 2015 leading to low hydrolysis kinetics proteins contained in lign xlign p and holo xholo p were not hydrolyzed at the same rate as non protein compounds xlign c and xlign c due to the poor bioaccessibility of lignin and cellulose compounds proteins encapsulated in these structures only become available via disintegration of the lignocellulosic structure hence hydrolysis of cellulose needs to take place prior to protein hydrolysis which may explain the low or equal hydrolysis kinetic rates for xlign p and xholo p conversely the constant hydrolysis rates for xprot p and xprot c were similar depending on the substrate incubated the constant hydrolysis rate was 0 08 d 1 for cf and 0 01 d 1 for bs these hydrolysis constants are the lowest constants obtained for the hydrolysis of biodegradable materials these constants also highlight the difference between group g1 and g2 substrates according to bareha et al 2018 the difference in biodegradability between these two types of substrate depends on the prot fraction in particular these authors showed that the prot fraction did not significantly contribute to biodegradation in g2 substrates in agreement with the very low values we obtained for khyd xprot p and c according to bareha et al 2018 and jimenez et al 2015 modified eps fractionation allows quantification of bioaccessibility the fractions sol prot holo and lign represent different degrees of bioaccessibility ranked from easily bioaccessible to poorly bioaccessible however according to these results this hierarchy was not respected the prot fraction which according to the modified eps fractionation is the second most bioaccessible fraction had a low hydrolysis constant for protein and non protein compounds similar to lign the slow hydrolysis of the prot fraction that upset the hierarchy based on bioaccessibility was due to the nature of the molecules extracted as mentioned in section 3 2 1 muller et al 2014 showed that molecules extracted using alkali solvents prot extraction are exopolymeric substances like and fulvic humic like compounds and that these molecules can be extremely complex thus these molecules are poorly biodegradable which explains the low hydrolysis constant rates of the prot fraction their biodegradation being limited by their chemical composition rather than by their bioaccessibility 3 2 2 2 kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of xsol c first order and contois kinetic comparison calibration of first order and contois kinetic parameters are presented table 7 as well as the rmse calculated between the experimental and simulated values of xsol c methane and ammonium fig 7 represents the simulation of these parameters following a first order kinetic and a contois kinetic the calibration rmse values obtained using contois kinetic were globally lower than the ones found using first order kinetic indeed for cf the calibration rmse obtained with contois kinetic were equal to 0 40 and 251 26 for respectively xsol c simulation and methane simulation rmse obtained using first order kinetic were equal to respectively 0 52 and 293 21 showing less efficient calibration performances regarding bs the calibration rmse were similar on xsol c simulation rmse 0 25 and better using contois kinetic on methane simulation rmsecontois 110 31 rmsefirst order 135 20 thus based on these results contois kinetic is most adequate to describe xsol c biodegradation for all substrates contois maximum uptake values were very low in comparison to the maximum monod uptake rates associated with downstream transformations while the contois half saturation value was high for both substrates hence xsol c hydrolysis is more limiting than acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis these results differed significantly for the two substrates used for calibration in cf the k m xsol c and ks xsol c were low 0 55 d 1 and 1 35 respectively these values show that the xsol c hydrolysis is a slow process limited by the biomass concentration vavilin et al 2008 leading to the observed transient accumulation see fig 4a conversely in bs no significant accumulation was observed during incubation fig 4b and the contois parameters found were the opposite of the one calibrated for cf 4 2 d 1 for km xsol c 26 for ks xsol c the high value of ks xsol c reduced the equation to first order kinetics as highlighted by the comparison of contois and first order kinetic simulations thus for bs the reaction was not limited by biomass growth but by the complexity of the polymers in xsol c 3 2 2 3 monod parameters for acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the monod maximum specific uptake rates k m substrate obtained for acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were below the values generally found in the literature batstone et al 2002 girault et al 2011 the opposite is true of the half saturation values which were high compared with default values batstone et al 2002 the non acclimated inoculum and the experimental design may explain these differences from default values indeed several reasons can explain a lower km value compared to defaults ones from batstone et al 2002 before batch experiments the inoculum was centrifuged and batstone et al 2015 showed that this step can reduce methanogen activity the loss of activity can lead to low km values for methanogens and this could extend to other biomasses that form the trophic chain in addition due to high substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments inhibitors from substrate can reduce biomass growth kinetics especially as the inoculum was not acclimated to the substrates the high values found for half saturation coefficients ks can be explained by the experimental design the bottles were not continuously stirred during the incubation but for 1 min twice a day the lack of stirring reduces the probability that the biomasses harvested their substrate in the medium which can lead to high ks values the same phenomenon was previously observed by girault et al 2011 in batch experiments without continuous stirring in addition table 6 highlights that calibrated parameters for biomass growth can strongly vary between substrates indeed due to high substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments physical chemical characteristics into each experiment strongly depend on the substrates hence inhibitor and micronutrient contents can strongly vary between each experiment which can explain km values significant variation amongst the substrates in addition for the same reasons viscosity strongly differs between experiments these variations combined with the non continuous mixing can explain variations of half saturation values across the substrates however these parameters only impact ammonia and methane production kinetics in the first days of the experiments default parameters can allow an accurate simulation of the ammonia and methane production for the rest of the experiment to further interpret these results identifiability analysis could be achieved on the model and confidence intervals could be estimated for calibrated parameters 3 3 model evaluation the developed and calibrated models were applied to a validation dataset composed of six batch biodegradation experiments initial fractionation used for evaluation and detailed simulations are available in respectively supplementary data d and f the g1 substrates chosen for model validation were grass silage gs oats o and faba beans fb g2 substrates were bovine manure bm pig slurry ps and oat silage os model initialization was achieved for each substrate following the procedure detailed in section 2 5 3 however calibrated kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for cf and bs were applied without any modifications to model anaerobic digestion of the substrates in their respective groups fig 8 compares measured and simulated ammonium and methane production rates during incubation for the validation set of substrates 3 3 1 prediction of ammonium and methane production the results showed that the admacc model can accurately predict the maximum ammonium concentration in all the incubation tests the simulated changes in concentration were also accurate for most of the substrates except for incubation of bovine manure fig 8d for this substrate the concentration at 7 days was poorly simulated by the model the simulation showed a time lag as it took 14 days to reach the value measured on the 7th day according to the results of the sensitivity analysis data not shown for g1 and g2 substrates which includes bovine manure short term ammonium production is highly sensitive to saa acidogenesis consequently for bovine manure saa acidogenesis is not fast enough resulting in erroneous predictions nevertheless these accurate results for most of the substrates validate the modeling framework including influent fractionation processes and kinetic models simulations of methane production also accurately predicted cumulated methane production small simulation inaccuracies were observed in first seven days due to a lag phase that was observed for all the substrates in the simulations according to the sensitivity analysis data not shown methane production is strongly limited by xsol c hydrolysis thus the discrepancy between predicted and experimental values was mainly due to xsol c hydrolysis parameters that were not optimized for each individual substrate yet due to high substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments physical chemical characteristics into each experiment strongly depended on the substrates and strongly vary then these variations can significantly impact biomass growth kinetics inhibitors micronutrients the calibrated admacc successfully simulated ammonium and methane production trends during anaerobic digestion without substrate specific calibration this is the main advantage of admacc in comparison to simpler models which require specific calibration of hydrolysis constants for each substrate however to improve the predictability of admacc a method allowing the prediction of the biodegradability of each fraction is still required nevertheless as the objective of this model is to simulate the characteristics of the digestate prediction of the bioaccessibility fractions needs to be evaluated to validate the model assumptions 3 3 2 prediction of the fate of bioaccessibility fractions during anaerobic digestion the ability of the admacc model to predict changes in the bioaccessibility fractions was investigated using the evaluation dataset predictions and measurements of the protein and non protein content of each fraction were compared for all the substrates g1 and g2 substrates and r2 coefficients were determined results of the comparison are presented in fig 9 the predicted values showed good correlations with measured values in xlign p xlign c xholo p and xholo c with respective coefficients of determination of 0 99 0 96 0 99 and 0 99 all the measured values are projected on or very close to the predicted values described by the diagonal fig 9 admacc thus allows accurate prediction of protein and non protein contents in these fractions during anaerobic digestion final and intermediary values nevertheless the fractionation method requires that total biodegradability of these fractions is previously determined by measuring the materials remaining in the fraction after incubation which limits the predictability of the model on the contrary the method for the determination of the remaining materials in prot and sol was only based on model prediction indeed these fractions are subject to more complex processes than hydrolysis e g complex material solubilization biomass growth biomass decay in the prot fraction and soluble compounds hence the biodegradation tests monitored here did not enable determination of the final inert contents in these fractions stoichiometric parameters for inert production associated with these fractions determined by calibration for cf and bs were applied to the substrates in their respective groups fig 9e shows that the predicted values are close to the experimental ones for prot fraction with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 this r2 is slightly lower than the one found previously due to delayed biomass growth correlated with the lag phase apparent in the methane production curves fig 8 the complexity of the process and of the compounds contained in this fraction was evaluated and results support the hypothesis concerning the complexity of this fraction based on observations made by jimenez et al 2015 nevertheless admacc is able to very accurately predict the biodegradability and the evolution kinetics of the prot fraction during anaerobic digestion regarding the sol fraction fig 9f reveals more differences between the predicted and measured values r2 0 71 the inaccurate predictions are mainly due to the lag phase in methane production observed in some incubation tests that is not accurately simulated by the calibrated model in addition as mentioned in section 2 1 in cf there is visible accumulation of soluble particulate compounds xsol c during incubation and the kinetic parameters associated with their transformation are the most sensitive for the prediction of short term methane production indeed no significant accumulations of vfa were observed fig 9g consequently inaccuracies in the prediction of changes in the xsol c fraction led to slight errors in the prediction of the short term methane production kinetics as can be seen in fig 8 nevertheless the use of contois kinetic as recommended by vavilin et al 1996 is justified by the fact that xsol c hydrolysis depends on the design of the experimental set up and the concentration of the original biomass the evaluation of the ability of admacc to predict trends in the bioaccessibility fraction during anaerobic digestion showed that predictions were good for almost all fractions thereby validating most of the hypotheses in the admacc model characterization of the inert content in xlign c p and xholo c p is the next step in consolidating admacc to improve its predictivity without the need for batch experiments the use of spectrophotometry could help determine these inert fractions in a limited time as done by jimenez et al 2015 2017 another limitation for the use of admacc model is its ability to simulate codigestion to this purpose further developments are required to allow the modeling of combined anaerobic digestion of several substrates as proposed by zaher et al 2009 however as identical hydrolysis kinetic parameters can be used for all the substrates owning to each two groups simpler approaches considering only two parallel hydrolysis ways could be investigated 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to develop a predictive model able to estimate methane and ammonium production plus accurate prediction of the bioaccessibility based fractionation of the digestates results were successful for ammonium production and bioaccessibility of the digestate simulated methane production was correct and depended on xsol c transformations the use of contois kinetics was appropriate to describe these transformations and made it possible to simulate a larger number of biodegradation patterns to improve the predictability of admacc characterization of the complexity of the xlign and xholo fractions could enable implementation of the model without inert

18988,simulating the fate of nitrogen during anaerobic digestion is required to predict the characteristics of digestates and to improve their exploitation for agricultural uses the aim of this study

can be converted into electric and calorific energy anaerobic digestion also produces a residue called digestate composed of materials that have not been converted into biogas and is generally spread on fields to improve soil fertility digestates are characterized by a high nitrogen content mainly found under two forms inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen thanks to the high nitrogen content of the digestate it can advantageously replace mineral fertilizers and when farms perform their own anaerobic digestion it helps them to become autonomous in nitrogen inputs alburquerque et al 2012 müller stöver et al 2016 to optimize agricultural exploitation of digestates better knowledge of nitrogen transformations that take place during anaerobic digestion is required to be able to control nitrogen characteristics of digestates for specific agricultural needs indeed the composition of the influent and design criteria vary from one anaerobic digestion unit to another and can strongly impact the nitrogen characteristics of the digestate bareha et al 2018 to allow the efficient agricultural exploitation of digestates predicting the nitrogen composition of the digestate starting from the composition of the influent and the operating and design parameters of the digester is consequently important various models have been developed to monitor and predict biogas production during anaerobic digestion and in addition to assess the inorganic nitrogen content of the digestate angelidaki et al 1999 1993 the best known and most frequently cited is the iwa anaerobic digestion model n 1 batstone et al 2002 a mechanistic model that simulates the main processes that occur during anaerobic digestion the model includes five steps disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the model which was originally developed for the anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge showed limitations when the influent contained solid organic waste vavilin et al 2008 since in this case hydrolysis is strongly limited by the physical structure of the organic matter the model was then considerably modified to enable simulation of the biodegradability of specific wastes such as manures and lignocellulosic residues the modifications were mainly made in the disintegration and hydrolysis steps as these are considered to be the limiting steps in anaerobic digestion vavilin et al 2008 modifications to the disintegration step involved considering several pools of composite organic matter with different disintegration kinetics several authors kouas et al 2015 mottet et al 2013 poggio et al 2016 used this strategy to simulate methane production in agricultural anaerobic digestion units other studies use an extended van soest analysis to characterize substrates and calculate adm1 input state variables biernacki et al 2013 koch et al 2010 as highlighted by biernacki et al 2013 default parameters for disintegration and hydrolysis kinetics can be used to obtain an estimation of biogas production adequate for preliminary design of an industrial plant however specific calibration of these kinetic parameters is generally required to simulate methane production with a complete accuracy the hydrolysis of complex compounds is strongly limited by their bioaccessibility bioaccessible organic matter refers to the compounds in the substrates that microorganisms can access for intra or extracellular biodegradation a modified eps fractionation was developed to assess the bioaccessibility of complex compounds bareha et al 2018 jimenez et al 2015 this method uses successive chemical extractions with increasingly alkaline solvents as extractants and ends with a strong acid extraction it results in the fractionation of the organic matter in the substrate into fractions with different bioaccessibility the modified eps fractionation has been successfully used to predict organic carbon and nitrogen biodegradability during anaerobic digestion bareha et al 2018 jimenez et al 2017 jimenez et al 2014 used this fractionation method to determine the input variables of the adm1 model to successfully predict methane production in batch experiments however the fractionation method has never been implemented in adm1 for the prediction of the nitrogen characteristics of the digestate ammonium concentration organic nitrogen properties as a function of the characteristics of the substrates and of the design and operating parameters the aim of this study was to develop a modified adm1 model that accounts for a bioaccessibility based set of state variables to accurately simulate the fate of nitrogen during anaerobic digestion without losing the ability to accurately simulate methane and ammonium production and without requiring individual calibration for each different substrate the nitrogen properties of the digestate that need to be predicted are ammonium and organic nitrogen contents and their bioaccessibility to this end the anaerobic biodegradation of two substrates representative of the substrate typology of bareha et al 2018 were monitored to investigate the changes in each fraction determined by the modified eps fractionation method based on these results transformation processes for these fractions were determined and implemented in adm1 the modified adm1 renamed admacc was then calibrated on the two substrates and was evaluated by comparing the results obtained on a set of substrates not used to develop the model this validation step allowed the quantification of the quality of the predictions obtained with the proposed model without individual calibration for each specific substrate 2 material and methods 2 1 substrates eight different substrates were collected from agricultural anaerobic digestion plants in brittany france the substrates collected were representative of the typologies based on the nh4 tkn ratio highlighted by bareha et al 2018 nh4 tkn 30 and nh4 tkn 30 these authors showed that this criterion has to be taken into account to predict organic nitrogen biodegradability based on the modified eps fractionation substrates with a low nh4 tkn hereafter g1 substrates showed high protein biodegradability and conversely substrates with a high nh4 tkn ratio hereafter g2 substrates showed low protein biodegradability the sampled substrates and their characteristics are listed in table 1 all the samples were ground in a knife mill r15v v robotcoupe and stored at 20 c samples for elemental analysis were ground in a ball mill dangoumill prolabo 2 2 physical chemical characterization total solids ts volatile solids vs total chemical oxygen demand cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total ammonia nitrogen were measured using standard methods apha 2005 for total organic carbon toc an extraction step with water was first achieved and each fraction was differently analyzed toc of the obtained liquid phase was analyzed using a liquid toc analyzer toc l cph shimatzu from total carbon and inorganic carbon estimates by acidifying the sample to ph3 with hydrochloric acid and analyzing the produced gas analysis toc of the solid phase was determined using a solid elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermofisher from total carbon sample was dried at 105 c and inorganic carbon analysis sample was mineralized at 480 c as dissolved co2 is mainly contained in the liquid phase this methodology ensures that it was not considered as organic carbon due to its volatilization during the mineralization step bmp and anmp were monitored according to vedrenne et al 2008 and bareha et al 2018 2 3 organic matter fractionation modified eps fractionation modified eps fractionation is based on successive alkaline extractions ending with strong acid extraction it allows the split the organic matter in the substrate into four fractions with different bioaccessibility this fractionation based on the eps fractionation developed by jimenez et al 2017 extractions were performed on 0 5 g of raw sample and combined centrifugation and filtration were implemented to separate the extracted fraction and the remaining pellet this method separates the organic matter into four fractions described below sol the first step of the protocol consisted in two successive extractions of the sample with 30 ml of a saline solution of cacl2 10 mm at 30 c under stirring 300 rpm for 1 h this fraction contains soluble molecules such as sugars amino acids and small proteins that are easily bioaccessible it can contain long chain fatty acids which are less dense than water and remain with the extracted fraction during centrifugation prot the pellet remaining from the first step was washed four times with 30 ml of a basic solution of naoh 10 mm nacl 10 mm at 30 c and under stirring 300 rpm for 15 min the remaining pellet was washed four times with 30 ml of a strong basic solution of naoh 0 1 m at 30 c under stirring 300 rpm for 1 h the molecules extracted during this step are mostly proteins exopolymeric substances and nucleic acids the bioaccessibility of these materials is not limited by the lignocellulosic structure of the organic matter holo the pellet remaining from the previous step was washed three times with 25 ml of a strong acid solution of h2so4 72 w w at 30 c under stirring at 300 rpm for 3 h this step is used to extract holocellulose materials due to the properties of the modified eps fractionation non holocellulosic materials physically entrapped in holocellulose proteins lipids are also extracted during this step hence this fraction contains slightly bioaccessible materials whose bioaccessibility is limited by the holocellulose structure of the organic matter lign this fraction contains the most recalcitrant material and is calculated by subtracting the total mass extracted from the original mass of the sample non lignin material such as holocellulose and proteins are also present in this fraction due to the physical lignin barrier surrounding these molecules this fraction contains very poorly bioaccessible materials the organic carbon and total nitrogen content in each fraction except lign fraction were measured in the extracts using a toc l analyzer shimadzu and by carbon and nitrogen balance for lign fraction between the raw sample and the sum of the extractible fractions protein and non protein cod content in the fractions were determined using equations 1 and 2 1 protein f r a c t i o n gcod kg 1 tkn fraction n h 4 fraction 0 007 moln kgcod 1 14 gn moln 1 where 0 007 moln kgcod 1 is the mean n content

batstone et al 2002 nitrogen content of proteins can vary depending on the origin of proteins which could induce deviations for protein non protein fractionation the impact of uncertainty for this fractionation will be evaluated during model evaluation all extractions and measurements on extracts were performed in triplicate 2 4 experimental set up batch experiments were designed to investigate carbon and nitrogen transformations in the substrate during anaerobic digestion five 1 l bottles were filled with the centrifuged inoculum and the substrate for a mix volume of 750 ml characterizations of the initial mixtures are available in supplementary data b the inoculum used for this test was sampled in a continuously stirred 93 l tank reactor at 38 c with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days this reactor was used for codigestion of pig slurry and horse feed with an organic loading rate of 2 5 gvs m 3 d 1 the sampled inoculum was centrifuged at 12100 g at ambient temperature for 20 min and the supernatant was removed to reduce the initial ammonium concentration the remaining pellet was suspended in a khco3 10 g l 1 nahco3 10 g l 1 solution to preserve sufficient buffering capacity in the batch and to prevent inhibition due to acidification during incubation substrates were ground in a knife mill r15v v robotcoupe physical chemical characteristics of the raw and centrifuged inoculum are presented in table 2 an inoculum substrate ratio of 0 3 gvs gvs 1 was targeted i e a dry matter content of each sample was incubated in five different bottles at 38 c and during the experiment bottles were stopped at different times until methane production reached the bmp of the substrate biogas production was monitored with a volumetric gas counter within laboratory designed it is mainly constituted of a tipping bucket in a water bath specific calibration was achieved before each experiment biogas composition was analyzed by gas chromatography agilent vfa volatile fatty acids production was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography with uv spectroscopy and an evaporation light scattering detector elsd physical chemical characterizations as detailed in section 2 2 were monitored at each stop time to check mass balances on cod and tkn the bioaccessibility of the organic carbon and nitrogen was monitored using the modified eps fractionation method 2 5 modeling batch experiments 2 5 1 model construction the model was developed following a structured method the model developed was based on adm1 and bioaccessibility considerations were added in the definition of the input state variables by including modified eps fractions in the organic matter fractionation the developed model was renamed admacc the methodology was divided into four steps step 1 determination of carbon and nitrogen transformation in batch tests two batch tests incubating cattle feed waste cf and bovine slurry bs were used to investigate the fate of the fractions resulting from modified eps fractionation during anaerobic digestion the choice of these substrates was based on the typologies determined by bareha et al 2018 these authors reported that biodegradability and bioaccessibility were linked differently depending on the substrate typology g1 for nh4 tkn 30 g2 for nh4 tkn 30 changes in non protein and protein content in the fractions presented in section 2 3 enabled assumptions to be made concerning the transformations of these compounds if there was no accumulation of these molecules in the fraction it was considered as a simple hydrolysis however the accumulations in the fraction revealed the presence of more complex processes hence this kind of fraction was considered as an intermediate fraction produced by the degradation of one or several other fractions and then consumed except for inert accumulations step 2 new variables added to the model new variables were defined based on the observations made in step 1 x variables are used for compounds that required a hydrolysis step for degradation and s variables for monomers these variables were defined from the modified eps fractionation and new processes were associated with the variables kinetic models associated with the processes were determined according to the results of the batch tests these variables were added to the adm1 model to obtain a new state variable set including bioaccessibility considerations to be used as inputs step 3 calibration of admacc on the results from batch tests the new model admacc was manually calibrated on a substrate set representing the two types of substrates used by bareha et al 2018 cf and bs new kinetic rates associated with the new variables were calibrated along with the stoichiometry of inert production calibration was evaluated and if the experimental results were accurately simulated the model proceeded to the next step step 4 model evaluation the calibrated model was then evaluated on a validation set of substrates that contained substrates representing the two typologies used by bareha et al 2018 grass silage gs oats o and faba beans fb as g1 substrates oat silage os pig slurry ps and bovine manure bm as g2 substrates this step enabled validation of the processes and of the stoichiometry associated with the new variables implemented the calibrated kinetic rates obtained in step 3 were also validated during this step the model was implemented in scilab5 5 2 and solved using ordinary differential equation solver ode package odepack solver isoda 2 5 2 proposed modifications to the adm1 input state variable set the model used to simulate the batch experiments admacc is a modified adm1 with major modifications to the disintegration step the complex compartment xc was replaced by variables that take the bioaccessibility of protein and non protein compounds into account fig 1 illustrates the main modifications made to the adm1 input state variable set for admacc composite fraction xc polymer fractions carbohydrates xch lipids xli and proteins xpr and particulate inerts xi were removed and replaced by bioaccessibility based fractionation particulate organic matter was divided into protein and non protein hydrolysable fractions protein and non protein hydrolysable fractions were qualified according to their different degrees of bioaccessibility according to modified eps fractionation which led to seven particulate hydrolysable fractions for each fraction a biodegradable and an inert fraction were considered particulate inert organic matter xi was also divided into protein and non protein inert fractions with different degrees of bioaccessibility according to modified eps fractionation the detailed modeling of bioaccessibility of inert fractions is not required to simulate biogas production and organic nitrogen mineralization during anaerobic digestion however it enables the detailed prediction of the bioaccessibility of residual organic carbon and nitrogen in the digestate which may be useful when combining admacc with other agronomic or composting models acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes were considered in admacc following adm1 and the associated variables were also kept in the new model soluble inert was broken down into three compartments biomass decay production of inert amino acids and inert non protein compounds 2 5 3 model initialization table 3 details the method used to determine the initial value of each state variable for each substrate based on the results of modified eps fractionation the biodegradability determined in the batch experiments and the results of the physical chemical analyses particulate inert xi prot p and xi prot c were assumed as not initially present and produced during the biodegradation of the xprot p and xprot c fractions soluble inert si sol p si sol c and si bio were also assumed as not initially present and produced during the biodegradation of the xprot p xprot c and biomass fractions inert non protein and inert proteins for xi lign c xi holo c xi lign p and xi holo p variables were also determined in batch tests by measuring the cod remaining in lign and holo after 50 days of incubation biodegradable protein content for variables xlign p and xholo p were determined by subtracting inert protein content in the respectively lign and holo fractions of the mix and expressed in gcod l 1 the protein variables were initially measured from total nitrogen tn in the fractions considering a nitrogen content of protein n protein of 0 007 moln gcod 1 batstone et al 2002 biodegradable non protein compounds in xlign c and xholo c were determined by subtracting the concentrations of inert non protein inert protein and biodegradable protein compounds in respectively the lign and holo fractions and expressed in gcod l 1 xprot c and xprot p were determined by subtracting biomass cod from the prot fraction the saa variable was calculated from total nitrogen tn concentration in sol considering a n aa of 0 007 moln gcod 1 batstone et al 2002 sva sbu spro and sac were measured by hplc in the sol fraction lcfa sfa variable was taken from a database fisgativa et al 2018 and assumed to be part of the sol fraction monosaccharides a ssu variable were assumed to be negligible the soluble particulate non protein compound xsol c was determined by difference between cod of sol fraction and cod of saa sfa ssu sva sbu spro and sac active biomass xsu h2 was determined by simulating the reactor in which the inoculum was sampled using adm1acc under the operating conditions reported in section 2 4 the reactor was simulated for a period of 1 000 days to ensure a stabilization period of more than three times its hrt the final biomass concentrations were considered as the biomass concentrations in the raw inoculum see supplementary data a the quantity of each active biomass in the batch tests was calculated considering a centrifugation capture rate equal to that observed for total cod capture percentage of 90 complying with jimenez et al 2015 active biomass is supposed to be extracted with prot fraction during the modified eps fractionation section 2 3 then it was deducted from prot fraction obtained as detailed in section 2 3 before its repartition into xprot c and xprot n see table 3 2 5 4 model calibration to support following subsections a general scheme of the new model admacc processes is provided fig 5 hydrolysis decay stoichiometry and the kinetics of the admacc model were calibrated manually on a calibration dataset composed of two substrates cattle feed waste cf and bovine slurry bs the stoichiometry and kinetic parameters newly added to the model are listed in table 4 all first order parameters k monod contois maximum specific uptake rates km half saturation coefficients ks were calibrated on the pattern of each associated compound monitored during the batch test except for decay rates which were set to 0 04 d 1 according to girault et al 2011 stoichiometric parameters for hydrolysis f product substrate and decay processes and carbon c i and nitrogen n i content for si and particulate variables xlign c xholo c xprot c were also calibrated on the same batch tests using cod toc measured on the non protein content in the fractions stoichiometric parameters concerning acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were implemented according to batstone et al 2002 ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 kinetic and stoichiometric parameters associated to the degradation of each variable were manually adjusted to allow a suitable modeling of its degradation trend observed during batch experiments no calibration was specifically achieved to improve the simulation of

of correlation r2 was used to determine the correlation between observed and simulated values and the predictability of the model 3 results 3 1 the fate of nitrogen considering modified eps fractionation batch reactor monitoring the aim of this part of the study was to understand the fate of bioaccessibility based fractions during anaerobic digestion in order to propose modifications of the adm1 general process scheme two substrates cf and bs were used for this purpose protein and non protein compounds were considered separately in each fraction due to the variations in the c n ratio during incubation fig 2 shows changes in the c n ratio in cf fig 2a and bs fig 2b depending on the substrate and on the fractions the c n ratio ranged from 3 14 to 39 in addition the c n ratio varied significantly in most of the fractions during anaerobic digestion consequently proteins were distinguished from the other compounds to be able to simulate these variations in c n during incubation 3 1 1 transformation of particulate material fig 3 shows the changes in protein and non protein content of the lign holo and prot fractions of cf and bs in cf the protein content of lign and holo decreased by respectively 94 cod fig 3a and by 38 cod fig 3c before leveling off in bs the protein content of lign remained stable at 4 5 gcod l 1 fig 3b however the protein content of holo decreased by 43 cod like in cf fig 3d changes in non protein content in the lign fig 3a and holo fig 3b fractions also revealed a decrease followed by stabilization with respectively 78 cod and 37 cod drops in cf and 6 cod and 54 cod drops respectively in bs no accumulation of protein and non protein compounds was observed in the lign and holo fractions during incubation depending on the substrate typology protein and non protein content in fractions varied significantly before leveling off or remained stable throughout the incubation period these results revealed that the lign and holo fractions were mostly composed of inert compounds that were already present in the raw substrate and were not produced during anaerobic digestion indeed the lign and holo fractions contained compounds entrapped in lignocellulosic and holocellulose materials that are reported to be the most recalcitrant fractions during anaerobic digestion due to their poor bioaccessibility tian et al 2017 in addition the results showed lower biodegradability of the lign fraction in bs than in cf this observation was linked to the type of substrate all g1 substrates also showed a decreasing trend in lign protein and non protein content whereas g2 substrates showed less significant changes in these compounds in this fraction data not shown in g1 substrates the breakdown of part of the lignocellulosic structures during anaerobic digestion made the biodegradable compounds present in large quantities in g1 substrates bioaccessible in g2 substrates no significant breakdown of lignocellulose was observed during anaerobic digestion due to the biological transformations that happened prior to incubation bareha et al 2018 and consequently only non bioaccessible compounds remained in the lign fraction for the prot fraction fig 3e and f shows an almost 100 decrease in non protein concentration in cf and a 39 decrease in bs this decrease is the result of the transformation of non protein compounds by hydrolysis but despite this decrease visible accumulation of protein compounds occurred in both substrates at approximately the same rate 1 gcod l 1 during the first 20 days after this peak the protein concentration in prot fraction decreased to reach a final value of 2 6 gcod l 1 in cf and of 1 3 gcod l 1 in bs prot extraction targets bacteria and exopolymeric substances associated to bacteria using an alkali solution muller et al 2014 prasad maharjan and ferenci 2003 the hypothesis retained to explain this transient accumulation of cod in prot fraction was an increase in biomass the decrease in protein content in the prot fraction at the end of the incubation periods fig 3 was consequently attributed to biomass decay combined with degradation of the compounds supplied by the substrate monitoring of protein and non protein concentration in lign holo and prot enabled their transformation processes to be identified these transformation processes were added to the admacc model and are presented in fig 5 except for the accumulation of biomass in the prot fraction no transient accumulation of protein or non protein compounds was observed in lign x lign c x lign n holo x holo c x holo n or prot x prot c hence the only transformation that has to be taken into account is hydrolysis and the products are directly transferred to the sol fraction xsol c and xsol n nor does any transfer between the above mentioned fractions need to be considered as these compounds are specific all the hydrolysis processes described in this section are extracellular processes that not induce direct biomass growth batstone et al 2002 vavilin et al 2008 1996 hydrolysis is assumed to follow first order kinetics as the process is mainly limited by the bioaccessibility of the compounds rather than by biomass growth 3 1 2 transformations of soluble material the sol fraction was considered as the fraction that contains soluble materials including carbohydrate monomers lipids amino acids and vfas fig 4 shows changes in the sol c and n fractions in addition to changes in the propionate and acetate concentrations in the sol fraction and cumulated methane and ammonium production in cf accumulation of soluble materials in the sol c fraction was observed during the first 20 days followed by a decrease until a stable value was reached fig 4a in bs fig 4b the accumulation was smaller even though a lag phase was observed during the first days of incubation that could be due to the equilibrium between the production and degradation of the sol c fraction the slight accumulation of vfas that occurred during this period contributed only slightly to the accumulation of cod in the sol c fraction indeed vfas reached maximum concentrations i of 0 6 gcod l 1 propionate and of 1 gcod l 1 acetate in cf ii 0 17 gcod l 1 propionate and 0 45 gcod l 1 acetate in bs fig 4c and d hence accumulation of sol c was mainly due to the transient accumulation of other soluble compounds 6 6 gcod l 1 on the 7th day in cf from the hydrolysis of less bioaccessible materials lign holo and prot fractions thus for modeling it is assumed that these compounds need hydrolysis to produce monomers sugar and lcfas consequently it was assumed that all the products of the hydrolysis of xlign c xholo c and xprot c are transferred to the soluble non protein polymer fraction xsol c as the materials contained in xsol c are particulate soluble they can be considered as easily bioaccessible materials that are transformed through hydrolysis process to produce monomers to simulate xsol c biodegradation first order kinetic can be adequate as it was already used to describe hydrolysis process of the previous fractions however as the xsol c fraction is composed by soluble particulate materials easily bioaccessible hydrolysis of this material could also be more likely limited by biomass growth and biomass colonization vavilin et al 2008 thus contois kinetics was assumed for the hydrolysis of xsol c as hydrolysis and acidogenesis are achieved by same groups of bacteria wang et al 2018 no specific hydrolytic biomass was considered and hydrolysis was considered as limited by the sum of monosaccharides and lcfa acidogenic biomass this reaction leads to the production of monomers without nitrogen sugars ssu and in a more marginal part lcfas sfa biodegradation in sol n during the first days fig 4a and b was as expected visually correlated with ammonium production fig 4e and f expressing the deamination phenomena that occur during acidogenesis of amino acids as described in adm1 and in the literature ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 in addition no transient accumulation of sol n was observed hence in contrast to non protein compounds the products of the hydrolysis of xlign p xholo p and xprot p were directly transformed into amino acids and transferred to the saa fraction consequently mineralization of organic nitrogen is assumed to be mainly limited by hydrolysis of the upstream fractions xlign p xholo p and xprot p transformations of soluble materials acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were considered as intracellular transformations following monod kinetics as described in adm1 3 1 3 inert production fig 4a and b shows the accumulation of non biodegradable sol n compounds at the end of incubation the same kind of phenomenon was observed for sol c in bs although to a lesser extent this can be explained by the production of inert soluble materials during anaerobic digestion that can result from degradation of non soluble materials in the substrates and decayed biomass according to adm1 batstone et al 2002 disintegration of decayed biomass is assumed to lead to the production of particulate and soluble inert materials in addition to biodegradable ones however default parameters of adm1 highlight that decay rates 0 02 d 1 are generally more than 10 time less than decayed biomass disintegration and hydrolysis rates 0 4 d 1 and 0 1 0 25 d 1 respectively thus decay is the rate limiting step in the biodegradation of biomass fractions and to simplify the model only decay was considered in admacc and decayed biomasses are directly transferred to soluble biodegradable monomers ssu saa and sfa and inert materials si sol c si sol n xi prot p and xi prot c in addition inert production by the prot fraction may be the result of the degradation of organic matter from the substrates particularly g2 substrates such as livestock manure or silage indeed the specificity of prot extraction is the alkaline solvent used according to jimenez et al 2015 this leads to the extraction of complex protein humic and fulvic acid like compounds these acids are highly recalcitrant to biodegradation due to their high degree of complexity such as their composition functional groups and molecular conformation qualls 2004 according to their physical chemical properties humic and fulvic acids are also partially water soluble maccarthy 1976 the results obtained for soluble nitrogen and carbonated compounds revealed accumulation of these molecules after the 10th day fig 4a and b the hypothesis retained to explain this accumulation of soluble nitrogen and carbonated molecules is that humic and fulvic acids like compounds in prot faction are solubilized during digestion hence partial production of soluble inerts was assumed for xprot c and xprot p si sol c and si sol n respectively the impact of this hypothesis on inert production will be evaluated during model validation below the kinetic model of biomass decay in adm1 was retained and followed first order kinetics batstone et al 2002 to summarize the previous sections modifications to the adm1 general scheme are depicted in fig 5 and the associated petersen matrix can be found in supplementary data c based on all these experimental results and the general process inferred the admacc model was calibrated on the biodegradability tests described in the previous section 3 2 model calibration admacc was calibrated on cf and bs batch tests fig 6 show simulation results for cumulated ammonium and methane production using contois kinetic initial fractionation and detailed simulation results for protein and non protein contents of the lign holo prot and sol fractions are available in supplementary data d and e r2 correlation coefficients are presented for each figure and showed good calibration for ammonium and methane production in both substrates the protein and non protein contents in each fraction also calibrated well with r2 values which ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 3 2 1 calibration of stoichiometric parameters table 5 lists the stoichiometric and parameter values used for calibration stoichiometric parameters for the hydrolysis of xprot p the hydrolysis of xprot c and biomass decay were calibrated for cf and bs calibration of xprot p stoichiometry showed that for the cf substrate f saa xprot p was 0 2 meaning that only 20 of the fraction was biodegradable and converted into saa table 5 the remainder 80 of xprot p was transferred to the inert fraction of prot xi prot p these stoichiometric parameters were similar for the bs substrate this similarity highlights the fact that non biodegradable proteins are not substrate dependent but inoculum dependent the amount of inoculum added to the biodegradability test was the same in each test consequently the nitrogen soluble inert molecules produced during anaerobic digestion with both substrates were humic acid like substances solubilized from the biomass regarding xprot c hydrolysis the stoichiometry differed between cf and bs substrates in the cf substrate f xsol c xprot c and f si c xprot c were respectively 1 and 0 meaning that all xprot c fractions are biodegradable conversely in the bs substrate all non protein compounds were directly transferred to the soluble inert carbon f si c xprot c 1 this stoichiometric parameter was the only difference between the two substrates representing g1 substrates in cf and g2 substrates in bs this result can be explained by the transformations that occurred before sampling cf was used fresh whereas bs had been stored for several weeks in a slurry tank with no aeration system biodegradation takes place during storage møller et al 2004 consequently in bs non protein biodegradable compounds contained in the prot fraction were previously transformed during storage the remaining materials were recalcitrant materials transferred to si sol c biomass disintegration stoichiometry was similar in the two substrates with 50 of the disintegration products transferred to the inert compartment 20 in soluble si and 30 in particulate xi prot p the rest of the disintegrated materials resulting from biomass decay were distributed in saa sfa and ssu with the same distribution as with adm1 inert production was 15 higher than that found with adm1 however as reported by batstone et al 2002 in adm1 this parameter is estimated for activated sludge and can thus vary widely depending on the type of biomass 3 2 2 calibration of the kinetic parameters the calibration of parameters relative to transformation of particulate and soluble compounds are listed in table 6 except xsol c and compared with the default values in adm1 batstone et al 2002 3 2 2 1 constant calibration of first order hydrolysis kinetics calibration of first order hydrolysis kinetics considering hydrolysable protein and carbon content resulted in lower values for the lign fraction than for the holo fraction in cf the first order kinetic rate for xlign p was 0 07 d 1 while for xholo p it was 0 25 d 1 in bs the first order kinetic rate for xlign p was 0 10 d 1 and for xholo p it was 0 15 d 1 the same trend was observed for the difference between k hyd xlign c and k hyd xholo c these results revealed a significant difference in bioaccessibility between the holo fraction and the lign fraction since the lign fraction is the least bioaccessible part of organic matter defined by eps fractionation jimenez et al 2015 leading to low hydrolysis kinetics proteins contained in lign xlign p and holo xholo p were not hydrolyzed at the same rate as non protein compounds xlign c and xlign c due to the poor bioaccessibility of lignin and cellulose compounds proteins encapsulated in these structures only become available via disintegration of the lignocellulosic structure hence hydrolysis of cellulose needs to take place prior to protein hydrolysis which may explain the low or equal hydrolysis kinetic rates for xlign p and xholo p conversely the constant hydrolysis rates for xprot p and xprot c were similar depending on the substrate incubated the constant hydrolysis rate was 0 08 d 1 for cf and 0 01 d 1 for bs these hydrolysis constants are the lowest constants obtained for the hydrolysis of biodegradable materials these constants also highlight the difference between group g1 and g2 substrates according to bareha et al 2018 the difference in biodegradability between these two types of substrate depends on the prot fraction in particular these authors showed that the prot fraction did not significantly contribute to biodegradation in g2 substrates in agreement with the very low values we obtained for khyd xprot p and c according to bareha et al 2018 and jimenez et al 2015 modified eps fractionation allows quantification of bioaccessibility the fractions sol prot holo and lign represent different degrees of bioaccessibility ranked from easily bioaccessible to poorly bioaccessible however according to these results this hierarchy was not respected the prot fraction which according to the modified eps fractionation is the second most bioaccessible fraction had a low hydrolysis constant for protein and non protein compounds similar to lign the slow hydrolysis of the prot fraction that upset the hierarchy based on bioaccessibility was due to the nature of the molecules extracted as mentioned in section 3 2 1 muller et al 2014 showed that molecules extracted using alkali solvents prot extraction are exopolymeric substances like and fulvic humic like compounds and that these molecules can be extremely complex thus these molecules are poorly biodegradable which explains the low hydrolysis constant rates of the prot fraction their biodegradation being limited by their chemical composition rather than by their bioaccessibility 3 2 2 2 kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of xsol c first order and contois kinetic comparison calibration of first order and contois kinetic parameters are presented table 7 as well as the rmse calculated between the experimental and simulated values of xsol c methane and ammonium fig 7 represents the simulation of these parameters following a first order kinetic and a contois kinetic the calibration rmse values obtained using contois kinetic were globally lower than the ones found using first order kinetic indeed for cf the calibration rmse obtained with contois kinetic were equal to 0 40 and 251 26 for respectively xsol c simulation and methane simulation rmse obtained using first order kinetic were equal to respectively 0 52 and 293 21 showing less efficient calibration performances regarding bs the calibration rmse were similar on xsol c simulation rmse 0 25 and better using contois kinetic on methane simulation rmsecontois 110 31 rmsefirst order 135 20 thus based on these results contois kinetic is most adequate to describe xsol c biodegradation for all substrates contois maximum uptake values were very low in comparison to the maximum monod uptake rates associated with downstream transformations while the contois half saturation value was high for both substrates hence xsol c hydrolysis is more limiting than acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis these results differed significantly for the two substrates used for calibration in cf the k m xsol c and ks xsol c were low 0 55 d 1 and 1 35 respectively these values show that the xsol c hydrolysis is a slow process limited by the biomass concentration vavilin et al 2008 leading to the observed transient accumulation see fig 4a conversely in bs no significant accumulation was observed during incubation fig 4b and the contois parameters found were the opposite of the one calibrated for cf 4 2 d 1 for km xsol c 26 for ks xsol c the high value of ks xsol c reduced the equation to first order kinetics as highlighted by the comparison of contois and first order kinetic simulations thus for bs the reaction was not limited by biomass growth but by the complexity of the polymers in xsol c 3 2 2 3 monod parameters for acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the monod maximum specific uptake rates k m substrate obtained for acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis were below the values generally found in the literature batstone et al 2002 girault et al 2011 the opposite is true of the half saturation values which were high compared with default values batstone et al 2002 the non acclimated inoculum and the experimental design may explain these differences from default values indeed several reasons can explain a lower km value compared to defaults ones from batstone et al 2002 before batch experiments the inoculum was centrifuged and batstone et al 2015 showed that this step can reduce methanogen activity the loss of activity can lead to low km values for methanogens and this could extend to other biomasses that form the trophic chain in addition due to high substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments inhibitors from substrate can reduce biomass growth kinetics especially as the inoculum was not acclimated to the substrates the high values found for half saturation coefficients ks can be explained by the experimental design the bottles were not continuously stirred during the incubation but for 1 min twice a day the lack of stirring reduces the probability that the biomasses harvested their substrate in the medium which can lead to high ks values the same phenomenon was previously observed by girault et al 2011 in batch experiments without continuous stirring in addition table 6 highlights that calibrated parameters for biomass growth can strongly vary between substrates indeed due to high substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments physical chemical characteristics into each experiment strongly depend on the substrates hence inhibitor and micronutrient contents can strongly vary between each experiment which can explain km values significant variation amongst the substrates in addition for the same reasons viscosity strongly differs between experiments these variations combined with the non continuous mixing can explain variations of half saturation values across the substrates however these parameters only impact ammonia and methane production kinetics in the first days of the experiments default parameters can allow an accurate simulation of the ammonia and methane production for the rest of the experiment to further interpret these results identifiability analysis could be achieved on the model and confidence intervals could be estimated for calibrated parameters 3 3 model evaluation the developed and calibrated models were applied to a validation dataset composed of six batch biodegradation experiments initial fractionation used for evaluation and detailed simulations are available in respectively supplementary data d and f the g1 substrates chosen for model validation were grass silage gs oats o and faba beans fb g2 substrates were bovine manure bm pig slurry ps and oat silage os model initialization was achieved for each substrate following the procedure detailed in section 2 5 3 however calibrated kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for cf and bs were applied without any modifications to model anaerobic digestion of the substrates in their respective groups fig 8 compares measured and simulated ammonium and methane production rates during incubation for the validation set of substrates 3 3 1 prediction of ammonium and methane production the results showed that the admacc model can accurately predict the maximum ammonium concentration in all the incubation tests the simulated changes in concentration were also accurate for most of the substrates except for incubation of bovine manure fig 8d for this substrate the concentration at 7 days was poorly simulated by the model the simulation showed a time lag as it took 14 days to reach the value measured on the 7th day according to the results of the sensitivity analysis data not shown for g1 and g2 substrates which includes bovine manure short term ammonium production is highly sensitive to saa acidogenesis consequently for bovine manure saa acidogenesis is not fast enough resulting in erroneous predictions nevertheless these accurate results for most of the substrates validate the modeling framework including influent fractionation processes and kinetic models simulations of methane production also accurately predicted cumulated methane production small simulation inaccuracies were observed in first seven days due to a lag phase that was observed for all the substrates in the simulations according to the sensitivity analysis data not shown methane production is strongly limited by xsol c hydrolysis thus the discrepancy between predicted and experimental values was mainly due to xsol c hydrolysis parameters that were not optimized for each individual substrate yet due to high substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments physical chemical characteristics into each experiment strongly depended on the substrates and strongly vary then these variations can significantly impact biomass growth kinetics inhibitors micronutrients the calibrated admacc successfully simulated ammonium and methane production trends during anaerobic digestion without substrate specific calibration this is the main advantage of admacc in comparison to simpler models which require specific calibration of hydrolysis constants for each substrate however to improve the predictability of admacc a method allowing the prediction of the biodegradability of each fraction is still required nevertheless as the objective of this model is to simulate the characteristics of the digestate prediction of the bioaccessibility fractions needs to be evaluated to validate the model assumptions 3 3 2 prediction of the fate of bioaccessibility fractions during anaerobic digestion the ability of the admacc model to predict changes in the bioaccessibility fractions was investigated using the evaluation dataset predictions and measurements of the protein and non protein content of each fraction were compared for all the substrates g1 and g2 substrates and r2 coefficients were determined results of the comparison are presented in fig 9 the predicted values showed good correlations with measured values in xlign p xlign c xholo p and xholo c with respective coefficients of determination of 0 99 0 96 0 99 and 0 99 all the measured values are projected on or very close to the predicted values described by the diagonal fig 9 admacc thus allows accurate prediction of protein and non protein contents in these fractions during anaerobic digestion final and intermediary values nevertheless the fractionation method requires that total biodegradability of these fractions is previously determined by measuring the materials remaining in the fraction after incubation which limits the predictability of the model on the contrary the method for the determination of the remaining materials in prot and sol was only based on model prediction indeed these fractions are subject to more complex processes than hydrolysis e g complex material solubilization biomass growth biomass decay in the prot fraction and soluble compounds hence the biodegradation tests monitored here did not enable determination of the final inert contents in these fractions stoichiometric parameters for inert production associated with these fractions determined by calibration for cf and bs were applied to the substrates in their respective groups fig 9e shows that the predicted values are close to the experimental ones for prot fraction with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 this r2 is slightly lower than the one found previously due to delayed biomass growth correlated with the lag phase apparent in the methane production curves fig 8 the complexity of the process and of the compounds contained in this fraction was evaluated and results support the hypothesis concerning the complexity of this fraction based on observations made by jimenez et al 2015 nevertheless admacc is able to very accurately predict the biodegradability and the evolution kinetics of the prot fraction during anaerobic digestion regarding the sol fraction fig 9f reveals more differences between the predicted and measured values r2 0 71 the inaccurate predictions are mainly due to the lag phase in methane production observed in some incubation tests that is not accurately simulated by the calibrated model in addition as mentioned in section 2 1 in cf there is visible accumulation of soluble particulate compounds xsol c during incubation and the kinetic parameters associated with their transformation are the most sensitive for the prediction of short term methane production indeed no significant accumulations of vfa were observed fig 9g consequently inaccuracies in the prediction of changes in the xsol c fraction led to slight errors in the prediction of the short term methane production kinetics as can be seen in fig 8 nevertheless the use of contois kinetic as recommended by vavilin et al 1996 is justified by the fact that xsol c hydrolysis depends on the design of the experimental set up and the concentration of the original biomass the evaluation of the ability of admacc to predict trends in the bioaccessibility fraction during anaerobic digestion showed that predictions were good for almost all fractions thereby validating most of the hypotheses in the admacc model characterization of the inert content in xlign c p and xholo c p is the next step in consolidating admacc to improve its predictivity without the need for batch experiments the use of spectrophotometry could help determine these inert fractions in a limited time as done by jimenez et al 2015 2017 another limitation for the use of admacc model is its ability to simulate codigestion to this purpose further developments are required to allow the modeling of combined anaerobic digestion of several substrates as proposed by zaher et al 2009 however as identical hydrolysis kinetic parameters can be used for all the substrates owning to each two groups simpler approaches considering only two parallel hydrolysis ways could be investigated 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to develop a predictive model able to estimate methane and ammonium production plus accurate prediction of the bioaccessibility based fractionation of the digestates results were successful for ammonium production and bioaccessibility of the digestate simulated methane production was correct and depended on xsol c transformations the use of contois kinetics was appropriate to describe these transformations and made it possible to simulate a larger number of biodegradation patterns to improve the predictability of admacc characterization of the complexity of the xlign and xholo fractions could enable implementation of the model without inert

18989,the treatment of ballast water is indispensable for preventing ecological and economic damage from the spread of invasive species in this study a continuous gas bubble reactor cbr system was developed for the efficient disinfection of microorganisms in ballast water ballast water treatment bwt in the cbr was experimentally performed to disinfect artemia salina in seawater by using 1 pure co2 and 2 mixtures with co2 n2 and or so2 as a simulated flue gas co2 n2 20 80 and co2 n2 so2 19 2 77 0 3 8 the bwt efficiency was improved with an increase in gas flowrate residence time gas pressure and co2 concentration in the gas the toxicity of so2 in the co2 mixture significantly improved the mortality of microorganisms since good dispersion of bubbles and effective contact between bubbles and liquid were important factors in the bwt a 100 mortality rate of microorganisms could be achieved by controlling the operating conditions in the vertical type cbr with a counter current flow between the gas bubbles and seawater the co2 gas distribution co2 solubility and gas bubble size distribution in the cbr were determined using computational fluid dynamics cfd and experimentally confirmed using a high speed camera since excess gas can be recovered from a gas liquid separator before a ballast tank the cbr system can be operated without using any toxic or explosive gases in an eco friendly and energy saving manner graphical abstract image 1 keywords ballast water treatment continuous bubble reactor carbon dioxide computational fluid dynamics flue gas 1 introduction due to the economic globalization international trade by ships is rapidly growing since ships transport ballast water to balance the ship s stability exponentially high species transfer rates of exotic species surviving in the harsh environments in the ship is a threat to indigenous aquatic species when the ballast water is discharged these create a high risk to the entire marine ecosystem didham et al 2005 for example it was reported that the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha is native to the ponto caspian region may et al 2006 has invaded up to 40 of inland water bodies in north america and highly disturbed the ecosystems johnson and padilla 1996 therefore ballast water treatment bwt is essential for protecting the coasts of each country from ecological and economic damage since the marine environment protection committee mepc 71st session announced the regulation that all the ships must treat their ballast waters at the latest by 2024 bwt systems are required to be equipped on all ships royan 2010 numerous attempts have been made to develop various devices for treating ballast waters such as filters tang et al 2009 addition of sterilizing chemical agents ozone oz perrins et al 2006 viitasalo et al 2005 chlorine simpson 2001 biocides chelossi and faimali 2006 gregg and hallegraeff 2007 sonication gavand et al 2007 ultraviolet uv ray sterilization montani et al 1995 moreno andrés et al 2016 wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 and electrolysis el lacasa et al 2013 matousek et al 2006 among the various bwt methods uv oz and el methods have been widely applied on ships kwon et al 2015b tsolaki and diamadopoulos 2010 uv radiation causes photochemical reactions with biological components such as rna and dna montani et al 1995 the efficacy of bwt by the uv method with the addition of h2o2 or tio2 was highly improved moreno andrés et al 2016 it was pointed out that the uv method is still needed to improve the disinfection efficiency because of no residual effects of the treatment in the ozone oz method o3 must be generated on site because it is unstable at atmospheric pressure and toxic at high concentrations viitasalo et al 2005 therefore crews must be protected from ozone exposure as a first priority and high energy consumption for the compression and electricity is expected the electrolysis el method is the most widely used because it exhibits high efficiency with a simple system configuration however due to the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from electrolyzed water safety in design and operator training is crucial due to the explosive hydrogen furthermore the electrodes contaminated by salt precipitation should be cleaned or replaced periodically in addition the sterilized ballast water should be neutralized before being discharged to prevent an ecosystem from generated hclo richard 2012 it was also reported that the treatment using pressurized carbon dioxide and sodium hypochlorite naclo showed efficient performance for inactivation of enterococcus sp in seawater dang et al 2016 however the process requires the consumption of compression energy and neutralizer therefore because of safety energy consumption and efficiency requirements the demands for eco friendly energy saving advanced bwt systems are increasing recently the heavy reliance of modern industries on fossil fuels have been a central obstacle for improving air quality and preventing catastrophic climate change due to carbon dioxide therefore large quantities of co2 must be captured from various emission sources lee et al 2017 another concern is that increased concentrations of co2 lead to significant disturbances of sea ecosystems by dissolved co2 chisti 2006 although some marine microorganisms can convert co2 to valuable chemicals they can be injured or killed at high co2 concentrations due to changes of the ph and ionic strength kwon et al 2015a therefore co2 capture from the emission gases from ships will be also regulated worldwide on the other hand co2 has great potential for sterilizing ballast waters lee et al 2019 in this study a continuous gas bubble reactor cbr system using co2 and its mixtures was developed for bwt the sterilization performance was evaluated by observing the mortality rate of artemia salina in the treated seawater experiments were carried out using pure co2 as a method for utilizing captured co2 in addition because all ships emit combustion gas the applicability of using them for bwt was also evaluated by using simulated flue gases co2 n2 and co2 n2 so2 the mortality rate of microorganisms was experimented for various conditions such as gas flowrate sample storage type of the treated bw residence time gas pressure and co2 concentration since the dispersion of gas bubbles and co2 concentration in the reactor were important for the efficacy of bwt computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis was used for two types of reactors vertical and horizontal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials as an ocean microorganism artemia salina was used for mortality experiments in the developed bwt system it is a species of brine shrimp aquatic crustaceans that are more closely related to triops and cladocerans than true shrimp due to the resilience of artemia salina it is one of the standard organisms for testing the chemical toxicities ruebhart et al 2008 furthermore its eggs survive for years in harsh environments in this study artemia eggs were cultured using seawater sigma aldrich s9883 1 kg at 40 c under constant o2 flow for 40 h co2 with 99 99 purity was used for the continuous gas bubble reactor cbr for bwt as a reference gas as well as to simulate captured co2 in addition as simulated flue gas from a ship a mixture gas co2 n2 20 80 was used in the cbr although the flue gas from a ship is treated according to environmental regulations certain levels of sulfur compounds remain in the treated flue gas since so2 has a strong toxicity to microorganisms in aqueous solutions komarnisky et al 2003 the flue gas containing so2 was expected to improve the disinfection efficiency of the ballast water therefore another co2 mixture gas co2 n2 so2 19 2 77 0 3 8 was used for bwt experiments to simulate flue gas from a ship 2 2 experimental apparatus and method a schematic of the experimental vertical type bubble reactor system using co2 gases is presented in fig 1 a and the detailed structure of the reactor is shown in fig 1 b the reactor system was made by connecting two quartz tube reactors with three flange type stainless steel reactors and the inner diameter of each reactor was the same the total reactor had a 28 cm length and 3 cm inner diameter 197 92 cm3 each quartz tube reactor was connected between two flange type stainless reactors the gas inlet lines for two micro porous ceramic filters with 0 003 μm pores were installed one by one at the center of two stainless steel reactors from the bottom of the reactor system the filters inserted into the reactor system were positioned at the center of the reactor with respect to the reactor diameter gas was introduced through the filters to generate micro bubbles for treating microorganisms the generated bubbles could be monitored through the two quartz tube reactors and the pictures were taken by a high speed camera red square in fig 1 b three gas outlets were installed near the top stainless steel rector for well distribution of effluent gas however these outlets were combined to a single tube line which was connected with a gas liquid separator the liquid seawater with microorganisms was fed to the stainless steel reactor positioned at the top of the reactor system in the study two types of reactor positions vertical type and horizontal type were tested to compare the bwt performance at room temperature 26 1 c due to the buoyancy effect in the vertical type reactor the supplied gas flowed from the bottom to the top of the reactor while the seawater containing artemia salina was fed from the top to the bottom of the reactor by a gear pump wt3000 1ja longer precision pump co ltd therefore contact between the two phases was achieved by the counter current flow the gas and liquid were supplied in the same direction in the horizontal type reactor co current flow because the gas flow interfered with the liquid flow and the reactor pressure was increased by the gas flow resistance in counter current flow mode in the horizontal type reactor the gas outlet lines equipped at the top stainless steel reactor were capped to prevent the by pass of seawater from the reactor therefore no shortcut flow was observed in the reactor system the residence time of the liquid was calculated by measuring the inlet amount and outlet amount at a certain period of time the treated seawater flowed to a phase separator to recover the excess gas supplied to the reactor aside from the dissolved gas in the seawater the excess gas was vented through the valve located at the top of separator subsequently the treated seawater was collected at the bottom of the separator three samples of 5 ml were collected from the solution a set of the samples was kept in three different vials to evaluate the effects of the storage type of the treated seawater sample on the mortality of the treated seawater open vial open full contact with air vial covered by paraffin wrap with five holes of 1 mm semi open partial contact with air and capped vial closed no contact with air as specified in fig 1 a since the samples were kept in a vial rack at room temperature the open sample was fully contacted with air the semi open sample could partially be contacted with air and the closed sample was isolated form air the number of artemia salina in the sample was periodically counted using the manual colony counter 350cl haccp korea the mortality was evaluated by counting the total and inactive numbers of artemia salina in the three solution samples 2 3 mathematical modeling 2 3 1 cfd model and thermodynamic model cfd analysis was performed to simulate the cbr an eulerian scheme was used to predict the performance the eulerian multiphase model is appropriate for modeling bubble columns risers particle suspensions and fluidized beds the mass conservation equation for phase i is 1 t α i ρ i α i ρ i υ i 0 where ρ i υ i and α i are the density mean velocity and volume fraction for the gas or liquid phase the momentum conservation equation for phase i is 2 t α i ρ i ν i α i ρ i ν ν α i p i τ i α i ρ i g i 1 n r j i α i ρ i f i where p i is the static pressure τ i is the stress tensor r i j is the interaction forces between phases and ρ i g and f i are the gravitational and external forces respectively the stress tensor τ i is defined as 3 t τ i μ ν i υ t α i λ i 2 3 μ i ν i i where μ i and λ i are shear and bulk viscosities of phase i respectively the gas in the reactor causes turbulence in the primary phase a realizable k ε turbulence model was used equation 4 is the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy k 4 t ρ i k α i α i ρ i k υ i μ μ t σ k k g k g b ρ ε y m s k where gk is the turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean velocity

prediction of gas bubble breakup and coalescence in the reactor are crucial for evaluating the mortality of microorganisms due to physical mechanisms a population balance model pbm which is a statistical formulation used to describe the dynamic size distribution of the dispersed phase in a multiphase system was applied for the cbr to consider bubble breakup aggregation and size distribution 7 t n v t u n v t 1 2 0 v a v v v n v n v t d v 0 a v v n v t n v t d v ω υ v g v β v v n v d v g v n v where g v is breakage frequency g v is growth rate term n v t is number of bubbles

co2 is dissolved in seawater it forms carbonic acid h2co3 which dissociates into bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and proton h ionic species according to henry s law the solubility of gases generally increases with pressure the equilibrium relationships between the concentrations of these species can be calculated by existing models stumm and morgan 2012 the solubility of co2 in seawater was calculated by the duan model duan and sun 2003 duan et al 2006 in this model the chemical potential of co2 in the vapor phase is calculated using an equation of state and the chemical potential of co2 in the liquid phase is described by the specific interaction model of pitzer 1973 the model can be extrapolated to various aqueous solution systems such as aqueous cacl2 mgcl2 and nh4 2so4 solutions and seawater duan and sun 2003 the chemical potentials in the liquid phase μ c o 2 l and that in the gas phase μ c o 2 v can be calculated in terms of the fugacity in the vapor phase and activity in the liquid phase as 8 μ c o 2 v t p y μ c o 2 v 0 t r t l n f c o 2 t p y μ c o 2 v 0 t rt l n y c o 2 p r t l n φ c o 2 t p y 9 μ c o 2 l t p m μ c o 2 l 0 t p r t l n α c o 2 t p m μ c o 2 l 0 t p

is the ideal gas chemical potential when the pressure is equal to 1 bar in the parameterization μ c o 2 v 0 as a reference number can be set to any number because only the difference between μ c o 2 l 0 and μ c o 2 v 0 is important denbigh 1981 therefore l n φ c o 2 can be calculated from the equation of state for pure co2 and mole fraction of co2 in gas y c o 2 can be approximately calculated from y c o 2 p p h 2 o p a virial expansion of the excess gibbs energy is used to obtain l n γ c o 2 consequently co2 solubility is obtained from the following equation duan et al 2006 11 l n m c o 2 l n y

cfd simulation for bubble reactors to analyze the performance of bubble reactors computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis ansys fluent was applied to the horizontal and vertical type reactors simulation domains for horizontal and vertical type reactors were generated in design modeler and dimensions were similar to the experimental setup simulation domains were discretized into a sufficient number of fine cells to achieve a stable solution the numbers of meshes were 360 695 tetrahedral cells for the vertical type reactor and 347 890 tetrahedral cells for the horizontal type reactor the continuity and momentum equations were numerically solved for each cell by the finite volume method seawater and co2 were considered to be the primary and secondary phases respectively the properties of seawater used were as follows density of 1 022 16 kg m3 viscosity of 8 614 10 4 kg m s and molecular weight of 19 g mol counter current flow for the vertical type reactor and co current flow for the horizontal type reactor were used to match the experimental operating conditions boundary conditions for the gas in the reactors were imposed at two positions to match the experimental setup in the population balance model pbm coupled with the eulerian multiphase model six bubble classes for the bubble diameter distribution diameter 0 0012 0 0019 0 0030 0 0048 0 0076 and 0 0120 m were selected for bubble break up and coalescence phenomena the segregated solver was used for pressure velocity coupling in the segregated solver the governing equations were solved in a successive manner and decoupled each momentum equation is linearized and solved individually the continuity and momentum equation are coupled through pressure correction equations rhie 1989 the simulation was performed with 0 001 s time step convergence was assumed to be achieved once the continuity residuals were less than 10 3 and mass imbalances were approximately zero 3 results 3 1 type of bubble reactor the experimental results from the horizontal and vertical type reactors are compared in fig 2 the mortality was counted at various times in the open vial sample which was continuously exposed to air as shown in fig 1 storage condition regardless of the type of reactor no active artemia salina was observed in the samples for approximately 20 h however after 20 h the number of active artemia salina increased with time the results clearly indicated that the performance of the vertical type reactor was better than that of the horizontal type reactor the mortality in the vertical type reactor was constant after 50 h whereas the mortality in the horizontal type reactor decreased again after 50 h since the solution sample open was exposed to the air it was expected that stunned artemia salina or artemia eggs grew after sufficient time 3 1 1 mortality of microorganisms by physical effects three dimensional cfd with time in the vertical and horizontal type bubble reactor was conducted by the mathematical model in section 2 3 fig 3 shows the bubble flow simulated when the velocities of co2 gas 10 m s approximately 5 l min and liquid 5 m s were constant the interfacial changes between the vapor and liquid phases by the volume fraction occupied by co2 were determined at a time interval of 0 1 s bubbles in the vertical type bubble reactor fig 3 b were uniformly distributed throughout the reactor within a short period of time the simulation also showed that bubbles were generated broken and agglomerated however in the horizontal type reactor fig 3 a the gas bubbles were biased toward the upper part of reactor due to buoyancy therefore a large portion of the gas was separated from the liquid contour plots for the co2 mean bubble diameter are illustrated in fig 4 for the horizontal and vertical type reactors in the horizontal type reactor the bubble diameter was maximized at the top of the reactor because the bubbles elongated and tended to move upward due to buoyancy a negligible quantity of small bubbles was also observed in the lower region of the reactor however various sizes of bubbles formed bubble break up and coalescence were well distributed throughout the entire vertical type reactor a finger type of gas flow was observed in the horizontal type reactor some small bubbles find its way down in reactor like fingers but not strictly in vertical path furthermore since the upper region of the reactor was occupied by large bubbles the contact efficiency between the gas and liquid was drastically reduced the bubbles were more uniformly distributed in the vertical type reactor than in the horizontal type reactor as shown in fig 4 a and b it was reported that bubble bursting or trapping of cells significantly enhanced cell death because of shear stresses tramper et al 1986 therefore better physical effects of the co2 on the microorganisms were expected in the vertical type reactor with high gaseous dissolution and greater micro bubble collapse the inside of the quartz tube reactor a red square in fig 1 was observed using a high speed camera which could capture 1000 images per second the generated bubbles were observed using close up images from the high speed camera fig 5 shows the bubble and liquid flow regimes in the continuous bubble reactor at a low flowrate shown in fig 5 a a bubble dead zone was observed in the front of bubble generator beyond which bubbles were distributed homogenously throughout the vertical type reactor however at a high flowrate homogeneous bubble flow and slug flow regimes appeared as shown in fig 5 b a smaller number of agglomerated bubbles with large sizes flowed into the reactor at higher gas flowrates in the horizontal type reactor the bubbles were observed at the interface between the liquid and gas phases as shown in fig 5 c furthermore the upper region of the reactor was occupied by gas the images captured by the high speed camera agreed well with the cfd simulation results shown in fig 4 a and b the results indicated that the dissolution rate of co2 in the seawater and the amount of bubble breakup were much less in the horizontal type reactor than in the vertical type reactor this difference led to a difference in the mortality performances of the two types of reactors as shown in fig 2 3 1 2 mortality of microorganisms by chemical effects to determine co2 solubility in the cbr reactors a user defined function udf solution algorithm for solubility model was coupled to the simulations and each cell s temperature and pressure values were obtained by fluent macros to calculate co2 solubility by using duan model duan et al 2006 the co2 gas inlet velocity was 10 m s and seawater velocity was 5 m s at temperatures of 15 and 30 c at a seawater salinity of 32 5 wt contours of the co2 solubility in the horizontal type reactor are shown in fig 6 a and b and those for the vertical type reactor were in fig 6 c and d since the solubility of co2 gas naturally lowered with increasing temperature an increased co2 solubility at lower temperature conditions was expected to be beneficial for ballast water treatment more importantly co2 gas was soluble in limited region of the horizontal type reactor because large co2 gas bubbles build up fast rise rate results in decreased gas liquid contact time and surface area in bubble column reactor on the other hand well dispersed co2 bubbles in contact with seawater were soluble in whole region of the vertical type reactor as a result the chemical effects of the dissolved co2 on the mortality of the microorganisms were limited in the horizontal type reactor the solubility of co2 in seawater was 0 026 mol kg at a salinity of 32 5 wt 30 c and 1 atm the ionic strength and ph in the seawater was obtained using the phreeqc program and the co2 solubility at a fixed temperature and pressure parkhurst and appelo 1999 the ionic strength and ph values were 0 6087 mol kg and 3 905 at 1 atm respectively the increased ionic strength and acidity caused by the dissolution of co2 improved the chemical sterilization effect since the contact of the bubbles with the solution was better in the vertical type reactor than in the horizontal type reactor the vertical type bubble reactor would reach a dissolved co2 equilibrium faster resulting in harsher conditions for the disinfection of microorganisms according to the calculated results at 3 8 atm the variation of dissolved co2 and ph were relatively substantial 0 0997 mol kg and 3 618 but the change of ionic strength was small 0 6088 mol kg therefore it was expected that a higher co2 pressure led to greater performance in the bwt which was experimentally confirmed as discussed in section 3 5 3 2 variation of mortality by co2 gas flowrate the effects of the gas inlet flowrate on the mortality of microorganisms at a fixed residence time were experimentally studied in the vertical type reactor with three different gas inlet flowrates in fig 7 a mortality of 100 was achieved at all the conditions until 25 h this mortality was maintained for 60 h when the gas inlet flowrate was 20 l min however at lower gas flowrates 5 and 10 l min the mortality rate decreased with time after a certain amount of time elapsed as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 5 there was a bubble dead zone in the reactor where the number of generated bubbles was relatively small therefore stunned artemia salina and its eggs in the open type sample could survive air contact 3 3 effect of residence time and sample storage on mortality of artemia salina the sample obtained from the separator was divided into three types of sample vials according to the degree of oxygen contact the mortality of the microorganisms in each vial was measured after 60 h in open type sample the microorganisms in the ballast water were in complete contact with air in the semi open type sample organisms were in partial contact with air through holes on the vial cover the closed type sample was sealed and there was no contact with air fig 1 in addition the mortality rates of the microorganisms in each type of sample were evaluated at three different residence times 15 30 and 60 s in the vertical type reactor treatment as presented above the mortality rate was maintained at 100 during the initial period after the reaction using a pure co2 flow therefore the comparison of mortality rate in the samples was made after 60 h as shown in fig 8 the mortality rate was 100 in all the closed type samples regardless of the residence time this indicated that the increased ionic strength and acidity contributed to the suppression of microorganisms survival in addition the semi open type samples at residence times of 30 and 60 s showed similar mortality rates while the mortality rate at a residence time of 15 s was significantly reduced thus if the ballast water is treated for certain amount of time in this study residence times longer than 30 s the treated microorganisms cannot survive limited contact with air however reductions of the mortality rates were observed in all the open type samples regardless of contact time although the degree of mortality was different for the different residence times 3 4 mortality of artemia salina based on type of gas to evaluate the effects of the type of gas on the mortality of the microorganisms experiments were conducted with two types of gas mixtures at 1 atm and a gas flowrate of 5 l min in the vertical type reactor to simulate flue gases from ships a gas mixture co2 n2 20 80 vol and co2 n2 so2 19 2 77 0 3 8 was used the residence time of ballast water containing microorganisms in the reactor was fixed at 30 s the experimental results are compared with the results obtained using pure co2 in fig 9 as mentioned above the mortality rate of microorganisms using pure co2 was 100 by 24 h but the mortality rate decreased with time and stabilized at a value of lower than 90 after 50 h for the co2 n2 20 80 mixture the mortality rate was much worse than that obtained with pure co2 flow but the variation of the mortality rate with time was similar as shown in fig 9 furthermore the mortality rate of microorganisms decreased to less than 50 after 60 h because the low partial pressure of co2 in the mixture resulted in lower solubility this implies that co2 solubility is crucial for achieving a high mortality rate however the so2 mixture co2 n2 so2 gas mixture 19 2 77 0 3 8 achieved a mortality of 100 even in the open type sample regardless of time this indicates that the toxicity of dissolved so2 critically damaged the microorganisms despite the partial pressure of co2 being much lower than that of pure co2 fig 10 shows the optical microscopic images of the microorganisms after being treated by various gases the artemia salina in the sample treated with the co2 n2 mixture fig 10 a appeared to be stunned while maintaining their original shapes when pure co2 gas was used fig 10 b although the microorganisms nearly maintained their original shapes parts of their bodies were damaged and changes of body surfaces were observed furthermore the microorganisms appeared to be dissolved when the gas mixture containing so2 was used fig 10 c this implies that the treatment efficiency of ballast water can be very high when the ship flue gas is used 3 5 mortality of artemia salina based on gas pressure the effects of dissolved co2 on the mortality of the microorganisms were experimentally investigated using pure co2 and a co2 n2 mixture at 3 8 atm experiments were conducted at a gas flowrate of 5 l min and residence time of 15 s in the vertical type reactor and the treated solution was kept in the open type sample the results clearly showed that a higher mortality rate of the microorganisms was obtained at higher pressures when pure co2 was used at 1 atm the mortality rate of the microorganisms was 100 but it rapidly decreased after 24 h because of the short residence time as shown in fig 11 a for the co2 n2 mixture at 1 atm the mortality of microorganisms was also lower than that at the residence time of 30 s as shown in fig 9 however at 3 8 atm shown in fig 11 b the initial mortality rate of the microorganisms increased significantly and the overall performance at 60 h was much higher than that at 1 atm and a residence time of 30 s as shown in fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 performance of mortality by operating variables cell damage in the bubble column increased with increasing gas flowrate and bubble bursting or trapping of cells among bubbles in foams were significant sources of cell death due to shear stresses tramper et al 1986 the hydrodynamic mechanism of bubble damage at a gas liquid interface consists of four steps 1 a bubble is formed at the interface between the liquid and gas 2 a hole is formed in the bubble 3 the hole rapidly recedes film and 4 the liquid jet rises wu 1995 therefore the mortality of microorganisms was greatly affected by the physical effects of more bubble formation at higher flowrates pressures and the type of a reactor vertical type reactor due to increasing co2 solubility with decreasing temperature lower temperature conditions are beneficial for ballast water treatment furthermore well dispersed co2 bubbles in seawater as well as contact time between gas and liquid were important for effective performance in the cbr system when the residence time was shortened and the possibility of oxygen contact with the treated ballast water increased the mortality of the microorganisms could be potentially worse although the structures of ballast tanks are similar to the semi open type sample a longer residence time is recommended to maintain a high mortality rate after treatment in the cbr system considering the partial pressure of co2 in the mixture the improved solubility of co2 chemical effects at the increasing pressure was not the only factor that enhanced the mortality because the partial pressure was lower than that of pure co2 at 1 atm the results indicated that the enhanced mechanical force physical effects of gas bubbles by operating variables contributed to the enhancement of the mortality to a certain degree furthermore since the treated ballast water with dissolved co2 may be kept at atmospheric pressure in ballast tanks the high mortality efficiency can be remained the developed continuous bubble reactor cbr system has the advantages of combined physical and chemical mechanisms for effective disinfection of microorganisms furthermore effective performance of the developed cbr system is expected for brackish or freshwater because dissolved co2 in liquid phases leads to decreasing ph and increasing ionic strength in our previous studies for biological co2 conversion highly dissolved co2 is very critical for the microorganisms which use co2 as one of energy sources kwon et al 2015a 2018 major drawback in applying various disinfection methods for bwt is associated with the problems of disinfection byproducts which possess long term toxicity and have impact on biodiversity co2 dissolution in seawater produces carbonates and bicarbonates and so2 produces sulphates andreasen and mayer 2007 since they are the natural constituents of seawater the byproducts will not be harmful for the marine ecosystem because they are dissolved in the treated ballast water under less than 1 bar a very small amount of salt may be precipitated to the reactor system due to the minerals and metal ions in the seawater however since the salt precipitation by the dissolved co2 takes a long reaction time at very high concentration of co2 jeon et al 2018 the precipitation may not be issued in the cbr system in addition if the concentration of dissolved gas should be reduced before being discharged the concentration can be easily reduced by a small temperature increase 4 2 notes for cbr commercial scale commercial bwt systems are required to fulfill the treatment of ballast water in the range of several hundreds to thousands cubic meter per hour depending upon the size of ships for the scale up of the developed cbr system the linear velocities of gas and liquid as well as the bubble distribution in a reactor are important considering the capacity of 500 m3 hr ballast water it is expected that the reactor with 4 166 m3 single reactor length 2 075 m diameter 1 6 m double reactors length 1 7 m diameter 1 25 m is required for 100 mortality rate residence time of 30 s when pure co2 or flue gas co2 n2 so2 at 1 atm is used to the cbr system if the residence time increases to confirm a perfect mortality rate the reactor volume naturally increases residence time of 60 s reactor volume of 8 333 m3 according to the experimental results the linear velocity of gas was much higher than that of liquid higher than 100 times because high bubble contact and solubility are desired when a flue gas from a ship is applied to the cbr system the consumption of gas may be unimportant however when pure co2 is used co2 supplied to a reactor must be circulated by a gas pump as presented in fig 1 dashed lines and circulation pump because a limited amount of co2 can be loaded on the ship for the scale up for the cbr system under a remaining high mortality rate well designed multi bubble generators are required because well dispersion of bubbles may be more critical for the commercial scale reactor with a larger diameter in addition since bwts are typically exposed to the prominent level of total suspended solids tss sediments and large sized microorganisms in seawater additional component for removing them may be recommended before the cbr system automatic self cleaning filter systems with mesh sizes of about 40 μm are frequently employed leaving only smaller organisms in the water werschkun et al 2014 it is needed for a further study because such solids can also contribute to mixing well gas and liquid in the reactor in addition such solid cannot clog the pores of bubble generators during gas feeding the cbr system can function effectively at atmospheric pressure however higher gas pressure is expected to the enhanced mortality rate due to the increased solubility of gases in seawater however auxiliary equipment such as compressor would be needed for gas supply and or gas circulation therefore additional equipment leads to increasing energy consumption and capital operational cost 5 conclusion a continuous gas bubble reactor system using co2 and simulated flue gases of ships co2 n2 and co2 n2 so2 was developed for the efficient disinfection of microorganisms in ballast water the mortality rate of microorganisms in the cbr was affected by physical and chemical effects of the supplied gas bubbles since the improved co2 solubility in the seawater resulted in increased ionic strength and acidity the mortality rate was enhanced by chemical effects in addition the increased bubble flowrate or pressure also contributed to the enhancement of the mortality rate due to physical effects however these physical and mechanical effects on the mortality were relatively weaker than the chemical effects furthermore when the simulated flue gas containing a low concentration of so2 was used microorganisms in the seawater were critically damaged and a mortality rate of 100 was achieved with a low co2 partial pressure and flowrate because of the strong toxicity of so2 toward microorganisms good dispersion of bubbles and effective contact between bubbles and liquid were important factors in the cbr system the contact between the two phases was limited and phase separation occurred in the horizontal type reactor due to buoyancy of the gas however according to cfd and experimental results the solubility bubble distribution and phase contact could be highly improved in the vertical type cbr with a counter current flow between gas bubbles and seawater therefore a 100 mortality rate of microorganisms could be achieved by controlling the operating conditions a longer residence time of the solution faster gas flowrate and higher co2 concentration and pressure were favorable for greater mortality rate in seawater in practical applications the excess gas from the top of a gas separator can be circulated to the reactor the treated seawater from the separator can be fed to ballast tanks at gas saturated conditions since the ballast tanks contain air and air vent lines before filling ballast water the semi open vial in fig 1 may be considered in a form similar to the ballast tank according to the results from the semi open vial the mortality rate can be maintained through the cbr system according to marpol 73 78 annex vi the concentration of sox contained in the ship s exhaust gases should be less than 0 6 g kwh if the flue gas from a ship is used in the cbr system even a dilute concentration of sulfur compounds in the flue gasis beneficial for complete sterilization of the ballast water in addition a gas circulating pump is not required because the flue gas can be continuously supplied to the cbr system the cbr system can achieve high disinfection performance of ballast water without requiring toxic or explosive gases providing an eco friendly and energy saving disinfection method the cbr system for bwt can contribute to preventing ecological and economic damage from marine pollution by using captured co2 or by utilizing ship flue gases the feasibility and reliability of the bwt by the developed cbr

18989,the treatment of ballast water is indispensable for preventing ecological and economic damage from the spread of invasive species in this study a continuous gas bubble reactor cbr system was developed for the efficient disinfection of microorganisms in ballast water ballast water treatment bwt in the cbr was experimentally performed to disinfect artemia salina in seawater by using 1 pure co2 and 2 mixtures with co2 n2 and or so2 as a simulated flue gas co2 n2 20 80 and co2 n2 so2 19 2 77 0 3 8 the bwt efficiency was improved with an increase in gas flowrate residence time gas pressure and co2 concentration in the gas the toxicity of so2 in the co2 mixture significantly improved the mortality of microorganisms since good dispersion of bubbles and effective contact between bubbles and liquid were important factors in the bwt a 100 mortality rate of microorganisms could be achieved by controlling the operating conditions in the vertical type cbr with a counter current flow between the gas bubbles and seawater the co2 gas distribution co2 solubility and gas bubble size distribution in the cbr were determined using computational fluid dynamics cfd and experimentally confirmed using a high speed camera since excess gas can be recovered from a gas liquid separator before a ballast tank the cbr system can be operated without using any toxic or explosive gases in an eco friendly and energy saving manner graphical abstract image 1 keywords ballast water treatment continuous bubble reactor carbon dioxide computational fluid dynamics flue gas 1 introduction due to the economic globalization international trade by ships is rapidly growing since ships transport ballast water to balance the ship s stability exponentially high species transfer rates of exotic species surviving in the harsh environments in the ship is a threat to indigenous aquatic species when the ballast water is discharged these create a high risk to the entire marine ecosystem didham et al 2005 for example it was reported that the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha is native to the ponto caspian region may et al 2006 has invaded up to 40 of inland water bodies in north america and highly disturbed the ecosystems johnson and padilla 1996 therefore ballast water treatment bwt is essential for protecting the coasts of each country from ecological and economic damage since the marine environment protection committee mepc 71st session announced the regulation that all the ships must treat their ballast waters at the latest by 2024 bwt systems are required to be equipped on all ships royan 2010 numerous attempts have been made to develop various devices for treating ballast waters such as filters tang et al 2009 addition of sterilizing chemical agents ozone oz perrins et al 2006 viitasalo et al 2005 chlorine simpson 2001 biocides chelossi and faimali 2006 gregg and hallegraeff 2007 sonication gavand et al 2007 ultraviolet uv ray sterilization montani et al 1995 moreno andrés et al 2016 wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 and electrolysis el lacasa et al 2013 matousek et al 2006 among the various bwt methods uv oz and el methods have been widely applied on ships kwon et al 2015b tsolaki and diamadopoulos 2010 uv radiation causes photochemical reactions with biological components such as rna and dna montani et al 1995 the efficacy of bwt by the uv method with the addition of h2o2 or tio2 was highly improved moreno andrés et al 2016 it was pointed out that the uv method is still needed to improve the disinfection efficiency because of no residual effects of the treatment in the ozone oz method o3 must be generated on site because it is unstable at atmospheric pressure and toxic at high concentrations viitasalo et al 2005 therefore crews must be protected from ozone exposure as a first priority and high energy consumption for the compression and electricity is expected the electrolysis el method is the most widely used because it exhibits high efficiency with a simple system configuration however due to the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from electrolyzed water safety in design and operator training is crucial due to the explosive hydrogen furthermore the electrodes contaminated by salt precipitation should be cleaned or replaced periodically in addition the sterilized ballast water should be neutralized before being discharged to prevent an ecosystem from generated hclo richard 2012 it was also reported that the treatment using pressurized carbon dioxide and sodium hypochlorite naclo showed efficient performance for inactivation of enterococcus sp in seawater dang et al 2016 however the process requires the consumption of compression energy and neutralizer therefore because of safety energy consumption and efficiency requirements the demands for eco friendly energy saving advanced bwt systems are increasing recently the heavy reliance of modern industries on fossil fuels have been a central obstacle for improving air quality and preventing catastrophic climate change due to carbon dioxide therefore large quantities of co2 must be captured from various emission sources lee et al 2017 another concern is that increased concentrations of co2 lead to significant disturbances of sea ecosystems by dissolved co2 chisti 2006 although some marine microorganisms can convert co2 to valuable chemicals they can be injured or killed at high co2 concentrations due to changes of the ph and ionic strength kwon et al 2015a therefore co2 capture from the emission gases from ships will be also regulated worldwide on the other hand co2 has great potential for sterilizing ballast waters lee et al 2019 in this study a continuous gas bubble reactor cbr system using co2 and its mixtures was developed for bwt the sterilization performance was evaluated by observing the mortality rate of artemia salina in the treated seawater experiments were carried out using pure co2 as a method for utilizing captured co2 in addition because all ships emit combustion gas the applicability of using them for bwt was also evaluated by using simulated flue gases co2 n2 and co2 n2 so2 the mortality rate of microorganisms was experimented for various conditions such as gas flowrate sample storage type of the treated bw residence time gas pressure and co2 concentration since the dispersion of gas bubbles and co2 concentration in the reactor were important for the efficacy of bwt computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis was used for two types of reactors vertical and horizontal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials as an ocean microorganism artemia salina was used for mortality experiments in the developed bwt system it is a species of brine shrimp aquatic crustaceans that are more closely related to triops and cladocerans than true shrimp due to the resilience of artemia salina it is one of the standard organisms for testing the chemical toxicities ruebhart et al 2008 furthermore its eggs survive for years in harsh environments in this study artemia eggs were cultured using seawater sigma aldrich s9883 1 kg at 40 c under constant o2 flow for 40 h co2 with 99 99 purity was used for the continuous gas bubble reactor cbr for bwt as a reference gas as well as to simulate captured co2 in addition as simulated flue gas from a ship a mixture gas co2 n2 20 80 was used in the cbr although the flue gas from a ship is treated according to environmental regulations certain levels of sulfur compounds remain in the treated flue gas since so2 has a strong toxicity to microorganisms in aqueous solutions komarnisky et al 2003 the flue gas containing so2 was expected to improve the disinfection efficiency of the ballast water therefore another co2 mixture gas co2 n2 so2 19 2 77 0 3 8 was used for bwt experiments to simulate flue gas from a ship 2 2 experimental apparatus and method a schematic of the experimental vertical type bubble reactor system using co2 gases is presented in fig 1 a and the detailed structure of the reactor is shown in fig 1 b the reactor system was made by connecting two quartz tube reactors with three flange type stainless steel reactors and the inner diameter of each reactor was the same the total reactor had a 28 cm length and 3 cm inner diameter 197 92 cm3 each quartz tube reactor was connected between two flange type stainless reactors the gas inlet lines for two micro porous ceramic filters with 0 003 μm pores were installed one by one at the center of two stainless steel reactors from the bottom of the reactor system the filters inserted into the reactor system were positioned at the center of the reactor with respect to the reactor diameter gas was introduced through the filters to generate micro bubbles for treating microorganisms the generated bubbles could be monitored through the two quartz tube reactors and the pictures were taken by a high speed camera red square in fig 1 b three gas outlets were installed near the top stainless steel rector for well distribution of effluent gas however these outlets were combined to a single tube line which was connected with a gas liquid separator the liquid seawater with microorganisms was fed to the stainless steel reactor positioned at the top of the reactor system in the study two types of reactor positions vertical type and horizontal type were tested to compare the bwt performance at room temperature 26 1 c due to the buoyancy effect in the vertical type reactor the supplied gas flowed from the bottom to the top of the reactor while the seawater containing artemia salina was fed from the top to the bottom of the reactor by a gear pump wt3000 1ja longer precision pump co ltd therefore contact between the two phases was achieved by the counter current flow the gas and liquid were supplied in the same direction in the horizontal type reactor co current flow because the gas flow interfered with the liquid flow and the reactor pressure was increased by the gas flow resistance in counter current flow mode in the horizontal type reactor the gas outlet lines equipped at the top stainless steel reactor were capped to prevent the by pass of seawater from the reactor therefore no shortcut flow was observed in the reactor system the residence time of the liquid was calculated by measuring the inlet amount and outlet amount at a certain period of time the treated seawater flowed to a phase separator to recover the excess gas supplied to the reactor aside from the dissolved gas in the seawater the excess gas was vented through the valve located at the top of separator subsequently the treated seawater was collected at the bottom of the separator three samples of 5 ml were collected from the solution a set of the samples was kept in three different vials to evaluate the effects of the storage type of the treated seawater sample on the mortality of the treated seawater open vial open full contact with air vial covered by paraffin wrap with five holes of 1 mm semi open partial contact with air and capped vial closed no contact with air as specified in fig 1 a since the samples were kept in a vial rack at room temperature the open sample was fully contacted with air the semi open sample could partially be contacted with air and the closed sample was isolated form air the number of artemia salina in the sample was periodically counted using the manual colony counter 350cl haccp korea the mortality was evaluated by counting the total and inactive numbers of artemia salina in the three solution samples 2 3 mathematical modeling 2 3 1 cfd model and thermodynamic model cfd analysis was performed to simulate the cbr an eulerian scheme was used to predict the performance the eulerian multiphase model is appropriate for modeling bubble columns risers particle suspensions and fluidized beds the mass conservation equation for phase i is 1 t α i ρ i α i ρ i υ i 0 where ρ i υ i and α i are the density mean velocity and volume fraction for the gas or liquid phase the momentum conservation equation for phase i is 2 t α i ρ i ν i α i ρ i ν ν α i p i τ i α i ρ i g i 1 n r j i α i ρ i f i where p i is the static pressure

i λ i 2 3 μ i ν i i where μ i and λ i are shear and bulk viscosities of phase i respectively the gas in the reactor causes turbulence in the primary phase a realizable k ε turbulence model was used equation 4 is the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy k 4 t ρ i k α i α i ρ i k υ i μ μ t σ k k g k g b ρ ε y m s k where gk is the turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean velocity

prediction of gas bubble breakup and coalescence in the reactor are crucial for evaluating the mortality of microorganisms due to physical mechanisms a population balance model pbm which is a statistical formulation used to describe the dynamic size distribution of the dispersed phase in a multiphase system was applied for the cbr to consider bubble breakup aggregation and size distribution 7 t n v t u n v t 1 2 0 v a v v v n v n v t d v 0 a v v n v t n v t d v ω υ v g v β v v n v d v g v n v where g v is breakage frequency g v is growth rate term n v t is number of bubbles

co2 is dissolved in seawater it forms carbonic acid h2co3 which dissociates into bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and proton h ionic species according to henry s law the solubility of gases generally increases with pressure the equilibrium relationships between the concentrations of these species can be calculated by existing models stumm and morgan 2012 the solubility of co2 in seawater was calculated by the duan model duan and sun 2003 duan et al 2006 in this model the chemical potential of co2 in the vapor phase is calculated using an equation of state and the chemical potential of co2 in the liquid phase is described by the specific interaction model of pitzer 1973 the model can be extrapolated to various aqueous solution systems such as aqueous cacl2 mgcl2 and nh4 2so4 solutions and seawater duan and sun 2003 the chemical potentials in the liquid phase μ c o 2 l and that in the gas phase μ c o 2 v can be calculated in terms of the fugacity in the vapor phase and activity in the liquid phase as 8 μ c o 2 v t p y μ c o 2 v 0 t r t l n f c o 2 t p y μ c o 2 v 0 t rt l n y c o 2 p r t l n φ c o 2 t p y 9 μ c o 2 l t p m μ c o 2 l 0 t p r t l n α c o 2 t p m μ c o 2 l 0 t p

is the ideal gas chemical potential when the pressure is equal to 1 bar in the parameterization μ c o 2 v 0 as a reference number can be set to any number because only the difference between μ c o 2 l

y c o 2 p p h 2 o p a virial expansion of the excess gibbs energy is used to obtain l n γ c o 2 consequently co2 solubility is obtained from the following equation duan et al 2006 11 l n m c o 2 l n y

cfd simulation for bubble reactors to analyze the performance of bubble reactors computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis ansys fluent was applied to the horizontal and vertical type reactors simulation domains for horizontal and vertical type reactors were generated in design modeler and dimensions were similar to the experimental setup simulation domains were discretized into a sufficient number of fine cells to achieve a stable solution the numbers of meshes were 360 695 tetrahedral cells for the vertical type reactor and 347 890 tetrahedral cells for the horizontal type reactor the continuity and momentum equations were numerically solved for each cell by the finite volume method seawater and co2 were considered to be the primary and secondary phases respectively the properties of seawater used were as follows density of 1 022 16 kg m3 viscosity of 8 614 10 4 kg m s and molecular weight of 19 g mol counter current flow for the vertical type reactor and co current flow for the horizontal type reactor were used to match the experimental operating conditions boundary conditions for the gas in the reactors were imposed at two positions to match the experimental setup in the population balance model pbm coupled with the eulerian multiphase model six bubble classes for the bubble diameter distribution diameter 0 0012 0 0019 0 0030 0 0048 0 0076 and 0 0120 m were selected for bubble break up and coalescence phenomena the segregated solver was used for pressure velocity coupling in the segregated solver the governing equations were solved in a successive manner and decoupled each momentum equation is linearized and solved individually the continuity and momentum equation are coupled through pressure correction equations rhie 1989 the simulation was performed with 0 001 s time step convergence was assumed to be achieved once the continuity residuals were less than 10 3 and mass imbalances were approximately zero 3 results 3 1 type of bubble reactor the experimental results from the horizontal and vertical type reactors are compared in fig 2 the mortality was counted at various times in the open vial sample which was continuously exposed to air as shown in fig 1 storage condition regardless of the type of reactor no active artemia salina was observed in the samples for approximately 20 h however after 20 h the number of active artemia salina increased with time the results clearly indicated that the performance of the vertical type reactor was better than that of the horizontal type reactor the mortality in the vertical type reactor was constant after 50 h whereas the mortality in the horizontal type reactor decreased again after 50 h since the solution sample open was exposed to the air it was expected that stunned artemia salina or artemia eggs grew after sufficient time 3 1 1 mortality of microorganisms by physical effects three dimensional cfd with time in the vertical and horizontal type bubble reactor was conducted by the mathematical model in section 2 3 fig 3 shows the bubble flow simulated when the velocities of co2 gas 10 m s approximately 5 l min and liquid 5 m s were constant the interfacial changes between the vapor and liquid phases by the volume fraction occupied by co2 were determined at a time interval of 0 1 s bubbles in the vertical type bubble reactor fig 3 b were uniformly distributed throughout the reactor within a short period of time the simulation also showed that bubbles were generated broken and agglomerated however in the horizontal type reactor fig 3 a the gas bubbles were biased toward the upper part of reactor due to buoyancy therefore a large portion of the gas was separated from the liquid contour plots for the co2 mean bubble diameter are illustrated in fig 4 for the horizontal and vertical type reactors in the horizontal type reactor the bubble diameter was maximized at the top of the reactor because the bubbles elongated and tended to move upward due to buoyancy a negligible quantity of small bubbles was also observed in the lower region of the reactor however various sizes of bubbles formed bubble break up and coalescence were well distributed throughout the entire vertical type reactor a finger type of gas flow was observed in the horizontal type reactor some small bubbles find its way down in reactor like fingers but not strictly in vertical path furthermore since the upper region of the reactor was occupied by large bubbles the contact efficiency between the gas and liquid was drastically reduced the bubbles were more uniformly distributed in the vertical type reactor than in the horizontal type reactor as shown in fig 4 a and b it was reported that bubble bursting or trapping of cells significantly enhanced cell death because of shear stresses tramper et al 1986 therefore better physical effects of the co2 on the microorganisms were expected in the vertical type reactor with high gaseous dissolution and greater micro bubble collapse the inside of the quartz tube reactor a red square in fig 1 was observed using a high speed camera which could capture 1000 images per second the generated bubbles were observed using close up images from the high speed camera fig 5 shows the bubble and liquid flow regimes in the continuous bubble reactor at a low flowrate shown in fig 5 a a bubble dead zone was observed in the front of bubble generator beyond which bubbles were distributed homogenously throughout the vertical type reactor however at a high flowrate homogeneous bubble flow and slug flow regimes appeared as shown in fig 5 b a smaller number of agglomerated bubbles with large sizes flowed into the reactor at higher gas flowrates in the horizontal type reactor the bubbles were observed at the interface between the liquid and gas phases as shown in fig 5 c furthermore the upper region of the reactor was occupied by gas the images captured by the high speed camera agreed well with the cfd simulation results shown in fig 4 a and b the results indicated that the dissolution rate of co2 in the seawater and the amount of bubble breakup were much less in the horizontal type reactor than in the vertical type reactor this difference led to a difference in the mortality performances of the two types of reactors as shown in fig 2 3 1 2 mortality of microorganisms by chemical effects to determine co2 solubility in the cbr reactors a user defined function udf solution algorithm for solubility model was coupled to the simulations and each cell s temperature and pressure values were obtained by fluent macros to calculate co2 solubility by using duan model duan et al 2006 the co2 gas inlet velocity was 10 m s and seawater velocity was 5 m s at temperatures of 15 and 30 c at a seawater salinity of 32 5 wt contours of the co2 solubility in the horizontal type reactor are shown in fig 6 a and b and those for the vertical type reactor were in fig 6 c and d since the solubility of co2 gas naturally lowered with increasing temperature an increased co2 solubility at lower temperature conditions was expected to be beneficial for ballast water treatment more importantly co2 gas was soluble in limited region of the horizontal type reactor because large co2 gas bubbles build up fast rise rate results in decreased gas liquid contact time and surface area in bubble column reactor on the other hand well dispersed co2 bubbles in contact with seawater were soluble in whole region of the vertical type reactor as a result the chemical effects of the dissolved co2 on the mortality of the microorganisms were limited in the horizontal type reactor the solubility of co2 in seawater was 0 026 mol kg at a salinity of 32 5 wt 30 c and 1 atm the ionic strength and ph in the seawater was obtained using the phreeqc program and the co2 solubility at a fixed temperature and pressure parkhurst and appelo 1999 the ionic strength and ph values were 0 6087 mol kg and 3 905 at 1 atm respectively the increased ionic strength and acidity caused by the dissolution of co2 improved the chemical sterilization effect since the contact of the bubbles with the solution was better in the vertical type reactor than in the horizontal type reactor the vertical type bubble reactor would reach a dissolved co2 equilibrium faster resulting in harsher conditions for the disinfection of microorganisms according to the calculated results at 3 8 atm the variation of dissolved co2 and ph were relatively substantial 0 0997 mol kg and 3 618 but the change of ionic strength was small 0 6088 mol kg therefore it was expected that a higher co2 pressure led to greater performance in the bwt which was experimentally confirmed as discussed in section 3 5 3 2 variation of mortality by co2 gas flowrate the effects of the gas inlet flowrate on the mortality of microorganisms at a fixed residence time were experimentally studied in the vertical type reactor with three different gas inlet flowrates in fig 7 a mortality of 100 was achieved at all the conditions until 25 h this mortality was maintained for 60 h when the gas inlet flowrate was 20 l min however at lower gas flowrates 5 and 10 l min the mortality rate decreased with time after a certain amount of time elapsed as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 5 there was a bubble dead zone in the reactor where the number of generated bubbles was relatively small therefore stunned artemia salina and its eggs in the open type sample could survive air contact 3 3 effect of residence time and sample storage on mortality of artemia salina the sample obtained from the separator was divided into three types of sample vials according to the degree of oxygen contact the mortality of the microorganisms in each vial was measured after 60 h in open type sample the microorganisms in the ballast water were in complete contact with air in the semi open type sample organisms were in partial contact with air through holes on the vial cover the closed type sample was sealed and there was no contact with air fig 1 in addition the mortality rates of the microorganisms in each type of sample were evaluated at three different residence times 15 30 and 60 s in the vertical type reactor treatment as presented above the mortality rate was maintained at 100 during the initial period after the reaction using a pure co2 flow therefore the comparison of mortality rate in the samples was made after 60 h as shown in fig 8 the mortality rate was 100 in all the closed type samples regardless of the residence time this indicated that the increased ionic strength and acidity contributed to the suppression of microorganisms survival in addition the semi open type samples at residence times of 30 and 60 s showed similar mortality rates while the mortality rate at a residence time of 15 s was significantly reduced thus if the ballast water is treated for certain amount of time in this study residence times longer than 30 s the treated microorganisms cannot survive limited contact with air however reductions of the mortality rates were observed in all the open type samples regardless of contact time although the degree of mortality was different for the different residence times 3 4 mortality of artemia salina based on type of gas to evaluate the effects of the type of gas on the mortality of the microorganisms experiments were conducted with two types of gas mixtures at 1 atm and a gas flowrate of 5 l min in the vertical type reactor to simulate flue gases from ships a gas mixture co2 n2 20 80 vol and co2 n2 so2 19 2 77 0 3 8 was used the residence time of ballast water containing microorganisms in the reactor was fixed at 30 s the experimental results are compared with the results obtained using pure co2 in fig 9 as mentioned above the mortality rate of microorganisms using pure co2 was 100 by 24 h but the mortality rate decreased with time and stabilized at a value of lower than 90 after 50 h for the co2 n2 20 80 mixture the mortality rate was much worse than that obtained with pure co2 flow but the variation of the mortality rate with time was similar as shown in fig 9 furthermore the mortality rate of microorganisms decreased to less than 50 after 60 h because the low partial pressure of co2 in the mixture resulted in lower solubility this implies that co2 solubility is crucial for achieving a high mortality rate however the so2 mixture co2 n2 so2 gas mixture 19 2 77 0 3 8 achieved a mortality of 100 even in the open type sample regardless of time this indicates that the toxicity of dissolved so2 critically damaged the microorganisms despite the partial pressure of co2 being much lower than that of pure co2 fig 10 shows the optical microscopic images of the microorganisms after being treated by various gases the artemia salina in the sample treated with the co2 n2 mixture fig 10 a appeared to be stunned while maintaining their original shapes when pure co2 gas was used fig 10 b although the microorganisms nearly maintained their original shapes parts of their bodies were damaged and changes of body surfaces were observed furthermore the microorganisms appeared to be dissolved when the gas mixture containing so2 was used fig 10 c this implies that the treatment efficiency of ballast water can be very high when the ship flue gas is used 3 5 mortality of artemia salina based on gas pressure the effects of dissolved co2 on the mortality of the microorganisms were experimentally investigated using pure co2 and a co2 n2 mixture at 3 8 atm experiments were conducted at a gas flowrate of 5 l min and residence time of 15 s in the vertical type reactor and the treated solution was kept in the open type sample the results clearly showed that a higher mortality rate of the microorganisms was obtained at higher pressures when pure co2 was used at 1 atm the mortality rate of the microorganisms was 100 but it rapidly decreased after 24 h because of the short residence time as shown in fig 11 a for the co2 n2 mixture at 1 atm the mortality of microorganisms was also lower than that at the residence time of 30 s as shown in fig 9 however at 3 8 atm shown in fig 11 b the initial mortality rate of the microorganisms increased significantly and the overall performance at 60 h was much higher than that at 1 atm and a residence time of 30 s as shown in fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 performance of mortality by operating variables cell damage in the bubble column increased with increasing gas flowrate and bubble bursting or trapping of cells among bubbles in foams were significant sources of cell death due to shear stresses tramper et al 1986 the hydrodynamic mechanism of bubble damage at a gas liquid interface consists of four steps 1 a bubble is formed at the interface between the liquid and gas 2 a hole is formed in the bubble 3 the hole rapidly recedes film and 4 the liquid jet rises wu 1995 therefore the mortality of microorganisms was greatly affected by the physical effects of more bubble formation at higher flowrates pressures and the type of a reactor vertical type reactor due to increasing co2 solubility with decreasing temperature lower temperature conditions are beneficial for ballast water treatment furthermore well dispersed co2 bubbles in seawater as well as contact time between gas and liquid were important for effective performance in the cbr system when the residence time was shortened and the possibility of oxygen contact with the treated ballast water increased the mortality of the microorganisms could be potentially worse although the structures of ballast tanks are similar to the semi open type sample a longer residence time is recommended to maintain a high mortality rate after treatment in the cbr system considering the partial pressure of co2 in the mixture the improved solubility of co2 chemical effects at the increasing pressure was not the only factor that enhanced the mortality because the partial pressure was lower than that of pure co2 at 1 atm the results indicated that the enhanced mechanical force physical effects of gas bubbles by operating variables contributed to the enhancement of the mortality to a certain degree furthermore since the treated ballast water with dissolved co2 may be kept at atmospheric pressure in ballast tanks the high mortality efficiency can be remained the developed continuous bubble reactor cbr system has the advantages of combined physical and chemical mechanisms for effective disinfection of microorganisms furthermore effective performance of the developed cbr system is expected for brackish or freshwater because dissolved co2 in liquid phases leads to decreasing ph and increasing ionic strength in our previous studies for biological co2 conversion highly dissolved co2 is very critical for the microorganisms which use co2 as one of energy sources kwon et al 2015a 2018 major drawback in applying various disinfection methods for bwt is associated with the problems of disinfection byproducts which possess long term toxicity and have impact on biodiversity co2 dissolution in seawater produces carbonates and bicarbonates and so2 produces sulphates andreasen and mayer 2007 since they are the natural constituents of seawater the byproducts will not be harmful for the marine ecosystem because they are dissolved in the treated ballast water under less than 1 bar a very small amount of salt may be precipitated to the reactor system due to the minerals and metal ions in the seawater however since the salt precipitation by the dissolved co2 takes a long reaction time at very high concentration of co2 jeon et al 2018 the precipitation may not be issued in the cbr system in addition if the concentration of dissolved gas should be reduced before being discharged the concentration can be easily reduced by a small temperature increase 4 2 notes for cbr commercial scale commercial bwt systems are required to fulfill the treatment of ballast water in the range of several hundreds to thousands cubic meter per hour depending upon the size of ships for the scale up of the developed cbr system the linear velocities of gas and liquid as well as the bubble distribution in a reactor are important considering the capacity of 500 m3 hr ballast water it is expected that the reactor with 4 166 m3 single reactor length 2 075 m diameter 1 6 m double reactors length 1 7 m diameter 1 25 m is required for 100 mortality rate residence time of 30 s when pure co2 or flue gas co2 n2 so2 at 1 atm is used to the cbr system if the residence time increases to confirm a perfect mortality rate the reactor volume naturally increases residence time of 60 s reactor volume of 8 333 m3 according to the experimental results the linear velocity of gas was much higher than that of liquid higher than 100 times because high bubble contact and solubility are desired when a flue gas from a ship is applied to the cbr system the consumption of gas may be unimportant however when pure co2 is used co2 supplied to a reactor must be circulated by a gas pump as presented in fig 1 dashed lines and circulation pump because a limited amount of co2 can be loaded on the ship for the scale up for the cbr system under a remaining high mortality rate well designed multi bubble generators are required because well dispersion of bubbles may be more critical for the commercial scale reactor with a larger diameter in addition since bwts are typically exposed to the prominent level of total suspended solids tss sediments and large sized microorganisms in seawater additional component for removing them may be recommended before the cbr system automatic self cleaning filter systems with mesh sizes of about 40 μm are frequently employed leaving only smaller organisms in the water werschkun et al 2014 it is needed for a further study because such solids can also contribute to mixing well gas and liquid in the reactor in addition such solid cannot clog the pores of bubble generators during gas feeding the cbr system can function effectively at atmospheric pressure however higher gas pressure is expected to the enhanced mortality rate due to the increased solubility of gases in seawater however auxiliary equipment such as compressor would be needed for gas supply and or gas circulation therefore additional equipment leads to increasing energy consumption and capital operational cost 5 conclusion a continuous gas bubble reactor system using co2 and simulated flue gases of ships co2 n2 and co2 n2 so2 was developed for the efficient disinfection of microorganisms in ballast water the mortality rate of microorganisms in the cbr was affected by physical and chemical effects of the supplied gas bubbles since the improved co2 solubility in the seawater resulted in increased ionic strength and acidity the mortality rate was enhanced by chemical effects in addition the increased bubble flowrate or pressure also contributed to the enhancement of the mortality rate due to physical effects however these physical and mechanical effects on the mortality were relatively weaker than the chemical effects furthermore when the simulated flue gas containing a low concentration of so2 was used microorganisms in the seawater were critically damaged and a mortality rate of 100 was achieved with a low co2 partial pressure and flowrate because of the strong toxicity of so2 toward microorganisms good dispersion of bubbles and effective contact between bubbles and liquid were important factors in the cbr system the contact between the two phases was limited and phase separation occurred in the horizontal type reactor due to buoyancy of the gas however according to cfd and experimental results the solubility bubble distribution and phase contact could be highly improved in the vertical type cbr with a counter current flow between gas bubbles and seawater therefore a 100 mortality rate of microorganisms could be achieved by controlling the operating conditions a longer residence time of the solution faster gas flowrate and higher co2 concentration and pressure were favorable for greater mortality rate in seawater in practical applications the excess gas from the top of a gas separator can be circulated to the reactor the treated seawater from the separator can be fed to ballast tanks at gas saturated conditions since the ballast tanks contain air and air vent lines before filling ballast water the semi open vial in fig 1 may be considered in a form similar to the ballast tank according to the results from the semi open vial the mortality rate can be maintained through the cbr system according to marpol 73 78 annex vi the concentration of sox contained in the ship s exhaust gases should be less than 0 6 g kwh if the flue gas from a ship is used in the cbr system even a dilute concentration of sulfur compounds in the flue gasis beneficial for complete sterilization of the ballast water in addition a gas circulating pump is not required because the flue gas can be continuously supplied to the cbr system the cbr system can achieve high disinfection performance of ballast water without requiring toxic or explosive gases providing an eco friendly and energy saving disinfection method the cbr system for bwt can contribute to preventing ecological and economic damage from marine pollution by using captured co2 or by utilizing ship flue gases the feasibility and reliability of the bwt by the developed cbr system using gases containing co2 suggest that it can be used in an eco friendly safe and energy saving manner conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
