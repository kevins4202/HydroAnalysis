17620,four microbes campylobacter spp escherichia coli cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp were monitored in 16 waterways that supply public drinking water for 13 new zealand towns and cities over 500 samples were collected from the abstraction point at each study site every three months between 2009 and 2019 the waterways represent a range from small to large free flowing to reservoir impoundments draining catchments of entirely native vegetation to those dominated by pastoral agriculture we used machine learning algorithms to explore the relative contribution of land use catchment geology vegetation topography and water quality characteristics of the catchment to determining the abundance and or presence of each microbe sites on rivers draining predominantly agricultural catchments the waikato river oroua river and waiorohi stream had all four microbes present often in high numbers throughout the sampling interval other sites such as the hutt river and big huia creek in wellington which drain catchments of native vegetation never had pathogenic microbes detected or unsafe levels of e coli boosted regression tree models could predict abundances and presence absence of all four microbes with good precision using a wide range of potential environmental predictors covering land use geology vegetation topography and nutrient concentrations models were more accurate for protozoa than bacteria but did not differ markedly in their ability to predict abundance or presence absence environmental drivers of microbe abundance or presence absence also differed depending on whether the microbe was protozoan or bacterial protozoa were more prevalent in waterways with lower water quality higher numbers of ruminants in the catchment and in september and december bacteria were more abundant with higher rainfall saturated soils and catchments with greater than 35 of the land in agriculture although modern water treatment protocols will usually remove many pathogens from drinking water several recent outbreaks of waterborne disease due to treatment failures have highlighted the need to manage water supplies on multiple fronts this research has identified potential catchment level variables and thresholds that could be better managed to reduce the potential for pathogens to enter drinking water supplies 1 introduction supplying safe drinking water is one of the top un sustainable development goals united nations 2015 but also remains a significant challenge for many developed countries hrudey and hrudey 2019 vinas et al 2019 reports suggest the number of cases where waterborne disease arises from drinking water supplies is decreasing at least amongst most developed countries but contamination of drinking water can still pose a serious health risk craun et al 2003 vinas et al 2019 world health organization 2020 mortality and morbidity from water sanitation and hygiene related infections remain as a health management concern even amongst the wealthiest nations craun et al 2010 guzman herrador et al 2015 hrudey et al 2006 schuster et al 2005 there are many well documented outbreaks of waterborne disease associated with failures in the drinking water supply network from a range of developed countries including the usa uk sweden france spain and turkey ercumen et al 2014 ligon and bartram 2016 there have been nearly 300 waterborne disease outbreaks in canada from 1974 to 2001 schuster et al 2005 the worst at walkerton in 2000 when seven people died and a further 2 300 became ill hrudey and hrudey 2019 new zealand experienced its largest recorded waterborne disease outbreak in 2016 when a drinking water supply was contaminated with campylobacter sp resulting in over 5 500 people diagnosed with this pathogen and four fatalities gilpin et al in review hrudey 2017 skegg 2019 excluding such one off large scale events new zealand drinking water related gastrointestinal illness has been estimated to be between 18 000 35 000 cases per year ball 2006 with hospitalization rates due to enteric diseases having increased over the twenty years leading up to 2008 baker et al 2012 in canada murphy et al 2016 estimated nearly 345 000 cases per year of drinking water related gastrointestinal illness minimizing microbial contamination of water sources is one key to reducing the prevalence of these drinking water related gastrointestinal illnesses ligon and bartram 2016 a multiple barrier approach is generally considered the best way to reduce microbial contamination and ensure drinking water safety vinas et al 2019 this approach involves implementation of preventive and or eliminative processes at various stages of the drinking water supply chain from the source through treatment to distribution while some might reason that management of the raw source water is not an overly critical step in this approach because any potential pathogens can be removed with the appropriate technological protocols this is not the case for example cryptosporidium contamination of drinking water supplies have led to several disease outbreaks because conventional water treatment and chlorine disinfection are often ineffective against the protozoan baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 swaffer et al 2018 there is also potential for treatment failure power loss or damage to delivery systems due to storm or earthquake damage ercumen et al 2014 ligon and bartram 2016 managing the state of the raw water supply is therefore critical for ensuring a safe drinking water supply and avoiding potentially fatal disease outbreaks however many aspects of water quality have been declining in the worlds waterways holden et al 2017 vorosmarty et al 2010 in new zealand most lowland rivers in pastoral catchments and all sites in urban catchments exceed safe swimming standards for pathogens and 55 of monitored sites have increasing nitrate nitrogen and 25 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp levels larned et al 2004 ministry for the environment and statistics new zealand 2015 thirty two percent of monitored lakes are now classed as polluted with nutrients as are 84 of lakes in pastoral catchments verburg et al 2010 groundwater ecosystems are less well monitored but at 50 out of 70 surveillance bores between 2012 and 2014 escherichia coli levels exceeded human drinking standards ministry for the environment and stats nz 2017 the relationship between the prevalence of waterborne pathogens catchment characteristics hydrology and land use management strategies have been well studied e g smith et al 2001 swaffer et al 2018 usepa 2009 wilkes et al 2009 wilkes et al 2011 many have found particular types of land management such as urban or agricultural land use often lead to an increase in pathogens in waterways draining those catchments swaffer et al 2018 usepa 2009 wilkes et al 2013 catchment and hydrological characteristics such as slope water velocity temperature and high flow events can also contribute to higher densities of pathogens in draining waterways smith et al 2001 swaffer et al 2018 wilkes et al 2009 wilkes et al 2011 frequently the subset of potential determinates of pathogen prevalence investigated have been limited to a range of either land use or hydrological variables and we are not aware of any studies that have considered water quality of the receiving waterbody as a potential driver furthermore assessment is often conducted with linear analytic techniques but see wilkes et al 2011 in this study we have measured the abundance and or presence of three pathogens campylobacter spp cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp and e coli in 16 waterbodies throughout new zealand that provide the raw water for public drinking supplies sampled between 2009 and 2019 they represent a range of waterways from small to large free flowing to reservoir impoundments draining catchments of entirely native vegetation to those dominated by pastoral agriculture we then used a powerful machine learning technique boosted regression tree brt analysis to investigate which of a range of land use catchment geology vegetation topography and water quality variables were most strongly linked with the abundance and or presence of each microbe and thresholds where that abundance and or presence may rapidly change brts are a modification of classification and regression tree analysis that combines the strengths of regression tree algorithms and boosting combining many simple models to yield models with improved predictive performance de ath and fabricius 2000 elith et al 2008 norberg et al 2019 there are a wide range of powerful machine learning techniques available now that can be used for both describing and predicting from larger datasets cheng et al 2018 crisci et al 2012 death 2015 they have the advantage that they do not require data linearity or any particular statistical properties in the data can often accommodate missing data and can account for the multilevel interactions that often occur in environmental data the objective of our analysis was to investigate which characteristics and thresholds of those drivers of the water source effect the microbial quality of the raw water intended for treatment and subsequent public consumption given the prevalence of disease outbreaks from purportedly treated drinking water in developed countries around the globe identifying these characteristics may help restrict pathogen abundance in raw drinking water and thus the risk of faulty treatment procedures endangering people s health 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the raw water sources of 16 public drinking supplies were sampled throughout new zealand between 2009 and 2019 fig 1 study sites were selected to represent different catchment types supplying drinking water to the public in new zealand however given the non random selection of sites the results of this study should not be assumed to represent the pathogen levels in new zealand waterways in general the study waterbodies supplied raw water to distribution networks receiving water from one or more sources in a simple standard drinking water distribution network water is abstracted at a source treated at a treatment plant and distributed to the public through a distribution system however for large communities it is common for a network to have multiple sources and treatment plants supplying water to multiple interconnected zones within a distribution system this was the case for the auckland wellington and tauranga plants 2 2 sample collection the study sites were monitored for four microbes campylobacter sp e coli cryptosporidium and giardia from september 2009 to june 2016 or january 2019 depending on the site in order to determine the quality of the raw drinking water table 1 samples were collected from the abstraction point intake at each study site every three months three water samples were collected 100 ml for campylobacter isolation 100 ml for e coli enumeration and 100 l filtered through a filta max filter idexx laboratories inc maine usa for the enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts after filtration the filta max filter module was removed from the filter housing and placed in a transportation bag all samples were stored on ice after sampling and transported to the laboratory within 24 h 2 3 laboratory procedures campylobacter and e coli for campylobacter isolation 2 100 ml of water were filtered through 0 45 μ m pore 47 mm diameter disks millipore corporation massachusetts usa on arrival at the laboratory immediately campylobacter enrichment was conducted by incubating one of the filter disks in bolton s broth under microaerophilic conditions 85 n2 5 o2 0 h2 and 10 co2 at 42 c for 48 h using a macs va500 microaerophilic workstation don whitley scientific limited yorkshire uk the broth was then cultured onto selective medium modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar mccda for a further 48 h the second filter disk was then placed into cefoperazone amphotericin teicoplanin cat broth and incubated in a hydrogen enriched microaerobic 82 nitrogen 3 oxygen 10 carbon dioxide 5 hydrogen whitley va500 workstation incubator don whitley shipley england for 48 hours at 37 c a sample of this was then cultured on cat agar fort richard laboratories auckland plates and grown for a further 48 hours under the same conditions from every mccda and cat plate with morphology typical of campylobacter were selected and grown on blood agar fort richard laboratories auckland and incubated in the microaerophilic workstation for 48 h a presumptive campylobacter positive result was declared if the blood agar growth exhibited typical campylobacter phenotypic characteristics a confirmatory positive result was obtained after subjecting the isolates to campylobacter genus stucki et al 1995 and species specific e g c jejuni and c coli polymerase chain reaction pcr s until 2018 then subsequently by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof mass spectrometry ms 100ml grab samples for e coli enumeration were submitted to accredited regional laboratories and processed within 24 hours using standard procedures reported as mpn 100 ml 2 4 laboratory procedures cryptosporidium and giardia screening for cryptosporidium and giardia was based on the united states environmental protection agency usepa method 1623 united states environmental protection agency 2012 in summary the filter module was removed from the transportation bag and dismantled to recover foam disks along with residual fluid and placed in a stomacher 3500 bag seward ltd west sussex uk containing 500 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs the mixture was homogenized using a stomacher 3500 seward ltd west sussex uk for 10 min the eluent was then transferred into a 500 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 min at 10 c using a sorvall rt7 benchtop centrifuge gmi inc minnesota usa the top 450 ml supernatant was aspirated and discarded the remaining fluid was vortexed to resuspend the formed pellet at the bottom of the tube and then transferred into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged as before the supernatant was aspirated as before leaving 10 ml in which the pellet was resuspended immunomagnetic separation ims using a dynabeads gc combo kit invitrogen corporation california usa was applied to the mixture the resultant 50 μ l fluid was transferred onto a fluorescence microscopy slide with reaction wells marienfeld gmbh co kg lauda königshofen germany and placed in a humidity chamber then 50 μ l of diluted aqua glo stain waterborne inc new orleans usa was added to the slide and incubated at 37 c for 30 60 min the stain was washed off using 50 μ l pbs and the slide was air dried for 2 min a bx 60 fluorescence microscope olympus tokyo japan was used to scan the slide for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts characteristic features as described in usepa method 1623 were used to identify the oo cysts and enumeration was performed following the method described by united states environmental protection agency 1995 2 5 waterbody characteristic data catchment attributes for the study locations are presented in table 1 populations supplied by each source was extracted from the 2011 register of community drinking water supplies in new zealand rainfall runoff excess precipitation less evaporation and deficit soil moisture deficit where full is 0 mm and empty is 150 mm data were obtained from weather stations located nearest to a particular study site via free downloads from the cliflo website http cliflo niwa co nz maintained by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa catchment environmental data from several publicly available gis resources on nutrients flow regime catchment geology vegetation topography temperature shading and macroinvertebrate communities i e macroinvertebrate community index mci for each sample location were included in the analysis as potential predictor variables of pathogen abundance modelled nutrient mci and e coli were sourced from unwin and larned 2013 flow data from booker and woods 2014 catchment geology topography and temperature from the freshwater ecosystems of new zealand fenz database leathwick et al 2010 domestic animal data were extracted from agribase 2016 shapefile purchased from asurequality new zealand limited a commercial company owned by the government of new zealand not surprisingly many of these variables were highly correlated so the data set was reduced to 47 potential predictors supplementary appendix 1 by removal of variables with a correlation greater than r 0 85 the variable with the strongest correlations with microbe abundance was retained 2 6 data analysis all data analysis was conducted in r 3 6 1 r core team 2018 correlation of pathogen abundance was performed using pearson s correlation coefficient because of the large number of zeros huson 2007 site and season differences in abundance or presence absence were evaluated with a generalized linear model glm using either poisson binomial or negative binomial theta 0 5 error distributions to minimize over dispersion relationships between the frequency of each pathogen at a site for e coli this was at 200 mpn 100 ml and potential environmental determinants identified in the boosted regression tree analysis were examined using the glm function in r using binomial errors or nls for non linear relationships analysis of variance anova was used to compare models with the most parsimonious model used if additional parameters transformations or increased model complexity did not achieve any significant improvement 2 7 boosted regression tree boosted regression trees brts are a powerful modification of classification and regression tree analysis that is now widely used de ath and fabricius 2000 elith et al 2008 the method combines the strengths of two algorithms regression trees models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits and boosting an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance trees are added and assessed sequentially until the holdout deviance is minimised which reduces the probability of overfitting the relative influence of each factor is calculated following friedman and meulman 2003 and is the average number of times a variable is selected for a split weighted by the squared improvement to the model at each split then scaled to ensure all variable importance scores add to 100 elith et al 2008 friedman and meulman 2003 one disadvantage of the approach is that models are complex and cannot be represented by a single decision tree which might allow a researcher to explain the model relationships to a potential end user however the advantage of the technique is it can provide robust models of predictor and response variable relationships from a limited dataset and allow extrapolation from that model to new data scenarios norberg et al 2019 we used the gbm package ridgeway 2013 in r version 3 6 1 r project for statistical computing vienna austria to fit the brts we used the gaussian family of relationships for count data and the bernoulli family for frequency data a tree complexity of 5 except for rain adjusted e coli which used a complexity of 20 learning rate of 0 001 and bag fraction of 0 5 and cross validation cv on 10 of the data 3 results 3 1 site catchment characteristics between 27 and 37 rounds of sampling were conducted at each site between september 2009 and january 2019 table 1 supplementary appendix 2 during this period a total of 512 samples were collected for each study microbe waterways supplying drinking water ranged from small streams to large rivers with some waterbodies lake like impoundments on streams or rivers the population supplied by a single water source ranged from 1 300 to 921 008 based on the 2011 register of community drinking water supplies in new zealand estimates the percentage of the catchment in agriculture ranged from 0 to 72 and total ruminant density ranged from 0 to 2 2 million for the lower reaches of the waikato river table 1 3 2 microbes all of the microbes are positively correlated but only cryptosporidium and giardia are strongly correlated table 2 the two sites on the waikato river oroua river and waiorohi stream had all four pathogens present for e coli this was 200 mpn 100 ml in at least one sample through the study while the hutt river and big huia creek had none recorded table 1 four surface water sources oroua river waiorohi stream and the two waikato river sites had samples positive for both cryptosporidium and giardia with the two waikato river sites having the highest percentage of protozoa positive samples table 1 cryptosporidium oocysts were highest in the two waikato sites and oroua river fig 2 table 3 cryptosporidium oocysts peaked in abundance in september at all sites where they occurred table 3 giardia cysts were also highest in the two waikato sites and oroua river fig 2 table 3 giardia cysts peaked in abundance in september and december table 3 among the 512 samples tested for campylobacter 100 20 were positive the surface water sources with the highest number of campylobacter positive samples included the waiorohi stream in tauranga waikato river in hamilton and the oroua river in feilding fig 2 table 3 december march and may had the highest number of positive samples table 3 for e coli 419 out of 500 82 samples had a concentration 1 mpn 100 ml but only 48 of the 512 samples 9 had concentrations 200 mpn 100 ml the waiorohi stream oroua river and waikato river at tuakau had the highest occurrence of e coli abundance 200 mpn 100 ml rainfall was the strongest determinant of in stream e coli levels higher rainfall on the date of collection increased the number of e coli adjusting for rainfall i e total e coli rainfall resulted in may june and july having the lowest proportional abundance of e coli in samples table 3 3 3 boosted regression tree analysis the brt models for all of the microbes had cross validated correlations of between 0 47 and 0 74 with the two protozoa having slightly better model fits table 4 interestingly dichotomous models for microbial presence absence were not markedly better but did have a slightly different order to the importance of key predictor variables table 4 fig 3 the top five predictor variables for each microbe are listed in table 4 and the percentage of each brt explained by the top 20 variables plotted in fig 3 the strongest predictors of the protozoan abundance and or prevalence were the number of ruminants in the catchment 800 000 e coli concentration adjusted for rainfall 150 200 mpn 100 ml mci 90 drp dissolved reactive phosphorus 0 015 mg l time of year spring catchment size and rainfall deficit high e coli and high drp and low mci that are associated with greater abundance or prevalence of protozoa indicate generally lower water quality potentially linked with a greater number of ruminants in the catchment the two bacterial species were better predicted by rainfall soil deficit saturated soils increased bacterial abundance in waterways percentage of upstream agriculture 35 instream nitrate concentration 0 24 mg l and human population size 3 4 regression analysis the number of ruminants in the catchment and mci an invertebrate measure of water quality were key environmental predictors identified in the brt analysis fig 4 illustrates that for both protozoa as the number of ruminants increase the frequency of positive samples also increases as a power function for cryptosporidium y 26 24 1 e 0 0000025rumin density r2 0 94 and for giardia y 33 0 1 e 0 0000028rumin density r2 0 89 interestingly the one site with high numbers of ruminants upstream but low frequency of positive samples is the only impoundment site in an agriculturally dominated landscape the frequency of positive bacterial samples was not clearly related to catchment ruminant density fig 4b the link between the number of positive samples and mci also differed between protozoa and bacteria fig 5 relationships were neither linear logarithmic or power functions but protozoan prevalence seemed to drop off markedly at an mci of 90 and bacterial prevalence at an mci of 120 protozoan prevalence also drops considerably at sites with a median e coli density of less than 50 mpn 100 ml fig 6 4 discussion there are marked differences in the prevalence and abundance of all four microbes identified in the water samples collected in the 16 streams rivers and impoundments where raw drinking water is abstracted sites on the waikato river oroua river and waiorohi stream that have catchments dominated by agriculture and large numbers of ruminates had the most positive samples for all four microbes while the hutt river and big huia creek located in catchments dominated by native vegetation had no recorded pathogens and very low levels of e coli this provides strong evidence that management of the catchment of a water source will impact the abundance and prevalence of waterborne pathogens as species of both giardia and cryptosporidium are typically gut parasites of ruminates it is not surprising that their prevalence increases in waterways surrounded by a greater number of ruminates a potential threshold at greater than 500 000 ruminates per catchment occurs when protozoan abundance appears to peak many of these sites also had low water quality which numerous studies have linked to agricultural intensification foote et al 2015 julian et al 2017 larned et al 2018 mcdowell et al 2017 snelder et al 2018 it is not possible from our study to determine whether reduced water quality promotes the survival of these protozoa outside the host or whether ruminant density is the main driver of protozoa abundance and low water quality was simply correlated with that several studies including in new zealand have found cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis is more prevalent in people that have greater exposure to cattle jagai et al 2010 lal et al 2016 snel et al 2009a snel et al 2009b snel et al 2009c animal waste from dairy shed effluent will often contain several pathogens including giardia and cryptosporidium mawdsley et al 1995 mcleod et al 2008 and these pathogens can survive for extended periods in the soil before being washed into nearby waterways mawdsley et al 1995 ross and donnison 2003 ehsan et al 2015 ruecker et al 2007 and swaffer et al 2018 also found giardia sp and cryptosporidium sp more common in waterways draining agriculture in belgium canada and australia although this relationship is dependent on the particular species of giardia and or cryptosporidium present for example species of cryptosporidium associated with wildlife which pose limited risk to humans are more prevalent in waterways draining native vegetation whereas c andersoni ruecker et al 2007 ryan and power 2012 and c parvum swaffer et al 2018 which are common in cattle and do pose a human health risk can be more prevalent in agricultural catchments robinson et al 2011 wells et al 2015 we were not able to speciate the giardia and cryptosporidium in our survey and thus are not able to determine their potential human health risk in contrast the prevalence of the two bacteria were linked more directly with rainfall soil moisture and catchment vegetation in the modelling than agricultural intensity per se saturated soils in catchments with a high percentage of pasture and high rainfall resulted in the greatest prevalence of campylobacter and abundance of e coli in waterways barriers to passage of the bacteria from the point of origin such as animal feaces to the waterway may therefore be more critical than for the protozoa and are thus affected more by the surrounding soil and vegetation properties close et al 2010 muirhead et al 2006 as with the protozoa numerous studies have found a link between high levels of e coli or the presence of campylobacter in waterways and more intensive agricultural land use close et al 2010 quilliam et al 2011 a major source of e coli in agricultural catchments is often livestock although direct defecation in waterways is now prevented in much of new zealand by stock exclusion fencing collins 2004 collins et al 2007 collins and rutherford 2004 jamieson et al 2004 microbes move from land to waterways through both surface and subsurface transportation khaleel et al 1981 reddy et al 1981 in saturated soil environments there is decreased interaction time with soil particles leading to diminished pathogen removal chandler et al 1981 however waterways are also reservoirs and or sources of bacteria in their own right and our study does not allow us to differentiate whether the collected bacteria arise from upstream or the adjoining land wilkes et al 2019 modeling of national data collected by environment agencies throughout new zealand has shown median e coli concentrations between 2013 and 2017 are 15 times higher in catchments dominated by pasture than those in native vegetation ministry for the environment and stats nz 2019 that soil and catchment vegetation characteristics were more important than stock numbers in predicting water bacterial concentrations suggests there may be more opportunity for restricting bacterial inputs into waterways by management of riparian vegetation numerous studies have shown the utility of riparian vegetation along stream banks to limit bacterial contamination of waterways feld et al 2018 parkyn et al 2003 stutter et al 2012 furthermore the waterborne disease outbreaks of campylobacter and e coli in new zealand and walkerton canada were linked to raw drinking water contaminated by livestock prior to inadequate treatment bartholomew et al 2014 gilpin et al in review hrudey 2017 hrudey and hrudey 2019 although e coli remains the standard method in the tool kit for assessing potential pathogen risk in waterways wu et al 2011 our survey highlights the potential for other water quality measures such as nutrient levels and macroinvertebrate community health to also indicate thresholds of increased risk particularly for protozoa thresholds commonly used for ecological health in new zealand of the mci at 90 and 120 also appear to be thresholds of change in protozoan pathogen numbers as the mci is routinely measured by environment agencies and less variable in time this potential relationship clearly warrants further investigation this relationship may also have potential for use in other countries where waterway pathogen monitoring may not be routine or too expensive monitoring of ecological health using macroinvertebrates is relatively inexpensive and widespread globally if macroinvertebrate community health is linked with microbial pathogen prevalence perhaps it could offer a cheaper alternative to direct pathogen assessments our study also provides some evidence that currently applied thresholds for e coli to restrict prevalence of other pathogens in waterway recreational activities may be set too high ministry for the environment 2017 the prevalence of both protozoan taxa was much higher at sites where the median e coli was greater than 50 mpn 100 ml the current national policy statement for freshwater management in new zealand have medians of 130 and 260 cfu e coli 100 ml to provide protection from these and other waterborne pathogens ministry for the environment 2017 although it is unclear at what levels of waterway protozoan abundance human health may be compromised our work does suggest there may be significant numbers of the pathogens in waterways with e coli well below 130 or 260 cfu 100 ml the three microbes cryptosporidium giardia and campylobacter are among the leading causes of gastrointestinal disease and seem to be on the rise in many countries baker et al 2012 institute of environmental science and research 2018 murphy et al 2016 many will assume that modern water treatment techniques and tight regulations for drinking water supplies makes concerns about raw water and the characteristics of the surrounding catchments irrelevant however the many cases of drinking water contamination even with these constraints highlight that we cannot always rely on technology to protect our health ercumen et al 2014 ligon and bartram 2016 vinas et al 2019 advocate for a multiple barrier approach to managing drinking water including prevention of potential pathogens in raw source water the modelling has identified some key catchment management variables that can impact the prevalence of these three pathogens in raw source water furthermore cryptosporidium in particular is notorious for its resistance to conventional water treatment and chlorine disinfection efstratiou et al 2017 swaffer et al 2018 as many waterways become increasingly degraded and the prevalence of human pathogens in those supplying drinking water increases we need to be increasingly vigilant of managing both the catchment of the water supply and the water supply itself in this study we have highlighted some of the key environmental indicators that can alert drinking supply managers to potential increased risks in their water supply 5 conclusion some of the 16 rivers and streams that supply raw drinking water to a number of new zealand towns and cities had significantly greater numbers and or prevalence of four microbes campylobacter spp escherichia coli cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp that are potential human pathogens modeling with machine learning techniques identified that the two species of protozoa were more prevalent in waterways with lower water quality and higher numbers of ruminants in the catchment whereas the two bacteria were more abundant at sites or times with higher rainfall waterlogged soils and catchments with greater than 35 of the land in agriculture although modern water treatment eliminates much of the potential risk from these contaminated waterways the recent outbreaks of drinking water contamination highlight that water managers also need to consider management of the water supply catchment to ensure safe drinking water our study highlights that an effective way to limit pathogens in raw source water is to manage catchment landuse protected watersheds of predominantly native vegetation is certainly a strategy used effectively in australia new zealand and the usa while current landuse may preclude such comprehensive approaches it could still be possible to limit agricultural intensity and or utilise riparian vegetation buffers to help reduce the prevalence of pathogens in many waterways declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of

17620,four microbes campylobacter spp escherichia coli cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp were monitored in 16 waterways that supply public drinking water for 13 new zealand towns and cities over 500 samples were collected from the abstraction point at each study site every three months between 2009 and 2019 the waterways represent a range from small to large free flowing to reservoir impoundments

vegetation topography and water quality characteristics of the catchment to determining the abundance and or presence of each microbe sites on rivers draining predominantly agricultural catchments the waikato river oroua river and waiorohi stream had all four microbes present often in high numbers throughout the sampling interval other sites such as the hutt river and big huia creek in wellington

microbes with good precision using a wide range of potential environmental predictors covering land use geology vegetation topography and nutrient concentrations models were more accurate for protozoa than bacteria but did not differ markedly in their ability to predict abundance or presence absence environmental drivers of microbe abundance or presence absence also differed depending on whether the microbe was protozoan or bacterial protozoa were more prevalent in waterways with lower water quality higher numbers of ruminants in the catchment and in september and december bacteria were more

sustainable development goals united nations 2015 but also remains a significant challenge for many developed countries hrudey and hrudey 2019 vinas et al 2019 reports suggest the number of cases

al 2003 vinas et al 2019 world health organization 2020 mortality and morbidity from water sanitation and hygiene related infections remain as a health management concern even amongst the wealthiest nations craun et al 2010 guzman herrador et al 2015 hrudey et al 2006 schuster et al 2005 there are many well documented outbreaks of waterborne disease associated with failures in the drinking water supply network from a range of developed countries including the usa uk sweden france spain and turkey ercumen et al 2014 ligon and bartram 2016 there have been nearly 300 waterborne disease outbreaks in canada from 1974 to 2001 schuster et al 2005 the worst at walkerton in 2000 when seven people died and a further 2 300 became ill hrudey and hrudey 2019 new zealand experienced its largest recorded waterborne disease outbreak in 2016 when a drinking water supply was contaminated with campylobacter sp resulting in over 5 500 people diagnosed with this pathogen and four fatalities gilpin et al in review hrudey 2017 skegg 2019 excluding such one off large scale events new zealand drinking water related gastrointestinal illness has been estimated to be between 18 000 35 000 cases per year ball 2006 with hospitalization rates due to enteric diseases having increased over the twenty years leading up to 2008 baker et al 2012 in canada murphy et al 2016 estimated nearly 345 000 cases per year of drinking water related gastrointestinal illness minimizing microbial contamination of water sources is one key to reducing the prevalence of these drinking water related gastrointestinal illnesses ligon and bartram 2016 a multiple barrier approach is generally considered the best way to reduce microbial contamination and ensure drinking water safety vinas et al 2019 this approach involves implementation of preventive and or eliminative processes at various stages of the drinking water supply chain from the source through treatment to distribution while some might reason that management of the raw source water is not an overly critical step in this approach because any potential pathogens can be removed with the appropriate technological protocols this is not the case for example cryptosporidium contamination of drinking water supplies have led to several disease outbreaks because conventional water treatment and chlorine disinfection are often ineffective against the protozoan baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 swaffer et al 2018 there is also potential for treatment failure power loss or damage to delivery systems due to storm or earthquake damage ercumen et al 2014 ligon and bartram 2016 managing the state of the raw water supply is therefore critical for ensuring a safe drinking water supply and avoiding potentially fatal disease outbreaks however many aspects of water quality have been declining in the worlds waterways holden et al 2017 vorosmarty et al 2010 in new zealand most lowland rivers in pastoral catchments and all sites in urban catchments exceed safe swimming standards for pathogens and 55 of monitored sites have increasing nitrate nitrogen and 25 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp levels larned et al 2004 ministry for the environment and statistics new zealand 2015 thirty two percent of monitored lakes are now classed as polluted with nutrients as are 84 of lakes in pastoral catchments verburg et al 2010 groundwater ecosystems are less well monitored but at 50 out of 70 surveillance bores between 2012 and 2014 escherichia coli levels exceeded human drinking standards ministry for the environment and stats nz 2017 the relationship between the prevalence of waterborne pathogens catchment characteristics hydrology and land use management strategies have been well studied e g smith et al 2001 swaffer et al 2018 usepa 2009 wilkes et al 2009 wilkes et al 2011 many have found particular types of land management such as urban or agricultural land use often lead to an increase in pathogens in waterways draining those catchments swaffer et al 2018 usepa 2009 wilkes et al 2013 catchment and hydrological characteristics such as slope water velocity temperature and high flow events can also contribute to higher densities of pathogens in draining waterways smith et al 2001 swaffer et al 2018 wilkes et al 2009 wilkes et al 2011 frequently the subset of potential determinates of pathogen prevalence investigated have been limited to a range of either land use or hydrological variables and we are not aware of any studies that have considered water quality of the receiving waterbody as a potential driver furthermore assessment is often conducted with linear analytic techniques but see wilkes et al 2011 in this study we have measured the abundance and or presence of three pathogens campylobacter spp cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp and e coli in 16 waterbodies throughout new zealand that provide the raw water for public drinking supplies sampled between 2009 and 2019 they represent a range of waterways from small to large free flowing to reservoir impoundments draining catchments of entirely native vegetation to those dominated by pastoral agriculture we then used a powerful machine learning technique boosted regression tree brt analysis to investigate which of a range of land use catchment geology vegetation topography and water quality variables were most strongly linked with the abundance and or presence of each microbe and thresholds where that abundance and or presence may rapidly change brts are a modification of classification and regression tree analysis that combines the strengths of regression tree algorithms and boosting combining many simple models to yield models with improved predictive performance de ath and fabricius 2000 elith et al 2008 norberg et al 2019 there are a wide range of powerful machine learning techniques available now that can be used for both describing and predicting from larger datasets cheng et al 2018 crisci et al 2012 death 2015 they have the advantage that they do not require data linearity or any particular statistical properties in the data can often accommodate missing data and can account for the multilevel interactions that often occur in environmental data the objective of our analysis was to investigate which characteristics and thresholds of those drivers of the water source effect the microbial quality of the raw water intended for treatment and subsequent public consumption given the prevalence of disease outbreaks from purportedly treated drinking water in developed countries around the globe identifying these characteristics may help restrict pathogen abundance in raw drinking water and thus the risk of faulty treatment procedures endangering people s health 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the raw water sources of 16 public drinking supplies were sampled throughout new zealand between 2009 and 2019 fig 1 study sites were selected to represent different catchment types supplying drinking water to the public in new zealand however given the non random selection of sites the results of this study should not be assumed to represent the pathogen levels in new zealand waterways in general the study waterbodies supplied raw water to distribution networks receiving water from one or more sources in a simple standard drinking water distribution network water is abstracted at a source treated at a treatment plant and distributed to the public through a distribution system however for large communities it is common for a network to have multiple sources and treatment plants supplying water to multiple interconnected zones within a distribution system this was the case for the auckland wellington and tauranga plants 2 2 sample collection the study sites were monitored for four microbes campylobacter sp e coli cryptosporidium and giardia from september 2009 to june 2016 or january 2019 depending on the site in order to determine the quality of the raw drinking water table 1 samples were collected from the abstraction point intake at each study site every three months three water samples were collected 100 ml for campylobacter isolation 100 ml for e coli enumeration and 100 l filtered through a filta max filter idexx laboratories inc maine usa for the enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts after filtration the filta max filter module was removed from the filter housing and placed in a transportation bag all samples were stored on ice after sampling and transported to the laboratory within 24 h 2 3 laboratory procedures campylobacter and e coli for campylobacter isolation 2 100 ml of water were filtered through 0 45 μ m pore 47 mm diameter disks millipore corporation massachusetts usa on arrival at the laboratory immediately campylobacter enrichment was conducted by incubating one of the filter disks in bolton s broth under microaerophilic conditions 85 n2 5 o2 0 h2 and 10 co2 at 42 c for 48 h using a macs va500 microaerophilic workstation don whitley scientific limited yorkshire uk the broth was then cultured onto selective medium modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar mccda for a further 48 h the second filter disk was then placed into cefoperazone amphotericin teicoplanin cat broth and incubated in a hydrogen enriched microaerobic 82 nitrogen 3 oxygen 10 carbon dioxide 5 hydrogen whitley va500 workstation incubator don whitley shipley england for 48 hours at 37 c a sample of this was then cultured on cat agar fort richard laboratories auckland plates and grown for a further 48 hours under the same conditions from every mccda and cat plate with morphology typical of campylobacter were selected and grown on blood agar fort richard laboratories auckland and incubated in the microaerophilic workstation for 48 h a presumptive campylobacter positive result was declared if the blood agar growth exhibited typical campylobacter phenotypic characteristics a confirmatory positive result was obtained after subjecting the isolates to campylobacter genus stucki et al 1995 and species specific e g c jejuni and c coli polymerase chain reaction pcr s until 2018 then subsequently by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof mass spectrometry ms 100ml grab samples for e coli enumeration were submitted to accredited regional laboratories and processed within 24 hours using standard procedures reported as mpn 100 ml 2 4 laboratory procedures cryptosporidium and giardia screening for cryptosporidium and giardia was based on the united states environmental protection agency usepa method 1623 united states environmental protection agency 2012 in summary the filter module was removed from the transportation bag and dismantled to recover foam disks along with residual fluid and placed in a stomacher 3500 bag seward ltd west sussex uk containing 500 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs the mixture was homogenized using a stomacher 3500 seward ltd west sussex uk for 10 min the eluent was then transferred into a 500 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 min at 10 c using a sorvall rt7 benchtop centrifuge gmi inc minnesota usa the top 450 ml supernatant was aspirated and discarded the remaining fluid was vortexed to resuspend the formed pellet at the bottom of the tube and then transferred into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged as before the supernatant was aspirated as before leaving 10 ml in which the pellet was resuspended immunomagnetic separation ims using a dynabeads gc combo kit invitrogen corporation california usa was applied to the mixture the resultant 50 μ l fluid was transferred onto a fluorescence microscopy slide with reaction wells marienfeld gmbh co kg lauda königshofen germany and placed in a humidity chamber then 50 μ l of diluted aqua glo stain waterborne inc new orleans usa was added to the slide and incubated at 37 c for 30 60 min the stain was washed off using 50 μ l pbs and the slide was air dried for 2 min a bx 60 fluorescence microscope olympus tokyo japan was used to scan the slide for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts characteristic features as described in usepa method 1623 were used to identify the oo cysts and enumeration was performed following the method described by united states environmental protection agency 1995 2 5 waterbody characteristic data catchment attributes for the study locations are presented in table 1 populations supplied by each source was extracted from the 2011 register of community drinking water supplies in new zealand rainfall runoff excess precipitation less evaporation and deficit soil moisture deficit where full is 0 mm and empty is 150 mm data were obtained from weather stations located nearest to a particular study site via free downloads from the cliflo website http cliflo niwa co nz maintained by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa catchment environmental data from several publicly available gis resources on nutrients flow regime catchment geology vegetation topography temperature shading and macroinvertebrate communities i e macroinvertebrate community index mci for each sample location were included in the analysis as potential predictor variables of pathogen abundance modelled nutrient mci and e coli were sourced from unwin and larned 2013 flow data from booker and woods 2014 catchment geology topography and temperature from the freshwater ecosystems of new zealand fenz database leathwick et al 2010 domestic animal data were extracted from agribase 2016 shapefile purchased from asurequality new zealand limited a commercial company owned by the government of new zealand not surprisingly many of these variables were highly correlated so the data set was reduced to 47 potential predictors supplementary appendix 1 by removal of variables with a correlation greater than r 0 85 the variable with the strongest correlations with microbe abundance was retained 2 6 data analysis all data analysis was conducted in r 3 6 1 r core team 2018 correlation of pathogen abundance was performed using pearson s correlation coefficient because of the large number of zeros huson 2007 site and season differences in abundance or presence absence were evaluated with a generalized linear model glm using either poisson binomial or negative binomial theta 0 5 error distributions to minimize over dispersion relationships between the frequency of each pathogen at a site for e coli this was at 200 mpn 100 ml and potential environmental determinants identified in the boosted regression tree analysis were examined using the glm function in r using binomial errors or nls for non linear relationships analysis of variance anova was used to compare models with the most parsimonious model used if additional parameters transformations or increased model complexity did not achieve any significant improvement 2 7 boosted regression tree boosted regression trees brts are a powerful modification of classification and regression tree analysis that is now widely used de ath and fabricius 2000 elith et al 2008 the method combines the strengths of two algorithms regression trees models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits and boosting an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance trees are added and assessed sequentially until the holdout deviance is minimised which reduces the probability of overfitting the relative influence of each factor is calculated following friedman and meulman 2003 and is the average number of times a variable is selected for a split weighted by the squared improvement to the model at each split then scaled to ensure all variable importance scores add to 100 elith et al 2008 friedman and meulman 2003 one disadvantage of the approach is that models are complex and cannot be represented by a single decision tree which might allow a researcher to explain the model relationships to a potential end user however the advantage of the technique is it can provide robust models of predictor and response variable relationships from a limited dataset and allow extrapolation from that model to new data scenarios norberg et al 2019 we used the gbm package ridgeway 2013 in r version 3 6 1 r project for statistical computing vienna austria to fit the brts we used the gaussian family of relationships for count data and the bernoulli family for frequency data a tree complexity of 5 except for rain adjusted e coli which used a complexity of 20 learning rate of 0 001 and bag fraction of 0 5 and cross validation cv on 10 of the data 3 results 3 1 site catchment characteristics between 27 and 37 rounds of sampling were conducted at each site between september 2009 and january 2019 table 1 supplementary appendix 2 during this period a total of 512 samples were collected for each study microbe waterways supplying drinking water ranged from small streams to large rivers with some waterbodies lake like impoundments on streams or rivers the population supplied by a single water source ranged from 1 300 to 921 008 based on the 2011 register of community drinking water supplies in new zealand estimates the percentage of the catchment in agriculture ranged from 0 to 72 and total ruminant density ranged from 0 to 2 2 million for the lower reaches of the waikato river table 1 3 2 microbes all of the microbes are positively correlated but only cryptosporidium and giardia are strongly correlated table 2 the two sites on the waikato river oroua river and waiorohi stream had all four pathogens present for e coli this was 200 mpn 100 ml in at least one sample through the study while the hutt river and big huia creek had none recorded table 1 four surface water sources oroua river waiorohi stream and the two waikato river sites had samples positive for both cryptosporidium and giardia with the two waikato river sites having the highest percentage of protozoa positive samples table 1 cryptosporidium oocysts were highest in the two waikato sites and oroua river fig 2 table 3 cryptosporidium oocysts peaked in abundance in september at all sites where they occurred table 3 giardia cysts were also highest in the two waikato sites and oroua river fig 2 table 3 giardia cysts peaked in abundance in september and december table 3 among the 512 samples tested for campylobacter 100 20 were positive the surface water sources with the highest number of campylobacter positive samples included the waiorohi stream in tauranga waikato river in hamilton and the oroua river in feilding fig 2 table 3 december march and may had the highest number of positive samples table 3 for e coli 419 out of 500 82 samples had a concentration 1 mpn 100 ml but only 48 of the 512 samples 9 had concentrations 200 mpn 100 ml the waiorohi stream oroua river and waikato river at tuakau had the highest occurrence of e coli abundance 200 mpn 100 ml rainfall was the strongest determinant of in stream e coli levels higher rainfall on the date of collection increased the number of e coli adjusting for rainfall i e total e coli rainfall resulted in may june and july having the lowest proportional abundance of e coli in samples table 3 3 3 boosted regression tree analysis the brt models for all of the microbes had cross validated correlations of between 0 47 and 0 74 with the two protozoa having slightly better model fits table 4 interestingly dichotomous models for microbial presence absence were not markedly better but did have a slightly different order to the importance of key predictor variables table 4 fig 3 the top five predictor variables for each microbe are listed in table 4 and the percentage of each brt explained by the top 20 variables plotted in fig 3 the strongest predictors of the protozoan abundance and or prevalence were the number of ruminants in the catchment 800 000 e coli concentration adjusted for rainfall 150 200 mpn 100 ml mci 90 drp dissolved reactive phosphorus 0 015 mg l time of year spring catchment size and rainfall deficit high e coli and high drp and low mci that are associated with greater abundance or prevalence of protozoa indicate generally lower water quality potentially linked with a greater number of ruminants in the catchment the two bacterial species were better predicted by rainfall soil deficit saturated soils increased bacterial abundance in waterways percentage of upstream agriculture 35 instream nitrate concentration 0 24 mg l and human population size 3 4 regression analysis the number of ruminants in the catchment and mci an invertebrate measure of water quality were key environmental predictors identified in the brt analysis fig 4 illustrates that for both protozoa as the number of ruminants increase the frequency of positive samples also increases as a power function for cryptosporidium y 26 24 1 e 0 0000025rumin density r2 0 94 and for giardia y 33 0 1 e 0 0000028rumin density r2 0 89 interestingly the one site with high numbers of ruminants upstream but low frequency of positive samples is the only impoundment site in an agriculturally dominated landscape the frequency of positive bacterial samples was not clearly related to catchment ruminant density fig 4b the link between the number of positive samples and mci also differed between protozoa and bacteria fig 5 relationships were neither linear logarithmic or power functions but protozoan prevalence seemed to drop off markedly at an mci of 90 and bacterial prevalence at an mci of 120 protozoan prevalence also drops considerably at sites with a median e coli density of less than 50 mpn 100 ml fig 6 4 discussion there are marked differences in the prevalence and abundance of all four microbes identified in the water samples collected in the 16 streams rivers and impoundments where raw drinking water is abstracted sites on the waikato river oroua river and waiorohi stream that have catchments dominated by agriculture and large numbers of ruminates had the most positive samples for all four microbes while the hutt river and big huia creek located in catchments dominated by native vegetation had no recorded pathogens and very low levels of e coli this provides strong evidence that management of the catchment of a water source will impact the abundance and prevalence of waterborne pathogens as species of both giardia and cryptosporidium are typically gut parasites of ruminates it is not surprising that their prevalence increases in waterways surrounded by a greater number of ruminates a potential threshold at greater than 500 000 ruminates per catchment occurs when protozoan abundance appears to peak many of these sites also had low water quality which numerous studies have linked to agricultural intensification foote et al 2015 julian et al 2017 larned et al 2018 mcdowell et al 2017 snelder et al 2018 it is not possible from our study to determine whether reduced water quality promotes the survival of these protozoa outside the host or whether ruminant density is the main driver of protozoa abundance and low water quality was simply correlated with that several studies including in new zealand have found cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis is more prevalent in people that have greater exposure to cattle jagai et al 2010 lal et al 2016 snel et al 2009a snel et al 2009b snel et al 2009c animal waste from dairy shed effluent will often contain several pathogens including giardia and cryptosporidium mawdsley et al 1995 mcleod et al 2008 and these pathogens can survive for extended periods in the soil before being washed into nearby waterways mawdsley et al 1995 ross and donnison 2003 ehsan et al 2015 ruecker et al 2007 and swaffer et al 2018 also found giardia sp and cryptosporidium sp more common in waterways draining agriculture in belgium canada and australia although this relationship is dependent on the particular species of giardia and or cryptosporidium present for example species of cryptosporidium associated with wildlife which pose limited risk to humans are more prevalent in waterways draining native vegetation whereas c andersoni ruecker et al 2007 ryan and power 2012 and c parvum swaffer et al 2018 which are common in cattle and do pose a human health risk can be more prevalent in agricultural catchments robinson et al 2011 wells et al 2015 we were not able to speciate the giardia and cryptosporidium in our survey and thus are not able to determine their potential human health risk in contrast the prevalence of the two bacteria were linked more directly with rainfall soil moisture and catchment vegetation in the modelling than agricultural intensity per se saturated soils in catchments with a high percentage of pasture and high rainfall resulted in the greatest prevalence of campylobacter and abundance of e coli in waterways barriers to passage of the bacteria from the point of origin such as animal feaces to the waterway may therefore be more critical than for the protozoa and are thus affected more by the surrounding soil and vegetation properties close et al 2010 muirhead et al 2006 as with the protozoa numerous studies have found a link between high levels of e coli or the presence of campylobacter in waterways and more intensive agricultural land use close et al 2010 quilliam et al 2011 a major source of e coli in agricultural catchments is often livestock although direct defecation in waterways is now prevented in much of new zealand by stock exclusion fencing collins 2004 collins et al 2007 collins and rutherford 2004 jamieson et al 2004 microbes move from land to waterways through both surface and subsurface transportation khaleel et al 1981 reddy et al 1981 in saturated soil environments there is decreased interaction time with soil particles leading to diminished pathogen removal chandler et al 1981 however waterways are also reservoirs and or sources of bacteria in their own right and our study does not allow us to differentiate whether the collected bacteria arise from upstream or the adjoining land wilkes et al 2019 modeling of national data collected by environment agencies throughout new zealand has shown median e coli concentrations between 2013 and 2017 are 15 times higher in catchments dominated by pasture than those in native vegetation ministry for the environment and stats nz 2019 that soil and catchment vegetation characteristics were more important than stock numbers in predicting water bacterial concentrations suggests there may be more opportunity for restricting bacterial inputs into waterways by management of riparian vegetation numerous studies have shown the utility of riparian vegetation along stream banks to limit bacterial contamination of waterways feld et al 2018 parkyn et al 2003 stutter et al 2012 furthermore the waterborne disease outbreaks of campylobacter and e coli in new zealand and walkerton canada were linked to raw drinking water contaminated by livestock prior to inadequate treatment bartholomew et al 2014 gilpin et al in review hrudey 2017 hrudey and hrudey 2019 although e coli remains the standard method in the tool kit for assessing potential pathogen risk in waterways wu et al 2011 our survey highlights the potential for other water quality measures such as nutrient levels and macroinvertebrate community health to also indicate thresholds of increased risk particularly for protozoa thresholds commonly used for ecological health in new zealand of the mci at 90 and 120 also appear to be thresholds of change in protozoan pathogen numbers as the mci is routinely measured by environment agencies and less variable in time this potential relationship clearly warrants further investigation this relationship may also have potential for use in other countries where waterway pathogen monitoring may not be routine or too expensive monitoring of ecological health using macroinvertebrates is relatively inexpensive and widespread globally if macroinvertebrate community health is linked with microbial pathogen prevalence perhaps it could offer a cheaper alternative to direct pathogen assessments our study also provides some evidence that currently applied thresholds for e coli to restrict prevalence of other pathogens in waterway recreational activities may be set too high ministry for the environment 2017 the prevalence of both protozoan taxa was much higher at sites where the median e coli was greater than 50 mpn 100 ml the current national policy statement for freshwater management in new zealand have medians of 130 and 260 cfu e coli 100 ml to provide protection from these and other waterborne pathogens ministry for the environment 2017 although it is unclear at what levels of waterway protozoan abundance human health may be compromised our work does suggest there may be significant numbers of the pathogens in waterways with e coli well below 130 or 260 cfu 100 ml the three microbes cryptosporidium giardia and campylobacter are among the leading causes of gastrointestinal disease and seem to be on the rise in many countries baker et al 2012 institute of environmental science and research 2018 murphy et al 2016 many will assume that modern water treatment techniques and tight regulations for drinking water supplies makes concerns about raw water and the characteristics of the surrounding catchments irrelevant however the many cases of drinking water contamination even with these constraints highlight that we cannot always rely on technology to protect our health ercumen et al 2014 ligon and bartram 2016 vinas et al 2019 advocate for a multiple barrier approach to managing drinking water including prevention of potential pathogens in raw source water the modelling has identified some key catchment management variables that can impact the prevalence of these three pathogens in raw source water furthermore cryptosporidium in particular is notorious for its resistance to conventional water treatment and chlorine disinfection efstratiou et al 2017 swaffer et al 2018 as many waterways become increasingly degraded and the prevalence of human pathogens in those supplying drinking water increases we need to be increasingly vigilant of managing both the catchment of the water supply and the water supply itself in this study we have highlighted some of the key environmental indicators that can alert drinking supply managers to potential increased risks in their water supply 5 conclusion some of the 16 rivers and streams that supply raw drinking water to a number of new zealand towns and cities had significantly greater numbers and or prevalence of four microbes campylobacter spp escherichia coli cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp that are potential human pathogens modeling with machine learning techniques identified that the two species of protozoa were more prevalent in waterways with lower water quality and higher numbers of ruminants in the catchment whereas the two bacteria were more abundant at sites or times with higher rainfall waterlogged soils and catchments with greater than 35 of the land in agriculture although modern water treatment eliminates much of the potential risk from these contaminated waterways the recent outbreaks of drinking water contamination highlight that water managers also need to consider management of the water supply catchment to ensure safe drinking water our study highlights that an effective way to limit pathogens in raw source water is to manage catchment landuse protected watersheds of predominantly native vegetation is certainly a strategy used effectively in australia new zealand and the usa while current landuse may preclude such comprehensive approaches it could still be possible to limit agricultural intensity and or utilise riparian vegetation buffers to help reduce the prevalence of pathogens in many waterways declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of

17621,under climate warming and coastal eutrophication outbreaks of green tides have increased in recent decades e g the world s largest green tide caused by ulva prolifera has occurred in the yellow sea for 13 consecutive years the massive assemblage of macroalgae absorbs large amounts of atmospheric co2 and converts it into biomass after the green tide millions of tons of the macroalgal biomass sink to the seabed to be degraded eventually this inevitably has a significant impact on the coastal organic carbon pool and microbial community however this impact is poorly understood here the degradation of ulva prolifera over 520 days revealed that relatively sufficient degradation of the macroalgae occurred at ca 7 months the rapid release of dissolved organic carbon doc mainly occurred in the first week which not only increased the size and diversity of the doc pool in a short time but also promoted the rapid growth of bacteria and led to hypoxia and acidification of the seawater after that the labile portion of doc was gradually used up by bacteria within one month while the degradation of semi labile or semi refractory doc occurred in half a year the remaining doc existed in the form of refractory doc rdoc resisting bacterial consumption and remaining stable for 10 months during the long term degradation process bacterial community structure and metabolic function showed obvious successional characteristics driving the gradual transformation of doc from labile to refractory through the microbial carbon pump mechanism after the long term degradation the remaining rdoc accounted for approximately 1 6 of the macroalgal carbon biomass as rdoc can maintain long term stability we propose that the frequent outbreaks of green tides not only affect microbial processes but also may have an important cumulative effect on the coastal rdoc pool graphical abstract after the world s largest green tide occurs every year in the yellow sea millions of tons of the macroalga u prolifera sink to the seabed and are eventually degraded the degradation of u prolifera is a long term process over 520 days the concentration and composition of doc changed dynamically concurrently bacterial community structure and the potential metabolic functions of the community showed significant succession at different stages driven by the microbial carbon pump doc was transformed gradually from labile to refractory the remaining refractory doc accounted for ca 1 6 of the biomass carbon of u prolifera added originally and maintained long term stability we propose that the frequent outbreak of green tides may have a cumulative effect on the refractory doc pool in the coastal ocean image graphical abstract keywords green tide ulva prolifera macroalgal degradation bacterial community dissolved organic carbon doc refractory doc 1 introduction the world s largest green tide caused by the macroalga ulva prolifera has occurred successively for 13 years since 2007 in the yellow sea china with the distribution and coverage areas reaching up to 57 384 km2 and 2906 km2 respectively cao et al 2019 after the green tides millions of tons of the macroalgal biomass sink to the bottom of the sea the input of this excessive amount of fresh algal biomass places great pressure on the coastal environment the decomposition of macroalgae accompanied by strong microbial respiration could soon cause coastal hypoxia and acidification zhang et al 2019 meanwhile the release of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from decaying macroalgae could cause eutrophication over a period of time wang et al 2012 zhang and wang 2017 however complete degradation of macroalgae usually takes a long time even a few years lavery et al 2013 this means that there will be a long term interaction between the sunken macroalgae and the microbial decomposer communities their long term interaction will have a long lasting influence on coastal microbial processes and biogeochemical cycles bacteria are the most abundant decomposers in the ocean and they can break down dead organic materials and transform them into dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients grossart et al 2006 these nutrients can further support the growth of phytoplankton and microbial communities the processing of organic matter by bacteria influences food web structure drives marine biogeochemical cycles and even plays roles in climate change hansell et al 2012 hill et al 2015 for example the ocean acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing a large amount of atmospheric co2 a large fraction of the absorbed co2 is transformed into algal biomass when algae die the algal biomass can be partially converted by bacteria into refractory dissolved organic carbon rdoc zhao et al 2017 the rdoc has the potential to be stored in the ocean s interior for millennia and thereby avoid being released as atmospheric co2 jiao et al 2010 the dissolved organic carbon doc released early from dead algae is usually labile doc ldoc zheng et al 2019 microbial uptake of the ldoc can leave behind the refractory part of the doc which can make the doc pool refractory rich in the process meanwhile according to the microbial carbon pump mcp theory an estimated 5 7 of the microbially produced doc are recalcitrant and can be stably stored in the oceans ogawa et al 2001 jiao et al 2014 in the ocean bacteria have extremely high diversity and various functions they usually differ greatly in biodegradability organic nutrition preference and life strategies r or k strategies teeling et al 2012 the long term decomposition of algal biomass is actually a process under actions of various bacterial communities that determines the release and transformation of doc in turn the variation in doc composition during different decomposition stages can affect the dynamics of bacterial communities in addition to physical and chemical factors the long term interactions between algae and bacterial communities in seawater will determine the legacy of algal biomass and influence ocean biogeochemistry due to complex uncontrollable factors an in situ study on the dynamics of doc and bacterial communities in coastal oceans during the long term degradation of macroalgae is hard to perform therefore algae degradation experiments have mostly been carried out under laboratory conditions despite the reality that the laboratory degradation process is different from that in the ocean so far most degradation experiments have been performed over a short time from weeks to months castaldelli et al 2003 zhang and wang 2017 indeed as mentioned above the complete degradation of algal biomass usually takes months to years but very little is currently known about this long term process and its impact in recent decades algal bloom outbreaks have been increasing in coastal ecosystems smetacek and zingone 2013 after the blooms the enormous amount of macroalgal biomass is one of the important doc sources in coastal regions ortega et al 2019 a twenty day period of microbial degradation of the green tide macroalga u prolifera was recently studied in the laboratory revealing the rapid release of a large proportion of dissolved organic matter dom ca 43 of the c and 63 of the n during the short term degradation process bacteria played important roles in regulating the chemical composition of dom zhang and wang 2017 however it is unclear which bacterial communities are mainly involved in the degradation process in addition the degradation of u prolifera in 20 days is far from complete we do not know what carbon legacy these macroalgae will leave behind if the time is extended to ensure sufficient degradation addressing these questions will help unveil the potential long term impact of large scale green tides on microbial processes and marine carbon pools we speculate that the macroalgae and bacterial communities will undergo a series of dynamic changes in the long term interaction process and eventually a part of the macroalgae derived carbon will be converted into rdoc by bacteria to be permanently stored in the ocean 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and pretreatment surface seawater and fresh fronds of the macroalga u prolifera were collected at the late stage of a green tide along the coast of qingdao a major city on the western coast of the yellow sea 120 25 e 35 96 n china in 2016 once the samples were transported to the laboratory seawater was immediately prefiltered through 20 μm bolting silk and subsequently filtered through a 0 8 μm pore polycarbonate filter 47 mm diameter millipore germany to exclude the interference of picophytoplankton protozoa and larger non living particulates to the macroalgal degradation system rochelle newall et al 2004 kragh et al 2008 tessarolli et al 2018 meanwhile u prolifera fronds were rinsed several times by autoclave sterilized seawater 120 c 20 min to remove any sediment particles attached to the surface of the algae zhang and wang 2017 2 2 experimental design at room temperature of 20 25 c and under dark conditions 180 0 2 g fresh weight of the macroalga u prolifera and 18 l of the filtered seawater containing bacterial communities were mixed in an acid cleaned high density polyethylene carboy to conduct a long term 520 days degradation experiment as a treatment group the purpose of setting this concentration of algal biomass i e 10 g l 1 fresh weight is to simulate the real situation as best as possible and the purpose of the use of dark incubation condition is to prevent the possible growth of picophytoplankton that may be present in the filtered seawater and interfere with the experiment simultaneously the long term degradation of the filtered seawater without u prolifera was set as the control group both the two groups had three replicates and all carboys were covered loosely to control contact with the atmosphere by collecting water samples at different time points during the 520 day degradation process the dynamic changes in planktonic bacterial community structure in seawater as well as the concentration and composition of doc were analyzed the samples for analyzing the concentration and composition using the fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom component as a proxy of doc and bacterial abundance were collected on days 0 5 2 4 8 11 20 30 33 36 39 43 47 51 57 61 68 74 81 113 224 251 284 315 348 and 520 meanwhile the samples for analyzing the molecular fingerprint of doc were collected on the 8th and 520th days t0 and t8 in the treatment groups and the initial day c0 and 520th day c520 in the control groups moreover the samples for analyzing the bacterial community structure were collected on days 0 5 2 4 11 20 30 68 113 224 251 and 520 during all samplings in the experiments the water samples were prefiltered through 3 μm pore sterile mesh to exclude u prolifera fronds the samples for doc analysis were then refiltered with 0 7 μm pore whatman glass fiber filters gf f pretreated by 450 c for 5 h and stored in 20 ml for later analysis of the doc concentration and fdom components and 500 ml for later analysis of the doc molecular fingerprint brown glass bottles additionally 1 8 ml of the samples was collected for measuring bacterial abundance ba moreover after prefiltration through 3 µm pore filters the bacterial communities in the 500 ml water samples for analyzing the community structure were collected using 0 2 µm polycarbonate membranes all glassware used in this study was acid cleaned rinsed with milli q water and precombusted at 450 c for 5 h 2 3 sample analysis concentrations of doc the doc concentrations were measured by a toc l analyzer with an asi v autosampler shimadzu toc l cph japan through high temperature catalytic oxidation htco benner and strom 1993 seawater doc standards including low carbon water 1 2 μm and deep seawater 41 44 μm produced in hansell s laboratory at the university of miami were analyzed to maintain data quality control dai et al 2012 the blank was deducted using milli q water analysis before every five samples and all samples including the blank were acidified to ph 2 by 6 m hcl until the analysis the average blanks associated with the doc measurement were approximately 5 μm and the analytic precision of the triplicate injections was 3 main components of fdom the main components of fdom were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy technique coupled with parallel factor parafac analysis li et al 2018 a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 4600 with a scanning speed of 1200 nm min was employed to measure the excitation emission matrix eem during the experiments a total of 126 eems spectra were obtained for parafac analysis matlab mathworks natick ma together with the dom fluor toolbox http www models life ku dk were employed for data analysis coble 1996 coble et al 1998 more details on the parafac eem analysis of fdom are described in the supplementary materials during the analysis of the main components of fdom the characteristic parameter of h p was employed to estimate the bioavailability of fdom h p is the ratio of the sum of the fluorescence intensities of humic like components to that of protein like components hence high values of h p denote the dominance of humic like components in the eem array and a high extent of humification kowalczuk et al 2013 molecular fingerprint of doc the molecular level changes in doc during degradation were analyzed by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms using a bruker apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer equipped with a 9 4 t superconducting magnet and apollo ii electrospray ionization source shi et al 2013 before the ft icr ms analysis doc was first solid phase extracted and then the extracted doc spe doc was eluted according to the method described in a previous study dittmar et al 2008 the methodologies for ft icr ms calibration data acquisition and processing have been described previously shi et al 2013 the data analyses were performed by using custom software the assigned formulas were limited to the following elemental composition 12c0 100 1h0 200 14n0 3 16o0 30

h c and o c value was restricted less than 3 and 1 5 respectively flerus et al 2012 more details on the ft icr ms technology are provided in the supplementary materials moreover during macroalgal degradation to estimate the refractory degree of doc released from u prolifera a modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated for all assigned formulas via ft icr ms schmidt et al 2011 the index was calculated according to the following equation 1 a i m o d 1 c 0 5 o s 0 5 h c 0 5 o s n where c h n o and s are the numbers of carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur atoms in a molecular formula respectively moreover the aimod value was selected to group all doc molecules into different species of compounds generally the aimod 0 66 is an unambiguous criterion for polycyclic aromatic structures and compounds having an 0 66 aimod 0 50 are aromatics with high aromaticity aimod 0 50 and h c 1 5 indicate highly unsaturated compounds aimod 0 5 2 0 h c 1 5 and n 0 nitrogen atom indicate nonnitrogenous unsaturated aliphatic compounds aimod 0 5 2 0 h c 1 5 and n 0 indicate nitrogenous unsaturated aliphatic compounds and aimod 0 5 and h c 2 0 indicate saturated fatty and sulfonic acids bacterial abundance ba samples for ba were preserved with a final concentration of 0 5 glutaraldehyde and stored at 80 c ba was measured using an accuri ii flow cytometer bd biosciences usa by

similarity threshold quast et al 2013 functional prediction of bacterial communities the functional profiles of bacterial communities were predicted using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 2 picrust 2 software we focused on the predicted abundances of kegg orthologs kos related to glycolysis sulfur glycan degradation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation metabolism douglas et al 2019 2 4 statistical analysis to test for changes in bacterial community composition during macroalgal degradation β diversity was calculated using bray curtis distances based on relative abundance matrices of otus nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were carried out based on the bray curtis distances analysis of similarity anosim was applied to test the differences in bacterial communities among groups clarke 1993 moreover significant differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa were determined using one way anova assumptions of homogeneity of variances and normality in the anovas were assessed by scatterplots of residuals and normality curves of residuals respectively holm sidak test and the significance level was p 0 05 for the tests 3 results 3 1 dynamic changes in doc concentration and bacterial abundance during long term macroalgal degradation the dynamic changes in doc concentration and bacterial abundance showed different characteristics among stages of the long term degradation process in the first week doc was released rapidly from the algal biomass resulting in a sharp increase in the doc concentration to the peak of 6244 μm fig 1 along with this process bacterial abundance also increased rapidly from 1 9 106 to 1 22 107 cells ml 1 here the first week was tentatively named the doc rising dr stage after that the doc concentration began to decline but the bacterial abundance still increased rapidly reaching the maximum i e 1 26 107 cells ml 1 at 3 days and then began to decline until the 224th day i e 7 5 months during degradation we temporarily named this period the doc decline dd stage which lasted ca 7 months in fact during the first 4 weeks of the dd stage the doc concentration decreased sharply from 6244 to 797 μm the bacterial abundance also decreased to 5 8 106 cells ml 1 this period was named the rapid doc decline r dd substage representing a rapid doc consumption phase after the r dd substage the declines in doc concentration and bacterial abundance became relatively slow until the end of the dd stage this period was called the slow doc decline s dd substage at the end of the s dd substage doc concentration and bacterial abundance decreased to 427 μm and 2 6 105 cells ml 1 respectively after that the doc concentration and bacterial abundance remained stable for 10 months until the end of degradation this long term stable period was called the doc stabilization ds stage by contrast in the control group no significant fluctuations in doc concentration or bacterial abundance were observed meanwhile the doc concentration and bacterial abundance in the control group were much lower than those in the treatment group at the end of degradation 3 2 dynamic changes in doc composition in different stages here we used two methods to track the changes in doc composition one method was to take fdom as a proxy of doc and analyze its dynamic changes the other was to use advanced ft icr ms technology to analyze the variation in doc molecular composition four distinct fdom components i e c1 c4 were identified in this study the ex em wavelengths of which were 275 320 nm 225 270 300 nm 240 315 390 nm and 270 355 460 nm respectively table s1 based on their ex em wavelengths c1 and c2 represented protein like fractions which were the amino acid tryptophan and tyrosine like components respectively c3 and c4 represented different humic like fluorophores during the degradation process the dynamic changes in fluorescence intensity of both protein like components exhibited two stages fig 2 during the first three weeks their fluorescence intensities increased rapidly to their maximum values then they began to decline until the end of long term degradation interestingly the change in the humic like components showed an opposite trend compared with that of the protein like components the two humic like components increased gradually throughout the whole degradation process their final fluorescence intensity increased over 5 fold by the end of degradation the h p index showed a substantial increase during the degradation process fig s1 in contrast the four fluorescence components i e c1 c4 in the control group exhibited no significant changes except for a slight increase in the initial stage of degradation ft icr ms analysis better revealed the changes in doc composition at a molecular level during different stages throughout the entire degradation process a total of 5136 different molecular formulas mfs covering a mass range of 200 670 da excluding 13c isotopologs were identified during the dr stage the normalized peak intensity of 2640 mfs increased obviously which was reflected by the comparison of the doc fingerprint at the 8th day with that at the beginning i e 0th day during the degradation process fig 3 a among them 1167 mf species were newly generated during the dr stage fig 4 a however in the subsequent dd and ds stages the normalized peak intensity of 2102 mfs clearly decreased as reflected by the differences in the doc molecular fingerprint at the 8th and 520th day during degradation fig 3b among them 1292 mf species disappeared meanwhile 508 mf species were newly generated during the long term degradation process fig 4a compared with that of the treatment group the doc composition in the control group also changed obviously after 520 days with the disappearance of 1000 mf species 713 mf species were newly generated during the long term degradation process fig 4b to further compare the doc composition changes during different stages the mfs were classified into four groups based on their broad elemental compositions i e cho chno chos and chnos containing mfs table 1 during the macroalgal degradation process the number of cho and chno containing mfs decreased gradually with final declines of 29 and 31 respectively however the changes in chos and chnos containing mfs showed an increasing trend with final increases of 114 and 197 respectively meanwhile in the control group the changes in cho chno chos and chnos containing mfs were relatively small 3 3 succession of bacterial community structure during macroalgal degradation in total 995 065 clean 16s rrna gene sequences and 2688 otus were obtained throughout macroalgal degradation these otus at a 3 dissimilarity threshold were classified into 43 phyla 87 classes 229 orders 405 families and 762 genera the addition of macroalgae significantly changed the dominant components of the bacterial community compared with those in the control group fig 5 except for the eleven bacterial classes existing in both the macroalgal degradation group and the control group i e flavobacteriia bacteroidia alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria planctomycetacia phycisphaerae actinobacteria anaerolineae and saprospiria the dominant bacterial classes in the two groups were quite different in the macroalgal degradation group they were spirochaetia clostridia melainabacteria and ignavibacteriae among others whereas in the control group they were acidimicrobiia rhodothermia thermoleophilia and dehalococcoidia among others at the otu classification level only 36 of the total otus were shared between the macroalgal degradation group and the control group fig s2 here it should be mentioned that the initial bacterial community employed to degrade macroalgae were filtered through the membrane with a pore size of 0 8 μm which would bring some deviation to the bacterial community as usually only about 80 of bacterial cells can pass through the similar pore size membrane giroldo et al 2007 wyatt et al 2014 furthermore hca and nmds analysis were employed to reveal the dynamic changes in bacterial community throughout the degradation process the bacterial communities at different sampling time points were clearly divided into three clusters fig 6 interestingly the three clusters corresponded exactly to the three stages of doc changes i e the dr dd and ds stages cluster i included all of the bacterial community profiles during the dr stage i e at the 0 5th 2nd and 4th days cluster ii contained all those during the dd stage i e at the 11th 20th 30th 68th and 113th days and cluster iii comprised the bacterial community profiles during the ds stage i e at the 224th 251st and 520th days cluster ii could be further separated into two subgroups the bacterial community profiles during the r dd i e at the 11th 20th and 30th days and s dd substages i e at the 68th and 113th days the bacterial community profiles in the three clusters showed significant differences p 0 05 one way analysis of similarity i e anosim table s2 indicating significant succession of the bacterial community during the long term degradation process meanwhile in the control group the bacterial communities showed quite different variation characteristics fig s3 and s4 at the beginning of the dr stage the addition of macroalgae led to the highest relative abundance of class flavobacteriia on the 0 5th day fig 5 flavobacteriaceae affiliated with class flavobacteriia was the most dominant bacterial family fig s3 meanwhile only one day later flavobacteriia declined rapidly but bacteroidia and clostridia increased and became the two most dominant bacterial classes the most dominant lineages during this period were also replaced by unclassified bacteroidales and prolixibacteraceae belonging to class bacteroidia after entering the r dd substage the relative abundance of class clostridia decreased gradually while spirochaetia grew into the second largest class after bacterodidia concurrently melainabacteria increased to be the third largest class at the family level spirochaetaceae of class spirochaetia and marinifilaceae of class bacteroidia increased significantly p 0 05 one way anova and successively became the dominant lineages during the s dd substage the relative abundance of bacteroidia declined meanwhile that of alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria deltaproteocteria planctomycetacia and melainabacteria increased obviously the dominant classes in the s dd stage became more balanced compared with that in the earlier stages of degradation at the family level burkholderiaceae belonging to class betaproteobacteria and planctomycetaceae belonging to class planctomycetacia emerged with a high relative abundance on the 68th and 113th days in the s dd stage respectively during the ds stage actinobacteria increased to be the third largest bacterial class after alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria and the dominant bacterial families ultimately became rhodospirillaceae and sphingomonadaceae both belonging to alphaproteobacteria and lysobacteraceae and salinisphaeraceae both belonging to gammaproteobacteria altogether throughout the whole process of macroalgal degradation bacterial community structure changed dramatically and showed significant successional characteristics fig s3 moreover the shared and unique otus during different stages fig s5 were identified only 72 otus were stable and existed commonly throughout the entire degradation process whereas 299 53 143 and 650 otus were observed only in the dr r dd s dd and ds stages respectively more unique otus were observed in the dr and ds stages 3 4 the potential metabolic functions of the bacterial community in different stages during macroalgal degradation we predicted 176 functional genes involved in glycolysis glycan degradation polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and sulfur metabolism based on bacterial community structure by using picrust 2 table s3 for simplicity only the representative genes were selected to reveal the metabolic changes fig s6 in the dr and r dd stages abundant genes were involved in glycan degradation such as the genes fuca k01206 lacz k01190 man2c1 k01191 and hexa b k12373 encoding fucosidase galactosidase mannosidase and hexosaminidase respectively meanwhile the gene ptsg k02779 encoding glucose permease had a higher abundance in the dr stage this indicates that the degradation of macromolecules such as glycan and the transport and utilization of monosaccharides are likely the main metabolic functions of the bacterial community during these stages monosaccharides as a type of doc with high bioavailability can promote the rapid growth of bacteria in addition there were abundant genes related to sulfur metabolism in the dr stage such as the asra b c k00385 k16950 and k16951 encoding anaerobic sulfite reductase for the production of sulfide however from the s dd stage to the end of degradation there were more genes encoding oxygenase dioxygenase dehydrogenase decarboxylase and reductase which are involved in the degradation of aromatic or polycyclic aromatic compounds 4 discussion over the past 13 years driven by a variety of factors especially disturbance caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change the world s largest green tide has occurred every year in the yellow sea after the green tide up to 2 million tons of the macroalga sinks into deep waters and sediment qu et al 2020 the degradation of such a large amount of macroalgal biomass will inevitably have serious ecological impacts on the coastal ocean but little is known about these impacts so far this study conducted a 520 day degradation experiment on the macroalga u prolifera to explore the potential long term impacts of green tides on the coastal doc pool and microbial processes we found that sufficient degradation of the algal biomass of u prolifera is a long term process that takes at least 7 months according to the dynamic changes in doc concentration the 520 day degradation process was clearly divided into three stages i e the doc rising dr stage 8 days doc decline dd stage 216 days and doc stabilization ds stage 296 days the dd stage could be further divided into the rapid and slow doc decline substages r dd and s dd fig 1 at different stages during the long term algal degradation u prolifera fronds changed significantly fig s7 at the beginning of dr stage u prolifera fronds were slender and green and floated in the seawater at the dd stage the fronds broke into small pieces and sank to the bottom at the ds stage no fronds could be directly observed by naked eyes and were all degraded into invisible particles in the seawater along with the physical changes of the decaying algal fronds doc has undergone drastic changes the doc concentration increased sharply and reached its maximum in only one week during the dr stage concurrently the bacterial abundance also increased rapidly this indicates that the release of doc from decaying macroalgae is very fast and that algae released doc is strongly favored by bacteria hansell et al 2012 during this stage the abundance of bacteria increased by almost one order of magnitude indicating that a considerable portion of the released doc was utilized and transformed into bacterial biomass ogawa et al 2001 after that the doc concentration began to decline entering the dd stage the decrease in doc concentration may be due to the slowdown in doc release from the macroalgae not keeping up with doc consumption by the abundant bacteria the rapid decline in doc lasted for four weeks during this period the doc concentration decreased by nearly 90 this showed that most of the doc released by the macroalgae was labile doc and very easily utilized by bacteria in the coastal environment of the southern yellow sea seawater quality usually deteriorates quickly within 1 2 weeks after green tides one important reason may be that while utilizing the rich labile doc released from decaying macroalgae the heterotrophic bacteria absorb a large amount of oxygen and release a large amount of co2 resulting in hypoxia and acidification of the seawater zhang et al 2019 in this study we did not measure co2 emission but based on the very low ph value the lowest value was 6 1 of seawater during degradation fig s8 it indicates that besides being converted into bacterial biomass a considerable part of the released doc should be emitted as co2 through microbial respiration after the r dd stage the rate of decline of the doc concentration became very slow suggesting that most of the labile doc had been consumed by bacteria the remaining doc in the s dd stage had a much lower bioavailability to bacteria and may have been semi labile or semi refractory doc notably after the bacteria reached their maximum abundance on the 11th day bacterial abundance decreased gradually in the next 7 months this may be because the concentration and bioavailability of doc were significantly reduced and could not continue to meet the needs for bacterial growth leading to the death of some bacteria thus the bacterial abundance decreased gradually especially during and after the s dd stage the remnants of dead bacteria i e necromass and bacterial secretions may make an important contribution to the doc pool in the subsequent ds stage although the doc concentration was significantly higher than that in the control group both the doc concentration and bacterial abundance maintained long term stability until the end of the degradation this suggests that the doc remaining after long term macroalgal degradation is extremely difficult for bacteria to use and represents the refractory doc rdoc and the bacterial community sustained very low metabolic activity the changes in doc composition should be a decisive reason for the transformation of doc from labile to refractory first fdom was employed as a proxy of doc to study the dynamic changes in doc composition in the early stage of degradation with the rapid release of doc the protein like fractions of fdom also increased rapidly reaching a peak within three weeks and then declined gradually in the long term to a very low level fig 2 protein like substances are usually considered an indicator of biolabile doc yang et al 2015 the nearly complete depletion of the protein like fraction indicated that the labile components of doc were nearly completely consumed by bacteria interestingly the humic like fraction of fdom gradually accumulated throughout the degradation process humic like organic matter is often considered as a potential tracer of rdoc lønborg et al 2013 the continuous accumulation of humic like components hints at why doc turned increasingly recalcitrant and resisted utilization by bacteria moreover the significant negative correlation pearson s correlation r values 0 76 0 46 p 0 01 between the protein like c1 and c2 and humic like c3 and c4 fractions table s4 and the substantial increase in the h p index fig s1 implied a transformation of doc from labile to refractory during the degradation process according to the conceptual framework of the microbial carbon pump mcp this transformation should be mainly driven by bacterial communities jiao et al 2018 indeed similar phenomena have been observed during microbial degradation of phytoplankton and demonstrated the existence of the mcp zheng et al 2019 in the ocean the rdoc constitutes the main component of the extremely large stable carbon pool which can sequester carbon over the long term and plays an important role in climate change zhang et al 2017 a previous study showed that rdoc can be produced by microbial degradation of particulate organic matter or directly from microbial cell materials such as necromass liang et al 2017a here we suggest that mcp may play an important role in the production of rdoc during the long term degradation of u prolifera to more clearly explain the variation in doc composition that determined the conversion of doc from labile to refractory the doc molecular fingerprints in the early and late stages of macroalgal degradation were characterized figs 3 and 4 compared with that in natural seawater the early degradation during the dr stage of macroalgae introduced a large number 1167 of new molecular formulas mfs this indicates that the large amount of macroalgal biomass left in the sea after green tides will soon significantly increase the molecular diversity of the doc pool in coastal water meanwhile after the long term degradation process a large number 1292 of mfs had disappeared and the cho and chno containing molecules decreased significantly these vanished mfs might represent a portion of the labile molecules that had been consumed by bacteria however many 508 new mfs were also generated we consider that these new mfs might mainly comprise bacterial secretions and necromass of dead bacteria they were likely the typical molecules of rdoc that maintained long term stability during the late stage of macroalgal degradation meanwhile we found that the chos and chnos containing molecules increased significantly in the late stage table 1 suggesting that diverse sulfocompounds were formed and became the molecular components of rdoc sulfur should mainly have originated from u prolifera as the cell wall of u prolifera contains sulfur rich ulvan and highly aliphatic lipids kendel et al 2015 in addition to provide an overview of the likely structures behind the identified mfs the modified aromaticity index aimod was employed to group the dom molecules into different classes koch and dittmar 2006 polycyclic aromatics 0 66 aimod and highly aromatic compounds 0 5 aimod 0 66 are usually regarded as refractory dom schmidt et al 2011 during the long term degradation process their percentages increased significantly from 3 6 to 7 3 fig s9 meanwhile the proportion of some highly unsaturated compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 and saturated fatty and sulfonic acids aimod 0 5 h c 2 which are usually considered as labile dom cai et al 2019 decreased dramatically these changes more strongly manifested the accumulation of rdoc during the long term degradation of macroalgae indeed the long term degradation of macroalgae is a process during which bacterial communities and algae derived carbon interact with each other the bacterial community was the driving force for the dynamic changes in doc composition and vice versa in response to the changes in doc distinct succession of bacterial community structure and the potential metabolic functions at different stages also occurred the bacterial communities at different sampling time points throughout the degradation process were clearly divided into three clusters corresponding exactly to the three stages of doc changes especially at the otu level only a very small proportion of bacteria were commonly present throughout the three stages fig s5 in the dr stage the addition of macroalgae also likely introduced some associated bacteria e g flavobacteriia usually inhabiting the phycosphere environment ramanan et al 2015 meanwhile other bacteria that usually have potential extracellular hydrolase activity increased collén et al 2011 for example bacteroidia and clostridia became the two most dominant bacterial classes with relative abundances rising from 1 5 to 27 7 and from 1 5 to 13 2 respectively their members can secrete highly active hydrolase which degrades a variety of macromolecules such as ulvan and cellulose lee et al 2014 wang et al 2015 joyce et al 2018 meanwhile based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathway analysis the bacterial communities in the dr stage were predicted to have the highest glycan degradation glucose transport and anaerobic sulfite reductase activities fig s6 these bacteria should greatly promote the conversion of algae derived carbon from particulate organic carbon poc to doc and the conversion of organic carbon from being large molecular doc to small molecular doc the released small molecular doc could be easily consumed by bacteria and promoted a rapid increase in bacterial abundance during this stage bacteroidia and clostridia are typical bacteria that prefer to grow in anaerobic environments zarkasi et al 2016 the predominance of these bacteria indicates that the released doc promoted a large degree of consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration transforming the stage into a hypoxic and acidification phase this also further explained why hypoxia and acidification usually occur soon after green tides in the yellow sea meanwhile the anaerobic conditions also promoted the growth of anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria such as desulfovibrionaceae and spirochaetaceae which are often observed after the massive green tides and are major players in marine sulfur biogeochemical cycling qu et al 2020 at the r dd stage bacterial consumption resulted in a decrease in doc concentration and bacterial abundance also began to decline after reaching its peak as mentioned above since the labile doc had been gradually used up by bacteria the remaining doc became increasingly recalcitrant meanwhile the remaining poc that had not been decomposed may also have become increasingly inert thus more diverse bacterial groups such as spirochaetia and melainabacteria which have a strong organic matter degradation ability köchling et al 2015 soo et al 2015 matured and became members of the dominant bacterial groups at the s dd stage the dominant groups in the bacterial community were more diverse and balanced their ability to degrade organic matter may also have become stronger which could be confirmed by the presence of more functional genes involved in the degradation of inert polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fig s9 at the ds stage the remaining doc concentration and bacterial abundance were very stable within 10 months many bacteria that can participate in the degradation of alkanes and aromatics such as members of the families sphingomonadaceae and salinisphaeraceae kertesz and kawasaki 2010 vetriani et al 2014 became members of the dominant groups the dominance of these bacteria is also a very clear indicator that the doc remaining after long term degradation of the macroalgae was highly recalcitrant it is worth mentioning that we did not analyze the biofilm bacterial community on the decaying u prolifera fronds which is a shortage of this study biofilm bacterial communities on the decaying fronds might be quite different from planktonic bacterial communities and also play important roles in the degradation of macroalgae finally a rough estimate was obtained based on the remaining rdoc concentration after long term degradation and the amount of macroalgal biomass carbon added initially in other words after the long term degradation process ca 1 6 0 02 of the algal biomass carbon was left in seawater in the form of rdoc rdoc is highly stable and can be stored and accumulated in seawater for millennia lechtenfeld et al 2014 lønborg et al 2018 we propose that the massive u prolifera green tide occurring annually in the yellow sea might have a significant long term cumulative effect on the rdoc pool in the ocean actually the degradation process in laboratory is quite different from that in the natural ocean environment due to the strong water exchange in coastal oceans the changes in dissolved oxygen ph and bacterial community are not as strong as those in the laboratory during long term degradation of macroalgae in addition the temperature change in different seasons in the ocean is more severe than in the laboratory the bottle effect and the above environmental factors will have a significant impact on the macroalgal degradation process making our experimental results have some deviation from the actual process in coastal oceans in addition many organisms in the ocean such as protozoa and invertebrates feed on and mineralize algal fronds graça 2001 sala and jürgens 2004 ribblett et al 2005 their feeding activities will also have an important impact on the degradation process of macroalgae the degradation process of macroalgae in the natural coastal environment is much more complicated than in the laboratory 5 conclusion the present study shows that the degradation of green tide algal biomass is a long term process that can have long lasting effects on marine microbial processes and carbon cycling during the long term degradation process the interactions between bacteria and macroalgae derived carbon resulted in dynamic changes in doc concentration and composition as well as significant succession of bacterial community structure and function the successive bacterial communities played an important role in driving the gradual transformation of doc from labile to refractory and ultimately determined the fate of the carbon biomass of the macroalga u prolifera it can be inferred from this laboratory study that although u prolifera green tides disappeared in late summer every year the long term degradation of massive sank macroalgae would not only have a significant impact on marine microbial processes but also make an important contribution to the growth of

17621,under climate warming and coastal eutrophication outbreaks of green tides have increased in recent decades e g the world s largest green tide caused by ulva prolifera has occurred in the yellow sea for 13 consecutive years the massive assemblage of macroalgae absorbs large amounts of atmospheric co2 and converts it into biomass after the green tide millions of tons of the macroalgal biomass sink to the seabed to be degraded eventually this inevitably has a significant impact on the coastal organic carbon pool and microbial community however this impact is poorly understood here the degradation of ulva prolifera over 520 days revealed that relatively sufficient degradation of the macroalgae occurred at ca 7 months the rapid release of dissolved organic carbon doc mainly occurred in the first week which not only increased the size and diversity of the doc pool in a short time but also promoted the rapid growth of bacteria and led to hypoxia and acidification of the seawater after that the labile portion of doc was gradually used up by bacteria within one month while the degradation of semi labile or semi refractory doc occurred in half a year the remaining doc existed in the form of refractory doc rdoc resisting bacterial consumption and remaining stable for 10 months during the long term degradation process bacterial community structure and metabolic function showed obvious successional characteristics driving the gradual transformation of doc from labile to refractory through the microbial carbon pump mechanism after the long term degradation the remaining rdoc accounted for approximately 1 6 of the macroalgal carbon biomass as rdoc can maintain long term stability we propose that the frequent outbreaks of green tides not only affect microbial processes but also may have an important cumulative effect on the coastal rdoc pool graphical abstract after the world s largest green tide occurs every year in the yellow sea millions of tons of the macroalga u prolifera sink to the seabed and are eventually degraded the degradation of u prolifera is a long term process over 520 days the concentration and composition of doc changed dynamically concurrently bacterial community structure and the potential metabolic functions of the community showed significant succession at different stages driven by the microbial carbon pump doc was transformed gradually from labile to refractory the remaining refractory doc accounted for ca 1 6 of the biomass carbon of u prolifera added originally and maintained long term stability we propose that the frequent outbreak of green tides may have a cumulative effect on the refractory doc pool in the coastal ocean image graphical abstract keywords green tide ulva prolifera macroalgal degradation bacterial community dissolved organic carbon doc refractory doc 1 introduction the world s largest green tide caused by the macroalga ulva prolifera has occurred successively for 13 years since 2007 in the yellow sea china with the distribution and coverage areas reaching up to 57 384 km2 and 2906 km2 respectively cao et al 2019 after the green tides millions of tons of the macroalgal biomass sink to the bottom of the sea the input of this excessive amount of fresh algal biomass places great pressure on the coastal environment the decomposition of macroalgae accompanied by strong microbial respiration could soon cause coastal hypoxia and acidification zhang et al 2019 meanwhile the release of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from decaying macroalgae could cause eutrophication over a period of time wang et al 2012 zhang and wang 2017 however complete degradation of macroalgae usually takes a long time even a few years lavery et al 2013 this means that there will be a long term interaction between the sunken macroalgae and the microbial decomposer communities their long term interaction will have a long lasting influence on coastal microbial processes and biogeochemical cycles bacteria are the most abundant decomposers in the ocean and they can break down dead organic materials and transform them into dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients grossart et al 2006 these nutrients can further support the growth of phytoplankton and microbial communities the processing of organic matter by bacteria influences food web structure drives marine biogeochemical cycles and even plays roles in climate change hansell et al 2012 hill et al 2015 for example the ocean acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing a large amount of atmospheric co2 a large fraction of the absorbed co2 is transformed into algal biomass when algae die the algal biomass can be partially converted by bacteria into refractory dissolved organic carbon rdoc zhao et al 2017 the rdoc has the potential to be stored in the ocean s interior for millennia and thereby avoid being released as atmospheric co2 jiao et al 2010 the dissolved organic carbon doc released early from dead algae is usually labile doc ldoc zheng et al 2019 microbial uptake of the ldoc can leave behind the refractory part of the doc which can make the doc pool refractory rich in the process meanwhile according to the microbial carbon pump mcp theory an estimated 5 7 of the microbially produced doc are recalcitrant and can be stably stored in the oceans ogawa et al 2001 jiao et al 2014 in the ocean bacteria have extremely high diversity and various functions they usually differ greatly in biodegradability organic nutrition preference and life strategies r or k strategies teeling et al 2012 the long term decomposition of algal biomass is actually a process under actions of various bacterial communities that determines the release and transformation of doc in turn the variation in doc composition during different decomposition stages can affect the dynamics of bacterial communities in addition to physical and chemical factors the long term interactions between algae and bacterial communities in seawater will determine the legacy of algal biomass and influence ocean biogeochemistry due to complex uncontrollable factors an in situ study on the dynamics of doc and bacterial communities in coastal oceans during the long term degradation of macroalgae is hard to perform therefore algae degradation experiments have mostly been carried out under laboratory conditions despite the reality that the laboratory degradation process is different from that in the ocean so far most degradation experiments have been performed over a short time from weeks to months castaldelli et al 2003 zhang and wang 2017 indeed as mentioned above the complete degradation of algal biomass usually takes months to years but very little is currently known about this long term process and its impact in recent decades algal bloom outbreaks have been increasing in coastal ecosystems smetacek and zingone 2013 after the blooms the enormous amount of macroalgal biomass is one of the important doc sources in coastal regions ortega et al 2019 a twenty day period of microbial degradation of the green tide macroalga u prolifera was recently studied in the laboratory revealing the rapid release of a large proportion of dissolved organic matter dom ca 43 of the c and 63 of the n during the short term degradation process bacteria played important roles in regulating the chemical composition of dom zhang and wang 2017 however it is unclear which bacterial communities are mainly involved in the degradation process in addition the degradation of u prolifera in 20 days is far from complete we do not know what carbon legacy these macroalgae will leave behind if the time is extended to ensure sufficient degradation addressing these questions will help unveil the potential long term impact of large scale green tides on microbial processes and marine carbon pools we speculate that the macroalgae and bacterial communities will undergo a series of dynamic changes in the long term interaction process and eventually a part of the macroalgae derived carbon will be converted into rdoc by bacteria to be permanently stored in the ocean 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and pretreatment surface seawater and fresh fronds of the macroalga u prolifera were collected at the late stage of a green tide along the coast of qingdao a major city on the western coast of the yellow sea 120 25 e 35 96 n china in 2016 once the samples were transported to the laboratory seawater was immediately prefiltered through 20 μm bolting silk and subsequently filtered through a 0 8 μm pore polycarbonate filter 47 mm diameter millipore germany to exclude the interference of picophytoplankton protozoa and larger non living particulates to the macroalgal degradation system rochelle newall et al 2004 kragh et al 2008 tessarolli et al 2018 meanwhile u prolifera fronds were rinsed several times by autoclave sterilized seawater 120 c 20 min to remove any sediment particles attached to the surface of the algae zhang and wang 2017 2 2 experimental design at room temperature of 20 25 c and under dark conditions 180 0 2 g fresh weight of the macroalga u prolifera and 18 l of the filtered seawater containing bacterial communities were mixed in an acid cleaned high density polyethylene carboy to conduct a long term 520 days degradation experiment as a treatment group the purpose of setting this concentration of algal biomass i e 10 g l 1 fresh weight is to simulate the real situation as best as possible and the purpose of the use of dark incubation condition is to prevent the possible growth of picophytoplankton that may be present in the filtered seawater and interfere with the experiment simultaneously the long term degradation of the filtered seawater without u prolifera was set as the control group both the two groups had three replicates and all carboys were covered loosely to control contact with the atmosphere by collecting water samples at different time points during the 520 day degradation process the dynamic changes in planktonic bacterial community structure in seawater as well as the concentration and composition of doc were analyzed the samples for analyzing the concentration and composition using the fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom component as a proxy of doc and bacterial abundance were collected on days 0 5 2 4 8 11 20 30 33 36 39 43 47 51 57 61 68 74 81 113 224 251 284 315 348 and 520 meanwhile the samples for analyzing the molecular fingerprint of doc were collected on the 8th and 520th days t0 and t8 in the treatment groups and the initial day c0 and 520th day c520 in the control groups moreover the samples for analyzing the bacterial community structure were collected on days 0 5 2 4 11 20 30 68 113 224 251 and 520 during all samplings in the experiments the water samples were prefiltered through 3 μm pore sterile mesh to exclude u prolifera fronds the samples for doc analysis were then refiltered with 0 7 μm pore whatman glass fiber filters gf f pretreated by 450 c for 5 h and stored in 20 ml for later analysis of the doc concentration and fdom components and 500 ml for later analysis of the doc molecular fingerprint brown glass bottles additionally 1 8 ml of the samples was collected for measuring bacterial abundance ba moreover after prefiltration through 3 µm pore filters the bacterial communities in the 500 ml water samples for analyzing the community structure were collected using 0 2 µm polycarbonate membranes all glassware used in this study was acid cleaned rinsed with milli q water and precombusted at 450 c for 5 h 2 3 sample analysis concentrations of doc the doc concentrations were measured by a toc l analyzer with an asi v autosampler shimadzu toc l cph japan through high temperature catalytic oxidation htco benner and strom 1993 seawater doc standards including low carbon water 1 2 μm and deep seawater 41 44 μm produced in hansell s laboratory at the university of miami were analyzed to maintain data quality control dai et al 2012 the blank was deducted using milli q water analysis before every five samples and all samples including the blank were acidified to ph 2 by 6 m hcl until the analysis the average blanks associated with the doc measurement were approximately 5 μm and the analytic precision of the triplicate injections was 3 main components of fdom the main components of fdom were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy technique coupled with parallel factor parafac analysis li et al 2018 a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 4600 with a scanning speed of 1200 nm min was employed to measure the excitation emission matrix eem during the experiments a total of 126 eems spectra were obtained for parafac analysis matlab mathworks natick ma together with the dom fluor toolbox http www models life ku dk were employed for data analysis coble 1996 coble et al 1998 more details on the parafac eem analysis of fdom are described in the supplementary materials during the analysis of the main components of fdom the characteristic parameter of h p was employed to estimate the bioavailability of fdom h p is the ratio of the sum of the fluorescence intensities of humic like components to that of protein like components hence high values of h p denote the dominance of humic like components in the eem array and a high extent of humification kowalczuk et al 2013 molecular fingerprint of doc the molecular level changes in doc during degradation were analyzed by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms using a bruker apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer equipped with a 9 4 t superconducting magnet and apollo ii electrospray ionization source shi et al 2013 before the ft icr ms analysis doc was first solid phase extracted and then the extracted doc spe doc was eluted according to the method described in a previous study dittmar et al 2008 the methodologies for ft icr ms calibration data acquisition and processing have been described previously shi et al 2013 the data analyses were performed by using custom software the assigned formulas were limited to the following elemental composition 12c0 100 1h0 200 14n0 3 16o0 30 and 32s0 2 all assigned formulas had to meet the following basic chemical criteria 1 the number of h atoms could not exceed 2c n 2 2 the sum of h and n atoms had to be even the nitrogen rule and 3 the h c and o c value was restricted less than 3 and 1 5 respectively flerus et al 2012 more details on the ft icr ms technology are provided in the supplementary materials moreover during macroalgal degradation to estimate the refractory degree of doc released from u prolifera a modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated for all assigned formulas via ft icr ms schmidt et al 2011 the index was calculated according to the following equation 1 a i m o d 1 c 0 5 o s 0 5 h c 0 5 o s n where c h n o and s are the numbers of carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur atoms in a molecular formula respectively moreover the aimod value was selected to group all doc molecules into different species of compounds generally the aimod 0 66 is an unambiguous criterion for polycyclic aromatic structures and compounds having an 0 66 aimod 0 50 are aromatics with high aromaticity aimod 0 50 and h c 1 5 indicate highly unsaturated compounds aimod 0 5 2 0 h c 1 5 and n 0 nitrogen atom indicate nonnitrogenous unsaturated aliphatic compounds aimod 0 5 2 0 h c 1 5 and n 0 indicate nitrogenous unsaturated aliphatic compounds and aimod 0 5 and h c 2 0 indicate saturated fatty and sulfonic acids

similarity threshold quast et al 2013 functional prediction of bacterial communities the functional profiles of bacterial communities were predicted using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 2 picrust 2 software we focused on the predicted abundances of kegg orthologs kos related to glycolysis sulfur glycan degradation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation metabolism douglas et al 2019 2 4 statistical analysis to test for changes in bacterial community composition during macroalgal degradation β diversity was calculated using bray curtis distances based on relative abundance matrices of otus nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were carried out based on the bray curtis distances analysis of similarity anosim was applied to test the differences in bacterial communities among groups clarke 1993 moreover significant differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa were determined using one way anova assumptions of homogeneity of variances and normality in the anovas were assessed by scatterplots of residuals and normality curves of residuals respectively holm sidak test and the significance level was p 0 05 for the tests 3 results 3 1 dynamic changes in doc concentration and bacterial abundance during long term macroalgal degradation the dynamic changes in doc concentration and bacterial abundance showed different characteristics among stages of the long term degradation process in the first week doc was released rapidly from the algal biomass resulting in a sharp increase in the doc concentration to the peak of 6244 μm fig 1 along with this process bacterial abundance also increased rapidly from 1 9 106 to 1 22 107 cells ml 1 here the first week was tentatively named the doc rising dr stage after that the doc concentration began to decline but the bacterial abundance still increased rapidly reaching the maximum i e 1 26 107 cells ml 1 at 3 days and then began to decline until the 224th day i e 7 5 months during degradation we temporarily named this period the doc decline dd stage which lasted ca 7 months in fact during the first 4 weeks of the dd stage the doc concentration decreased sharply from 6244 to 797 μm the bacterial abundance also decreased to 5 8 106 cells ml 1 this period was named the rapid doc decline r dd substage representing a rapid doc consumption phase after the r dd substage the declines in doc concentration and bacterial abundance became relatively slow until the end of the dd stage this period was called the slow doc decline s dd substage at the end of the s dd substage doc concentration and bacterial abundance decreased to 427 μm and 2 6 105 cells ml 1 respectively after that the doc concentration and bacterial abundance remained stable for 10 months until the end of degradation this long term stable period was called the doc stabilization ds stage by contrast in the control group no significant fluctuations in doc concentration or bacterial abundance were observed meanwhile the doc concentration and bacterial abundance in the control group were much lower than those in the treatment group at the end of degradation 3 2 dynamic changes in doc composition in different stages here we used two methods to track the changes in doc composition one method was to take fdom as a proxy of doc and analyze its dynamic changes the other was to use advanced ft icr ms technology to analyze the variation in doc molecular composition four distinct fdom components i e c1 c4 were identified in this study the ex em wavelengths of which were 275 320 nm 225 270 300 nm 240 315 390 nm and 270 355 460 nm respectively table s1 based on their ex em wavelengths c1 and c2 represented protein like fractions which were the amino acid tryptophan and tyrosine like components respectively c3 and c4 represented different humic like fluorophores during the degradation process the dynamic changes in fluorescence intensity of both protein like components exhibited two stages fig 2 during the first three weeks their fluorescence intensities increased rapidly to their maximum values then they began to decline until the end of long term degradation interestingly the change in the humic like components showed an opposite trend compared with that of the protein like components the two humic like components increased gradually throughout the whole degradation process their final fluorescence intensity increased over 5 fold by the end of degradation the h p index showed a substantial increase during the degradation process fig s1 in contrast the four fluorescence components i e c1 c4 in the control group exhibited no significant changes except for a slight increase in the initial stage of degradation ft icr ms analysis better revealed the changes in doc composition at a molecular level during different stages throughout the entire degradation process a total of 5136 different molecular formulas mfs covering a mass range of 200 670 da excluding 13c isotopologs were identified during the dr stage the normalized peak intensity of 2640 mfs increased obviously which was reflected by the comparison of the doc fingerprint at the 8th day with that at the beginning i e 0th day during the degradation process fig 3 a among them 1167 mf species were newly generated during the dr stage fig 4 a however in the subsequent dd and ds stages the normalized peak intensity of 2102 mfs clearly decreased as reflected by the differences in the doc molecular fingerprint at the 8th and 520th day during degradation fig 3b among them 1292 mf species disappeared meanwhile 508 mf species were newly generated during the long term degradation process fig 4a compared with that of the treatment group the doc composition in the control group also changed obviously after 520 days with the disappearance of 1000 mf species 713 mf species were newly generated during the long term degradation process fig 4b to further compare the doc composition changes during different stages the mfs were classified into four groups based on their broad elemental compositions i e cho chno chos and chnos containing mfs table 1 during the macroalgal degradation process the number of cho and chno containing mfs decreased gradually with final declines of 29 and 31 respectively however the changes in chos and chnos containing mfs showed an increasing trend with final increases of 114 and 197 respectively meanwhile in the control group the changes in cho chno chos and chnos containing mfs were relatively small 3 3 succession of bacterial community structure during macroalgal degradation in total 995 065 clean 16s rrna gene sequences and 2688 otus were obtained throughout macroalgal degradation these otus at a 3 dissimilarity threshold were classified into 43 phyla 87 classes 229 orders 405 families and 762 genera the addition of macroalgae significantly changed the dominant components of the bacterial community compared with those in the control group fig 5 except for the eleven bacterial classes existing in both the macroalgal degradation group and the control group i e flavobacteriia bacteroidia alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria planctomycetacia phycisphaerae actinobacteria anaerolineae and saprospiria the dominant bacterial classes in the two groups were quite different in the macroalgal degradation group they were spirochaetia clostridia melainabacteria and ignavibacteriae among others whereas in the control group they were acidimicrobiia rhodothermia thermoleophilia and dehalococcoidia among others at the otu classification level only 36 of the total otus were shared between the macroalgal degradation group and the control group fig s2 here it should be mentioned that the initial bacterial community employed to degrade macroalgae were filtered through the membrane with a pore size of 0 8 μm which would bring some deviation to the bacterial community as usually only about 80 of bacterial cells can pass through the similar pore size membrane giroldo et al 2007 wyatt et al 2014 furthermore hca and nmds analysis were employed to reveal the dynamic changes in bacterial community throughout the degradation process the bacterial communities at different sampling time points were clearly divided into three clusters fig 6 interestingly the three clusters corresponded exactly to the three stages of doc changes i e the dr dd and ds stages cluster i included all of the bacterial community profiles during the dr stage i e at the 0 5th 2nd and 4th days cluster ii contained all those during the dd stage i e at the 11th 20th 30th 68th and 113th days and cluster iii comprised the bacterial community profiles during the ds stage i e at the 224th 251st and 520th days cluster ii could be further separated into two subgroups the bacterial community profiles during the r dd i e at the 11th 20th and 30th days and s dd substages i e at the 68th and 113th days the bacterial community profiles in the three clusters showed significant differences p 0 05 one way analysis of similarity i e anosim table s2 indicating significant succession of the bacterial community during the long term degradation process meanwhile in the control group the bacterial communities showed quite different variation characteristics fig s3 and s4 at the beginning of the dr stage the addition of macroalgae led to the highest relative abundance of class flavobacteriia on the 0 5th day fig 5 flavobacteriaceae affiliated with class flavobacteriia was the most dominant bacterial family fig s3 meanwhile only one day later flavobacteriia declined rapidly but bacteroidia and clostridia increased and became the two most dominant bacterial classes the most dominant lineages during this period were also replaced by unclassified bacteroidales and prolixibacteraceae belonging to class bacteroidia after entering the r dd substage the relative abundance of class clostridia decreased gradually while spirochaetia grew into the second largest class after bacterodidia concurrently melainabacteria increased to be the third largest class at the family level spirochaetaceae of class spirochaetia and marinifilaceae of class bacteroidia increased significantly p 0 05 one way anova and successively became the dominant lineages during the s dd substage the relative abundance of bacteroidia declined meanwhile that of alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria deltaproteocteria planctomycetacia and melainabacteria increased obviously the dominant classes in the s dd stage became more balanced compared with that in the earlier stages of degradation at the family level burkholderiaceae belonging to class betaproteobacteria and planctomycetaceae belonging to class planctomycetacia emerged with a high relative abundance on the 68th and 113th days in the s dd stage respectively during the ds stage actinobacteria increased to be the third largest bacterial class after alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria and the dominant bacterial families ultimately became rhodospirillaceae and sphingomonadaceae both belonging to alphaproteobacteria and lysobacteraceae and salinisphaeraceae both belonging to gammaproteobacteria altogether throughout the whole process of macroalgal degradation bacterial community structure changed dramatically and showed significant successional characteristics fig s3 moreover the shared and unique otus during different stages fig s5 were identified only 72 otus were stable and existed commonly throughout the entire degradation process whereas 299 53 143 and 650 otus were observed only in the dr r dd s dd and ds stages respectively more unique otus were observed in the dr and ds stages 3 4 the potential metabolic functions of the bacterial community in different stages during macroalgal degradation we predicted 176 functional genes involved in glycolysis glycan degradation polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and sulfur metabolism based on bacterial community structure by using picrust 2 table s3 for simplicity only the representative genes were selected to reveal the metabolic changes fig s6 in the dr and r dd stages abundant genes were involved in glycan degradation such as the genes fuca k01206 lacz k01190 man2c1 k01191 and hexa b k12373 encoding fucosidase galactosidase mannosidase and hexosaminidase respectively meanwhile the gene ptsg k02779 encoding glucose permease had a higher abundance in the dr stage this indicates that the degradation of macromolecules such as glycan and the transport and utilization of monosaccharides are likely the main metabolic functions of the bacterial community during these stages monosaccharides as a type of doc with high bioavailability can promote the rapid growth of bacteria in addition there were abundant genes related to sulfur metabolism in the dr stage such as the asra b c k00385 k16950 and k16951 encoding anaerobic sulfite reductase for the production of sulfide however from the s dd stage to the end of degradation there were more genes encoding oxygenase dioxygenase dehydrogenase decarboxylase and reductase which are involved in the degradation of aromatic or polycyclic aromatic compounds 4 discussion over the past 13 years driven by a variety of factors especially disturbance caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change the world s largest green tide has occurred every year in the yellow sea after the green tide up to 2 million tons of the macroalga sinks into deep waters and sediment qu et al 2020 the degradation of such a large amount of macroalgal biomass will inevitably have serious ecological impacts on the coastal ocean but little is known about these impacts so far this study conducted a 520 day degradation experiment on the macroalga u prolifera to explore the potential long term impacts of green tides on the coastal doc pool and microbial processes we found that sufficient degradation of the algal biomass of u prolifera is a long term process that takes at least 7 months according to the dynamic changes in doc concentration the 520 day degradation process was clearly divided into three stages i e the doc rising dr stage 8 days doc decline dd stage 216 days and doc stabilization ds stage 296 days the dd stage could be further divided into the rapid and slow doc decline substages r dd and s dd fig 1 at different stages during the long term algal degradation u prolifera fronds changed significantly fig s7 at the beginning of dr stage u prolifera fronds were slender and green and floated in the seawater at the dd stage the fronds broke into small pieces and sank to the bottom at the ds stage no fronds could be directly observed by naked eyes and were all degraded into invisible particles in the seawater along with the physical changes of the decaying algal fronds doc has undergone drastic changes the doc concentration increased sharply and reached its maximum in only one week during the dr stage concurrently the bacterial abundance also increased rapidly this indicates that the release of doc from decaying macroalgae is very fast and that algae released doc is strongly favored by bacteria hansell et al 2012 during this stage the abundance of bacteria increased by almost one order of magnitude indicating that a considerable portion of the released doc was utilized and transformed into bacterial biomass ogawa et al 2001 after that the doc concentration began to decline entering the dd stage the decrease in doc concentration may be due to the slowdown in doc release from the macroalgae not keeping up with doc consumption by the abundant bacteria the rapid decline in doc lasted for four weeks during this period the doc concentration decreased by nearly 90 this showed that most of the doc released by the macroalgae was labile doc and very easily utilized by bacteria in the coastal environment of the southern yellow sea seawater quality usually deteriorates quickly within 1 2 weeks after green tides one important reason may be that while utilizing the rich labile doc released from decaying macroalgae the heterotrophic bacteria absorb a large amount of oxygen and release a large amount of co2 resulting in hypoxia and acidification of the seawater zhang et al 2019 in this study we did not measure co2 emission but based on the very low ph value the lowest value was 6 1 of seawater during degradation fig s8 it indicates that besides being converted into bacterial biomass a considerable part of the released doc should be emitted as co2 through microbial respiration after the r dd stage the rate of decline of the doc concentration became very slow suggesting that most of the labile doc had been consumed by bacteria the remaining doc in the s dd stage had a much lower bioavailability to bacteria and may have been semi labile or semi refractory doc notably after the bacteria reached their maximum abundance on the 11th day bacterial abundance decreased gradually in the next 7 months this may be because the concentration and bioavailability of doc were significantly reduced and could not continue to meet the needs for bacterial growth leading to the death of some bacteria thus the bacterial abundance decreased gradually especially during and after the s dd stage the remnants of dead bacteria i e necromass and bacterial secretions may make an important contribution to the doc pool in the subsequent ds stage although the doc concentration was significantly higher than that in the control group both the doc concentration and bacterial abundance maintained long term stability until the end of the degradation this suggests that the doc remaining after long term macroalgal degradation is extremely difficult for bacteria to use and represents the refractory doc rdoc and the bacterial community sustained very low metabolic activity the changes in doc composition should be a decisive reason for the transformation of doc from labile to refractory first fdom was employed as a proxy of doc to study the dynamic changes in doc composition in the early stage of degradation with the rapid release of doc the protein like fractions of fdom also increased rapidly reaching a peak within three weeks and then declined gradually in the long term to a very low level fig 2 protein like substances are usually considered an indicator of biolabile doc yang et al 2015 the nearly complete depletion of the protein like fraction indicated that the labile components of doc were nearly completely consumed by bacteria interestingly the humic like fraction of fdom gradually accumulated throughout the degradation process humic like organic matter is often considered as a potential tracer of rdoc lønborg et al 2013 the continuous accumulation of humic like components hints at why doc turned increasingly recalcitrant and resisted utilization by bacteria moreover the significant negative correlation pearson s correlation r values 0 76 0 46 p 0 01 between the protein like c1 and c2 and humic like c3 and c4 fractions table s4 and the substantial increase in the h p index fig s1 implied a transformation of doc from labile to refractory during the degradation process according to the conceptual framework of the microbial carbon pump mcp this transformation should be mainly driven by bacterial communities jiao et al 2018 indeed similar phenomena have been observed during microbial degradation of phytoplankton and demonstrated the existence of the mcp zheng et al 2019 in the ocean the rdoc constitutes the main component of the extremely large stable carbon pool which can sequester carbon over the long term and plays an important role in climate change zhang et al 2017 a previous study showed that rdoc can be produced by microbial degradation of particulate organic matter or directly from microbial cell materials such as necromass liang et al 2017a here we suggest that mcp may play an important role in the production of rdoc during the long term degradation of u prolifera to more clearly explain the variation in doc composition that determined the conversion of doc from labile to refractory the doc molecular fingerprints in the early and late stages of macroalgal degradation were characterized figs 3 and 4 compared with that in natural seawater the early degradation during the dr stage of macroalgae introduced a large number 1167 of new molecular formulas mfs this indicates that the large amount of macroalgal biomass left in the sea after green tides will soon significantly increase the molecular diversity of the doc pool in coastal water meanwhile after the long term degradation process a large number 1292 of mfs had disappeared and the cho and chno containing molecules decreased significantly these vanished mfs might represent a portion of the labile molecules that had been consumed by bacteria however many 508 new mfs were also generated we consider that these new mfs might mainly comprise bacterial secretions and necromass of dead bacteria they were likely the typical molecules of rdoc that maintained long term stability during the late stage of macroalgal degradation meanwhile we found that the chos and chnos containing molecules increased significantly in the late stage table 1 suggesting that diverse sulfocompounds were formed and became the molecular components of rdoc sulfur should mainly have originated from u prolifera as the cell wall of u prolifera contains sulfur rich ulvan and highly aliphatic lipids kendel et al 2015 in addition to provide an overview of the likely structures behind the identified mfs the modified aromaticity index aimod was employed to group the dom molecules into different classes koch and dittmar 2006 polycyclic aromatics 0 66 aimod and highly aromatic compounds 0 5 aimod 0 66 are usually regarded as refractory dom schmidt et al 2011 during the long term degradation process their percentages increased significantly from 3 6 to 7 3 fig s9 meanwhile the proportion of some highly unsaturated compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 and saturated fatty and sulfonic acids aimod 0 5 h c 2 which are usually considered as labile dom cai et al 2019 decreased dramatically these changes more strongly manifested the accumulation of rdoc during the long term degradation of macroalgae indeed the long term degradation of macroalgae is a process during which bacterial communities and algae derived carbon interact with each other the bacterial community was the driving force for the dynamic changes in doc composition and vice versa in response to the changes in doc distinct succession of bacterial community structure and the potential metabolic functions at different stages also occurred the bacterial communities at different sampling time points throughout the degradation process were clearly divided into three clusters corresponding exactly to the three stages of doc changes especially at the otu level only a very small proportion of bacteria were commonly present throughout the three stages fig s5 in the dr stage the addition of macroalgae also likely introduced some associated bacteria e g flavobacteriia usually inhabiting the phycosphere environment ramanan et al 2015 meanwhile other bacteria that usually have potential extracellular hydrolase activity increased collén et al 2011 for example bacteroidia and clostridia became the two most dominant bacterial classes with relative abundances rising from 1 5 to 27 7 and from 1 5 to 13 2 respectively their members can secrete highly active hydrolase which degrades a variety of macromolecules such as ulvan and cellulose lee et al 2014 wang et al 2015 joyce et al 2018 meanwhile based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathway analysis the bacterial communities in the dr stage were predicted to have the highest glycan degradation glucose transport and anaerobic sulfite reductase activities fig s6 these bacteria should greatly promote the conversion of algae derived carbon from particulate organic carbon poc to doc and the conversion of organic carbon from being large molecular doc to small molecular doc the released small molecular doc could be easily consumed by bacteria and promoted a rapid increase in bacterial abundance during this stage bacteroidia and clostridia are typical bacteria that prefer to grow in anaerobic environments zarkasi et al 2016 the predominance of these bacteria indicates that the released doc promoted a large degree of consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration transforming the stage into a hypoxic and acidification phase this also further explained why hypoxia and acidification usually occur soon after green tides in the yellow sea meanwhile the anaerobic conditions also promoted the growth of anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria such as desulfovibrionaceae and spirochaetaceae which are often observed after the massive green tides and are major players in marine sulfur biogeochemical cycling qu et al 2020 at the r dd stage bacterial consumption resulted in a decrease in doc concentration and bacterial abundance also began to decline after reaching its peak as mentioned above since the labile doc had been gradually used up by bacteria the remaining doc became increasingly recalcitrant meanwhile the remaining poc that had not been decomposed may also have become increasingly inert thus more diverse bacterial groups such as spirochaetia and melainabacteria which have a strong organic matter degradation ability köchling et al 2015 soo et al 2015 matured and became members of the dominant bacterial groups at the s dd stage the dominant groups in the bacterial community were more diverse and balanced their ability to degrade organic matter may also have become stronger which could be confirmed by the presence of more functional genes involved in the degradation of inert polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fig s9 at the ds stage the remaining doc concentration and bacterial abundance were very stable within 10 months many bacteria that can participate in the degradation of alkanes and aromatics such as members of the families sphingomonadaceae and salinisphaeraceae kertesz and kawasaki 2010 vetriani et al 2014 became members of the dominant groups the dominance of these bacteria is also a very clear indicator that the doc remaining after long term degradation of the macroalgae was highly recalcitrant it is worth mentioning that we did not analyze the biofilm bacterial community on the decaying u prolifera fronds which is a shortage of this study biofilm bacterial communities on the decaying fronds might be quite different from planktonic bacterial communities and also play important roles in the degradation of macroalgae finally a rough estimate was obtained based on the remaining rdoc concentration after long term degradation and the amount of macroalgal biomass carbon added initially in other words after the long term degradation process ca 1 6 0 02 of the algal biomass carbon was left in seawater in the form of rdoc rdoc is highly stable and can be stored and accumulated in seawater for millennia lechtenfeld et al 2014 lønborg et al 2018 we propose that the massive u prolifera green tide occurring annually in the yellow sea might have a significant long term cumulative effect on the rdoc pool in the ocean actually the degradation process in laboratory is quite different from that in the natural ocean environment due to the strong water exchange in coastal oceans the changes in dissolved oxygen ph and bacterial community are not as strong as those in the laboratory during long term degradation of macroalgae in addition the temperature change in different seasons in the ocean is more severe than in the laboratory the bottle effect and the above environmental factors will have a significant impact on the macroalgal degradation process making our experimental results have some deviation from the actual process in coastal oceans in addition many organisms in the ocean such as protozoa and invertebrates feed on and mineralize algal fronds graça 2001 sala and jürgens 2004 ribblett et al 2005 their feeding activities will also have an important impact on the degradation process of macroalgae the degradation process of macroalgae in the natural coastal environment is much more complicated than in the laboratory 5 conclusion the present study shows that the degradation of green tide algal biomass is a long term process that can have long lasting effects on marine microbial processes and carbon cycling during the long term degradation process the interactions between bacteria and macroalgae derived carbon resulted in dynamic changes in doc concentration and composition as well as significant succession of bacterial community structure and function the successive bacterial communities played an important role in driving the gradual transformation of doc from labile to refractory and ultimately determined the fate of the carbon biomass of the macroalga u prolifera it can be inferred from this laboratory study that although u prolifera green tides disappeared in late summer every year the long term degradation of massive sank macroalgae would not only have a significant impact on marine microbial processes but also make an important contribution to the growth of

17622,terrestrial dissolved organic matter dom in forested watersheds is a known precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water although the characteristics of terrestrial dom may change with increasing nitrogen n deposition in forests how these changes alter formation potential and toxicity of dbps remains unexplored we analyzed the speciation and toxicity of dbps from chlorination of dom derived from soils o a and b horizons in an experimental temperate forest with 22 years of n addition with long term n addition the dom reactivity toward the formation of trihalomethanes from 27 7 51 8 to 22 8 31 1 µg mg dissolved organic carbon doc and chloral hydrate from 1 25 1 63 to 1 14 1 36 µg mg doc decreased but that toward the formation of haloketones increased from 0 23 0 26 to 0 26 0 33 µg mg doc the dom reactivity toward the formation of haloacetonitriles was increased in the deeper soil but reduced in the surface soil the dbp formation potential of dom draining from a certain area of forest soils in µg dbp m2 soil was estimated to be reduced by 20 3 for trihalomethanes and increased by 37 5 for haloketones and have minor changes for haloacetonitriles and chloral hydrate both 7 furthermore the dbps from chlorination of the soil derived dom showed lowered microtoxicity with n addition possibly due to reduced brominated dbp formation overall this study highlights that n deposition may not increase drinking water toxicity through altering terrestrial dom characteristics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen deposition soil derived dissolved organic matter dom disinfection by products dbps formation potential microtoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction although disinfection is essential to reduce pathogenetic risk in the water supply chowdhury 2012 it generates undesired disinfection byproducts dbps as dbp precursors in raw water react with added disinfectants such as chlorine postigo et al 2018 huang et al 2019 vu et al 2019 dissolved organic matter dom from forested watersheds has been increasingly recognized as a dbp precursor lu et al 2018 given that 90 of the world s cities rely on forested watersheds for their drinking water supply food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 terrestrial dom in forested watersheds can be altered by global change and local or regional anthropogenic disturbance mikkelson et al 2013 wang et al 2015a dom quantity and chemistry are major factors controlling the formation potential of dbps which have varying characteristics and toxicity marhaba et al 2000 therefore altered dom properties can affect water treatability and subsequent dbp formation in drinking water mikkelson et al 2013 wang et al 2015b hohner et al 2019 for example greater tree mortality in forested watersheds induced by climate warming and beetle invasion doubled trihalomethane thm levels a common carbonaceous dbp in drinking water mikkelson et al 2013 increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in forested watersheds worldwide induced by warming can reduce the coagulation efficiency of dom removal and increase formation of haloacetonitrile han a common nitrogenous dbp from chlorination and n nitrosodimethylamine a common nitrogenous dbp from chloramination for drinking water supply wang et al 2015b hohner et al 2019 effects of other global changes such as increasing atmospheric nitrogen n deposition on drinking water quality remain poorly understood due to intensive anthropogenic activity the global atmospheric reactive n deposition has increased from 34 tg yr in 1860 to approximately 150 tg yr at present and is projected to reach 200 tg yr by 2050 and 300 tg yr by 2100 respectively galloway et al 2008 cornell 2011 previous studies have shown that increasing atmospheric n deposition on terrestrial ecosystems may alter primary productivity microbial biomass and communities and soil properties e g ph and cation exchange capacity kim et al 2009 hu et al 2013 alterations in these parameters may collectively change export of different dom components from forested watersheds that receive more reactive n indeed a meta analysis has shown that the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in n added soils increased by 12 25 95 confidence interval in 58 tropical temporal and boreal forest sites yue et al 2016 in addition to doc concentrations the chemical characteristics of soil derived dom have been increasingly reported to be altered by n addition for example we recently found that more carbohydrates and condensed aromatics were contained in soil derived dom in a temperate forest after 22 years of n addition wang et al 2020 because terrestrial dom can be altered by long term n addition we expected that the components of this dbp precursor would differ in their reactivity with chlorine to yield various types of dbps which may also have differing toxicity however to the best of our knowledge there have no studies on how n addition in a forest alters terrestrial dbp precursors elucidating the responses in yield and toxicity of dbps from chlorination of altered terrestrial dom is critical to predicting drinking water quality and guiding water engineering in the coming decades with continuously increasing global n deposition here we analyzed the yield and toxicity of dbps from the chlorination of soil derived dom from experimental temperate forests with and without long term n addition we hypothesized that 1 long term n deposition would increase the reactivity of soil derived dom to form various types of dbps including nitrogenous dbps and increase the toxicity of dbps because nitrogenous dbps are usually more toxic than carbonaceous dbps and 2 long term n deposition would increase the formation potential of dbps from dom in forest soils because the doc concentration would be increased by n addition in addition the optical properties of dom are an economical and fast method to evaluate the dom characteristics and have often been linked to the reactivity of dom toward dbp formation therefore we also explored correlations between optical properties and formation and toxicity of dbps from dom chlorination to understand whether the optical properties of dom could be good proxies for predicting dbp formation and toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling the sampling site is located in the allegheny college bousson experimental forest in northwestern pennsylvania 41 36 n 80 20 w this region has a temperate climate with a mean temperature of 9 6 c and seasonally distributed precipitation 112 5 cm yr soils are cambridge series silt loam alfisols with a density of 0 52 0 01 g cm wang et al 2019 bowden et al 2019 the field experiment of chronic n addition was initiated in 1993 there are three control and three n added plots each with a size of 15 15 m the naturally atmospheric n deposition in the control site was 13 kg n ha yr wang et al 2019 the three n added plots were treated with ammonium nitrate nh4no3 using a backpack sprayer during the growing season at an annual rate of 100 kg n ha yr which is a relatively high dose to simulate an accelerated atmospheric n deposition and to examine the potential environmental effects the soil samples were collected in april 2016 after surface litter removal soils from the o horizon depth of approximately 1 3 cm a horizon depth of approximately 3 8 cm and top 10 cm of the b horizon were collected from two 20 20 cm area soil blocks within each plot therefore six soil blocks two blocks in each of the three plots were collected from both control and n added plots all samples were sieved 2 mm and lyophilized before analysis the soil mass of each horizon in each soil block from the known area 20 20 cm was recorded for the calculation of the stocks of doc tdn nh4 n nox n and don 2 2 dissolved organic matter extraction and characterization four grams of soil from the o and a horizons

visible absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem of the soil water extracts were determined by a spectrophotometer uv 8000 metash and a spectrofluorometer aqualog horiba the samples were diluted to an absorbance at 254 nm less than 0 1 to minimize the inner filter effect before the fluorescence analyses the excitation wavelengths were set to change gradually from 600 to 250 nm in 3 nm increments while the emission scans were made from 246 to 828 nm in 1 nm steps for each excitation wavelength all eems were corrected as described previously and calculated in raman units murphy

the absorbance at 365 nm peuravuori et al 1997 the slope ratio sr was calculated as the ratio of the logarithmically transformed absorbance spectrum slope at 275 295 nm s275 295 to that estimated in the range of 350 400 nm s350 400 helms et al 2008 e2 e3 ratio and sr are commonly inversely correlated with the molecular size of dom peuravuori et al 1997 helms et al 2008 the freshness index β α an index of the contribution of recently produced autochthonous dom was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm divided by the maximum emission intensity between 420 and 435 nm with excitation at 310 nm wilson et al 2008 fluorescence index fi an index to evaluate the relative contributions of microbial or higher plant dom sources was calculated as the as the emission intensity at

2014 podgorski et al 2018 a four component model was determined and passed the split half validation stedmon et al 2008 analyses using random initialization fits and residual analysis were performed to ensure that the model was the least squares result and not a local minimum each component was compared to previously published models in the openfluor database using a criterion of 95 similarity to indicate a match murphy et al 2014 after the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component f max was obtained the f max doc ratio was calculated to estimate the relative abundance of each fluorescent dom component in the dom tank et al 2011 2 3 chlorination experiment and analyses of disinfection byproducts according to the doc results all dom samples were diluted to a doc concentration of 3 0 mg l and buffered to a ph of 8 0 0 1 using nah2po4 na2hpo4 at 3 mm the chlorination experiment was carried out in 60 ml brown headspace free borosilicate glass bottles with teflon septa in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c the reaction was initiated by spiking a certain amount of naocl solution into the dom samples the chlorine dose was based on the organic and inorganic chlorine demand calculated as cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh3 after 24 hrs 10 ml aliquots were withdrawn from each sample for the measurement of ph and residual chlorine subsequently excess ascorbic acid 1 m was use to quench the reaction immediately the remaining 50 ml aliquots were used for dbp determination and toxicity assessment specifically the samples were acidified to a ph of 0 5 with h2so4 6 m saturated with 20 0 g of

bioluminescence inhibition bioassay was selected because its effect concentrations are correlated to other aquatic toxicity endpoints and it is suitable for toxic equivalency evaluation of environmental samples briefly the luminescence intensity of photobacterium phosphoreum after 15 min of exposure to an aqueous solution of chlorination products was measured by a microplate reader varioscan thermo samples with a decrease in luminescence of more than 20 were considered toxic sponza et al 2011 the assay was calibrated against zn ii with milli q water as the control sample the

induced by genotoxic chemicals was applied to monitor the overall genotoxicity the standard compound 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide 4 nqo was used as a positive control based on the dose response curve of 4

2 6 statistical analyses when assumptions e g homogeneity of variance and normally distributed data were satisfied one way analyses of variance anova with tukey s post hoc test were used to evaluate differences in the properties of water extracts between treatments control and n added in each of the three horizons pearson s correlation analysis was carried out for the optical properties sdbp fp values and proxies of dbp toxicity as the data were normally distributed these data were also standardized and analyzed using principal component analysis pca to provide a rough overview of the reduced dimensions of parameters and sample clustering the loading of different parameters on the first two principal components which explained 57 1 of the total variance and the relevant component scores of each water sample were calculated significance was considered at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of dissolved organic matter with all three soil horizons combined no significant difference p 0 23 was found in the water extractable doc stock between the n added plots 46 0 5 5 g m 2 and the control plots 40 4 6 0 g m 2 in the present study the resulting 13 8 nonsignificant difference is within the range of percent increase in doc concentration of n added soils 12 0 25 3 95 confidence interval from 58 forest sites in a meta analysis yue et al 2016 the insignificant difference in doc stocks also occurred in each individual soil horizon table 1 the insignificant alternation of n addition on doc production was observed in some previous studies as well mcdowell et al 2004 wang et al 2020 evans et al 2008 proposed that the insignificant change was caused by the untended effect of acidity change owing to added n on doc mobility that masks the genuine effects of experimental n enrichment on doc production indeed the soil ph was significantly lowered from the control 3 9 4 1 to the n added plots 3 5 3 7 in our studied forest bowden et al 2019 likewise the water extractable stocks of tdn nh4 n nox n and don were not elevated with n addition only except the significantly increased nox n stock with n addition in the o horizon table 1 this phenomenon could be explained by the high leaching loss of added nitrogen and the suppressed microbial mineralization of litter and soil organic nitrogen with consequent reduced microbial production of dissolved n berg 2000 micks et al 2004 bowden et al 2019 with 22 years of n addition the suva254 of soil water extracts was significantly increased in the b horizon table 1 because suva254 is commonly used as a surrogate of aromaticity wang et al 2020 this result suggests that n addition increased the dom aromaticity in the b horizon the n added plots had consistently lower average e2 e3 and sr values in each of the three horizons than in the control plots table 1 and the statistically significant difference occurred in a horizon for e2 e3 and in o and a horizons for sr values as e2 e3 and sr values are both inversely proportional to molecular size de haan et al 1987 helms et al 2008 hansen et al 2016 the molecular size of dom was significantly increased in all soil horizons with n addition in o and a horizons the possible increased aromaticity and molecular size of the dom in some soil horizons are consistent with our recent data based on nuclear magnetic resonance and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry which showed that aromatic and large molecular size components increased with n addition wang et al 2020 the statistically more significant difference and greater effect size of dom aromaticity in b horizon than the o and a horizon was greatly contributed by the increase of condensed aromatic dom wang et al 2020 which can be formed via the fungi mediated and fenton like reactions waggoner et al 2015 khatami et al 2019 the greater increase of fungi to bacteria biomass ratio and greater iron content in b horizon wang et al 2019 with n addition at this site may both contribute to the greater yield of condensed aromatic dom in b horizon than in o and a horizons the statistically more significant difference and greater effect size of dom molecular size in o and a horizons than the b horizon was probably because that n addition suppressed the microbial activity in o and a horizons to greater extents wang et al 2019 and thus reduced the yield of low molecular weight dom from plant biomass decomposition in the o and a horizons wang et al 2020 recent studies also showed that the low molecular weight plant derived dom decreased faster than other dom components with increasing soil depth roth et al 2019 ye et al 2020 which supports that such dom fraction has less impact in the deeper b horizon four different fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified by the parafac model fig s1 c1 displayed a prominent peak at 300 410 nm excitation emission wavelengths and was assigned as a microbial humic like component coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2006 c2 had a primary peak at 260 490 nm and was recognized as a terrestrial humic like i component shutova et al 2014 wünsch et al 2017 c3 showed a peak at 275 320 nm and was noted as a protein like component guéguen et al 2014 dainard et al 2015 podgorski et al 2018 c4 had peaks at excitation wavelengths of 370 nm and 250 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm and was characterized as a terrestrial humic like ii component murphy et al 2008 the fmax doc for the protein like c3 fluorescent component of the o horizon was lower in the n added plots than in the control plots table 1 fig s1 as the protein like fluorescent component mainly comes from microbial source murphy et al 2008 this result is in line with the decreased microbial biomass indicated by phospholipid fatty acids wang et al 2019 and suppressed enzyme reactivity bowden et al 2019 in the o horizon with n addition at this site in contrast the fmax doc values for the humic like fluorescent components c2 and c4 of the b horizon were higher in the n added plots than in the control plots table 1 fig s1 this result indicates that long term n addition resulted in more humic like fluorescent components in addition to the chromophoric dom as indicated by suva254 in the dom in the deep soil horizon 3 2 formation of common disinfection byproducts dbps the sdbp fp values i e dbp formation per doc were evaluated for dom in different soil horizons in control and n added plots the specific thm formation potential sthm fp values were lower in the n added plots than in the control plots specifically the largest reduction in the sthm fp was observed from 51 8 4 9 µg mg doc in the control plots to 28 8 2 1 µg mg doc in the n added plots for the o horizon 44 followed by a modest reduction in the a horizon from 42 7 3 8 to 31 1 2 9 µg mg doc 27 and no significant change in the b horizon from 27 7 2 7 to 22 8 1 5 µg mg doc these sthm fp values were comparable with those of forest soils 25 0 65 6 µg mg doc in wang et al 2015 and litter materials 25 4 74 9 μg mg doc in jian et al 2016 and chen et al 2020 but lower than those of peatland soils 63 80 µg mg doc in chow et al 2003 in previous studies in contrast to our hypothesis the specific han formation potential shan fp was not increased with long term n addition in any horizons it decreased from 3 2 0 4 to 2 1 0 1 µg mg doc in the o horizon 34 followed by no significant change in the a horizon from 1 9 0 2 to 1 9 0 2 µg mg doc and a significant increase in the b horizon from 1 1 0 1 to 1 4 0 1 µg mg doc 27 the specific chd formation potential schd fp showed no difference between the control and treatment in the o and a horizons but was significantly decreased in the b horizon with n addition from 0 68 0 06 to 0 48 0 06 µg mg doc in contrast to the sthm fp shan fp and schd fp the specific hkt formation potential shkt fp was elevated with n addition in all horizons from 0 22 0 01 to 0 26 0 01 µg mg doc in the o horizon from 0 25 0 01 to 0 32 0 01 µg mg doc in the a horizon and from 0 26 0 02 to 0 33 0 01 µg mg doc in the b horizon these shan fp schd fp and shkt fp values were similar to those from the soils of another forest wang et al 2015 overall these findings suggest that with long term n addition terrestrial dom reactivity toward formation of thms and chd decreased but that toward formation of hkts slightly increased in addition to these changes the bif of thms was reduced from 3 2 to 2 3 in the o horizon but not altered in a and b horizons by n addition fig s2 as brominated dbps are generally more toxic than the chlorinated analogs the toxicity of thms is expected to be reduced by n addition in o horizon the amount of dbp precursors draining from a certain area of forest soils can be estimated by dbp fpsoil which is defined as the product of sdbp fp in µg mg doc and the doc stock in soil in mg doc m2 soil most likely due to the large within treatment variations in doc stocks none of the dbp fpsoil values were significantly different between the control and treatment fig 1 this result is consistent with our earlier finding that the terrestrial dom chemistry was altered to a greater extent than the terrestrial dom quantity with long term n addition wang et al 2020 nevertheless the thm fpsoil was reduced by 34 3 from 808 1 130 9 to 531 2 42 8 mg m2 in o horizon but not significantly changed in a and b horizons with long term n addition with n addition the average han fpsoil declined by 31 2 in the o horizon from 55 6 13 6 to 38 3 2 1 mg m2 but not changed in a and b horizons no significant changes were observed for chd fpsoil in all horizons after long term n addition in contrast hkt fpsoil was found to be an exception because it increased by 42 0 from 14 4 3 6 to 20 5 2 1 mg m2 in a horizons but no alternation was found in o and a horizons after summing the three horizons the total dbp fpsoil of the three soil horizons decreased by 20 2 for thms from 4760 3 1071 5 to 3794 7 430 6 mg m2 but increased by 37 5 for hkts from 31 6 6 5 to 43 5 3 5 mg m2 the percent changes in the total han fpsoil 6 4 from 223 8 52 9 to 239 3 25 4 mg m2 and chd fpsoil 6 8 180 1 21 9 to 167 9 14 9 mg m2 with n addition were however relatively small 3 3 formation of polar halogenated dbps with uplc esi tqms uplc esi tqms was further adopted as a complementary tool to characterize dbps via nontargeted analysis the precursor ion scan pis method was adopted in our study zhai et al 2011 this approach assumes that cl dbps and br dbps contain cl isotopes 35cl and 37cl and br isotopes 79br and 81br respectively consequently the cl dbps and br dbps could be identified by the pis of isotope ions with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi tqms zhai et al 2011 the total intensities of pis 35 as well as pis 79 obtained by pis were utilized to semiquantify the total organic cl tocl and br tobr respectively which are displayed in fig 2 the intensities of pis 35 in n added plots increased by 23 6 in o horizon 4 9 in a horizon and 12 3 in b horizon respectively these results indicated that cl containing dbps were increased with the n addition however the intensities of pis 79 in n added plots were reduced by 65 6 in the o horizon and 48 4 in b horizon compared to those in control plots but increased by 70 6 in a horizon implying that br containing polar disinfection products were decreased with the n addition in o and b horizon but were increased in a horizon four most abundant cl containing dbps m z 227 229 m z 259 261 263 m z 223 225 and m z 266 268 and br containing dbps m z 457 459 m z 456 458 m z 215 217 219 and m z 207 209 were selected and identified in all spectra table s2 and fig s1 in particular the even number m z values of 266 268 indicated that this dbp was nitrogenous with one n atom in the molecule according to the nitrogen rule yang et al 2014 the intensities of all the four representative products were higher with n addition than in control plot except for the nitrogenous dbp m z 266 268 in a horizon in terms of br containing dbps the products with m z values of 207 209 and 215 217 219 were respectively identified as 7 bromoheptanoic acid br ch2 6cooh and chlorobromopropanedioic acid hooccclbrcooh based on a previous report yang et al 2019 product with m z of 457 459 and 456 458 were both characterized to contain one br according to the isotope patterns and their exact chemical formula needs further investigation additionally these four products were semi quantified with the intensities fig 2b products with m z of 457 459 and m z 456 458 were the most abundant one in terms of the intensities compared to those with m z values of 207 209 and 215 217 219 except for the products in a horizon the intensities of all the four products were lower in the n added plots in both o and b horizons than in the control plots implying that long term n addition reduced the formation of the representative polar br containing dbps the even number m z values of 456 458 indicated that this dbp contained one n atom yang et al 2014 the result of m z 456 458 illustrated that nitrogen addition elevated the formation of nitrogenous dbp in o and a horizons overall the decreased intensity from br and representative brominated dbps with n addition in both o and b horizons together with the aforementioned decreased bif suggest that long term n addition decreased the formation of brominated dbps 3 4 microtoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps mixtures with long term n addition the microtoxicity in mg l equivalent zn ii was reduced by 27 4 from 0 66 0 07 to 0 48 0 05 mg l equivalent zn ii in the a horizon and by 28 3 from 0 57 0 07 to 0 41 0 04 mg l equivalent zn ii in the b horizon fig 3 a as the volatile dbps are almost entirely lost during organic solvent removal for bioassays described in the pretreatment procedure the dbps that contributed to the toxicity should be the polar organic dbps detected with uplc esi tqms indeed the variation in microtoxicity was found to coincide with the variation in pis 79 intensity rather than pis 35 fig 2 which supports previous findings that unidentified dbps contributed substantially to the overall toxicity hua et al 2006 the good agreement inferred that the microtoxicity was mainly attributed to the polar br dbps such as the three main identified dbps m z 457 459 and 456 458 found in our study these results suggest that long term nitrogen addition may attenuate microtoxicity possibly due to the reduced formation of br containing dbps in terms of genotoxicity indicated by the reactivity of β galactosidase although the reactivity of galactosidase with dbps was increased with n addition in the a and b horizons none of the dbps formed from the 3 mg l doc were genotoxic because all values were below the threshold of 1 5 fig 3b 3 5 linking dbp formation and toxicity with optical properties of dom correlation analysis table s1 and pca fig 4 of the dom optical properties sdbp fp and toxicity proxies showed that the dbp formation and toxicity were linked to different parameters the sthm fp shan fp suva254 fmax docc1 fmax docc2 and fmax docc3 had relatively high positive loadings on pc1 while the e2 e3 fi and β α values were highly correlated and had negative loading on pc1 fig 4 these results and the correlations among sthm fp shan fp fmax doc e2 e2 and β α table s1 support the idea that the terrestrial dom reactivities toward formation of thms and hans were related to non fresh and humic like components in dom this agrees well with the arguments that terrestrial humificated dom is an important thm precursor chen et al 2019 the positive correlation of shan fp with only fmax docc3 protein like fluorescent component and not other fmax doc values table s1 further supports that protein like dom is an important source of hans the shkt fp and fmax docc4 were positively correlated and both had high positive loadings on pc2 microtoxicity and sr correlated with each other and both had negative loadings on the pc2 fig 4 these results seem to suggest that the c4 humic like dom component or its correlated component is a source of hkts and the microtoxicity appears to be linked to the low molecular weight fraction of dom the schd fp was not correlated with any other parameter and the genotoxicity was only weakly and negatively correlated with shkt fp table s1 note that the dbp microtoxicity or genotoxicity was not positively linked to any of the sdbp fps of thms hans chd or hkts this finding is in line with the previously reported finding that these commonly detected dbps made a weak contribution to the overall dbp toxicity despite their relatively high abundances in addition the n added samples had higher f2 scores than the control samples fig 4 suggesting that the terrestrial dom became larger in molecular size and more reactive toward hkt formation but would yield dbps with lower microtoxicity with long term n addition the reduced formation of brominated dbps should be one factor responsible for the decreased microtoxicity in addition we suspected that the dom with greater molecular size in the n added plots may yield more high molecular weight dbps compared but less low molecular weight dbps the latter of which may cross cell membranes easier and cause toxicity 4 conclusions increasing atmospheric n deposition is an important global trend that is likely to alter the total export and characteristics of terrestrial dom as well as the dom reactivity with chlorine to form dbps of varying degrees of toxicity although long term n deposition was hypothesized to increase the reactivity of dom to yield more toxic nitrogenous dbps our study presents the first evidence that the dom reactivity toward han formation depends on the dom source surface vs deeper soils although the long term n addition slightly promoted the reactivity toward hkt formation it reduced the reactivity toward the formation of thms and brominated dbps more importantly the long term n addition weakened the microtoxicity of the reaction products from the chlorination of terrestrial dom these results were contradictory to our hypothesis that n addition may lead to the formation of more nitrogenous dbps and thus higher overall toxicity therefore increasing global n deposition to forested watersheds may not increase drinking water toxicity through altering the terrestrial dbp precursors conversely it could even possibly contribute to the reduction in the formation and toxicity of dbps from terrestrial dom although the current work has shown the effect of simulated atmospheric n deposition on terrestrial dbp precursors how aquatic dbp precursors respond to increased atmospheric n deposition remains unknown and awaits further prospective studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17622,terrestrial dissolved organic matter dom in forested watersheds is a known precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water although the characteristics of terrestrial dom may change with increasing nitrogen n deposition in forests how these changes alter formation potential and toxicity of dbps remains unexplored we analyzed the speciation and toxicity of dbps from chlorination of dom derived from soils o a and b horizons in an experimental temperate forest with 22 years of n addition with long term n addition the dom reactivity toward the formation of trihalomethanes from 27 7 51 8 to 22 8 31 1 µg mg dissolved organic carbon doc and chloral hydrate from 1 25 1 63 to 1 14 1 36 µg mg doc decreased but that toward the formation of haloketones increased from 0 23 0 26 to 0 26 0 33 µg mg doc the dom reactivity toward the formation of haloacetonitriles was increased in the deeper soil but reduced in the surface soil the dbp formation potential of dom draining from a certain area of forest soils in µg dbp m2 soil was estimated to be reduced by 20 3 for trihalomethanes and increased by 37 5 for haloketones and have minor changes for haloacetonitriles and chloral hydrate both 7 furthermore the dbps from chlorination of the soil derived dom showed lowered microtoxicity with n addition possibly due to reduced brominated dbp formation overall this study

al 2019 dissolved organic matter dom from forested watersheds has been increasingly recognized as a dbp precursor lu et al 2018 given that 90 of the world s cities rely on forested watersheds for their drinking water supply food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 terrestrial dom in forested watersheds can be altered by global change and local or regional anthropogenic disturbance mikkelson et al 2013 wang et al 2015a dom quantity and chemistry are major factors controlling the formation potential of dbps which have varying characteristics and toxicity marhaba et al 2000 therefore altered dom properties can affect water treatability and subsequent dbp formation in drinking water mikkelson et al 2013 wang et al 2015b hohner et al 2019 for example greater tree mortality in forested watersheds induced by climate warming and beetle invasion doubled trihalomethane thm levels a common carbonaceous dbp in drinking water mikkelson et al 2013 increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in forested watersheds worldwide induced by warming can reduce the coagulation efficiency of dom removal and increase formation of haloacetonitrile han a common nitrogenous dbp from chlorination and n nitrosodimethylamine a common nitrogenous dbp from chloramination for drinking water supply wang et al 2015b hohner et al 2019 effects of other global changes such as increasing atmospheric nitrogen n deposition on drinking water quality remain poorly understood due to intensive anthropogenic activity the global atmospheric reactive n deposition has increased from 34 tg yr in 1860 to approximately 150 tg yr at present and is projected to reach 200 tg yr by 2050 and 300 tg yr by 2100 respectively galloway et al 2008 cornell 2011 previous studies have shown that increasing atmospheric n deposition on terrestrial ecosystems may alter primary productivity microbial biomass and communities and soil properties e g ph and cation exchange capacity kim et al 2009 hu et al 2013 alterations in these parameters may collectively change export of different dom components from forested watersheds that receive more reactive n indeed a meta analysis has shown that the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in n added soils increased by 12 25 95 confidence interval in 58 tropical temporal and boreal forest sites yue et al 2016 in addition to doc concentrations the chemical characteristics of soil derived dom have been increasingly reported to be altered by n addition for example we recently found that more carbohydrates and condensed aromatics were contained in soil derived dom in a temperate forest after 22 years of n addition wang et al 2020 because terrestrial dom can be altered by long term n addition we expected that the components of this dbp precursor would differ in their reactivity with chlorine to yield various types of dbps which may also have differing toxicity however to the best of our knowledge there have no studies on how n addition in a forest alters terrestrial dbp precursors elucidating the responses in yield and toxicity of dbps from chlorination of altered terrestrial dom is critical to predicting drinking water quality and guiding water engineering in the coming decades with continuously increasing global n deposition here we analyzed the yield and toxicity of dbps from the chlorination of soil derived dom from experimental temperate forests with and without long term n addition we hypothesized that 1 long term n deposition would increase the reactivity of soil derived dom to form various types of dbps including nitrogenous dbps and increase the toxicity of dbps because nitrogenous dbps are usually more toxic than carbonaceous dbps and 2 long term n deposition would increase the formation potential of dbps from dom in forest soils because the doc concentration would be increased by n addition in addition the optical properties of dom are an economical and fast method to evaluate the dom characteristics and have often been linked to the reactivity of dom toward dbp formation therefore we also explored correlations between optical properties and formation and toxicity of dbps from dom chlorination to understand whether the optical properties of dom could be good proxies for predicting dbp formation and toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling the sampling site is located in the allegheny college bousson experimental forest in northwestern pennsylvania 41 36 n 80 20 w this region has a temperate climate with a mean temperature of 9 6 c and seasonally distributed precipitation 112 5 cm yr soils are cambridge series silt loam alfisols with a density of 0 52 0 01 g cm wang et al 2019 bowden et al 2019 the field experiment of chronic n addition was initiated in 1993 there are three control and three n added plots each with a size of 15 15 m the naturally atmospheric n deposition in the control site was 13 kg n ha yr wang et al 2019 the three n added plots were treated with ammonium nitrate nh4no3 using a backpack sprayer during the growing season at an annual rate of 100 kg n ha yr which is a relatively high dose to simulate an accelerated atmospheric n deposition and to examine the potential environmental effects the soil samples were collected in april 2016 after surface litter removal soils from the o horizon depth of approximately 1 3 cm a horizon depth of approximately 3 8 cm and top 10 cm of the b horizon were collected from two 20 20 cm area soil blocks within each plot therefore six soil blocks two blocks in each of the three plots were collected from both control and n added plots all samples were sieved 2 mm and lyophilized before analysis the soil mass of each horizon in each soil block from the known area 20 20 cm was recorded for the calculation of the stocks of doc tdn nh4 n nox n and don 2 2 dissolved organic matter extraction and characterization four grams of soil from the o and a horizons

were diluted to an absorbance at 254 nm less than 0 1 to minimize the inner filter effect before the fluorescence analyses the excitation wavelengths were set to change gradually from 600 to 250 nm in 3 nm increments while the emission scans were made from 246 to 828 nm in 1 nm steps for each excitation wavelength all eems were corrected as described previously and calculated in raman units murphy

excitation at 310 nm wilson et al 2008 fluorescence index fi an index to evaluate the relative contributions of microbial or higher plant dom sources was calculated as the as the emission intensity at

2014 podgorski et al 2018 a four component model was determined and passed the split half validation stedmon et al 2008 analyses using random initialization fits and residual analysis were performed to ensure that the model was the least squares result and not a local minimum each component was compared to previously published models in the openfluor database using a criterion of 95 similarity to indicate a match murphy et al 2014 after the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component f max was obtained the f max doc ratio was calculated to estimate the relative abundance of each fluorescent dom component in the dom tank et al 2011 2 3 chlorination experiment and analyses of disinfection byproducts according to the doc results all dom samples were diluted to a doc concentration of 3 0 mg l and buffered to a ph of 8 0 0 1 using nah2po4 na2hpo4 at 3 mm the chlorination experiment was carried out in 60 ml brown headspace free borosilicate glass bottles with teflon septa in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c the reaction was initiated by spiking a certain amount of naocl solution into the dom samples the chlorine dose was based on the organic and inorganic chlorine demand calculated as cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh3 after 24 hrs 10 ml aliquots were withdrawn from each sample for the measurement of ph and residual chlorine subsequently excess ascorbic acid 1 m was use to quench the

nqo and the samples the genotoxicity of the sample was standardized to an equivalent 4 nqo concentration the details of this genotoxicity assay are available in method s2 in the supporting information 2 6 statistical analyses when assumptions e g homogeneity of variance and normally distributed data were satisfied one way analyses of variance anova with tukey s post hoc test were used to evaluate differences in the properties of water extracts between treatments control and n added in each of the three horizons pearson s correlation analysis was carried out for the optical properties sdbp fp values and proxies of dbp toxicity as the data were normally distributed these data were also standardized and analyzed using principal component analysis pca to provide a rough overview of the reduced dimensions of parameters and sample clustering the loading of different parameters on the first two principal components which explained 57 1 of the total variance and the relevant component scores of each water sample were calculated significance was considered at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of dissolved organic matter with all three soil horizons combined no significant difference p 0 23 was found in the water extractable doc stock between the n added plots 46 0 5 5 g m 2 and the control plots 40 4 6 0 g m 2 in the present study the resulting 13 8 nonsignificant difference is within the range of percent increase in doc concentration of n added soils 12 0 25 3 95 confidence interval from 58 forest sites in a meta analysis yue et al 2016 the insignificant difference in doc stocks also occurred in each individual soil horizon table 1 the insignificant alternation of n addition on doc production was observed in some previous studies as well mcdowell et al 2004 wang et al 2020 evans et al 2008 proposed that the insignificant change was caused by the untended effect of acidity change owing to added n on doc mobility that masks the genuine effects of experimental n enrichment on doc production indeed the soil ph was significantly lowered from the control 3 9 4 1 to the n added plots 3 5 3 7 in our studied forest bowden et al 2019 likewise the water extractable stocks of tdn nh4 n nox n and don were not elevated with n addition only except the significantly increased nox n stock with n addition in the o horizon table 1 this phenomenon could be explained by the high leaching loss of added nitrogen and the suppressed microbial mineralization of litter and soil organic nitrogen with consequent reduced microbial production of dissolved n berg 2000 micks et al 2004 bowden et al 2019 with 22 years of n addition the suva254 of soil water extracts was significantly increased in the b horizon table 1 because suva254 is commonly used as a surrogate of aromaticity wang et al 2020 this result suggests that n addition increased the dom aromaticity in the b horizon the n added plots had consistently lower average e2 e3 and sr values in each of the three horizons than in the control plots table 1 and the statistically significant difference occurred in a horizon for e2 e3 and in o and a horizons for sr values as e2 e3 and sr values are both inversely proportional to molecular size de haan et al 1987 helms et al 2008 hansen et al 2016 the molecular size of dom was significantly increased in all soil horizons with n addition in o and a horizons the possible increased aromaticity and molecular size of the dom in some soil horizons are consistent with our recent data based on nuclear magnetic resonance and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry which showed that aromatic and large molecular size components increased with n addition wang et al 2020 the statistically more significant difference and greater effect size of dom aromaticity in b horizon than the o and a horizon was greatly contributed by the increase of condensed aromatic dom wang et al 2020 which can be formed via the fungi mediated and fenton like reactions waggoner et al 2015 khatami et al 2019 the greater increase of fungi to bacteria biomass ratio and greater iron content in b horizon wang et al 2019 with n addition at this site may both contribute to the greater yield of condensed aromatic dom in b horizon than in o and a horizons the statistically more significant difference and greater effect size of dom molecular size in o and a horizons than the b horizon was probably because that n addition suppressed the microbial activity in o and a horizons to greater extents wang et al 2019 and thus reduced the yield of low molecular weight dom from plant biomass decomposition in the o and a horizons wang et al 2020 recent studies also showed that the low molecular weight plant derived dom decreased faster than other dom components with increasing soil depth roth et al 2019 ye et al 2020 which supports that such dom fraction has less impact in the deeper b horizon four different fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were identified by the parafac model fig s1 c1 displayed a prominent peak at 300 410 nm excitation emission wavelengths and was assigned as a microbial humic like component coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2006 c2 had a primary peak at 260 490 nm and was recognized as a terrestrial humic like i component shutova et al 2014 wünsch et al 2017 c3 showed a peak at 275 320 nm and was noted as a protein like component guéguen et al 2014 dainard et al 2015 podgorski et al 2018 c4 had peaks at excitation wavelengths of 370 nm and 250 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm and was characterized as a terrestrial humic like ii component murphy et al 2008 the fmax doc for the protein like c3 fluorescent component of the o horizon was lower in the n added plots than in the control plots table 1 fig s1 as the protein like fluorescent component mainly comes from microbial source murphy et al 2008 this result is in line with the decreased microbial biomass indicated by phospholipid fatty acids wang et al 2019 and suppressed enzyme reactivity bowden et al 2019 in the o horizon with n addition at this site in contrast the fmax doc values for the humic like fluorescent components c2 and c4 of the b horizon were higher in the n added plots than in the control plots table 1 fig s1 this result indicates that long term n addition resulted in more humic like fluorescent components in addition to the chromophoric dom as indicated by suva254 in the dom in the deep soil horizon 3 2 formation of common disinfection byproducts dbps the sdbp fp values i e dbp formation per doc were evaluated for dom in different soil horizons in control and n added plots the specific thm formation potential sthm fp values were lower in the n added plots than in the control plots specifically the largest reduction in the sthm fp was observed from 51 8 4 9 µg mg doc in the control plots to 28 8 2 1 µg mg doc in the n added plots for the o horizon 44 followed by a modest reduction in the a horizon from 42 7 3 8 to 31 1 2 9 µg mg doc 27 and no significant change in the b horizon from 27 7 2 7 to 22 8 1 5 µg mg doc these sthm fp values were comparable with those of forest soils 25 0 65 6 µg mg doc in wang et al 2015 and litter materials 25 4 74 9 μg mg doc in jian et al 2016 and chen et al 2020 but lower than those of peatland soils 63 80 µg mg doc in chow et al 2003 in previous studies in contrast to our hypothesis the specific han formation potential shan fp was not increased with long term n addition in any horizons it decreased from 3 2 0 4 to 2 1 0 1 µg mg doc in the o horizon 34 followed by no significant change in the a horizon from 1 9 0 2 to 1 9 0 2 µg mg doc and a significant increase in the b horizon from 1 1 0 1 to 1 4 0 1 µg mg doc 27 the specific chd formation potential schd fp showed no difference between the control and treatment in the o and a horizons but was significantly decreased in the b horizon with n addition from 0 68 0 06 to 0 48 0 06 µg mg doc in contrast to the sthm fp shan fp and schd fp the specific hkt formation potential shkt fp was elevated with n addition in all horizons from 0 22 0 01 to 0 26 0 01 µg mg doc in the o horizon from 0 25 0 01 to 0 32 0 01 µg mg doc in the a horizon and from 0 26 0 02 to 0 33 0 01 µg mg doc in the b horizon these shan fp schd fp and shkt fp values were similar to those from the soils of another forest wang et al 2015 overall these findings suggest that with long term n addition terrestrial dom reactivity toward formation of thms and chd decreased but that toward formation of hkts slightly increased in addition to these changes the bif of thms was reduced from 3 2 to 2 3 in the o horizon but not altered in a and b horizons by n addition fig s2 as brominated dbps are generally more toxic than the chlorinated analogs the toxicity of thms is expected to be reduced by n addition in o horizon the amount of dbp precursors draining from a certain area of forest soils can be estimated by dbp fpsoil which is defined as the product of sdbp fp in µg mg doc and the doc stock in soil in mg doc m2 soil most likely due to the large within treatment variations in doc stocks none of the dbp fpsoil values were significantly different between the control and treatment fig 1 this result is consistent with our earlier finding that the terrestrial dom chemistry was altered to a greater extent than the terrestrial dom quantity with long term n addition wang et al 2020 nevertheless the thm fpsoil was reduced by 34 3 from 808 1 130 9 to 531 2 42 8 mg m2 in o horizon but not significantly changed in a and b horizons with long term n addition with n addition the average han fpsoil declined by 31 2 in the o horizon from 55 6 13 6 to 38 3 2 1 mg m2 but not changed in a and b horizons no significant changes were observed for chd fpsoil in all horizons after long term n addition in contrast hkt fpsoil was found to be an exception because it increased by 42 0 from 14 4 3 6 to 20 5 2 1 mg m2 in a horizons but no alternation was found in o and a horizons after summing the three horizons the total dbp fpsoil of the three soil horizons decreased by 20 2 for thms from 4760 3 1071 5 to 3794 7 430 6 mg m2 but increased by 37 5 for hkts from 31 6 6 5 to 43 5 3 5 mg m2 the percent changes in the total han fpsoil 6 4 from 223 8 52 9 to 239 3 25 4 mg m2 and chd fpsoil 6 8 180 1 21 9 to 167 9 14 9 mg m2 with n addition were however relatively small 3 3 formation of polar halogenated dbps with uplc esi tqms uplc esi tqms was further adopted as a complementary tool to characterize dbps via nontargeted analysis the precursor ion scan pis method was adopted in our study zhai et al 2011 this approach assumes that cl dbps and br dbps contain cl isotopes 35cl and 37cl and br isotopes 79br and 81br respectively consequently the cl dbps and br dbps could be identified by the pis of isotope ions with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi tqms zhai et al 2011 the total intensities of pis 35 as well as pis 79 obtained by pis were utilized to semiquantify the total organic cl tocl and br tobr respectively which are displayed in fig 2 the intensities of pis 35 in n added plots increased by 23 6 in o horizon 4 9 in a horizon and 12 3 in b horizon respectively these results indicated that cl containing dbps were increased with the n addition however the intensities of pis 79 in n added plots were reduced by 65 6 in the o horizon and 48 4 in b horizon compared to those in control plots but increased by 70 6 in a horizon implying that br containing polar disinfection products were decreased with the n addition in o and b horizon but were increased in a horizon four most abundant cl containing dbps m z 227 229 m z 259 261 263 m z 223 225 and m z 266 268 and br containing dbps m z 457 459 m z 456 458 m z 215 217 219 and m z 207 209 were selected and identified in all spectra table s2 and fig s1 in particular the even number m z values of 266 268 indicated that this dbp was nitrogenous with one n atom in the molecule according to the nitrogen rule yang et al 2014 the intensities of all the four representative products were higher with n addition than in control plot except for the nitrogenous dbp m z 266 268 in a horizon in terms of br containing dbps the products with m z values of 207 209 and 215 217 219 were respectively identified as 7 bromoheptanoic acid br ch2 6cooh and chlorobromopropanedioic acid hooccclbrcooh based on a previous report yang et al 2019 product with m z of 457 459 and 456 458 were both characterized to contain one br according to the isotope patterns and their exact chemical formula needs further investigation additionally these four products were semi quantified with the intensities fig 2b products with m z of 457 459 and m z 456 458 were the most abundant one in terms of the intensities compared to those with m z values of 207 209 and 215 217 219 except for the products in a horizon the intensities of all the four products were lower in the n added plots in both o and b horizons than in the control plots implying that long term n addition reduced the formation of the representative polar br containing dbps the even number m z values of 456 458 indicated that this dbp contained one n atom yang et al 2014 the result of m z 456 458 illustrated that nitrogen addition elevated the formation of nitrogenous dbp in o and a horizons overall the decreased intensity from br and representative brominated dbps with n addition in both o and b horizons together with the aforementioned decreased bif suggest that long term n addition decreased the formation of brominated dbps 3 4 microtoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps mixtures with long term n addition the microtoxicity in mg l equivalent zn ii was reduced by 27 4 from 0 66 0 07 to 0 48 0 05 mg l equivalent zn ii in the a horizon and by 28 3 from 0 57 0 07 to 0 41 0 04 mg l equivalent zn ii in the b horizon fig 3 a as the volatile dbps are almost entirely lost during organic solvent removal for bioassays described in the pretreatment procedure the dbps that contributed to the toxicity should be the polar organic dbps detected with uplc esi tqms indeed the variation in microtoxicity was found to coincide with the variation in pis 79 intensity rather than pis 35 fig 2 which supports previous findings that unidentified dbps contributed substantially to the overall toxicity hua et al 2006 the good agreement inferred that the microtoxicity was mainly attributed to the polar br dbps such as the three main identified dbps m z 457 459 and 456 458 found in our study these results suggest that long term nitrogen addition may attenuate microtoxicity possibly due to the reduced formation of br containing dbps in terms of genotoxicity indicated by the reactivity of β galactosidase although the reactivity of galactosidase with dbps was increased with n addition in the a and b horizons none of the dbps formed from the 3 mg l doc were genotoxic because all values were below the threshold of 1 5 fig 3b 3 5 linking dbp formation and toxicity with optical properties of dom correlation analysis table s1 and pca fig 4 of the dom optical properties sdbp fp and toxicity proxies showed that the dbp formation and toxicity were linked to different parameters the sthm fp shan fp suva254 fmax docc1 fmax docc2 and fmax docc3 had relatively high positive loadings on pc1 while the e2 e3 fi and β α values were highly correlated and had negative loading on pc1 fig 4 these results and the correlations among sthm fp shan fp fmax doc e2 e2 and β α table s1 support the idea that the terrestrial dom reactivities toward formation of thms and hans were related to non fresh and humic like components in dom this agrees well with the arguments that terrestrial humificated dom is an important thm precursor chen et al 2019 the positive correlation of shan fp with only fmax docc3 protein like fluorescent component and not other fmax doc values table s1 further supports that protein like dom is an important source of hans the shkt fp and fmax docc4 were positively correlated and both had high positive loadings on pc2 microtoxicity and sr correlated with each other and both had negative loadings on the pc2 fig 4 these results seem to suggest that the c4 humic like dom component or its correlated component is a source of hkts and the microtoxicity appears to be linked to the low molecular weight fraction of dom the schd fp was not correlated with any other parameter and the genotoxicity was only weakly and negatively correlated with shkt fp table s1 note that the dbp microtoxicity or genotoxicity was not positively linked to any of the sdbp fps of thms hans chd or hkts this finding is in line with the previously reported finding that these commonly detected dbps made a weak contribution to the overall dbp toxicity despite their relatively high abundances in addition the n added samples had higher f2 scores than the control samples fig 4 suggesting that the terrestrial dom became larger in molecular size and more reactive toward hkt formation but would yield dbps with lower microtoxicity with long term n addition the reduced formation of brominated dbps should be one factor responsible for the decreased microtoxicity in addition we suspected that the dom with greater molecular size in the n added plots may yield more high molecular weight dbps compared but less low molecular weight dbps the latter of which may cross cell membranes easier and cause toxicity 4 conclusions increasing atmospheric n deposition is an important global trend that is likely to alter the total export and characteristics of terrestrial dom as well as the dom reactivity with chlorine to form dbps of varying degrees of toxicity although long term n deposition was hypothesized to increase the reactivity of dom to yield more toxic nitrogenous dbps our study presents the first evidence that the dom reactivity toward han formation depends on the dom source surface vs deeper soils although the long term n addition slightly promoted the reactivity toward hkt formation it reduced the reactivity toward the formation of thms and brominated dbps more importantly the long term n addition weakened the microtoxicity of the reaction products from the chlorination of terrestrial dom these results were contradictory to our hypothesis that n addition may lead to the formation of more nitrogenous dbps and thus higher overall toxicity therefore increasing global n deposition to forested watersheds may not increase drinking water toxicity through altering the terrestrial dbp precursors conversely it could even possibly contribute to the reduction in the formation and toxicity of dbps from terrestrial dom although the current work has shown the effect of simulated atmospheric n deposition on terrestrial dbp precursors how aquatic dbp precursors respond to increased atmospheric n deposition remains unknown and awaits further prospective studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17623,conventional coagulation process is not effective to eliminate trace organic compounds trocs this study proposed a novel peroxomonosulfate pms amended iron coagulation process and found its effectiveness in eliminating trocs in synthetic and natural waters in synthetic waters containing hydroquinone hq or benzoquinone bq fe iii pms effectively degraded carbamazepine cbz a representative of resistant trocs the step of reduction of fe iii to form fe ii governed the degradation rate of cbz as pms activation by fe ii was the dominant reaction to generate so4 which was the major reactive oxidant in the system meanwhile hq was quickly transformed to bq in the fe iii pms system and bq acted as an electron shuttle to induce fe iii fe ii redox cycle and accelerate pms activation natural organic matter nom bearing phenolic and quinone moieties played similar roles as hq and bq and fast cbz degradation was also observed finally two surface waters spiked cbz were subjected to bench scale experimentation to simulate coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes in water treatment plants compared to the conventional iron coagulation process the pms amended iron coagulation process increased the removal percentage of cbz by 50 80 overall this study demonstrates that pms enhanced iron coagulation is a promising process for the abatement of trocs in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate pms coagulation trace organic compounds carbamazepine sulfate radical water treatment 1 introduction trace organic compounds trocs such as pharsmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs have been frequently detected in surface waters at ng μg l levels padhye et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation and filtration units were not very effective in removing trocs huerta fontela et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2005 chlorination can remove some trocs bearing phenolic amine and aniline groups huerta fontela et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2005 a variety group of trocs were thus still detected in the finished drinking water gaffney et al 2015 loraine and pettigrove 2006 considering that some of trocs have been linked to adverse health and ecological effects bruce et al 2010 liu et al 2020 improving the degradation efficiency of trocs in drinking water treatment processes is still urgently needed activated persulfate including peroxomonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds has been widely used to eliminate various trocs taking advantage of sulfate so4 or hydroxyl ho radicals ghanbari and moradi 2017 lee et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 among the activators used ferrous iron fe ii was commonly adopted parallel to the fenton reaction this process proceeds through one electron reduction of the o o bond to produce sulfate radical so4 eqs 1 and 2 kim et al 2018 zou et al 2013 however due to the limitation of slow transformation rate from the formed fe iii back to fe ii the degradation of contaminants was quickly inhibited and resulted in incomplete degradation to alleviate the drawbacks multiple antioxidants such as hydroxylamine and natural polyphenols have been proposed to assist the redox cycling of fe iii fe ii pan et al 2020 zou et al 2013 in addition to fe ii recent studies indicated that naturally occurring quinones can also activate persulfate for example 1 4 benzoquinone bq can effectively decompose pds to so4 for 2 4 4 trichlorobiphenyl pcb 28 degradation fang et al 2013 the activation of pms by bq however produced singlet oxygen 1o2 not so4 ahmad et al 2013 despite of many researches on pms pds activation by fe ii or phenols quinones the application of these processes in drinking water treatment is still questionable partially because the addition of fe ii or other activators may lead to secondary pollution or bring problems for the subsequent treatment steps e g disinfection

ferric sulfate are commonly used as coagulants to remove suspended solids ss and some natural organic matter nom matilainen et al 2010 vik and eikebrokk 1988 nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and contains numerous phenolic and quinone moieties aeschbacher et al 2012 cory and mcknight 2005 previous results show that the phenolic and quinone moieties are involved in the redox transformation of iron for example garg and coworkers found that hydroquinone and or semiquinone type species present in nom can reduce fe iii to fe ii in natural waters garg et al 2015 for benzoquinone although it cannot directly reduce fe iii it can undergo self redox cycling to produce semiquinone or hydroquinone to interact with fe iii song and buettner 2010 therefore we suspect that if pms is added to the coagulation process these redox active moieties phenols and quinones present in nom might assist in pms activation possible reactions include i activation of pms by benzoquinone or semiquinone moieties ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 2 activation of pms by fe ii formed from reduction of fe iii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 3 regeneration of fe ii via hydroquinone quinone redox reactions jiang et al 2015 an understanding of these reactions is thus important for the potential application of pms amended iron coagulation for trocs degradation as such the aim of this study is to verify whether fe iii quinone and fe iii hydroquinone interactions can be used to activate pms for troc degradation and whether the pms amended iron coagulation is feasible for trocs degradation for natural waters carbamazepine cbz was chosen as the target compound due to its prevalence in surface waters and resistance to common oxidants e g chlorine chlorine dioxide hydrogen peroxide and pms pds in some tests caffeine ibuprofen atrazine are also included as they are also known to be resistant by conventional water treatment processes benzoquinone bq and hydroquinone hq were used as representatives of oxidized and reduced quinones respectively because of their simple structures and well studied reactions with fe iii surface water samples were used for coagulation flocculation sedimentation treatment processes the results from this study are inspiring and provide a potential application of upgrading the traditional coagulation process to bear advanced oxidation functions

varied concentrations of srfa 1 mgc l 2 5 mgc l and 5 mgc l were added to the fe iii pms process to mediate cbz degradation to further confirm the contribution of ho and so4 in cbz degradation in srfa fe iii pms process scavenging experiments were conducted by adding 10 mm meoh or tba the molar alcohol cbz ratio was 1000 1 to the reaction system all the degradation experiments were conducted in

μmol of cbz was spiked to 0 8 l source water then 6 ml of fe iii solution 26 7 mm and 2 ml of pms solution 0 4 mm were added simultaneously to the water samples and the rapid mixing step immediately started the final concentrations of cbz fe iii and pms in this process were 0 5 μm 0 2 mm and 1 mm respectively the mixing procedures were conducted as follows 1 min of rapid mixing at 200 rpm 30 min of flocculation at 30 rpm and 90 min of settling time control experiments with fe iii or pms alone were also conducted after reaction for 5 15 30 60 90 and 120 min 1 ml of supernatant was withdrawn

degraded by pms alone less than 8 cbz was degraded in hq pms and fe iii pms processes within 60 min about 20 cbz was degraded in bq fe iii process after 60 min however when bq was added to fe iii pms system the degradation of cbz was significantly accelerated and showed a two stage decay kinetics about 20 cbz was degraded in the initial 1 min the first sampling point after which the degradation proceeded moderately reaching 99 after 60 min in comparison the degradation of cbz was much faster in hq fe iii pms process i e almost all cbz was degraded within 8 min such faster degradation rate can be attributed to the high reactivity of hq toward fe iii 2 4 106 m 1 s 1 jiang et al 2015 which generates fe ii as shown in fig s1 pms activation by fe ii 50 μm was very effective to eliminate cbz and about 90 of cbz was degraded in 1 min afterwards the degradation of cbz almost stopped due to the limitation of fe iii transformation back to fe ii which is similar to the case in fenton reaction except bq and hq the effects of other substituted quinones were also examined the addition of chq cbq or mhq in fe iii pms system resulted in complete degradation of cbz after 8 min and 89 cbz was degraded in mbq amended fe iii pms system in the same period fig s2 the results suggest that quinone and or hydroquinone moieties can effectively mediate fe iii for pms activation and thus promote cbz degradation 3 2 identification the roles of reactive oxidants a series of experiments were conducted to further explore the roles of reactive species in bq fe iii pms systems by the use of probe compounds quenchers and epr spectroscopy methods self decomposition of pms or bq catalyzed pms activation was reported to generate 1o2 li et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 to verify the generation of 1o2 in bq fe iii pms process temp was used as the trapping agent in epr spectroscopy as shown in fig s3 a typical 3 fold characteristic peak of the temp 1o2 adduct α 16 9 g with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 sun et al 2019 was observed in solution containing pms alone primarily due to its self decomposition although higher tepm 1o2 signal was observed in bq fe iii pms process it should be noted that its intensity was similar as that in bq pms whereas the latter showed negligible cbz degradation fig 1 moreover the reactivity of 1o2 with cbz was low which was determined to be 2 57 105 m 1 s 1 in this study details in text s2 the results indicated that 1o2 played a negligible role in cbz degradation the epr results showed a typical dmpo so4 signal an 13 2 g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g and ah 0 78 g fang et al 2013 in quinone fe iii pms process fig 2 a indicating the generation of so4 in this process the peak intensity of dmpo so4 in bq fe iii pms process was slightly lower than that in hq fe iii pms which was consistent with the difference in cbz degradation observed in fig 1 the signal of dmpo oh an ah 14 9 g was too small to observe in bq fe iii pms and hq fe iii pms processes to further explore the role of so4 and ho in cbz degradation ba and nb were added as probe compounds as shown in table s3 ba reacted both with so4 k 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and ho k 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1977 and nb mainly reacted with ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but barely with so4 k 1 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 as shown in fig 2b insignificant amount of nb was degraded after 60 min reaction in the bq fe iii pms system whereas ba was degraded by 96 in the same period clearly so4 but not ho was the dominant specie in the bq fe iii pms system quenching experiments were also conducted by using ba nb and meoh in this study the addition of 0 4 mm ba would completely quench almost all the generated so4 kso4 ba ba kso4 ba ba kso4 cbz cbz 99 2 and ho kho ba ba kho ba ba kho cbz cbz 99 while 0 5 mm nb will only quench all the ho kho nb nb kho nb nb kho cbz cbz 99 1 as shown in fig s4 the degradation of cbz after 60 min was reduced by only 13 in the presence of 0 5 mm nb while it was markedly retarded and almost terminated when 0 4 mm ba was added meanwhile the addition of 250 mm meoh kso4 meoh meoh kso4 meoh meoh kso4 cbz cbz 99 9 also greatly inhibited cbz degradation fig s4 besides cbz atrazine caffeine and ibuprofen were also selected as the target compounds to evaluate the bq fe iii pms process these compounds are refractory to 1o2 oxidation zhu et al 2019 but can be degraded by so4 109 m 1 s 1 table s3 as shown in fig 2b atrazine caffeine and ibuprofen were completed degraded within 60 min however in the presence of 0 4 mm ba no significant degradation was observed for these trocs fig s5 further troc decay within the first 30 min was fitted with pseudo first order kinetic model ln troc t troc 0 k obst then the correlation of k obs and the rate constant of troc with so4 kso4 was plotted a good linear relationship r2 0 93 was observed between k obs and kso4 fig 2c again suggesting that so4 was mainly responsible for troc degradation additionally the formation of high valent iron species e g fe iv and fe v was not observed from the experimental results of the distinct transformation of methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 details in text s3 and fig s6 thus the above results provide solid evidence that bq fe iii pms process is a so4 dominated process it should be noted that hq fe iii pms process is also dominated by so4 because hq is quickly converted to bq in the system 1 min with details discussed below 3 3 the redox reactions of bq hq fe ii fe iii and the formation of so4 the concentrations of bq and hq were also tracked in the reaction system figs 3a 1 approximately 4 7 μm of hq existed in the bq solution 100 μm before the initiation of reactions in bq fe iii pms process bq concentration quickly decreased to 93 μm and hq concentration was not detectable after 1 min reaction the first sampling point with reaction time prolonging from 1 min to 60 min bq concentration slightly decreased to 87 μm this phenomenon was consistent with the cbz degradation in the initial 1 min and the following reaction period 1 60 min we also tracked the changes of hq bq concentrations as functions of reaction time in hq fe iii pms system the original 100 μm of hq 20 μm was oxidized to bq before pms added was barely detectable 1 5 μm after 1 min reaction the first sampling point and bq concentration simultaneously increased to 88 μm fig s7 note that in the hq fe iii process without the presence of pms the reduction of fe iii by hq proceeds through two one electron transfer steps via a semiquinone radical sq as intermediate eqs 3 4 duesteberg and waite 2007 bq was generated slowly to reach the peak concentration and the conversion percentage was low 10 jiang et al 2015 whereas in the presence of pms the depletion of hq and the formation of bq were much faster 1 min figs 3a 1 this is due to the faster transformation of hq by so4 eq 5 as the second order reaction rate constant for hq with so4 k 1 109 m 1s 1 anipsitakis et al 2006 was much faster than that with fe iii k 1 103 m 1s 1 eq 3 jiang et al 2015 on the other hand it is interesting to observe that only 13 of bq was degraded in bq fe iii pms process after 60 min reaction but theoretically bq should have a degradation percentage around 26 based on the second order rate constant of bq with so4 3 5 108 m 1s 1 al suhybani and hughes 1986 and the so4 level 2 03 10 13 m obtained from text s1 as such some reaction pathways to convert the bq oxidation products back to bq may be involved suggesting bq as an electron shuttle in the system more details were discussed in the next section image 2 image 3 image 4 the generation of fe ii was confirmed in the bq fe iii pms process figs 3a 2 fe ii concentration rapidly increased to 0 29 μm in 1 min and then maintained at this level during 15 min and then decreased gradually to 0 09 μm the fe ii concentration was lower than that in bq fe iii system with the absence of pms which was around 0 8 μm during the reaction period of 1 30 min fe ii is known to react with pms to generate so4 eq 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 which can lead to the cbz degradation when ferrozine was added to the solution as a quencher for fe ii the cbz degradation was greatly inhibited but still around 27 cbz was degraded after 60 min reaction this was mainly due to the bq activation of pms which also led to cbz degradation though in a less extent fig 1 when both ferrozine and ba were added as quenchers for fe ii and so4 ho respectively negligible degradation of cbz was observed the results indicated the important role of fe ii formation in generating so4 and accelerating cbz degradation oxygen was involved in both the fe iii fe ii and hq bq redox reaction cycles and its role in cbz degradation was thus evaluated cbz degradation in the solution purging with argon was faster than that in air saturated condition fig 3 b 3 after 15 min reaction 80 cbz was degraded in argon purged solution higher than 44 degradation with oxygen present bq also had a faster degradation at the initial first min and gradually decreased to 75 μm over time regarding to fe ii concentration in argon purged system it rapidly increased to 0 32 μm in 1 min and then gradually decreased to 0 16 μm after 60 min which was slightly higher than that with oxygen present thus it seemed that more fe ii could react with pms to generate so4 in argon purged solution which thus accelerated cbz degradation the inhibition of o2 can also be attributed to the formation of superoxide anion radicals ho2 which can quench so4 quickly eqs 6 7 in fact the role of ho2 in cbz degradation was examined by adding sod in the system with o2 present as shown in fig 3a 3 the degradation of cbz increased from 20 to 32 in the first 1 min which can be ascribed to sod catalyzes the disproportion of ho2 to h2o2 jiang et al 2015 image 5 7 h o 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 h 2 o 3 4 reaction mechanisms as mentioned above three reactive species 1o2 ho and so4 were observed in the bq fe iii pms system among which so4 was the dominant specie contributing to cbz degradation so4 was mainly generated from fe ii activation of pms eq 1 and the formation of fe ii was the rate limiting step fe ii was formed from the reduction of fe iii by multiple reductants e g hq and sq eqs 3 4 the concentration of so4 was much higher in the beginning stage of the reaction 1 min in bq fe iii pms system than the later stage 1 60 min due to the presence of trace amount hq which can rapidly reduce fe iii to fe ii bq is proposed to act as electron shuttle in the bq fe iii pms system along with cbz the residual bq can be oxidized by so4 the initial product of bq oxidation by so4 is benzoquinone oh adduct radical which then undergoes a very rapid possibly water assisted keto enol tautomerization to give a 2 4 dihydroxyphenoxyl radical dhpo eq 8 al suhybani and hughes 1986 nien schuchmann et al 1998 subsequently the 2 4 dihydroxyphenoxyl radical can be oxidized by another bq to produce 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone 2 oh bq and semiquinone radial sq eq 9 al suhybani and hughes 1986 sq can reduce fe iii to regenerate bq again eq 4 these reactions account for the lower rate of bq decay observed in section 3 3 image 6 image 7 therefore in bq fe iii pms system bq acts as an electron shuttle in transferring fe iii back to fe ii and fe ii activates pms to produce so4 in promoting the degradation of micropollutants e g cbz a reaction scheme is drawn and presented in scheme 1 3 5 pms enhanced coagulation process for cbz degradation in natural waters nom bearing phenolic and quinone moieties is ubiquitous in natural waters linkhorst et al 2017 in order to verify if nom can play a similar role as phenol quinone the degradation of cbz was tracked following a coagulation sedimentation process with fecl3 as the coagulant and with pms amended in natural waters fig 4 a displays the cbz abatement in pms oxidation alone fe iii coagulation alone and pms amended fe iii coagulation abbreviated as fe iii pms coagulation in beijiang sw1 and pearl river samples sw2 cbz can be barely removed by either fe iii coagulation or pms oxidation alone 10 in 120 min however when pms was concomitantly added with fe iii the degradation percentages of cbz reached 80 for beijiang water and 50 for pearl river water after coagulation sedimentation in 120 min moreover increasing pms concentration enhanced cbz degradation percentage in beijiang water fig 4b when pms increased from 0 2 to 1 mm the corresponding cbz degradation percentage increased from 15 to 81 after coagulation sedimentation in order to further highlight the important role of nom in iron redox transformation and in pms activation cbz was spiked to a solution containing srfa 1 5 mg l an allochthonous aquatic nom representative to perform the fe iii pms coagulation process as shown in fig 4c the cbz degradation increased rapidly in the solutions containing srfa fe iii and pms the degradation percentage of cbz was 94 within 120 min in 1 mgc l of srfa containing water and rapidly increased to 100 after 60 min as srfa increased to 2 5 mgc l further increasing srfa concentration from 2 5 mgc l to 5 mgc l could not lead to greater promotion on cbz degradation which might be due to the quenching effect of reactive species ho and so4 by srfa lutze et al 2015 xie et al 2015 again tba and methanol were respectively added to explore the role of so4 and ho results showed that 30 of cbz degradation was inhibited by tba while 60 was inhibited by methanol suggesting that both so4 and ho contributed to cbz degradation the more pronounced ho contribution in srfa solution than those of bq and hq systems may be due to the higher efficiency of ho formation from oxygenation of reduced srfa and subsequently mediated fenton reaction eqs 10 12 chen and pignatello 1997 jiang et al 2015 page et al 2012 10 s r f a r e d o 2 s r f a o x h o 2 11 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 8 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 12 h 2 o 2 f e i i o h h o f e i i i k 76 m 1 s 1 it should be noted that ph was not adjusted during the pms enhanced coagulation sedimentation process in fact the ph values deceased from 7 49 the original ph of beijiang water to 6 82 in fe iii coagulation process and to 6 02 in pms fe iii coagulation processes table s4 the decreases in ph were due to the acidity of pms wacławek et al 2017 the results indicated that the efficient pms activation can also be achieved in near neutral natural water on the one hand nom contains a wide range of redox active groups such as quinone hydroquinone moieties which can generate fe ii via redox reactions for pms activation daugherty et al 2017 thus the reactions to degrade cbz shared similarities as those in hq fe iii pms and bq fe iii pms systems on the other hand nom consists of an extended network in which some moieties e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can effectively complex with ferric irons to prevent their precipitation fujii et al 2014 which is one of the prerequisites for fe mediated pms activation these aspects are beneficial for pms activation undoubtedly nom also quenched so4 to reduce its levels lutze et al 2015 meanwhile the reactions produced a wide range of products which may also possibly activate pms to generate so4 it should be noted that the enhanced coagulation process had little impact on the turbidity removal after settling for 90 min the residual turbidity and dissolved fe in two surface water samples were both below the detection limits 1 ntu for turbidity and 0 03 mg l for dissolved fe also the concentrations of so4 2 were 216 mg l for beijiang water and 230 mg l for pearl river water which were lower than the standard for drinking water quality 250 mg l gb 5749 2006 note that the concentrations of trocs in source water are normally much lower than that used in this study 0 5 μm thus a smaller quantity of pms would be used to effectively degrade trocs the pms enhanced fe iii coagulation seems to be a promising process for trocs removal in water treatment especially for urgent water deterioration upgrading the conventional coagulation process to an aop mediated coagulation process can be effective to reduce the risks of trocs 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that peroxomonosulfate pms amended iron coagulation process can effectively degrade trocs including cbz due to so4 generation in the system the generation of fe ii was the rate limiting step for cbz degradation and fe ii activation of pms to generate so4 was the major mechanism leading to cbz degradation the fe iii fe ii redox cycle was driven by hq and bq transformation and bq served as the electron shuttle in the reaction system to accelerate the generation of fe ii and so4 nom in natural waters containing quinone hydroquinone moieties can also generate fe ii via redox reactions for pms activation the significant removal of cbz in natural waters following the full treatment chain of pms amended coagulation flocculation sedimentation proved the effectiveness of the proposed treatment method overall this study provides new insights into the pathway of pms activation and provides an efficient way to improve the common drinking water treatment process for trocs abatement as nom is a heterogeneous mixture and contains a wide range of redox active functional groups future studies

17623,conventional coagulation process is not effective to eliminate trace organic compounds trocs this study proposed a novel peroxomonosulfate pms amended iron coagulation process and found its effectiveness in eliminating trocs in synthetic and natural waters in synthetic waters containing hydroquinone hq or benzoquinone bq fe iii pms effectively degraded carbamazepine cbz a representative of resistant trocs the step of reduction of fe iii to form fe ii governed the degradation rate of cbz as pms activation by fe ii was the dominant reaction to generate so4 which was the major reactive oxidant in the system meanwhile hq was quickly transformed to bq in the fe iii pms system and bq acted as an electron shuttle to induce fe iii fe ii redox cycle and accelerate pms activation natural organic matter nom bearing phenolic and quinone moieties played similar roles as hq and bq and fast cbz degradation was also observed finally two surface waters spiked cbz were subjected to bench scale experimentation to simulate coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes in water treatment plants compared to the conventional iron coagulation process the pms amended iron coagulation process increased the removal percentage of cbz by 50 80 overall this study demonstrates that pms enhanced iron coagulation is a promising process for the abatement of trocs in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate pms coagulation trace organic compounds carbamazepine sulfate radical water treatment 1 introduction trace organic compounds trocs such as pharsmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs have been frequently detected in surface waters at ng μg l levels padhye et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation and filtration units were not very effective in removing trocs huerta fontela et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2005 chlorination can remove some trocs bearing phenolic amine and aniline groups huerta fontela et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2005 a variety group of trocs were thus still detected in the finished drinking water gaffney et al 2015 loraine and pettigrove 2006 considering that some of trocs have been linked to adverse health and ecological effects bruce et al 2010 liu et al 2020 improving the degradation efficiency of trocs in drinking water treatment processes is still urgently needed activated persulfate including peroxomonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds has been widely used to eliminate various trocs taking advantage of sulfate so4 or hydroxyl ho radicals ghanbari and moradi 2017 lee et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 among the activators used ferrous iron fe ii was commonly adopted parallel to the fenton reaction this process proceeds through one electron reduction of the o o bond to produce sulfate radical so4 eqs 1 and 2 kim et al 2018 zou et al 2013 however due to the limitation of slow transformation rate from the formed fe iii back to fe ii the degradation of contaminants was quickly inhibited and resulted in incomplete degradation to alleviate the drawbacks multiple antioxidants such as hydroxylamine and natural polyphenols have been proposed to assist the redox cycling of fe iii fe ii pan et al 2020 zou et al 2013 in addition to fe ii recent studies indicated that naturally occurring quinones can also activate persulfate for example 1 4 benzoquinone bq can effectively decompose pds to so4 for 2 4 4 trichlorobiphenyl pcb 28 degradation fang et al 2013 the activation of pms by bq however produced singlet oxygen 1o2 not so4 ahmad et al 2013 despite of many researches on pms pds activation by fe ii or phenols quinones the application of these processes in drinking water treatment is still questionable partially because the addition of fe ii or other activators may lead to secondary pollution or bring problems for the subsequent treatment steps e g disinfection

ferric sulfate are commonly used as coagulants to remove suspended solids ss and some natural organic matter nom matilainen et al 2010 vik and eikebrokk 1988 nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and contains numerous phenolic and quinone moieties aeschbacher et al 2012 cory and mcknight 2005 previous results show that the phenolic and quinone moieties are involved in the redox transformation of iron for example garg and coworkers found that hydroquinone and or semiquinone type species present in nom can reduce fe iii to fe ii in natural waters garg et al 2015 for benzoquinone although it cannot directly reduce fe iii it can undergo self redox cycling to produce semiquinone or hydroquinone to interact with fe iii song and buettner 2010 therefore we suspect that if pms is added to the coagulation process these redox active moieties phenols and quinones present in nom might assist in pms activation possible reactions include i activation of pms by benzoquinone or semiquinone moieties ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 2 activation of pms by fe ii formed from reduction of fe iii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 3 regeneration of fe ii via hydroquinone quinone redox reactions jiang et al 2015 an understanding of these reactions is thus important for the potential application of pms amended iron coagulation for trocs degradation as such the aim of this study is to verify whether fe iii quinone and fe iii hydroquinone interactions can be used to activate pms for troc degradation and whether the pms amended iron coagulation is feasible for trocs degradation for natural waters carbamazepine cbz was chosen as the target compound due to its prevalence in surface waters and resistance to common oxidants e g chlorine chlorine dioxide hydrogen peroxide and pms pds in some tests caffeine ibuprofen atrazine are also included as they are also known to be resistant by conventional water treatment processes benzoquinone bq and hydroquinone hq were used as representatives of oxidized and reduced quinones respectively because of their simple structures and well studied reactions with fe iii surface water samples were used for coagulation flocculation sedimentation treatment processes the results from this study are inspiring and provide a potential application of upgrading the traditional coagulation process to bear advanced oxidation functions

certain tests nb and ba were added as probe compounds to determine the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 respectively see details in text s1 in some tests nom was used to replace hq or bq varied concentrations of srfa 1 mgc l 2 5 mgc l and 5 mgc l were added to the fe iii pms process to mediate cbz degradation to further confirm the contribution of ho and so4 in cbz degradation in srfa fe iii pms process scavenging experiments were conducted by adding 10 mm meoh or tba the molar alcohol cbz ratio was 1000 1 to the reaction system all the degradation experiments were conducted in

μmol of cbz was spiked to 0 8 l source water then 6 ml of fe iii solution 26 7 mm and 2 ml of pms solution 0 4 mm were added simultaneously to the water samples and the rapid mixing step immediately started the final concentrations of cbz fe iii and pms in this process were 0 5 μm 0 2 mm and 1 mm respectively the mixing procedures were conducted as follows 1 min of rapid mixing at 200 rpm 30 min of flocculation at 30 rpm and 90 min of settling time control experiments with fe iii or pms alone were also conducted after reaction for 5 15 30 60 90 and 120 min 1 ml of supernatant was withdrawn

3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of cbz in bq fe iii pms and hq fe iii pms processes the degradation kinetics of cbz in different pms based oxidation processes are shown in fig 1 cbz can t be degraded by pms alone less than 8 cbz was degraded in hq pms and fe iii pms processes within 60 min about 20 cbz was degraded in bq fe iii process after 60 min however when bq was added to fe iii pms system the degradation of cbz was significantly accelerated and showed a two stage decay kinetics about 20 cbz was degraded in the initial 1 min the first sampling point after which the degradation proceeded moderately reaching 99 after 60 min in comparison the degradation of cbz was much faster in hq fe iii pms process i e almost all cbz was degraded within 8 min such faster degradation rate can be attributed to the high reactivity of hq toward fe iii 2 4 106 m 1 s 1 jiang et al 2015 which generates fe ii as shown in fig s1 pms activation by fe ii 50 μm was very effective to eliminate cbz and about 90 of cbz was degraded in 1 min afterwards the degradation of cbz almost stopped due to the limitation of fe iii transformation back to fe ii which is similar to the case in fenton reaction except bq and hq the effects of other substituted quinones were also examined the addition of chq cbq or mhq in fe iii pms system resulted in complete degradation of cbz after 8 min and 89 cbz was degraded in mbq amended fe iii pms system in the same period fig s2 the results suggest that quinone and or hydroquinone moieties can effectively mediate fe iii for pms activation and thus promote cbz degradation 3 2 identification the roles of reactive oxidants a series of experiments were conducted to further explore the roles of reactive species in bq fe iii pms systems by the use of probe compounds quenchers and epr spectroscopy methods self decomposition of pms or bq catalyzed pms activation was reported to generate 1o2 li et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 to verify the generation of 1o2 in bq fe iii pms process temp was used as the trapping agent in epr spectroscopy as shown in fig s3 a typical 3 fold characteristic peak of the temp 1o2 adduct α 16 9 g with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 sun et al 2019 was observed in solution containing pms alone primarily due to its self decomposition although higher tepm 1o2 signal was observed in bq fe iii pms process it should be noted that its intensity was similar as that in bq pms whereas the latter showed negligible cbz degradation fig 1 moreover the reactivity of 1o2 with cbz was low which was determined to be 2 57 105 m 1 s 1 in this study details in text s2 the results indicated that 1o2 played a negligible role in cbz degradation the epr results showed a typical dmpo so4 signal an 13 2 g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g and ah 0 78 g fang et al 2013 in quinone fe iii pms process fig 2 a indicating the generation of so4 in this process the peak intensity of dmpo so4 in bq fe iii pms process was slightly lower than that in hq fe iii pms which was consistent with the difference in cbz degradation observed in fig 1 the signal of dmpo oh an ah 14 9 g was too small to observe in bq fe iii pms and hq fe iii pms processes to further explore the role of so4 and ho in cbz degradation ba and nb were added as probe compounds as shown in table s3 ba reacted both with so4 k 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and ho k 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1977 and nb mainly reacted with ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but barely with so4 k 1 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 as shown in fig 2b insignificant amount of nb was degraded after 60 min reaction in the bq fe iii pms system whereas ba was degraded by 96 in the same period clearly so4 but not ho was the dominant specie in the bq fe iii pms system quenching experiments were also conducted by using ba nb and meoh in this study the addition of 0 4 mm ba would completely quench almost all the generated so4 kso4 ba ba kso4 ba ba kso4 cbz cbz 99 2 and ho kho ba ba kho ba ba kho cbz cbz 99 while 0 5 mm nb will only quench all the ho kho nb nb kho nb nb kho cbz cbz 99 1 as shown in fig s4 the degradation of cbz after 60 min was reduced by only 13 in the presence of 0 5 mm nb while it was markedly retarded and almost terminated when 0 4 mm ba was added meanwhile the addition of 250 mm meoh kso4 meoh meoh kso4 meoh meoh kso4 cbz cbz 99 9 also greatly inhibited cbz degradation fig s4 besides cbz atrazine caffeine and ibuprofen were also selected as the target compounds to evaluate the bq fe iii pms process these compounds are refractory to 1o2 oxidation zhu et al 2019 but can be degraded by so4 109 m 1 s 1 table s3 as shown in fig 2b atrazine caffeine and ibuprofen were completed degraded within 60 min however in the presence of 0 4 mm ba no significant degradation was observed for these trocs fig s5 further troc decay within the first 30 min was fitted with pseudo first order kinetic model ln troc t troc 0 k obst then the correlation of k obs and the rate constant of troc with so4 kso4 was plotted a good linear relationship r2 0 93 was observed between k obs and kso4 fig 2c again suggesting that so4 was mainly responsible for troc degradation additionally the formation of high valent iron species e g fe iv and fe v was not observed from the experimental results of the distinct transformation of methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 details in text s3 and fig s6 thus the above results provide solid evidence that bq fe iii pms process is a so4 dominated process it should be noted that hq fe iii pms process is also dominated by so4 because hq is quickly converted to bq in the system 1 min with details discussed below 3 3 the redox reactions of bq hq fe ii fe iii and the formation of so4 the concentrations of bq and hq were also tracked in the reaction system figs 3a 1 approximately 4 7 μm of hq existed in the bq solution 100 μm before the initiation of reactions in bq fe iii pms process bq concentration quickly decreased to 93 μm and hq concentration was not detectable after 1 min reaction the first sampling point with reaction time prolonging from 1 min to 60 min bq concentration slightly decreased to 87 μm this phenomenon was consistent with the cbz degradation in the initial 1 min and the following reaction period 1 60 min we also tracked the changes of hq bq concentrations as functions of reaction time in hq fe iii pms system the original 100 μm of hq 20 μm was oxidized to bq before pms added was barely detectable 1 5 μm after 1 min reaction the first sampling point and bq concentration simultaneously increased to 88 μm fig s7 note that in the hq fe iii process without the presence of pms the reduction of fe iii by hq proceeds through two one electron transfer steps via a semiquinone radical sq as intermediate eqs 3 4 duesteberg and waite 2007 bq was generated slowly to reach the peak concentration and the conversion percentage was low 10 jiang et al 2015 whereas in the presence of pms the depletion of hq and the formation of bq were much faster 1 min figs 3a 1 this is due to the faster transformation of hq by so4 eq 5 as the second order reaction rate constant for hq with so4 k 1 109 m 1s 1 anipsitakis et al 2006 was much faster than that with fe iii k 1 103 m 1s 1 eq 3 jiang et al 2015 on the other hand it is interesting to observe that only 13 of bq was degraded in bq fe iii pms process after 60 min reaction but theoretically bq should have a degradation percentage around 26 based on the second order rate constant of bq with so4 3 5 108 m 1s 1 al suhybani and hughes 1986 and the so4 level 2 03 10 13 m obtained from text s1 as such some reaction pathways to convert the bq oxidation products back to bq may be involved suggesting bq as an electron shuttle in the system more details were discussed in the next section image 2 image 3 image 4 the generation of fe ii was confirmed in the bq fe iii pms process figs 3a 2 fe ii concentration rapidly increased to 0 29 μm in 1 min and then maintained at this level during 15 min and then decreased gradually to 0 09 μm the fe ii concentration was lower than that in bq fe iii system with the absence of pms which was around 0 8 μm during the reaction period of 1 30 min fe ii is known to react with pms to generate so4 eq 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 which can lead to the cbz degradation when ferrozine was added to the solution as a quencher for fe ii the cbz degradation was greatly inhibited but still around 27 cbz was degraded after 60 min reaction this was mainly due to the bq activation of pms which also led to cbz degradation though in a less extent fig 1 when both ferrozine and ba were added as quenchers for fe ii and so4 ho respectively negligible degradation of cbz was observed the results indicated the important role of fe ii formation in generating so4 and accelerating cbz degradation oxygen was involved in both the fe iii fe ii and hq bq redox reaction cycles and its role in cbz degradation was thus evaluated cbz degradation in the solution purging with argon was faster than that in air saturated condition fig 3 b 3 after 15 min reaction 80 cbz was degraded in argon purged solution higher than 44 degradation with oxygen present bq also had a faster degradation at the initial first min and gradually decreased to 75 μm over time regarding to fe ii concentration in argon purged system it rapidly increased to 0 32 μm in 1 min and then gradually decreased to 0 16 μm after 60 min which was slightly higher than that with oxygen present thus it seemed that more fe ii could react with pms to generate so4 in argon purged solution which thus accelerated cbz degradation the inhibition of o2 can also be attributed to the formation of superoxide anion radicals ho2 which can quench so4 quickly eqs 6 7 in fact the role of ho2 in cbz degradation was examined by adding sod in the system with o2 present as shown in fig 3a 3 the degradation of cbz increased from 20 to 32 in the first 1 min which can be ascribed to sod catalyzes the disproportion of ho2 to h2o2 jiang et al 2015 image 5 7 h o 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 h 2 o 3 4 reaction mechanisms as mentioned above three reactive species 1o2 ho and so4 were observed in the bq fe iii pms system among which so4 was the dominant specie contributing to cbz degradation so4 was mainly generated from fe ii activation of pms eq 1 and the formation of fe ii was the rate limiting step fe ii was formed from the reduction of fe iii by multiple reductants e g hq and sq eqs 3 4 the concentration of so4 was much higher in the beginning stage of the reaction 1 min in bq fe iii pms system than the later stage 1 60 min due to the presence of trace amount hq which can rapidly reduce fe iii to fe ii bq is proposed to act as electron shuttle in the bq fe iii pms system along with cbz the residual bq can be oxidized by so4 the initial product of bq oxidation by so4 is benzoquinone oh adduct radical which then undergoes a very rapid possibly water assisted keto enol tautomerization to give a 2 4 dihydroxyphenoxyl radical dhpo eq 8 al suhybani and hughes 1986 nien schuchmann et al 1998 subsequently the 2 4 dihydroxyphenoxyl radical can be oxidized by another bq to produce 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone 2 oh bq and semiquinone radial sq eq 9 al suhybani and hughes 1986 sq can reduce fe iii to regenerate bq again eq 4 these reactions account for the lower rate of bq decay observed in section 3 3 image 6 image 7 therefore in bq fe iii pms system bq acts as an electron shuttle in transferring fe iii back to fe ii and fe ii activates pms to produce so4 in promoting the degradation of micropollutants e g cbz a reaction scheme is drawn and presented in scheme 1 3 5 pms enhanced coagulation process for cbz degradation in natural waters nom bearing phenolic and quinone moieties is ubiquitous in natural waters linkhorst et al 2017 in order to verify if nom can play a similar role as phenol quinone the degradation of cbz was tracked following a coagulation sedimentation process with fecl3 as the coagulant and with pms amended in natural waters fig 4 a displays the cbz abatement in pms oxidation alone fe iii coagulation alone and pms amended fe iii coagulation abbreviated as fe iii pms coagulation in beijiang sw1 and pearl river samples sw2 cbz can be barely removed by either fe iii coagulation or pms oxidation alone 10 in 120 min however when pms was concomitantly added with fe iii the degradation percentages of cbz reached 80 for beijiang water and 50 for pearl river water after coagulation sedimentation in 120 min moreover increasing pms concentration enhanced cbz degradation percentage in beijiang water fig 4b when pms increased from 0 2 to 1 mm the corresponding cbz degradation percentage increased from 15 to 81 after coagulation sedimentation in order to further highlight the important role of nom in iron redox transformation and in pms activation cbz was spiked to a solution containing srfa 1 5 mg l an allochthonous aquatic nom representative to perform the fe iii pms coagulation process as shown in fig 4c the cbz degradation increased rapidly in the solutions containing srfa fe iii and pms the degradation percentage of cbz was 94 within 120 min in 1 mgc l of srfa containing water and rapidly increased to 100 after 60 min as srfa increased to 2 5 mgc l further increasing srfa concentration from 2 5 mgc l to 5 mgc l could not lead to greater promotion on cbz degradation which might be due to the quenching effect of reactive species ho and so4 by srfa lutze et al 2015 xie et al 2015 again tba and methanol were respectively added to explore the role of so4 and ho results showed that 30 of cbz degradation was inhibited by tba while 60 was inhibited by methanol suggesting that both so4 and ho contributed to cbz degradation the more pronounced ho contribution in srfa solution than those of bq and hq systems may be due to the higher efficiency of ho formation from oxygenation of reduced srfa and subsequently mediated fenton reaction eqs 10 12 chen and pignatello 1997 jiang et al 2015 page et al 2012 10 s r f a r e d o 2 s r f a o x h o 2 11 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 8 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 12 h 2 o 2 f e i i o h h o f e i i i k 76 m 1 s 1 it should be noted that ph was not adjusted during the pms enhanced coagulation sedimentation process in fact the ph values deceased from 7 49 the original ph of beijiang water to 6 82 in fe iii coagulation process and to 6 02 in pms fe iii coagulation processes table s4 the decreases in ph were due to the acidity of pms wacławek et al 2017 the results indicated that the efficient pms activation can also be achieved in near neutral natural water on the one hand nom contains a wide range of redox active groups such as quinone hydroquinone moieties which can generate fe ii via redox reactions for pms activation daugherty et al 2017 thus the reactions to degrade cbz shared similarities as those in hq fe iii pms and bq fe iii pms systems on the other hand nom consists of an extended network in which some moieties e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can effectively complex with ferric irons to prevent their precipitation fujii et al 2014 which is one of the prerequisites for fe mediated pms activation these aspects are beneficial for pms activation undoubtedly nom also quenched so4 to reduce its levels lutze et al 2015 meanwhile the reactions produced a wide range of products which may also possibly activate pms to generate so4 it should be noted that the enhanced coagulation process had little impact on the turbidity removal after settling for 90 min the residual turbidity and dissolved fe in two surface water samples were both below the detection limits 1 ntu for turbidity and 0 03 mg l for dissolved fe also the concentrations of so4 2 were 216 mg l for beijiang water and 230 mg l for pearl river water which were lower than the standard for drinking water quality 250 mg l gb 5749 2006 note that the concentrations of trocs in source water are normally much lower than that used in this study 0 5 μm thus a smaller quantity of pms would be used to effectively degrade trocs the pms enhanced fe iii coagulation seems to be a promising process for trocs removal in water treatment especially for urgent water deterioration upgrading the conventional coagulation process to an aop mediated coagulation process can be effective to reduce the risks of trocs 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that peroxomonosulfate pms amended iron coagulation process can effectively degrade trocs including cbz due to so4 generation in the system the generation of fe ii was the rate limiting step for cbz degradation and fe ii activation of pms to generate so4 was the major mechanism leading to cbz degradation the fe iii fe ii redox cycle was driven by hq and bq transformation and bq served as the electron shuttle in the reaction system to accelerate the generation of fe ii and so4 nom in natural waters containing quinone hydroquinone moieties can also generate fe ii via redox reactions for pms activation the significant removal of cbz in natural waters following the full treatment chain of pms amended coagulation flocculation sedimentation proved the effectiveness of the proposed treatment method overall this study provides new insights into the pathway of pms activation and provides an efficient way to improve the common drinking water treatment process for trocs abatement as nom is a heterogeneous mixture and contains a wide range of redox active functional groups future studies

research institute nanyang technological university 637141 singapore corresponding author 1 rongrong sun and liang zhang contributed equally to this work elemental sulfur driven sulfidogenic process has been demonstrated to be more economical and energy efficient than sulfate driven sulfidogenic process when treating metal laden wastewater in previous studies we observed that the polysulfide involved indirect sulfur reduction ensured the superiority of sulfur over sulfate as the electron acceptor in the sulfidogenic process under neutral or weak alkaline conditions however realizing high rate sulfur reduction process for acid mine drainage amd treatment without ph amelioration is still a great challenge because polysulfide cannot exist under acidic conditions in this study a laboratory scale sulfur packed bed reactor was therefore continuously operated with a constant sulfate concentration 1300 mg s l and decreasing ph from 7 3 to 2 1 after 400 days of operation a stable sulfide production rate 38 2 7 6 mg s l was achieved under highly acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 which is significantly higher than those reported in sulfate reduction under similar conditions in the presence of high sulfate content elemental sulfur reduction could dominate over sulfate reduction under neutral and acidic conditions especially when the ph 6 5 or 3 5 the decreasing ph significantly reduced the diversity of microbial community but did not substantially influence the abundance of functional genes associated with organic and sulfur metabolisms the predominant sulfur reducing genera shifted from desulfomicrobium under neutral conditions to desulfurella under highly acidic conditions the high rate sulfur reduction under acidic conditions could be attributed to the combined results of high abundance of desulfurella and low abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria srb accordingly sulfur reduction process can be developed to achieve efficient and economical treatment of amd under highly acidic conditions ph 3 5 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metal laden wastewater treatment acid mine drainage sulfur bioavailability sulfur reduction sulfate reduction 1 introduction sulfate reduction process has been widely employed for treating acid mine drainage amd muyzer and stams 2008 zhang et al 2016 in the bioprocess sulfate reducing bacteria srb oxidize organics while generating sulfide which subsequently precipitate metals from wastewater via forming insoluble metal sulfides eqs 1 and 2 however the low organic content in amd greatly restricts the activity of srb indicating that additional carbon source is deemed necessary for achieving high rate and stable sulfate reduction processes neculita et al 2007 dosing additional carbon source would certainly increase the operational cost during amd treatment thereby likely becoming a key bottleneck for its wide application 1 c h 3 co o so 4 2 2 hco 3 h s 2 h s m e 2 m e s h 3 c h 3 co o 4 s 0 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h s 3 h sulfur reduction process mediated by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb is an attractive alternative for metal laden wastewater treatment qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 guo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as sulfur reduction can theoretically reduce organic consumption by 75 eqs 1 and 3 in comparison to sulfate reduction when producing the same amount of sulfide zhang et al 2018b in a laboratory scale test sun et al 2020 reported that sulfur reduction could reduce 26 79 of the chemical cost for sulfide production compared to sulfate reduction sulfur is a water insoluble chemical 5 µg l at 25 c boulegue 1978 but sulfur reduction can achieve similar or even higher sulfide production rate spr than sulfate reduction under neutral or alkaline conditions qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b despite sulfate has higher bioaccessibility than sulfur high strength sulfate in metal laden wastewater generally 1000 mg s l did not influence the achievement of high rate sulfur reduction under nearly neutral conditions sun et al 2018 it is because the involvement of polysulfide generated from the chemical reaction between sulfide and sulfur eq 4 boyd and druschel 2013 in which the polysulfide instead of sulfate is preferentially utilized by sulfur reducers therefore operating sulfur reduction systems under neutral conditions can efficiently remove metals from metal laden wastewaters regardless of sulfate presence 4 h s n 1 8 s 8 s n 2 h however to our knowledge it still remains unknown if sulfur reduction can dominate over sulfate reduction when treating amd without ph amelioration generally ph level in amd is lower than 6 0 under which polysulfide formation is almost completely prohibited florentino et al 2016b in this light the bioavailability of sulfur could substantially reduce under acidic conditions it may even not be viable to develop a sulfur reduction process for amd treatment owing to the very low spr moreover the presence of high sulfate content in amd may result in the competition between srb and s0rb the different responses of srb and s0rb to acidic conditions may significantly influence the system s performance and organic consumption and may finally lead to the failure of sulfur reduction process additionally under acidic conditions microbial communities still need to face big challenges to tolerate strong toxicities from protons organic acids e g acetic acid and formic acid and undissociated sulfide h2s sánchez andrea et al 2014 the optimal ph for the growth of most s0rb is between 5 and 9 florentino et al 2016b whereas amd could be highly acidic ph 4 sahinkaya and gungor 2010 hedrich and johnson 2014 sephton and webb 2019 it means that most of the known s0rb could not thrive under such extreme conditions likely resulting in the failure of the setup of sulfur reduction process the discovery of acidotolerant and acidophilic s0rb in extreme environments such as desulfurella sp thermoplasma spp acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and acidilobus sulfurireducens boyd et al 2007 florentino et al 2015 florentino et al 2016a florentino et al 2016b offers the possibility of directly treating amd without neutralization however no information on sulfur reduction under acidic conditions by these s0rb for engineering purposes has been previously reported this study aims to evaluate the long term feasibility and stability of a sulfur reducing process under sulfate rich and acidic conditions a laboratory scale sulfur packed bed reactor thereafter referred to as sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor was therefore setup and continuously operated for 400 days under high level sulfate condition with gradually decreasing ph from neutral to highly acidic to a investigate the long term feasibility of sulfidogenic reactor under varying acidic conditions b study the effects of both high level sulfate and low ph on microbial communities and their relationships using illumina miseq sequencing and c discuss the potential mechanisms pertinent to high rate sulfur reduction overall the findings of this study could extend the knowledge of sulfidogenic processes with electron acceptor competition at acidic environments and help to further apply this biotechnology for cost effective amd treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale sulfidogenic reactor setup and operation a sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor with a working volume of 1 08 l 45 diameter x 750 mm total height was fabricated with plexiglass sulfur lumps 99 99 purity 10 30 mesh damao chemical co china were loaded into the reactor with a packing ratio of 0 42 the sulfidogenic reactor was seeded with well cultivated sulfur reducing sludge collected from other sulfur reducing reactors in our lab which were continuously operated for approximately one year sun et al 2018 sun et al 2019 the sulfidogenic reactor was fed with organic solution the stock organic solution containing carbon source acetate glucose and yeast extract and trace elements was prepared as per jiang et al 2013 the bioreactor was also fed with synthetic pretreated amd during the stages from ii to ix details described below according to our previous study on the sulfur reduction based amd treatment system sun et al 2020 the sulfidogenic reactor was placed in the sidestream to minimize the effluent sulfide concentration and maintain the long term stability of system fig s1 in this light the heavy metals in the amd could be efficiently removed in the metal precipitators ahead of sulfidogenic reactor sun et al 2020 and the pretreated amd could only contain high content of sulfate as such the synthetic pretreated amd only containing approximately 1300 mg s l of sulfate was used in this study 2 2 chemical analysis the influent and effluent water samples of the sulfidogenic reactor were collected periodically and then filtered via disposable millipore filters 0 45 μm pore size these samples were then analyzed for various parameters sulfate thiosulfate total dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 toc and ph sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method as per the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate and thiosulfate were measured using an ion chromatograph dionex aquion ics 900 fremont ca usa with a conductivity detector and an ic as22 fast analytical column qiu et al 2020 toc was determined using with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a japan ph was measured with a ph meter hq40d hach sulfur in sludge samples was extracted as per mcguire and hamers 2000 and then was measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc shimadzu lc 16 japan equipped with a kromasil column c18 5 μ 100 å and a uv detector operating at 254 nm 2 3 dna extraction pcr illumina miseq sequencing and analysis sludge samples were collected from the sulfidogenic reactor on days 60 135 163 194 230 260 315 and 400 to investigate the effects of different low ph levels on functional groups using illumina miseq sequencing the total genomic dna was extracted with a fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer the 16s rrna was amplified with the 341f 806r primer pair to target the hypervariable v4 region of the bacteria kozich et al 2013 the illumina miseq sequencing service was provided by big shenzhen china the obtained paired end raw 16s rrna gene sequences were assembled and filtered in mothur v1 31 2 kozich et al 2013 the aligned sequences were checked for chimeras using usearch v7 0 1090 in qiime v4 2 40 and classified into operational taxonomic units otus with a 3 dissimilarity cutoff caporaso et al 2010 the upset venn plot was performed using upsetr r package conway et al 2017 to visualize the total number of otus in each sludge sample the shared and unique otus across the sludge samples a principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the unweighted unifrac distance matrix was performed to determine the beta diversity of the bacterial community lozupone et al 2011 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was conducted to predict microbial metabolic functions in the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor under different acidic conditions with the galaxy platform against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg orthology database langille et al 2013 the abundances of predicted functional genes kegg ortholog ko at l1 l2 and l3 levels were calculated 3 results 3 1 performance of sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor the bioreactor produced a high amount of sulfide with a constant hrt of 9 6 h although the influent ph level progressively decreased from 7 3 in stage i to 2 1 in stage ix fig 1 and table 1 in stage i days 1 60 in the absence of sulfate 347 8 128 9 mg s l of sulfide were produced with an average spr of 36 2 13 4 mg s l h indicating that sulfidogenic bacteria were highly enriched from stage ii approximately 1300 mg s l sulfate were continuously added into the bioreactor to simulate the pretreated amd and the effluent sulfide concentration increased to 604 3 140 1 mg s l with an average spr of 62 9 14 6 mg s l h with decreasing the influent ph from 7 3 to 4 5 the sprs declined from 62 9 14 6 mg s l h in stage ii days 61 135 to 15 4 7 2 mg s l h in stage v days 195 224 showing that the acidic condition severely suppressed the sulfidogenic activities fig 1a then in stage vi days 225 280 the influent toc concentration was doubled to approximately 500 mg l to stimulate the sulfidogenic activity in the subsequent stage vi the sulfide production soon recovered to 337 6 45 6 mg s l with an average spr of 35 2 4 8 mg s l then the influent toc concentration was decreased to the normal level during the following stages during stage vii days 281 339 to viii days 340 370 the average spr maintained at 38 2 7 6 mg s l with the ph decreasing from 3 5 to 2 6 finally under an extremely acidic condition ph 2 1 in stage ix days 371 400 the spr further dropped to 10 3 2 7 mg s l h the results indicate although varied acidic conditions significantly influenced sulfidogenic activity in the sulfidogenic reactor sulfidogenic bacteria could still maintain a relatively high activity even under a highly acidic condition ph 2 6 3 5 3 2 contribution of sulfate reducing and sulfur reducing bacteria to sulfide production as shown in fig 1a only 2 0 on average of the influent sulfate were reduced to sulfide in the 400 day lab scale test note that thiosulfate an intermediate of sulfate reduction was not detected in the effluent throughout the entire operational period the contribution of sulfur reduction to sulfide production in each stage was therefore derived and presented in fig 2 displaying that sulfide production was mainly attributed to sulfur reduction in all stages except for stage v ph 4 5 the c s ratios mg organic carbon consumed mg sulfide produced is another critical indicator to assess the sulfidogenic processes in the reactor as shown in fig 1c in all stages the c s ratios were similar 0 22 0 50 except for those in stage iv 0 79 on average and v 1 65 on average fig 1c considering that the theoretical c s ratios of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction are 0 19 and 0 75 hao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a respectively it can be concluded that sulfur reduction dominated the sulfidogenic process in the reactor under neutral conditions stage i ii and iiii with ph 7 3 6 5 and under highly acidic conditions stage vi vii vii and ix with ph 3 5 2 1 even under sulfate rich conditions it indicates that the organic consumption in sulfur reduction under acidic conditions is less than that in sulfate reduction when producing the same amount of sulfide thus sulfur reduction is still more competitive than sulfate reduction at acidic environments 3 3 microbial community diversity a total of 289 925 sequences 34 000 sequences of each type of sludge samples from 15 sludge samples were recovered from pyrosequencing after quality filtering and trimming the sequences ware assigned to 3045 otus in all the samples with a 97 sequence identity threshold the value of coverage above 0 99 suggested that the sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity of the microbial community in the sludge samples as demonstrated by the rarefaction curve shown in fig s2 fig 3 shows 58 otus were shared by at least fourteen samples in which the majority of otus were associated with the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes thermotogae and proteobacteria suggesting that these bacteria could tolerate or well adapt to the varying acidic environments except for the extremely acidic condition ph 2 1 under such condition only four otus shared by the fifteen sludge samples in which the phyla proteobacteria and thermotogae dominated more than 98 of the total abundance described below when ph was below 3 5 day 315 and 400 the numbers of otus and shannon index were significantly lower than those under high ph table 2 correspondingly the simpson index under such conditions was significantly higher than those under high ph accordingly the acidic conditions reduced microbial community diversity in the sulfidogenic reactor the three dimensional pcoa analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances and unweighted unifrac tree revealed that the microbial community presented a clear evolution trajectory response to an increasing acidic environment fig 4 and fig s3 indicating that acidic conditions apparently provided a selective pressure on microbial compositions in the sulfidogenic reactor 3 4 taxonomic diversity at phylum level bacteroidetes proteobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi spirochaetes synergistetes and thermotogae were the top seven under the varying ph conditions fig s4 which all have been frequently detected in sulfidogenic systems employed from amd and metal laden wastewater treatment except for thermotogae zhang et al 2016 sun et al 2018 vasquez et al 2018 the relative abundance of the phylum thermotogae was less than 0 05 within the first 230 days ph 3 5 however when the influent ph gradually dropped from 3 5 to 2 1 on day 400 ph 2 1 its relative abundance sharply increased to 76 1 becoming the most abundant phylum in the bioreactor the result reveals that the phylum thermotogae could thrive under extremely acidic conditions of these paludibacter trichococcus t78 and lactococcus were the main identified fermentative genera fig 5 the fermentative genera exhibited different responses to the varying ph briefly the relative abundance of paludibacter and lactococcus gradually increased from 3 4 and 0 5 on day 60 ph 7 3 to 21 5 and 6 7 on day 315 ph 3 5 respectively followed by a sharp decrease to undetected levels on day 400 ph 2 1 t78 abundance maintained stable with an average of 6 5 in the first 230 days ph 3 5 followed by a gradual decrease to an undetected level on day 400 the relative abundance of trichococcus gradually declined from 7 3 on day 60 to an undetected level on day 400 ph 2 1 the present results indicate these fermentative genera could tolerate different acidity it is worthwhile to note that there was a significant increase in relative abundance of operational taxonomy units affiliated with the order v5 within the phylum thermotogae 76 1 fig s5 most members of the phylum thermotogae have been identified to be heterotrophic fermentative bacteria fadhlaoui et al 2018 diverse sulfidogenic genera were also detected such as desulfurella desulfomicrobium clostridium desulfovibrio geobacter acidithiobacillus and sulfurospirillum florentino et al 2016b and their abundance varied differentially with decreasing ph under neutral conditions and in the absence of sulfate desulfomicrobium 7 7 clostridium 1 9 sulfurospirillum 0 6 geobacter 0 3 and desulfovibrio 0 4 were the dominant sulfidogenic genera the relative abundance of acidithiobacillus and desulfurella was all below 0 1 when sulfate was introduced into the bioreactor the relative abundance of desulfomicrobium clostridium and desulfovibrio was enriched to 12 0 4 2 and 1 4 respectively the relative abundance of geobacter acidithiobacillus and desulfurella maintained stable the sulfurospirillum abundance decreased to a very low level 0 02 with decreasing ph the relative abundance of acidithiobacillus increased to 3 7 on day 230 ph 3 5 followed by a gradual decline to 0 5 on day 400 ph 2 1 the relative abundance of desulfovibrio gradually increased to 1 9 on day 315 ph 3 5 and then decreased to an undetected level on day 400 ph 2 1 the relative abundance of sulfurospirillum always maintained at a very low level with dropping ph during the entire operational period the relative abundance of desulfomicrobium gradually decreased to an undetected level on day 315 ph 3 5 the relative abundance of clostridium gradually declined to 0 9 on day 400 ph 2 1 the relative of geobacter first increased to 2 4 on day 194 ph 5 5 followed by a gradual decline to an undetected level on day 315 ph 3 5 conversely the relative abundance of the relative abundance of desulfurella increased from very low levels 0 01 under neutral conditions to 40 0 on day 260 ph 3 5 and then maintained at 17 5 21 7 with ph decreasing from 3 5 to 2 1 the present results indicate that sulfur reducers exhibited different tolerance to different acidity 3 5 prediction of metabolic functions to investigate the effects of dynamic acidic conditions on metagenomic functions in particular sulfur metabolic functions in the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor picrust analysis based on kegg database was employed a total of 277 predicted functions were identified in all the samples the major metabolic functions were involved in metabolism 43 87 70 46 genetic information processing 15 95 24 47 environmental information processing 12 94 18 45 and cellular processes 3 45 8 00 fig 6 a carbohydrate and amino acid were the main pathways in the metabolism with stable relative abundance of 9 65 10 75 and 9 78 10 46 respectively during the long term operation fig 6a carbohydrate metabolism is associated with organic degradation and decomposition wei et al 2018 amino acid metabolism could provide carbon sources and energy that bacteria demand lópez gonzález et al 2015 the stable relative abundance of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism indicates that the decreasing ph from neutral to extremely acidic did not have a substantial influence on organic metabolism in the sulfidogenic reactor which is partially supported by the high abundance of fermentative bacteria membrane transport with relative abundance of 10 80 12 71 was the most dominant function in environmental information processing category membrane transport corresponds to cell growth as it could responsible for nutrient transportation between outside and inside cell of bacteria ye et al 2018 moreover the relative abundance of genes associated with cell motility gradually increased from 3 11 under neutral conditions to 5 00 at ph 2 1 suggesting the enhancement of microbial metabolism which is supported by the increase in the relative abundance of genes involved in energy metabolism increasing from 5 96 under neutral conditions to 8 12 at ph 2 1 it may be due to the substantial growth and high activity of acid tolerant desulfurella additionally the relative abundance of functional genes associated with sulfur conversion maintained stable with gradually decreasing ph from 7 3 day 60 to 2 1 day 315 except for a slight higher relative abundance at ph 3 5 and ph 2 1 the increased relative abundance of sulfur metabolism fig 6b may be ascribed to the combined results of a decrease in microbial diversity and an increase in sulfur reducer abundance table 2 and fig 5 which is consistent with the high rate sulfur reduction under varying acidic conditions 4 discussion 4 1 sulfur reduction under acidic and sulfate rich conditions in this study sulfur reduction was found to prevail in the bioreactor in two ph ranges under sulfate rich condition namely neutral ph 7 3 6 5 and highly acidic ph 3 5 2 1 under neutral conditions the sulfidogenic reactor achieved an average spr of 62 9 14 6 mg s l h in the presence of sulfate stage ii which was due to the polysulfide involved indirect sulfur reduction sun et al 2018 the presence of polysulfide can enhance the bioaccessibility of sulfur and then promote sulfur reduction sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b under neutral conditions the dominant sulfidogenic bacterium was found to be a facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium which means it can reduce both sulfur and sulfate to sulfide florentino et al 2016b it preferentially use sulfur rather than sulfate as the electron donors in the presence of sulfide under neutral conditions sun et al 2018 which could explain the negligible sulfate reduction under such conditions which is consistent with our previous study sun et al 2018 when ph 6 0 polysulfide could immediately decompose back to sulfide and sulfur florentino et al 2016b sun et al 2020 recently also observed that the sprs of sulfur reduction significantly decreased with decreasing ph and approached to zero at ph 4 0 in short term batch tests however we obtained a finding contradicted with sun et al 2020 in which our study for the first time demonstrated the long term feasibility of achieving high rate sulfur reduction under acidic conditions even at ph 2 6 3 5 the discrepancy could be explained by the different sulfidogenic bacteria between the neutral conditions and acidic conditions the activities of the dominant sulfidogenic bacteria at neutral environments could be prohibited when exposed to acidic conditions in a short term period in contrast when exposed to acidic conditions in a long term period an apparent evolution of sulfidogenic bacteria could take place to allow them to adapt well to the varying acidic environments under moderately acidic conditions 3 5 ph 6 0 although high sprs were achieved sulfate reduction contributed to a big fraction of or even dominated sulfide production resulting in the high c s ratios fig 3 it likely due to the fact that the predominated sulfidogenic genera was a facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium sun et al 2018 demonstrated that without polysulfide desulfomicrobium mainly reduced sulfate instead of sulfur in this light under moderately acidic conditions where polysulfide was absent desulfomicrobium could likely preferentially utilize sulfate instead of sulfur as the electron acceptors resulting in the high contribution of sulfate reduction to sulfide production under strongly acidic conditions ph 3 5 most of the known srb could not survive as they are neutrophilic sánchez andrea et al 2014 so we observed that the abundance of facultative srb desulfomicrobium and desulfovibrio decreased to a low level in this study under such conditions desulfurella replaced desulfomicrobium and became the most abundant sulfidogenic genus florentino et al 2015 isolated a species affiliated with the genus desulfurella d amilsii from acidic river sediments and this species can grow at ph as low as 3 0 sánchez andrea et al 2011 also observed that desulfurella spp predominated in a river sediment with constant acidic ph 2 3 kaksonen et al 2004 detected some sequences related to desulfurella in a lactate utilizing fluidized bed reactor operated at ph 4 0 sun et al 2019 also reported that desulfurella predominated in a sulfur reducing reactor operated at ph 4 3 these indicate that the identified desulfaurella spp are acidophilic and can be applied to treat amd without ph amelioration even under highly acidic conditions moreover desulfurella could not proceed sulfate reduction florentino et al 2016b thus the sulfur reduction rather than sulfate reduction dominated high rate sulfide production under such conditions could be a combined results of the high abundance of desulfurella and the decrease in srb abundance it should be noted that although the genus desulfurella could have the capacity of disproportionating sulfur to sulfate and sulfide florentino et al 2017 biological sulfur disproportionation could not occur in this reactor it may be explained by the fact that this reaction is endergonic under standard conditions finster 2008 and the high abundant sulfide prohibited its happening as stated above polysulfide cannot exist under highly acidic conditions florentino et al 2016b suggesting that the sulfur reduction pathway at such conditions may be different from that under neutral condition by reviewing literature direct and indirect electron transfer from sulfur reducers to sulfur may explain the sulfur reduction at acidic environments florentino et al 2016b florentino et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the physical attachment of microbes on sulfur particles to form biofilm is the prerequisite of direct electron transport demonstrated by sem shown in fig s6 the direct electron transfer has been demonstrated to be a crucial pathway for sulfate reducing and iron reducing bacteria reducing insoluble iron oxides lovley et al 2004 florentino et al 2016b as for the indirect electron transport sulfidogenic bacteria that did not grow on the surface of sulfur particles could also reduce sulfur to sulfide likely using extracellular redox mediators e g nanowires cysteine cytochromes flavins and quinones florentino et al 2016b as electron shuttles to transport electrons from the cells to sulfur particles it should be pointed out that the two putative pathways responsible for high rate sulfur reduction under acidic conditions need to be further experimentally demonstrated additionally the total relative abundance of fermentative genera paludibacter trichococcus t78 lactococcus and unidentified genera affiliated with phylum thermotogae drastically increased with decreasing ph fig 5 the high abundance of fermentative bacteria could provide high amount of simple organics via complex organic decomposition for the growth and respiration of the sulfidogenic bacteria under the harsh environments under the highly acidic conditions almost all the produced dissolved sulfide and the added acetate were present in forms of undissociated sulfide h2s pka 7 05 and acetic acid pka 4 76 respectively both h2s and acetic acid could severely inhibit the activities of microbiota including sulfidogenic bacteria s0rb and srb and fermenting bacteria kimura et al 2006 sánchez andrea et al 2014 sun et al 2019 the dominant sulfidogenic genus desulfurella in this study has been previously reported to harbor the genes encoding resistance to acidic conditions ph as low as 3 0 florentino et al 2016a florentino et al 2017 which could explain the high rate sulfide production even under highly acidic conditions moreover the formed biofilm grown on sulfur particles sem analysis shown in fig s6 could protect the microbes against the toxicity from the undissociated h2s 4 2 environmental implications during sulfate reduction process for amd treatment alkali addition is usually needed to raise the ph to weak acidity or neutral to achieve stable and efficient sulfide production for subsequent metal removal tabak and govind 2003 tabak et al 2003 hedrich and johnson 2014 chen et al 2016 in this study we achieved high rate sulfur reduction at acidic environments even under highly acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 revealing no or a little amount of alkali is required thereby reducing the operational cost which has a competitive advantage over sulfate reduction as shown in table 3 the sprs in sulfur reduction are significantly higher than those in sulfate reduction under the similar acidic conditions kaksonen et al 2003 wang et al 2008 sahinkaya 2009 sahinkaya and gungor 2010 villa gomez et al 2015 costa et al 2017 liu et al 2018 it should be noted that most of the previously studied sulfate reducing reactors were operated under moderately acidic conditions ph 4 0 and only very few operated at a very low ph 2 0 4 0 kaksonen et al 2003 sahinkaya and gungor 2010 moreover their hrts are much higher than that in this study 16 48 h vs 9 6 h importantly the spr at ph as low as 3 5 is still comparable to those of sulfate reduction under neutral or weak alkaline conditions 6 5 9 0 see table s1 but still this process for amd treatment without ph amelioration should be further investigated to demonstrate its feasibility in pilot scale or full scale applications and to optimize the operational conditions to maximize sulfide production in addition the equipment corrosion caused by sulfide should be considered but the successful demonstration of a large scale sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani system in hong kong indicates that corrosion issues could be avoided if necessary counter measures are taken wu et al 2016 sulfur reduction operated under acidic conditions requires lower reagent alkali costs as various metal ions e g fe3 cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 can efficiently precipitated as metal sulfides at ph 4 0 sahinkaya et al 2011 hedrich and johnson 2014 it should be noted that under acidic conditions the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor operated may not be able to effectively remove aluminum al3 and manganese mn2 as the water solubilities of aluminum and manganese sulfides 2 10 7 and 2 5 10 13 2 5 10 10 mol l are higher than those of aluminum and manganese hydroxides 1 3 10 33 and 1 9 10 13 mol l dean 1999 further controlled measure such as ph amelioration achieved by adding alkaline solution e g sodium hydroxide would selectively allow aluminum and manganese to be precipitated hedrich and johnson 2014 additionally elemental sulfur commonly co exists with sulfate in groundwater aquifer sediments and soils li et al 2008 knöller and schubert 2010 flynn et al 2014 when organics are present the activity of sulfidogenic bacteria result in sulfide production which could be underestimated as sulfur reduction was not considered previously given that sulfur reduction instead of sulfate reduction prevails under either neutral or highly acidic conditions higher sulfide production than expected could generate in the presence of organics the higher sulfide production could accelerate nitrate removal from contaminated groundwater aquifers soares 2000 in addition groundwater aquifers sediments and soils are sometimes contaminated with heavy metals santos et al 2005 hashim et al 2011 the produced sulfide could help to remove those metals via direct immobilization e g cu2 pb2 and fe2 or reduction followed by immobilization thus in addition to sulfate reduction sulfur reduction should also be taken into account when remediating contaminated groundwater aquifers sediments and soils 5 conclusions the long term feasibility of sulfur reduction process for amd treatment under varying acidic conditions especially at highly acidic environment was demonstrated via a laboratory scale sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor the main findings are shown as following the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor achieved high performance in the presence of high sulfate content under both neutral conditions ph 6 5 7 3 and highly acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 with high sprs 38 7 62 9 mg s l h and 34 8 36 8 mg s l h respectively which was mainly attributed to sulfur reduction the suppression of sulfate reduction under highly acidic conditions was a result of the decrease in srb abundance the facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium was the most abundant sulfideogenic bacteria under both neutral condition ph 6 5 7 3 and moderately acidic conditions 3 5 ph 6 0 but behaved differently under neutral conditions the genus used sulfur as the preferable electron acceptor over sulfate conversely it preferentially used sulfate as the electron acceptor under the moderately acidic conditions when the ph decreased to 3 5 the dominated sulfidogenic bacteria shifted to desulfurella resulting in the dominance of sulfur reduction taken together the sulfur reduction process can be explored for economically treating amd at highly acidic environment ph 3 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

has been demonstrated to be more economical and energy efficient than sulfate driven sulfidogenic process when treating metal laden wastewater in previous studies we observed that the polysulfide involved indirect sulfur reduction ensured the superiority of sulfur over sulfate as the electron acceptor in the sulfidogenic process under neutral or weak alkaline conditions however realizing high rate sulfur reduction process for acid mine drainage amd treatment without ph amelioration is still a great challenge because polysulfide cannot exist under acidic conditions in this study a laboratory scale sulfur packed bed reactor was therefore continuously operated with a constant sulfate concentration 1300 mg s l and decreasing ph from 7 3 to 2 1 after 400 days of operation a stable sulfide production rate 38 2 7 6 mg s l was achieved under highly acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 which is significantly higher than those reported in sulfate reduction under similar conditions in the presence of high sulfate content elemental sulfur reduction could dominate over sulfate reduction under neutral and acidic conditions especially when the ph 6 5 or 3 5 the decreasing ph significantly reduced the diversity of microbial community but did not substantially influence the abundance of functional genes associated with organic and sulfur metabolisms the predominant sulfur reducing genera shifted from desulfomicrobium under neutral conditions to desulfurella under highly acidic conditions the high rate sulfur reduction under acidic conditions could be attributed to the combined results of high abundance of desulfurella and low abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria srb accordingly sulfur reduction process can be developed to achieve efficient and economical treatment of amd under highly acidic conditions ph 3 5 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metal laden wastewater treatment acid mine drainage sulfur bioavailability sulfur reduction sulfate reduction 1 introduction sulfate reduction process has been widely employed for treating acid mine drainage amd muyzer and stams 2008 zhang et al 2016 in the bioprocess sulfate reducing bacteria srb oxidize organics while generating sulfide which subsequently precipitate metals from wastewater via forming insoluble metal sulfides eqs 1 and 2 however the low organic content in amd greatly restricts the activity of srb indicating that additional carbon source is deemed necessary for achieving high rate and stable sulfate reduction processes neculita et al 2007 dosing additional carbon source would certainly increase the operational cost during amd treatment thereby likely becoming a key bottleneck for its wide application 1 c h 3 co o so 4 2 2 hco 3 h s 2 h s m e 2 m e s h 3 c h 3 co o 4 s 0 2

2019 wang et al 2019 as sulfur reduction can theoretically reduce organic consumption by 75 eqs 1 and 3 in comparison to sulfate reduction when producing the same amount of sulfide zhang et al 2018b in a laboratory scale test sun et al 2020 reported that sulfur reduction could reduce 26 79 of the chemical cost for sulfide production compared to sulfate reduction sulfur is a water insoluble chemical 5 µg l at 25 c boulegue 1978 but sulfur reduction can achieve similar or even higher sulfide production rate spr than sulfate reduction under neutral or alkaline conditions qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b despite sulfate has higher bioaccessibility than sulfur high strength sulfate in metal laden wastewater generally 1000 mg s l did not influence the achievement of high rate sulfur reduction under nearly neutral conditions sun et al 2018 it is because the involvement of polysulfide generated from the chemical reaction between sulfide and sulfur eq 4 boyd and druschel 2013 in which the polysulfide instead of sulfate is preferentially utilized by sulfur reducers therefore operating sulfur reduction systems under neutral conditions can efficiently remove metals from metal laden wastewaters regardless of sulfate presence 4 h s n 1 8 s 8 s n 2 h however to our knowledge it still remains unknown if sulfur reduction can dominate over sulfate reduction when treating amd without ph amelioration generally ph level in amd is lower than 6 0 under which polysulfide formation is almost completely prohibited florentino et al 2016b in this light the bioavailability of sulfur could substantially reduce under acidic conditions it may even not be viable to develop a sulfur reduction process for amd treatment owing to the very low spr moreover the presence of high sulfate content in amd may result in the competition between srb and s0rb the different responses of srb and s0rb to acidic conditions may significantly influence the system s performance and organic consumption and may finally lead to the failure of sulfur reduction process additionally under acidic conditions microbial communities still need to face big challenges to tolerate strong toxicities from protons organic acids e g acetic acid and formic acid and undissociated sulfide h2s sánchez andrea et al 2014 the optimal ph for the growth of most s0rb is between 5 and 9 florentino et al 2016b whereas amd could be highly acidic ph 4 sahinkaya and gungor 2010 hedrich and johnson 2014 sephton and webb 2019 it means that most of the known s0rb could not thrive under such extreme conditions likely resulting in the failure of the setup of sulfur reduction process the discovery of acidotolerant and acidophilic s0rb in extreme environments such as desulfurella sp thermoplasma spp acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and acidilobus sulfurireducens boyd et al 2007 florentino et al 2015 florentino et al 2016a florentino et al 2016b offers the possibility of directly treating amd without neutralization however no information on sulfur reduction under acidic conditions by these s0rb for engineering purposes has been previously reported this study aims to evaluate the long term feasibility and stability of a sulfur reducing process under sulfate rich and acidic conditions a laboratory scale sulfur packed bed reactor thereafter referred to as sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor was therefore setup and continuously operated for 400 days under high level sulfate condition with gradually decreasing ph from neutral to highly acidic to a investigate the long term feasibility of sulfidogenic reactor under varying acidic conditions b study the effects of both high level sulfate and low ph on microbial communities and their relationships using illumina miseq sequencing and c discuss the potential mechanisms pertinent to high rate sulfur reduction overall the findings of this study could extend the knowledge of sulfidogenic processes with electron acceptor competition at acidic environments and help to further apply this biotechnology for cost effective amd treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale sulfidogenic reactor setup and operation a sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor with a working volume of 1 08 l 45 diameter x 750 mm total height was fabricated with plexiglass sulfur lumps 99 99 purity 10 30 mesh damao chemical co china were loaded into the reactor with a packing ratio of 0 42 the sulfidogenic reactor was seeded with well cultivated sulfur reducing sludge collected from other sulfur reducing reactors in our lab which were continuously operated for approximately one year sun et al 2018 sun et al 2019 the sulfidogenic reactor was fed with organic solution the stock organic solution containing carbon source acetate glucose and yeast extract and trace elements was prepared as per jiang et al 2013 the bioreactor was also fed with synthetic pretreated amd during the stages from ii to ix details described below according to our previous study on the sulfur reduction based amd treatment system sun et al 2020 the sulfidogenic reactor was placed in the sidestream to minimize the effluent sulfide concentration and maintain the long term stability of system fig s1 in this light the heavy metals in the amd could be efficiently removed in the metal precipitators ahead of sulfidogenic reactor sun et al 2020 and the pretreated amd could only contain high content of sulfate as such the synthetic pretreated amd only containing approximately 1300 mg s l of sulfate was used in this study 2 2 chemical analysis the influent and effluent water samples of the sulfidogenic reactor were collected periodically and then filtered via disposable millipore filters 0 45 μm pore size these samples were then analyzed for various parameters sulfate thiosulfate total dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 toc and ph sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method as per the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate and

illumina miseq sequencing the total genomic dna was extracted with a fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer the 16s rrna was amplified with the 341f 806r primer pair to target the hypervariable v4 region of the bacteria kozich et al 2013 the illumina miseq sequencing service was provided by big shenzhen china the obtained paired end raw 16s rrna gene sequences were assembled and filtered in mothur v1 31 2 kozich et al 2013 the aligned sequences were checked for chimeras using usearch v7 0 1090 in qiime v4 2 40 and classified into operational taxonomic units otus with a 3 dissimilarity cutoff caporaso et al 2010 the upset venn plot was performed using upsetr r package conway et al 2017 to visualize the total number of otus in each sludge sample the shared and unique otus across the sludge samples a principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the unweighted unifrac distance matrix was performed to determine the beta diversity of the bacterial community lozupone et al 2011 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was conducted to predict microbial metabolic functions in the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor under different acidic conditions with the galaxy platform against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg orthology database langille et al 2013 the abundances of predicted functional genes kegg ortholog ko at l1 l2 and l3 levels were calculated 3 results 3 1 performance of sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor the bioreactor produced a high amount of sulfide with a constant hrt of 9 6 h although the influent ph level progressively decreased from 7 3 in stage i to 2 1 in stage ix fig 1 and table 1 in stage i days 1 60 in the absence of sulfate 347 8 128 9 mg s l of sulfide were produced with an average spr of 36 2 13 4 mg s l h indicating that sulfidogenic bacteria were highly enriched from stage ii approximately 1300 mg s l sulfate were continuously added into the bioreactor to simulate the pretreated amd and the effluent sulfide concentration increased to 604 3 140 1 mg s l with an average spr of 62 9 14 6 mg s l h with decreasing the influent ph from 7 3 to 4 5 the sprs declined from 62 9 14 6 mg s l h in stage ii days 61 135 to 15 4 7 2 mg s l h in stage v days 195 224 showing that the acidic condition severely suppressed the sulfidogenic activities fig 1a then in stage vi days 225 280 the influent toc concentration was doubled to approximately 500 mg l to stimulate the sulfidogenic activity in the subsequent stage vi the sulfide production soon recovered to 337 6 45 6 mg s l with an average spr of 35 2 4 8 mg s l then the influent toc concentration was decreased to the normal level during the following stages during stage vii days 281 339 to viii days 340 370 the average spr maintained at 38 2 7 6 mg s l with the ph decreasing from 3 5 to 2 6 finally under an extremely acidic condition ph 2 1 in stage ix days 371 400 the spr further dropped to 10 3 2 7 mg s l h the results indicate although varied acidic conditions significantly influenced sulfidogenic activity in the sulfidogenic reactor sulfidogenic bacteria could still maintain a relatively high activity even under a highly acidic condition ph 2 6 3 5 3 2 contribution of sulfate reducing and sulfur reducing bacteria to sulfide production as shown in fig 1a only 2 0 on average of the influent sulfate were reduced to sulfide in the 400 day lab scale test note that thiosulfate an intermediate of sulfate reduction was not detected in the effluent throughout the entire operational period the contribution of sulfur reduction to sulfide production in each stage was therefore derived and presented in fig 2 displaying that sulfide production was mainly attributed to sulfur reduction in all stages except for stage v ph 4 5 the c s ratios mg organic carbon consumed mg sulfide produced is another critical indicator to assess the sulfidogenic processes in the reactor as shown in fig 1c in all stages the c s ratios were similar 0 22 0 50 except for those in stage iv 0 79 on average and v 1 65 on average fig 1c considering that the theoretical c s ratios of sulfate reduction and sulfur reduction are 0 19 and 0 75 hao et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a respectively it can be concluded that sulfur reduction dominated the sulfidogenic process in the reactor under neutral conditions stage i ii and iiii with ph 7 3 6 5 and under highly acidic conditions stage vi vii vii and ix with ph 3 5 2 1 even under sulfate rich conditions it indicates that the organic consumption in sulfur reduction under acidic conditions is less than that in sulfate reduction when producing the same amount of sulfide thus sulfur reduction is still more competitive than sulfate reduction at acidic environments 3 3 microbial community diversity a total of 289 925 sequences 34 000 sequences of each type of sludge samples from 15 sludge samples were recovered from pyrosequencing after quality filtering and trimming the sequences ware assigned to 3045 otus in all the samples with a 97 sequence identity threshold the value of coverage above 0 99 suggested that the sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity of the microbial community in the sludge samples as demonstrated by the rarefaction curve shown in fig s2 fig 3 shows 58 otus were shared by at least fourteen samples in which the majority of otus were associated with the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes thermotogae and proteobacteria suggesting that these bacteria could tolerate or well adapt to the varying acidic environments except for the extremely acidic condition ph 2 1 under such condition only four otus shared by the fifteen sludge samples in which the phyla proteobacteria and thermotogae dominated more than 98 of the total abundance described below when ph was below 3 5 day 315 and 400 the numbers of otus and shannon index were significantly lower than those under high ph table 2 correspondingly the simpson index under such conditions was significantly higher than those under high ph accordingly the acidic conditions reduced microbial community diversity in the sulfidogenic reactor the three dimensional pcoa analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances and unweighted unifrac tree revealed that the microbial community presented a clear evolution trajectory response to an increasing acidic environment fig 4 and fig s3 indicating that acidic conditions apparently provided a selective pressure on microbial compositions in the sulfidogenic reactor 3 4 taxonomic diversity at phylum level bacteroidetes proteobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi spirochaetes synergistetes and thermotogae were the top seven under the varying ph conditions fig s4 which all have been frequently detected in sulfidogenic systems employed from amd and metal laden wastewater treatment except for thermotogae zhang et al 2016 sun et al 2018 vasquez et al 2018 the relative abundance of the phylum thermotogae was less than 0 05 within the first 230 days ph 3 5 however when the influent ph gradually dropped from 3 5 to 2 1 on day 400 ph 2 1 its relative abundance sharply increased to 76 1 becoming the most abundant phylum in the bioreactor the result reveals that the phylum thermotogae could thrive under extremely acidic conditions of these paludibacter trichococcus t78 and lactococcus were the main identified fermentative genera fig 5 the fermentative genera exhibited different responses to the varying ph briefly the relative abundance of paludibacter and lactococcus gradually increased from 3 4 and 0 5 on day 60 ph 7 3 to 21 5 and 6 7 on day 315 ph 3 5 respectively followed by a sharp decrease to undetected levels on day 400 ph 2 1 t78 abundance maintained stable with an average of 6 5 in the first 230 days ph 3 5 followed by a gradual decrease to an undetected level on day 400 the relative abundance of trichococcus gradually declined from 7 3 on day 60 to an undetected level on day 400 ph 2 1 the present results indicate these fermentative genera could tolerate different acidity it is worthwhile to note that there was a significant increase in relative abundance of operational taxonomy units affiliated with the order v5 within the phylum thermotogae 76 1 fig s5 most members of the phylum thermotogae have been identified to be heterotrophic fermentative bacteria fadhlaoui et al 2018 diverse sulfidogenic genera were also detected such as desulfurella desulfomicrobium clostridium desulfovibrio geobacter acidithiobacillus and sulfurospirillum florentino et al 2016b and their abundance varied differentially with decreasing ph under neutral conditions and in the absence of sulfate desulfomicrobium 7 7 clostridium 1 9 sulfurospirillum 0 6 geobacter 0 3 and desulfovibrio 0 4 were the dominant sulfidogenic genera the relative abundance of acidithiobacillus and desulfurella was all below 0 1 when sulfate was introduced into the bioreactor the relative abundance of desulfomicrobium clostridium and desulfovibrio was enriched to 12 0 4 2 and 1 4 respectively the relative abundance of geobacter acidithiobacillus and desulfurella maintained stable the sulfurospirillum abundance decreased to a very low level 0 02 with decreasing ph the relative abundance of acidithiobacillus increased to 3 7 on day 230 ph 3 5 followed by a gradual decline to 0 5 on day 400 ph 2 1 the relative abundance of desulfovibrio gradually increased to 1 9 on day 315 ph 3 5 and then decreased to an undetected level on day 400 ph 2 1 the relative abundance of sulfurospirillum always maintained at a very low level with dropping ph during the entire operational period the relative abundance of desulfomicrobium gradually decreased to an undetected level on day 315 ph 3 5 the relative abundance of clostridium gradually declined to 0 9 on day 400 ph 2 1 the relative of geobacter first increased to 2 4 on day 194 ph 5 5 followed by a gradual decline to an undetected level on day 315 ph 3 5 conversely the relative abundance of the relative abundance of desulfurella increased from very low levels 0 01 under neutral conditions to 40 0 on day 260 ph 3 5 and then maintained at 17 5 21 7 with ph decreasing from 3 5 to 2 1 the present results indicate that sulfur reducers exhibited different tolerance to different acidity 3 5 prediction of metabolic functions to investigate the effects of dynamic acidic conditions on metagenomic functions in particular sulfur metabolic functions in the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor picrust analysis based on kegg database was employed a total of 277 predicted functions were identified in all the samples the major metabolic functions were involved in metabolism 43 87 70 46 genetic information processing 15 95 24 47 environmental information processing 12 94 18 45 and cellular processes 3 45 8 00 fig 6 a carbohydrate and amino acid were the main pathways in the metabolism with stable relative abundance of 9 65 10 75 and 9 78 10 46 respectively during the long term operation fig 6a carbohydrate metabolism is associated with organic degradation and decomposition wei et al 2018 amino acid metabolism could provide carbon sources and energy that bacteria demand lópez gonzález et al 2015 the stable relative abundance of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism indicates that the decreasing ph from neutral to extremely acidic did not have a substantial influence on organic metabolism in the sulfidogenic reactor which is partially supported by the high abundance of fermentative bacteria membrane transport with relative abundance of 10 80 12 71 was the most dominant function in environmental information processing category membrane transport corresponds to cell growth as it could responsible for nutrient transportation between outside and inside cell of bacteria ye et al 2018 moreover the relative abundance of genes associated with cell motility gradually increased from 3 11 under neutral conditions to 5 00 at ph 2 1 suggesting the enhancement of microbial metabolism which is supported by the increase in the relative abundance of genes involved in energy metabolism increasing from 5 96 under neutral conditions to 8 12 at ph 2 1 it may be due to the substantial growth and high activity of acid tolerant desulfurella additionally the relative abundance of functional genes associated with sulfur conversion maintained stable with gradually decreasing ph from 7 3 day 60 to 2 1 day 315 except for a slight higher relative abundance at ph 3 5 and ph 2 1 the increased relative abundance of sulfur metabolism fig 6b may be ascribed to the combined results of a decrease in microbial diversity and an increase in sulfur reducer abundance table 2 and fig 5 which is consistent with the high rate sulfur reduction under varying acidic conditions 4 discussion 4 1 sulfur reduction under acidic and sulfate rich conditions in this study sulfur reduction was found to prevail in the bioreactor in two ph ranges under sulfate rich condition namely neutral ph 7 3 6 5 and highly acidic ph 3 5 2 1 under neutral conditions the sulfidogenic reactor achieved an average spr of 62 9 14 6 mg s l h in the presence of sulfate stage ii which was due to the polysulfide involved indirect sulfur reduction sun et al 2018 the presence of polysulfide can enhance the bioaccessibility of sulfur and then promote sulfur reduction sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b under neutral conditions the dominant sulfidogenic bacterium was found to be a facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium which means it can reduce both sulfur and sulfate to sulfide florentino et al 2016b it preferentially use sulfur rather than sulfate as the electron donors in the presence of sulfide under neutral conditions sun et al 2018 which could explain the negligible sulfate reduction under such conditions which is consistent with our previous study sun et al 2018 when ph 6 0 polysulfide could immediately decompose back to sulfide and sulfur florentino et al 2016b sun et al 2020 recently also observed that the sprs of sulfur reduction significantly decreased with decreasing ph and approached to zero at ph 4 0 in short term batch tests however we obtained a finding contradicted with sun et al 2020 in which our study for the first time demonstrated the long term feasibility of achieving high rate sulfur reduction under acidic conditions even at ph 2 6 3 5 the discrepancy could be explained by the different sulfidogenic bacteria between the neutral conditions and acidic conditions the activities of the dominant sulfidogenic bacteria at neutral environments could be prohibited when exposed to acidic conditions in a short term period in contrast when exposed to acidic conditions in a long term period an apparent evolution of sulfidogenic bacteria could take place to allow them to adapt well to the varying acidic environments under moderately acidic conditions 3 5 ph 6 0 although high sprs were achieved sulfate reduction contributed to a big fraction of or even dominated sulfide production resulting in the high c s ratios fig 3 it likely due to the fact that the predominated sulfidogenic genera was a facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium sun et al 2018 demonstrated that without polysulfide desulfomicrobium mainly reduced sulfate instead of sulfur in this light under moderately acidic conditions where polysulfide was absent desulfomicrobium could likely preferentially utilize sulfate instead of sulfur as the electron acceptors resulting in the high contribution of sulfate reduction to sulfide production under strongly acidic conditions ph 3 5 most of the known srb could not survive as they are neutrophilic sánchez andrea et al 2014 so we observed that the abundance of facultative srb desulfomicrobium and desulfovibrio decreased to a low level in this study under such conditions desulfurella replaced desulfomicrobium and became the most abundant sulfidogenic genus florentino et al 2015 isolated a species affiliated with the genus desulfurella d amilsii from acidic river sediments and this species can grow at ph as low as 3 0 sánchez andrea et al 2011 also observed that desulfurella spp predominated in a river sediment with constant acidic ph 2 3 kaksonen et al 2004 detected some sequences related to desulfurella in a lactate utilizing fluidized bed reactor operated at ph 4 0 sun et al 2019 also reported that desulfurella predominated in a sulfur reducing reactor operated at ph 4 3 these indicate that the identified desulfaurella spp are acidophilic and can be applied to treat amd without ph amelioration even under highly acidic conditions moreover desulfurella could not proceed sulfate reduction florentino et al 2016b thus the sulfur reduction rather than sulfate reduction dominated high rate sulfide production under such conditions could be a combined results of the high abundance of desulfurella and the decrease in srb abundance it should be noted that although the genus desulfurella could have the capacity of disproportionating sulfur to sulfate and sulfide florentino et al 2017 biological sulfur disproportionation could not occur in this reactor it may be explained by the fact that this reaction is endergonic under standard conditions finster 2008 and the high abundant sulfide prohibited its happening as stated above polysulfide cannot exist under highly acidic conditions florentino et al 2016b suggesting that the sulfur reduction pathway at such conditions may be different from that under neutral condition by reviewing literature direct and indirect electron transfer from sulfur reducers to sulfur may explain the sulfur reduction at acidic environments florentino et al 2016b florentino et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the physical attachment of microbes on sulfur particles to form biofilm is the prerequisite of direct electron transport demonstrated by sem shown in fig s6 the direct electron transfer has been demonstrated to be a crucial pathway for sulfate reducing and iron reducing bacteria reducing insoluble iron oxides lovley et al 2004 florentino et al 2016b as for the indirect electron transport sulfidogenic bacteria that did not grow on the surface of sulfur particles could also reduce sulfur to sulfide likely using extracellular redox mediators e g nanowires cysteine cytochromes flavins and quinones florentino et al 2016b as electron shuttles to transport electrons from the cells to sulfur particles it should be pointed out that the two putative pathways responsible for high rate sulfur reduction under acidic conditions need to be further experimentally demonstrated additionally the total relative abundance of fermentative genera paludibacter trichococcus t78 lactococcus and unidentified genera affiliated with phylum thermotogae drastically increased with decreasing ph fig 5 the high abundance of fermentative bacteria could provide high amount of simple organics via complex organic decomposition for the growth and respiration of the sulfidogenic bacteria under the harsh environments under the highly acidic conditions almost all the produced dissolved sulfide and the added acetate were present in forms of undissociated sulfide h2s pka 7 05 and acetic acid pka 4 76 respectively both h2s and acetic acid could severely inhibit the activities of microbiota including sulfidogenic bacteria s0rb and srb and fermenting bacteria kimura et al 2006 sánchez andrea et al 2014 sun et al 2019 the dominant sulfidogenic genus desulfurella in this study has been previously reported to harbor the genes encoding resistance to acidic conditions ph as low as 3 0 florentino et al 2016a florentino et al 2017 which could explain the high rate sulfide production even under highly acidic conditions moreover the formed biofilm grown on sulfur particles sem analysis shown in fig s6 could protect the microbes against the toxicity from the undissociated h2s 4 2 environmental implications during sulfate reduction process for amd treatment alkali addition is usually needed to raise the ph to weak acidity or neutral to achieve stable and efficient sulfide production for subsequent metal removal tabak and govind 2003 tabak et al 2003 hedrich and johnson 2014 chen et al 2016 in this study we achieved high rate sulfur reduction at acidic environments even under highly acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 revealing no or a little amount of alkali is required thereby reducing the operational cost which has a competitive advantage over sulfate reduction as shown in table 3 the sprs in sulfur reduction are significantly higher than those in sulfate reduction under the similar acidic conditions kaksonen et al 2003 wang et al 2008 sahinkaya 2009 sahinkaya and gungor 2010 villa gomez et al 2015 costa et al 2017 liu et al 2018 it should be noted that most of the previously studied sulfate reducing reactors were operated under moderately acidic conditions ph 4 0 and only very few operated at a very low ph 2 0 4 0 kaksonen et al 2003 sahinkaya and gungor 2010 moreover their hrts are much higher than that in this study 16 48 h vs 9 6 h importantly the spr at ph as low as 3 5 is still comparable to those of sulfate reduction under neutral or weak alkaline conditions 6 5 9 0 see table s1 but still this process for amd treatment without ph amelioration should be further investigated to demonstrate its feasibility in pilot scale or full scale applications and to optimize the operational conditions to maximize sulfide production in addition the equipment corrosion caused by sulfide should be considered but the successful demonstration of a large scale sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani system in hong kong indicates that corrosion issues could be avoided if necessary counter measures are taken wu et al 2016 sulfur reduction operated under acidic conditions requires lower reagent alkali costs as various metal ions e g fe3 cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 can efficiently precipitated as metal sulfides at ph 4 0 sahinkaya et al 2011 hedrich and johnson 2014 it should be noted that under acidic conditions the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor operated may not be able to effectively remove aluminum al3 and manganese mn2 as the water solubilities of aluminum and manganese sulfides 2 10 7 and 2 5 10 13 2 5 10 10 mol l are higher than those of aluminum and manganese hydroxides 1 3 10 33 and 1 9 10 13 mol l dean 1999 further controlled measure such as ph amelioration achieved by adding alkaline solution e g sodium hydroxide would selectively allow aluminum and manganese to be precipitated hedrich and johnson 2014 additionally elemental sulfur commonly co exists with sulfate in groundwater aquifer sediments and soils li et al 2008 knöller and schubert 2010 flynn et al 2014 when organics are present the activity of sulfidogenic bacteria result in sulfide production which could be underestimated as sulfur reduction was not considered previously given that sulfur reduction instead of sulfate reduction prevails under either neutral or highly acidic conditions higher sulfide production than expected could generate in the presence of organics the higher sulfide production could accelerate nitrate removal from contaminated groundwater aquifers soares 2000 in addition groundwater aquifers sediments and soils are sometimes contaminated with heavy metals santos et al 2005 hashim et al 2011 the produced sulfide could help to remove those metals via direct immobilization e g cu2 pb2 and fe2 or reduction followed by immobilization thus in addition to sulfate reduction sulfur reduction should also be taken into account when remediating contaminated groundwater aquifers sediments and soils 5 conclusions the long term feasibility of sulfur reduction process for amd treatment under varying acidic conditions especially at highly acidic environment was demonstrated via a laboratory scale sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor the main findings are shown as following the sulfur reducing sulfidogenic reactor achieved high performance in the presence of high sulfate content under both neutral conditions ph 6 5 7 3 and highly acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 with high sprs 38 7 62 9 mg s l h and 34 8 36 8 mg s l h respectively which was mainly attributed to sulfur reduction the suppression of sulfate reduction under highly acidic conditions was a result of the decrease in srb abundance the facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium was the most abundant sulfideogenic bacteria under both neutral condition ph 6 5 7 3 and moderately acidic conditions 3 5 ph 6 0 but behaved differently under neutral conditions the genus used sulfur as the preferable electron acceptor over sulfate conversely it preferentially used sulfate as the electron acceptor under the moderately acidic conditions when the ph decreased to 3 5 the dominated sulfidogenic bacteria shifted to desulfurella resulting in the dominance of sulfur reduction taken together the sulfur reduction process can be explored for economically treating amd at highly acidic environment ph 3 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
