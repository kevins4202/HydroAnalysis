6670,based on the principles underlying the calculation of the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this study selects precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and runoff data to develop a multi scalar drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration runoff index speri using methods such as penman monteith and copula this index is applied along with the spi and spei to yunnan province of china the results show that the changes in the speri are close to those in the spi and spei they are well correlated and can all reflect drought conditions in addition comparisons among these three drought indexes and the actual extreme drought during september 2009 august 2010 showed that the speri was superior to the spi and spei and that the 3 month speri assessment was the most accurate therefore the speri can be used to analyze assess and forecast drought conditions in different areas as well as to assess the impacts of climate change on drought keywords speri spei spi copula function 1 introduction droughts are among the main natural hazards leading to agricultural economic and environmental damage burton et al 1978 wilhite and glantz 1985 global economic losses due to droughts are estimated to be as high as 600 800 million dollars per year which are much greater than those due to other meteorological disasters wilhite 2000 therefore it is necessary to conduct drought monitoring and assessment globally or in each area in order to determine drought intensity magnitude duration and spatial extent and to provide a basis for fighting drought and drought relief therefore it is necessary to select or develop an index to describe drought because droughts in each area of the globe differ significantly various industrial departments in each region and country have proposed numerous different drought indexes more than 58 types of drought indexes from different countries are listed in the technical report of the world meteorological organization wmo wmo 1975 2016 in addition the bulletin of the american meteorological society bams published a special issue in 2002 to discuss drought indexes heim 2002 redmond 2002 keyantash and dracup 2002 svoboda et al 2002 lawrimore et al 2002 among the many drought indexes the most widely used are the palmer drought severity index pdsi based on the soil moisture balance equation palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi based on a precipitation probabilistic approach mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei based on the water balance deficit or surplus probabilistic method vicente serrano et al 2010a the pdsi is a milestone in the development of drought indexes and is based on the demand in the water balance equation to analyze the dry negative and wet positive changes in semi arid and semi wet areas heim 2002 vicente serrano et al 2010a numerous scholars have by now explained the calculation process of the pdsi and its meanings karl 1983 1986 alley 1984 although the pdsi is widely used it also suffers drawbacks hayes 2000 keyantash and dracup 2002 alley 1984 karl 1986 soulé 1992 akinremi et al 1996 weber and nkemdirim 1998 vicente serrano et al 2010a some of the drawbacks can be solved by developing the self calibrated pdsi wells et al 2004 but the main drawback of the pdsi remains unsolved that drawback is related to its fixed temporal scale 9 12 months and auto regression characteristics which are subject to the values of the past four years guttman 1998 the spi is the quantile of the standard normal distribution transformed from the precipitation distribution function therefore it can be used to compare dry and wet conditions in different areas in addition it can be used to calculate dry and wet conditions at different temporal scales e g 1 3 6 12 18 and 24 months thus the spi has been widely used in dry and wet analyses in different areas because the spi is calculated based on precipitation data it does not consider other variables that affect drought such as temperature and evapotranspiration in addition this index is based on two assumptions 1 the change in precipitation is much larger than those in other variables such as temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet and 2 other variables are stable and do not have temporal trends vicente serrano et al 2010a b c therefore spi is mainly used in areas with great precipitation impacts the spei is based on the difference between precipitation p and pet water balance and is calculated using the spi method vicente serrano et al 2010a b 2011a b 2012a provided the comprehensive theory and calculation details of this index since proposed in 2010 the index has been widely used in different research areas beguería et al 2014 including investigations of drought changes drought reconstructions climate changes and the impacts of drought on hydrology agriculture and ecosystems potop 2011 li et al 2012 paulo et al 2012 sohn et al 2013 allen et al 2011 boroneant and ionita 2011 wolf and abatzoglou 2011 abiodun et al 2013 soo jin et al 2013 yu et al 2013 lorenzo

balance it does not sufficiently consider the impact of runoff on drought for multi year averages and closed watersheds precipitation minus evapotranspiration is equal to runoff however for drought people generally care about drought in a certain area primarily unclosed watersheds in specific periods unmulti year averages thus it is necessary to consider the impact of runoff on drought therefore based on the advantages of the pdsi spi and spei the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration on drought and multi scalar effects this study develops a new index that considers the runoff effect the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration runoff index speri based on the calculation principle of the spi and spei this index first calculates p pet then uses a two dimensional copula function to calculate the joint distribution function of p pet and runoff and lastly returns the quantile of the standard normal distribution the speri considers the integrated impacts of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff on drought p pet denotes the usable amount of precipitation after deducting potential evapotranspiration a positive value denotes a surplus and a negative value denotes a deficit whether the area experiences drought depends on the analysis of runoff for example precipitation in a certain region in some periods is small with very large pet but a river flows through the region because of upstream snow melt or water reservoir discharges drought due to meteorological elements precipitation and evaporation would be buffered by hydrological elements runoff this is because when a drought occurs river water can be used to fight it therefore it is necessary to develop a drought index considering runoff this will provide a basis for relevant departments to develop plans for fighting drought and drought relief 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data this article chose yunnan province in china fig 1 as an example to calculate analyze and evaluate speri located in the southwestern part of china yunnan province is mainly affected by the plateau monsoon climate which makes most of the areas characterized by warm in winter and cool in summer in addition due to the control and influence of different atmospheric circulations the precipitation is unevenly distributed in spatial and the dry and wet seasons are obvious in temporal in order to calculate speri this article selected the monthly precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and runoff data of 9 stations in yunnan province fig 1 the above data came from the yunnan meteorological bureau and hydrological bureau and this article also selected the extreme drought grades during september 2009 august 2010 provided by the yunnan flood control and drought relief office to assess the accuracy of speri 2 2 methods this study first calculates pet in each period using the penman monteith pm formula according to meteorological data then uses the copula function to calculation the joint distribution function of p pet and runoff and finally transforms the probability of the joint distribution function into the quantile of the standard normal distribution function which is speri 2 2 1 potential evapotranspiration the spei uses the thornthwaite method to calculate pet this method is simple and only requires small types of data however relevant studies have shown that the global drying trend of the past 60 years is overestimated hulme 1996 ipcc 2007 sheffield et al 2012 which is caused by use of the thornthwaite empirical formula to calculate pet so that pet is overestimated sheffield et al 2012 therefore this study uses the pm method allen et al 1998 recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations to calculate pet this method is more complicated and requires more data but with more accurate results the speri uses a month as the calculation duration selects data that include temperature relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed and calculates the pet of each station in each month and year using the eto calculator published by fao 2 2 2 p pet and runoff according to the monthly precipitation for each year and pet calculated above their differences are 1 d i j p i j p e t i j where p i j denotes precipitation of the ith year and jth month and pe t i j denotes the potential evapotranspiration of the ith year and jth month according to eq 1 the total amount of each different temporal scale x i j k k denotes the temporal scale is calculated using the same method as for spi and spei 2 d l d i j l i i 0 12 j 3 x l k l k 1 l d l 4 x i j k x l k i i 0 int l 1 12 j mod l 1 12 1 where l is the order number i 0 is the initial year int l 1 12 represents the integer part of l 1 12 and mod l 1 12 represents the modulo of l 1 12 the method used to calculate the total runoff amount of each different temporal scale is the same as that for p pet 2 2 3 the joint distribution function of p pet and runoff because univariate frequency analyses cannot completely solve the problems encountered in actual work multivariate frequency analyses are drawing increased attention early multivariate frequency analyses primarily employed the following methods 1 multivariate normal distributions correia 1987 sackl and bergmann 1987 goel et al 1988 yue 2000a bonaccorso et al 2015 2 joint distributions consisting of specific margin distributions bacchi et al 1994 yue 2000b 2001 and 3 non parametric methods silverman 1986 lau and bosworth 1994 all the above methods suffer problems for example assuming or transforming original data to a normal distribution is complicated and easily distorted and different hydrological variables may obey different distribution types in addition the margin distribution types of the joint distribution constructed using non parametric methods are unknown guo et al 2008 to address the above problems many scholars have applied the copula function theory and method to multivariable hydrological analyses and calculations shiau 2006 serinaldi et al 2009 song and singh 2010 chen et al 2015 xu et al 2015 bezak et al 2016 chang et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2016 balistrocchi and bacchi 2017 zhang et al 2017 lei et al 2017 therefore the speri uses the copula function for calculations the details are as follows sklar 1959 proved that the margin distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n of the joint distribution function h x 1 x 2 x n with multiple random variables x 1 x 2 x n are continuous and only one copula function c then satisfies the following equation 5 h x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n the joint distribution function consists of two parts the margin distribution and the correlation structure that can be described by the copula function overall the construction of the copula function includes the following steps 1 determine the margin distribution of each variable 2 determine the parameters of the copula function 3 select the copula function according to the assessment index and build a joint distribution and 4 conduct the corresponding statistical analysis according to the established distribution guo et al 2008 because the speri is based on two variables p pet and runoff the calculation process of the 2 dimensional copula function will be discussed below 2 2 3 1 margin distribution the probability density functions of runoff x and p pet y are fitted separately to obtain the corresponding distribution functions f x and f y because runoff and p pet differ around the globe this study does not recommend a specific type of margin distribution function 2 2 3 2 correlation coefficient at present the most widely used correlation indexes for hydrological variables are the pearson linear correlation coefficient and the kendall rank correlation coefficient nelsen 2006 the kendall rank correlation coefficient can describe the nonlinear correlation between variables as well as the linear correlation between variables guo et al 2008 it is defined as 6 τ c n 2 1 i j s i g n x i x j y i y j i j 1 2 n where x i y i are the sample data and sign is the sign function 2 2 3 3 copula function generally the copula function can be divided into three types elliptic archimedean and quadratic nelsen 2006 described in detail the widely used archimedean copula functions and their properties therefore speri only selects the following few commonly used two dimensional archimedean copula functions in hydrology and relevant fields 1 gumbel hougaard gh copula function the structures of the gh copula function and the gumbel logistic model yue 2001 are the same 7a c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ θ 1 where u v denote the margin distribution functions u f x and v f y respectively and they have the same meanings in later equations θ denotes a parameter of the gh copula function and it has the same meanings in later equations its relationship with the kendall rank correlation coefficient is 8a τ 1 1 θ 2 clayton copula function the equation of the clayton copula function is 7b c u v u θ v θ 1 1 θ θ 0 the relationship between θ and τ is 8b τ θ 2 θ 3 frank copula function the frank copula equation is 7c c u v 1 θ ln 1 e θ u 1 e θ v 1 e θ 1 θ r the relationship between θ and τ is 8c τ 1 4 θ 1 θ 0 θ t exp t 1 d t 1 2 2 3 4 joint probability according to the margin distributions of the two variables and the joint probability of the two dimension copula function obtained by eqs 7a 8c the equation is 9 p x x y y c x y where x and y are a pair of measured values for r and p pet 2 2 3 5 assessment and testing of the goodness of fit of the copula function which copula function should be chosen under the condition with measured data the type of copula function that best fits the data is chosen 1 assessment of the goodness of fit of the copula function the assessment index of goodness of fit is an important criterion for selecting the distribution type here this article use ordinary least squares ols to assess the goodness of fit of different copula functions the equation is 10 ols 1 n i 1 n p e i p i 2 where p e i and p i denote the empirical and theoretical frequencies respectively fit improves with smaller ols 2 testing the goodness of fit of the copula function to validate whether the selected copula function is able to describe the correlation structure among the variables it is necessary to validate the fit of the copula function this study selects the kolmogorov smirnov k s test to assess the fitness degree between the joint distribution and joint observations the statistic d is calculated as 11 d max p e i p i the bivariate empirical frequency can be derived using the theoretical basis of the univariate empirical frequency gringorten 1963 cunnane 1978 for which the mathematical expression is 12 p x x y y m 1 i l 1 j n ml 0 44 n 0 12 where n denotes the number of data and n ml is the order number of x x i y y i 2 2 4 calculation of the speri the speri is obtained by transforming the above calculated verified joint distribution probability to a standard normal distribution the approximate equation is 13 speri w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value and p 1 c if p 0 5 then p is replaced by p 1 p and the sign of the resultant speri is reversed the constants are c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 3 results the speri was calculated in yunnan province first this article selected monthly precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and runoff data from the 9 stations fig 1 in yunnan province and then used the above calculation method to obtain the speri the purpose of this study is to propose a drought index therefore the calculation temporal scales are 1 3 6 12 months and the calculation methods for the other temporal scales are similar 3 1 fitting probability density function first this article calculated p pet pet is based on the pm calculation method and runoff in the different temporal scales and then fit their probability density functions because p pet and runoff do not know what to follow the distributions this article selected dozens of distribution functions and used the method of maximum likelihood estimation to estimate parameters of the different distribution functions the calculation method is given in chen 1996 according to the above steps this article finally selected the log logistic distribution cumulative distribution function cdf f x 1 β x γ α 1 where α β and γ are cdf parameters for the p pet and lognormal distribution cdf f x φ ln x γ μ σ where φ is the laplace integral and μ σ and γ are cdf parameters for runoff figs 2 9 show the empirical probability theoretical probability p p plot which is nearly a line this suggests that the distribution function is able to fit p pet and runoff data of different temporal scales very well the parameters of the distribution functions are provided in table 1 3 2 joint distribution function first according to eqs 6 and 8a 8c this article calculated the kendall rank correlation coefficient and the parameters of the copula function table 2 calculated the values of the three types of copula functions according to eqs 7a 7c and finally selected the most suitable copula function table 3 according to the assessment and testing of the three copula functions using eqs 10 12 table 3 shows that the frank copula function was selected for the temporal scale of 1 12 months and that the clayton copula function was selected for the temporal scale of 3 6 months most of the k s testing values of these two functions are smaller than the thresholds thus the assumed testing is satisfied therefore for this example the frank and clayton copula distribution functions were selected for the temporal scales of 1 12 months and 3 6 months respectively the p p plots are shown in figs 10 13 3 3 calculation of the speri this article used eq 13 to transform the above calculated copula joint distribution probability into the quantile of the standard normal distribution which is the speri as shown in figs 14 17 3 4 comparison of the speri to the spi and spei this article used two methods to assess the speri one was to calculate the spi and spei using precipitation and p pet and a comparison of the three indexes as figs 18 21 and the other was to use data for the extreme drought during september 2009 august 2010 in yunnan province to validate the accuracy of the speri figs 18 21 show that the changes in the speri were similar to those in the spi and spei table 4 in addition table 4 shows that the speri was well correlated to the spi and spei the correlation between the spei and speri was the best followed by the correlation between the spi and spei suggesting that speri is used to describe drought conditions additionally most of the spei values exceed the spi and speri values suggesting that drought intensity may be smaller than the actual drought intensity after consideration of pet and most of the speri values are smaller than the spi and spei values drought intensity may be greater than the actual drought intensity due to the consideration of not only p pet difference but also the impact of runoff on drought as for fighting drought and drought relief people prefer forecasted drought intensities greater than the actual intensities under most conditions which is more favorable for making plans to fight drought and for drought relief therefore it is feasible to use speri analysis assessments to forecast droughts in addition this article used the extreme drought grades during september 2009 august 2010 provided by the yunnan flood control and drought relief office to assess the accuracy of the three drought indexes first according to the china national standard grades of meteorological drought gb t 20481 2017 general administration of quality supervision 2017 the values of the spi spei and speri were divided into five grades because the calculation principles of the speri are similar to those of the spi and spei the speri uses the same grade standard as the spi and spei as shown in table 5 and then compared the grades of the three drought indexes of the 9 stations at temporal scales of 1 3 6 12 months with the provided actual drought grades as shown in fig 22 fig 22 shows that for the total of 108 counts 12 months 9 stations the number of absolute accurate assessments absolute accurate assessment the calculated drought grade completely matches the actual drought grade of spi1 spi3 spi6 spi12 spei1 spei3 spei6 spei12 speri1 speri3 speri6 and speri12were 41 49 52 27 43 48 48 26 45 55 46 and 14 respectively the number of relative accurate assessments relative accurate assessment the calculated index and reality show drought concurrently but the calculated drought grade is higher or lower than the actual drought grade was 22 31 29 44 31 39 30 42 40 35 33 and 52 respectively and the number of wrong assessments wrong assessment the calculated indexes indicate drought but no actual drought occurs or an actual drought occurs whereas the calculated indexes do not suggest drought was 45 28 27 37 34 21 30 40 23 18 29 and 42 respectively overall the assessment with a temporal scale of 3 months was more accurate than the other temporal scales in addition regardless of whether an absolute accurate assessment or relative accurate assessment the speri was superior to the other two drought indexes the speri with a temporal scale of 3 months was also able to identify the drought very well as shown in table 6 4 discussion and conclusions according to precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and runoff data this study uses methods that include pm and copula and the calculation principles of the spi and spei to propose a multi scalar drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration runoff index speri this article applied the index to yunnan province and compared it with the widely used spi and spei the results show that the speri is superior to the spi and spei although for multi year averages and closed watersheds precipitation minus evapotranspiration is equal to runoff what people care about is the analysis assessment and forecasting of drought conditions of a specific area in a certain period therefore the consideration of the two variables of p pet and runoff in this index is reasonable that is except for meteorological factors the speri also considers the impact of hydrological factors on drought therefore the speri can be considered as a hydrological drought index or a simple drought disaster index when a drought disaster occurs river water can be fetched to relieve the drought similar to the spei the speri is capable of describing the drought conditions of different areas and assessing the impacts of climate change on drought because the conditions of different areas are not always the same different from other drought indexes that specify a certain probability distribution the bivariate distribution of the speri does not specify any probability distribution rather it selects the distribution with the best fitting results similarly the joint distribution probability can be calculated with other copula functions whereas it needs to pass assessments and tests of goodness of fit when applying the three indexes to yunnan province this article found that the changes in the speri were similar to those in the spi and spei and were well correlated across the indexes this suggests that the speri can also reflect regional drought conditions in addition the comparison between the three drought index grades and the actual grades of the extreme drought during september 2009 august 2010 shows that the speri is superior to the spi and spei and that the speri assessment at a temporal scale of 3 months was the most accurate figs 18 21 show that the spei was overestimated whereas the speri value was underestimated suggesting that the drought intensity assessed by the spei may be smaller than the actual drought intensity and that assessed by the speri may be greater than the actual intensity this conclusion is consistent with table 7 under conditions for which there is no accurate forecast people prefer a forecasted drought grade higher than the actual drought grade which is favorable for making plans for drought prevention and relief in summary the speri method is reasonable and enhances the accuracy of drought assessments to some extent in addition we have also developed automatic calculation software for multi temporal scalar executable speri please contact the first author or the corresponding author if necessary acknowledgements this study was supported by the science and technology project of yunnan province 2014fd022 we greatly appreciate suggestions from anonymous referees

evapotranspiration of the ith year and jth month according to eq 1 the total amount of each different temporal scale x i j k k denotes the temporal scale is calculated using the same method as for spi and spei 2 d l d i j l i i 0 12 j 3 x l k l k 1 l d l 4 x i j k x l k i i 0 int l 1 12 j mod l 1 12 1 where l is the order number i 0 is the initial year int l 1 12 represents the integer part of l 1 12 and mod l 1 12 represents the modulo of l 1 12 the method used to calculate the total runoff amount of each different temporal scale is the same as that for p pet 2 2 3 the joint distribution function of p pet and runoff because univariate frequency analyses cannot completely solve the problems encountered in actual work multivariate frequency analyses are drawing increased attention early multivariate frequency analyses primarily employed the following methods 1 multivariate normal distributions correia 1987 sackl and bergmann 1987 goel et al 1988 yue 2000a bonaccorso et al 2015 2 joint distributions consisting of specific margin distributions bacchi et al 1994 yue 2000b 2001 and 3 non parametric methods silverman 1986 lau and bosworth 1994 all the above methods suffer problems for example assuming or transforming original data to a normal distribution is complicated and easily distorted and different hydrological variables may obey different distribution types in addition the margin distribution types of the joint distribution constructed using non parametric methods are unknown guo et al 2008 to address the above problems many scholars have applied the copula function theory and method to multivariable hydrological analyses and calculations shiau 2006 serinaldi et al 2009 song and singh 2010 chen et al 2015 xu et al 2015 bezak et al 2016 chang et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2016 balistrocchi and bacchi 2017 zhang et al 2017 lei et al 2017 therefore the speri uses the copula function for calculations the details are as follows sklar 1959 proved that the margin distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n of the joint distribution function h x 1 x 2 x n with multiple random variables x 1 x 2 x n are continuous and only one copula function c then satisfies the following equation 5 h x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n the joint distribution function consists of two parts the margin distribution and the correlation structure that can be described by the copula function overall the construction of the copula function includes the following steps 1 determine the margin distribution of each variable 2 determine the parameters of the copula function 3 select the copula function according to the assessment index and build a joint distribution and 4 conduct the corresponding statistical analysis according to the established distribution guo et al 2008 because the speri is based on two variables p pet and runoff the calculation process of the 2 dimensional copula function will be discussed below 2 2 3 1 margin distribution the probability density functions of runoff x and p pet y are fitted separately to obtain the corresponding distribution functions f x and f y because runoff and p pet differ around the globe this study does not recommend a specific type of margin distribution function 2 2 3 2 correlation coefficient at present the most widely used correlation indexes for hydrological variables are the pearson linear correlation coefficient and the kendall rank correlation coefficient nelsen 2006 the kendall rank correlation coefficient can describe the nonlinear correlation between variables as well as the linear correlation between variables guo et al 2008 it is defined as 6 τ c n 2 1 i j s i g n x i x j y i y j i j 1 2 n where x i y i are the sample data and sign is the sign function 2 2 3 3 copula function generally the copula function can be divided into three types elliptic archimedean and quadratic nelsen 2006 described in detail the widely used archimedean copula functions and their properties therefore speri only selects the following few commonly used two dimensional archimedean copula functions in hydrology and relevant fields 1 gumbel hougaard gh copula function the structures of the gh copula function and the gumbel logistic model yue 2001 are the same 7a c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ θ 1 where u v denote the margin distribution functions u f x and v f y respectively and they have the same meanings in later equations θ denotes a parameter of the gh copula function and it has the same meanings in later equations its relationship with the kendall rank correlation coefficient is 8a τ 1 1 θ 2 clayton copula function the equation of the clayton copula function is 7b c u v u θ v θ 1 1 θ θ 0 the relationship between θ and τ is 8b τ θ 2 θ 3 frank copula function the frank copula equation is 7c c u v 1 θ ln 1 e θ u 1 e θ v 1 e θ 1 θ r the relationship between θ and τ is 8c τ 1 4 θ 1 θ 0 θ t exp t 1 d t 1 2 2 3 4 joint probability according to the margin distributions of the two variables and the joint probability of the two dimension copula function obtained by eqs 7a 8c the equation is 9 p x x y y c x y where x and y are a pair of measured values for r and p pet 2 2 3 5 assessment and testing of the goodness of fit of the copula function which copula function should be chosen under the condition with measured data the type of copula function that best fits the data is chosen 1 assessment of the goodness of fit of the copula function the assessment index of goodness of fit is an important criterion for selecting the distribution type here this article use ordinary least squares ols to assess the goodness of fit of different copula functions the equation is 10 ols 1 n i 1 n p e i p i 2 where p e i and p i denote the empirical and theoretical frequencies respectively fit improves with smaller ols 2 testing the goodness of fit of the copula function to validate whether the selected copula function is able to describe the correlation structure among the variables it is necessary to validate the fit of the copula function this study selects the kolmogorov smirnov k s test to assess the fitness degree between the joint distribution and joint observations the statistic d is calculated as 11 d max p e i p i the bivariate empirical frequency can be derived using the theoretical basis of the univariate empirical frequency gringorten 1963 cunnane 1978 for which the mathematical expression is 12 p x x y y m 1 i l 1 j n ml 0 44 n 0 12 where n denotes the number of data and n ml is the order number of x x i y y i 2 2 4 calculation of the speri the speri is obtained by transforming the above calculated verified joint distribution probability to a standard normal distribution the approximate equation is 13 speri w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value and p 1 c if p 0 5 then p is replaced by p 1 p and the sign of the resultant speri is reversed the constants are c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 3 results the speri was calculated in yunnan province first this article selected monthly precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and runoff data from the 9 stations fig 1 in yunnan province and then used the above calculation method to obtain the speri the purpose of this study is to propose a drought index therefore the calculation temporal scales are 1 3 6 12 months and the calculation methods for the other temporal scales are similar 3 1 fitting probability density function first this article calculated p pet pet is based on the pm calculation method and runoff in the different temporal scales and then fit their probability density functions because p pet and runoff do not know what to follow the distributions this article selected dozens of distribution functions and used the method of maximum likelihood estimation to estimate parameters of the different distribution functions the calculation method is given in chen 1996 according to the above steps this article finally selected the log logistic distribution cumulative distribution function cdf f x 1 β x γ α 1 where α β and γ are cdf parameters for the p pet and lognormal distribution cdf f x φ ln x γ μ σ where φ is the laplace integral and μ σ and γ are cdf parameters for runoff figs 2 9 show the empirical probability theoretical probability p p plot which is nearly a line this suggests that the distribution function is able to fit p pet and runoff data of different temporal scales very well the parameters of the distribution functions are provided in table 1 3 2 joint distribution function first according to eqs 6 and 8a 8c this article calculated the kendall rank correlation coefficient and the parameters of the copula function table 2 calculated the values of the three types of copula functions according to eqs 7a 7c and finally selected the most suitable copula function table 3 according to the assessment and testing of the three copula functions using eqs 10 12 table 3 shows that the frank copula function was selected for the temporal scale of 1 12 months and that the clayton copula function was selected for the temporal scale of 3 6 months most of the k s testing values of these two functions are smaller than the thresholds thus the assumed testing is satisfied therefore for this example the frank and clayton copula distribution functions were selected for the temporal scales of 1 12 months and 3 6 months respectively the p p plots are shown in figs 10 13 3 3 calculation of the speri this article used eq 13 to transform the above calculated copula joint distribution probability into the quantile of the standard normal distribution which is the speri as shown in figs 14 17 3 4 comparison of the speri to the spi and spei this article used two methods to assess the speri one was to calculate the spi and spei using precipitation and p pet and a comparison of the three indexes as figs 18 21 and the other was to use data for the extreme drought during september 2009 august 2010 in yunnan province to validate the accuracy of the speri figs 18 21 show that the changes in the speri were similar to those in the spi and spei table 4 in addition table 4 shows that the speri was well correlated to the spi and spei the correlation between the spei and speri was the best followed by the correlation between the spi and spei suggesting that speri is used to describe drought conditions additionally most of the spei values exceed the spi and speri values suggesting that drought intensity may be smaller than the actual drought intensity after consideration of pet and most of the speri values are smaller than the spi and spei values drought intensity may be greater than the actual drought intensity due to the consideration of not only p pet difference but also the impact of runoff on drought as for fighting drought and drought relief people prefer forecasted drought intensities greater than the actual intensities under most conditions which is more favorable for making plans to fight drought and for drought relief therefore it is feasible to use speri analysis assessments to forecast droughts in addition this article used the extreme drought grades during september 2009 august 2010 provided by the yunnan flood control and drought relief office to assess the accuracy of the three drought indexes first according to the china national standard grades of meteorological drought gb t 20481 2017 general administration of quality supervision 2017 the values of the spi spei and speri were divided into five grades because the calculation principles of the speri are similar to those of the spi and spei the speri uses the same grade standard as the spi and spei as shown in table 5 and then compared the grades of the three drought indexes of the 9 stations at temporal scales of 1 3 6 12 months with the provided actual drought grades as shown in fig 22 fig 22 shows that for the total of 108 counts 12 months 9 stations the number of absolute accurate assessments absolute accurate assessment the calculated drought grade completely matches the actual drought grade of spi1 spi3 spi6 spi12 spei1 spei3 spei6 spei12 speri1 speri3 speri6 and speri12were 41 49 52 27 43 48 48 26 45 55 46 and 14 respectively the number of relative accurate assessments relative accurate assessment the calculated index and reality show drought concurrently but the calculated drought grade is higher or lower than the actual drought grade was 22 31 29 44 31 39 30 42 40 35 33 and 52 respectively and the number of wrong assessments wrong assessment the calculated indexes indicate drought but no actual drought occurs or an actual drought occurs whereas the calculated indexes do not suggest drought was 45 28 27 37 34 21 30 40 23 18 29 and 42 respectively overall the assessment with a temporal scale of 3 months was more accurate than the other temporal scales in addition regardless of whether an absolute accurate assessment or relative accurate assessment the speri was superior to the other two drought indexes the speri with a temporal scale of 3 months was also able to identify the drought very well as shown in table 6 4 discussion and conclusions according to precipitation temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and runoff data this study uses methods that include pm and copula and the calculation principles of the spi and spei to propose a multi scalar drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration runoff index speri this article applied the index to yunnan province and compared it with the widely used spi and spei the results show that the speri is superior to the spi and spei although for multi year averages and closed watersheds precipitation minus evapotranspiration is equal to runoff what people care about is the analysis assessment and forecasting of drought conditions of a specific area in a certain period therefore the consideration of the two variables of p pet and runoff in this index is reasonable that is except for meteorological factors the speri also considers the impact of hydrological factors on drought therefore the speri can be considered as a hydrological drought index or a simple drought disaster index when a drought disaster occurs river water can be fetched to relieve the drought similar to the spei the speri is capable of describing the drought conditions of different areas and assessing the impacts of climate change on drought because the conditions of different areas are not always the same different from other drought indexes that specify a certain probability distribution the bivariate distribution of the speri does not specify any probability distribution rather it selects the distribution with the best fitting results similarly the joint distribution probability can be calculated with other copula functions whereas it needs to pass assessments and tests of goodness of fit when applying the three indexes to yunnan province this article found that the changes in the speri were similar to those in the spi and spei and were well correlated across the indexes this suggests that the speri can also reflect regional drought conditions in addition the comparison between the three drought index grades and the actual grades of the extreme drought during september 2009 august 2010 shows that the speri is superior to the spi and spei and that the speri assessment at a temporal scale of 3 months was the most accurate figs 18 21 show that the spei was overestimated whereas the speri value was underestimated suggesting that the drought intensity assessed by the spei may be smaller than the actual drought intensity and that assessed by the speri may be greater than the actual intensity this conclusion is consistent with table 7 under conditions for which there is no accurate forecast people prefer a forecasted drought grade higher than the actual drought grade which is favorable for making plans for drought prevention and relief in summary the speri method is reasonable and enhances the accuracy of drought assessments to some extent in addition we have also developed automatic calculation software for multi temporal scalar executable speri please contact the first author or the

6671,water stress can cause the structural and physiological changes of plants to prevent excessive water loss according to species specific water use strategies co2 and water vapor fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance in a mixed plantation during a 4 year period the potential evapotranspiration pet was obtained by the shuttleworth wallace model evapotranspiration et versus pet was used to determine the plant water stress index pwsi the objective of this study is to quantify the effect of pwsi on net ecosystem productivity nep gross primary productivity gpp and water use efficiency wue the relationship between pwsi and soil water content in sunny and cloudy skies was examined mean seasonal pwsi values varied substantially among years the average annual value of pwsi was 0 49 0 07 pwsi was strongly correlated with vapor pressure deficit illustrating that the moisture limitation through high evaporative demand was more remarkable than water supply limitation water stress can substantially reduce canopy conductance and leaf area index and hence decreasing photosynthesis water stress suppressed gpp while having little influence on ecosystem respiration resulting in the increase of net carbon uptake nep decreased as a reaction to water stress when pwsi was more than 0 4 whereas wue was enhanced under moderate and severe water stress pwsi 0 6 compared to nep the difference of et between cloudy and sunny sky conditions was more evident at the same pwsi value therefore cloudy sky conditions were beneficial to enhancing wue water stress restricted the mixed plantation in the period of spring early summer at the annual scale the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress the pwsi approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in forest ecosystems keywords plant water stress index net ecosystem productivity gross primary productivity evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction the severity of hydrological drought will increase in a warmer world at the end of the 21st century prudhomme et al 2014 in semiarid areas high air temperature high evaporative demand and low precipitation increase the likelihood of short term drought events occurring dai 2013 ipcc 2013 which induce heat and water stress ghrab et al 2013 and hence reduce net co2 uptake ma et al 2016 drought is one of factors affecting plant productivity and photosynthesis tezara et al 1999 xie et al 2016 changing the coupling between co2 and water vapor fluxes the short term drought events could have important influences on the growth and survival of trees by altering soil water content evapotranspiration et and carbon balance wullschleger and hanson 2006 the decrease of soil water can compromise the multifaceted process of water transfer from soil to roots watt et al 2018 leading to stomatal closure and result in a reduction in photosynthesis sade et al 2012 many previous studies have been demonstrated that prolonged and severe drought events decreased water availability in the soil which even caused forest mortality mcdowell et al 2008 allen et al 2010 vegetation productivity was much more impacted by spring and summer drought than autumn drought zhang et al 2016 spring drought can lead to a decrease in photosynthesis limiting canopy development and peak leaf area summer respiration is enhanced by spring drought because of a larger amount of labile carbon in the form of senescent biomass associated with spring drought induced mortality of understory plants scott et al 2009 as a result spring drought reduces annual net carbon uptake in addition spring drought restricts annual carbon uptake by regulating the soil moisture availability in the summer period noormets et al 2008 scott et al 2009 and shortening the length of the growing season zhang et al 2016 found that drought events had a lagged influence on vegetation productivity of the mixed and deciduous forests in the northeast and southwest china water stress is one of limiting factors controlling vegetation productivity farooq et al 2014 water stress can reduce co2 assimilation munjonji et al 2016 under soil moisture stress the reduction in photosynthesis is mainly attributed to stomatal closure which is a mechanism of forests to prevent xylem embolism cornic 2000 de souza et al 2005 limousin et al 2009 hartmann 2011 mild water stress resulted in the decrease of water use efficiency wue whereas severe drought stress led to a slight increase in wue janket et al 2013 drought also increased wue in jerusalem artichoke conde et al 1991 and cassava olanrewaju et al 2009 however ruttanaprasert et al 2016 reported that soil water stress reduced wue in jerusalem artichoke soil moisture depletion in the root zone drought may have a strong influence on carbon and water fluxes in forests which may affect regional environments and the growth of the forests ciais et al 2005 limousin et al 2009 hartmann 2011 drought index can be described by soil water content and water stress index plant water status is regulated by both soil moisture and atmospheric evaporation demand thus drought impacts on vegetation cannot be evaluated only by soil water content water stress index based on the remote sensing and plant growth however has been applying the evaluation on vegetation drought on the regional scale tree water status is assessed using xylem water potential stem water potential and stomatal conductance romero et al 2006 garcía tejero et al 2010 egea et al 2017 however continuous monitoring of tree water status using xylem water potential and stomatal conductance is limited ghrab et al 2013 the plant water stress index pwsi as introduced by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 can be used to quantify plant water stress and schedule irrigation kacira et al 2002 the pwsi is dependent on three components of dt the difference between air temperature t a and canopy temperature t c dold et al 2017 the limitation of the pwsi based on the idso and jackson methods is the primary calculation to obtain the upper and lower limit of canopy temperature and air temperature veysi et al 2017 additionally the idso and jackson methods can only be used under ideal conditions e g sunny skies dejonge et al 2015 in this study we used et versus potential evapotranspiration pet to determine the pwsi to overcome these limitations the pwsi has been applied in the crops erdem et al 2010 li et al 2010 dold et al 2017 and grasslands feldhake et al 1997 holifield collins et al 2008 dold et al 2017 however there has been little knowledge on the variation in pwsi in forests and pwsi relative to net ecosystem productivity nep to determine the impact of water stress on carbon flux of the forest ecosystems it is reported that north china has been experiencing severe dry periods since the late 1990s zou et al 2005 and the frequency of extreme drought events will increase in the 21st century wang et al 2012 the warmer climate further increases et enhancing water stress in this region zhang et al 2016 the plantation area is 8 72 106 ha in north china and the proportion of the plantation area to total forest area is more than 62 a reduction in rainfall in summer is projected in north china leading to the potential for increased occurrence of water stress during the latter part of the growing season of the plantation moreover the frequency of heat wave and high temperature increases in this region in recent years resulting in increasing water consumption by the trees and restricting tree growth the multi year observations of both carbon and water fluxes in the mixed plantation provide a unique opportunity to determine the impact of environmental variables on the pwsi furthermore this study will evaluate the links between nep wue and pwsi to help us understand carbon sequestration and water use strategy of trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this

condition and the value of 1 indicates a water stressed condition 3 results 3 1 et estimated by the s w model and the p m model fig 1 shows the comparison of simulated half hourly et and measured et over the mixed plantation at the half hourly time scale the simulated et by the s w model and the p m model was about 3 and 40 lower than the measured et respectively soil surface resistance was not taken into account in the p m model and therefore the simulated et values by the p m model were much lower than the measured ones compared with the p m model the et values simulated by the s w model were more consistent with the measured ones fig 1 the correlation coefficient of the regression and the index of agreement between measured et by the eddy covariance and simulated et by the s w model were 0 80 and 0 97 it is demonstrated that the s w model performed well in estimating et over the mixed plantation 3 2 diurnal course of pwsi results from this study showed that half hourly pwsi was higher between 9 00 and 15 30 h with a value about 0 72 in the vegetative growing season and the variation of pwsi was not obvious during this period fig 2 pwsi was lower in the early morning and late afternoon with a value of about 0 60 indicating that trees underwent moderate water stress at this site in a corn cropland mangus et al 2016 found that plant water stress peaked between 13 30 and 15 00 h in the actual field conditions whether the peak pwsi will occur and the occurrence time depends on current environmental conditions 3 3 seasonal pattern of pwsi during the period of the transition between the wet and dry seasons from mid may to early june with little rain and high evaporative demand soil water is exhausted up to the grass shrub rooting depth and pwsi increased fig 3 the pwsi was high in late spring and early summer with about the mean monthly values of 0 50 0 60 0 70 and 0 66 in 2006 2007 2008 and 2009 dry atmospheric and soil conditions in spring may inhibit canopy development and peak leaf area affecting plant c status by reducing carbon use efficiency ciais et al 2005 and hence resulting in the decrease of annual net carbon uptake flanagan et al 2002 although water stress in late may early june probably suppressed the gas exchange rates of all leaves the adverse impact on the development of new leaves was large in contrast to the existing foliage noormets et al 2008 the low pwsi lagged with large precipitation events implying that soil water content increased owing to large precipitation events but the restriction of water stress on the plantation did not stop the soil layer of this site is thin about 60 cm and the deeper soil layer contains high rock fractions the thin soil layer limits water holding capacity inducing less infiltration and hence draining much precipitation the amount of precipitation from july to september of 2008 was twice more than that during the same period of 2009 but it did little to sustain soil water content fig 3 and thus the difference of pwsi value was not pronounced compared with the same period of 2008 the pwsi was greater in june of 2009 due to stronger net radiation in spite of the same amount of precipitation the mean annual pwsi was 0 44 0 45 0 55 and 0 56 in the 2006 2009 periods it is demonstrated that the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress 3 4 responses of pwsi to environmental variables fig 4 shows the relationships between pwsi and environmental variables r n vpd and swc in the growing season of the mixed plantation r n and swc can explain 30 and 31 variation of pwsi respectively the moderate and severe water stress corresponded to high vpd and low swc figs 3 and 4 pwsi decreased from 0 83 to 0 15 as soil water content increased from 16 to 26 and it exhibited a sensitivity to the change of soil water content under mildly and moderately stressed conditions in contrast to under cloudy sky conditions pwsi had a strong relation with swc under sunny sky conditions fig 5 compared to r n and swc vpd had tighter relations with pwsi the 60 variation of pwsi can be explained by vpd it is illustrated that the moisture limitation was more pronounced through high evaporative demand than through energy and water supply limitations 3 5 effects of pwsi on carbon flux and wue 3 5 1 effects of pwsi on gpp rec and nep nep of the mixed plantation was depressed by pwsi figs 6 a and 7 the suppression of gpp and nep was large during water stressed conditions but r ec was insensitive to water stress fig 7 c assimilation was limited under water stress and reducing lue pronouncedly fig 8 a the long term influence of water stress on canopy assimilation is the decrease in lai fig 8b shows that low lai coincided with the high value of pwsi in this study g c was low under the high pwsi without the limitation of solar radiation and hence the decreased nep was strong stomatal control figs 7 and 8c 3 5 2 effect of pwsi on wue the change of wue with increasing pwsi was little when pwsi was 0 6 under moderate and severe water stressed conditions pwsi 0 6 net carbon uptake was more depressed than et due to the low g c and wue increased consistent with increasing pwsi figs 6 and 8 it demonstrates the conservative strategy of the mixed plantation toward water limitation forest canopies are coupled to the atmosphere grace et al 1981 in a coupled canopy carbon assimilation may be limited by stomatal closure less than transpiration g c was negatively correlated with pwsi p 0 001 fig 8c the decrease in canopy conductance will reduce plant transpiration however it is smaller important to photosynthesis because air co2 is affected by the canopy less than air vapor pressure steduto and hsiao 1998 fig 9 shows that the sensitivity of nep to water stress in sunny skies was same as in cloudy skies but et decreased more drastically in cloudy skies than in sunny skies during the water stressed period as a result wue would increase much more under cloudy sky conditions 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls on pwsi pwsi was strongly controlled by vpd and the 60 variation of pwsi can be explained by vpd fig 4 it is demonstrated that atmospheric drought was the main factor causing plant water stress in the mixed plantation pwsi was negatively correlated with swc in the growing season and swc can explain 31 variation of pwsi fig 4 garcía tejero et al 2017 found that pwsi of an olive orchard had significant relations with swc and hence resulting in a reduction in net co2 assimilation and transpiration a similar relationship between pwsi and soil water content was found in a prairie dold et al 2017 and a corn ecosystems carcova et al 1998 mangus et al 2016 the pwsi is strongly sensitive to the change of soil water content under mild water stressed conditions in apple trees osroosh et al 2016 as a proxy of soil water content vegetation water content was negatively correlated with pwsi in a sugarcane field veysi et al 2017 however an increase in pwsi with high soil water content was reported in a soybean crop and a cotton field reicosky et al 1985 dold et al 2017 demonstrating that excess water in the soil profile enhanced plant water stress as a result of water logging the site of this study cannot occur water logging owing to its slope and thus pwsi dropped with the increasing soil water content fig 4 4 2 effects of pwsi on gpp rec and nep under water stressed conditions gpp was more limited than r ec over the mixed plantation fig 7 gpp depends on how much water is available to roots in the whole soil profile reichstein et al 2002 whereas r ec is mainly controlled by soil temperature of the upper soil layers tong et al 2012 the soil of this site contains high rock fractions in deeper soil layer and it has low deep soil water storage capacity in addition water stress reduces leaf mesophyll conductance reddy et al 2003 limiting the transfer of co2 from the intercellular air spaces to the carboxylation sites bogi and loreto 1989 and thus causing a reduction in photosynthesis carbon assimilation was limited under water stress conditions leading to the decrease of lue figs 7 and 8 similar results have been reported by chasmer et al 2008 for a jack pine pereira et al 2007 for a eucalypts plantation and allen et al 2004 for irrigated and non irrigated sweetgum and sycamore stands compared to r ec gpp was more sensitive to water stress fig 7 consistent with the results in an oak grass savanna ecosystem tang and baldocchi 2005 and temperate deciduous and evergreen forests novick et al 2015 in contrast to this study mild and moderate water stress reduced r ec for a boreal aspen forest but it had little effect on gpp causing an increase in nep barr et al 2007 gpp was insensitive to water stress in a loblolly pine stand noormets et al 2010 the drought sensitivity of gpp was masked by high lai and strong par in the dry year the response of gpp to water stress was almost similar to r ec for a pinus elliottii stand resulting in a stable annual nep powell et al 2008 low soil water content significantly reduced r ec but gpp was unaffected in a deciduous forest stand in the 1st drought year kljun et al 2007 both et and gpp decreased during the 2nd and 3rd years of the drought indicating the occurrence of tree water stress gpp was low due to a reduction in lai under high pwsi figs 7a and 8b the depression of lai with increasing pwsi was significant p 0 001 it is an agreement with the finding of çolak and yazar 2017 who found a negative relationship between lai and the pwsi in a royal table grape field water stress reduces lai by folding wilting slowing leaf expansion and shutting off the supply of carbohydrates collino et al 2001 reddy et al 2003 a decrease in leaf area reduces the ability of capturing light resources by plants collino et al 2001 causing a negative influence on nep in the mixed plantation figs 7c and 8b in the glasshouse plant water stress index had a weak correlation with final leaf area with larger water stress corresponding to smaller leaf area carroll ii et al 2017 it is possible as a result of the changing degrees of both water and nitrogen stress in the growing season nep was inhibited under moderate and severe water stressed conditions pwsi 0 4 figs 6 and 7 at the same time water stress reduces the activity of the enzyme ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase known as ribusco parry et al 2002 and thereby restricting ribulose biphosphate synthesis related to lower atp content resulting from loss of atp synthase tezara et al 1999 xylem elements lost part of their hydraulic efficiency under water stressed conditions due to cavitation induced loss of conductivity tyree and sperry 1989 demonstrating the hypothesized physiological limitation of gpp by water stress noormets et al 2010 under water stressed conditions a reduction in co2 flux was reported in a jack pine chasmer et al 2008 a grassland holifield collins et al 2008 a wheat maize cropland li et al 2010 a corn and soybean crop and a prairie dold et al 2017 pingintha et al 2010 also found that nep was remarkably depressed under soil water stressed conditions with high photosynthetically active radiation 4 3 effect of pwsi on wue canopy conductance an index of open stoma decreased with water stress which reduced nep and et figs 5 and 6 the reduction in nep was less than et under moderate and severe water stressed conditions and thus increasing wue similar to the results obtained in jerusalem artichoke conde et al 1991 janket et al 2013 and in cassava olanrewaju et al 2009 during the summer drought wue increased at two semi arid pine forests and the young plantation experienced more severe water stress than the mature ponderosa pine forest vickers et al 2012 it is also found that wue was high at a deciduous boreal forest in the dry year brümmer et al 2012 in an arid zone acacia savanna woodland a high wue occurred at low soil moisture eamus et al 2013 the physiological responses of the vegetation to water stress are involved in the decline of enzymatic activities for preventing water loss van der molen et al 2011 additionally the response of plants to water stress is stomatal closure which causing the decline of the conductivity of water vapor and co2 mccree and fernandez 1989 stomatal closure is a mechanism of forest ecosystems to prevent xylem embolism during water stress conditions hartmann 2011 wue enhanced with increasing pwsi because water stress induced stomatal closure limited co2 uptake less than water loss cowan 1981 5 conclusions a 4 year dataset of eddy covariance measurement and the s w model were used to evaluate the influence of pwsi on co2 and wue of the mixed plantation in north china water stress arose in spring and early summer because it was dependent on precipitation with high interannual variation mean annual pwsi was 0 49 0 07 revealing that there was remarkable moderate water stress pwsi decreased with an increase in swc and it is demonstrated there was a close relation between plant water stress and water in the soil profile both et and nep decreased with increasing pwsi due to stomata closure as a reaction to water stress the pwsi approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in the forest ecosystems these findings will contribute to developing policies for better management of the mixed plantation under water stressed conditions however other factors e g timing of drought stress should be taken into account when tree growth is simulated furthermore the models on water consumption and carbon uptake in the water limited ecosystems during the extreme environmental conditions are needed to develop to predict long term variability in nep more reliably conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the national natural science foundation of

6671,water stress can cause the structural and physiological changes of plants to prevent excessive water loss according to species specific water use strategies co2 and water vapor fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance in a mixed plantation during a 4 year period the potential evapotranspiration pet was obtained by the shuttleworth wallace model evapotranspiration et versus pet was used to determine the plant water stress index pwsi the objective of this study is to quantify the effect of pwsi on net ecosystem productivity nep gross primary productivity gpp and water use efficiency wue the relationship between pwsi and soil water content in sunny and cloudy skies was examined mean seasonal pwsi values varied substantially among years the average annual value of pwsi was 0 49 0 07 pwsi was strongly correlated with vapor pressure deficit illustrating that the moisture limitation through high evaporative demand was more remarkable than water supply limitation water stress can substantially reduce canopy conductance and leaf area index and hence decreasing photosynthesis water stress suppressed gpp while having little influence on ecosystem respiration resulting in the increase of net carbon uptake nep decreased as a reaction to water stress when pwsi was more than 0 4 whereas wue was enhanced under moderate and severe water stress pwsi 0 6 compared to nep the difference of et between cloudy and sunny sky conditions was more evident at the same pwsi value therefore cloudy sky conditions were beneficial to enhancing wue water stress restricted the mixed plantation in the period of spring early summer at the annual scale the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress the pwsi approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in forest ecosystems keywords plant water stress index net ecosystem productivity gross primary productivity evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction the severity of hydrological drought will increase in a warmer world at the end of the 21st century prudhomme et al 2014 in semiarid areas high air temperature high evaporative demand and low precipitation increase the likelihood of short term drought events occurring dai 2013 ipcc 2013 which induce heat and water stress ghrab et al 2013 and hence reduce net co2 uptake ma et al 2016 drought is one of factors affecting plant productivity and photosynthesis tezara et al 1999 xie et al 2016 changing the coupling between co2 and water vapor fluxes the short term drought events could have important influences on the growth and survival of trees by altering soil water content evapotranspiration et and carbon balance wullschleger and hanson 2006 the decrease of soil water can compromise the multifaceted process of water transfer from soil to roots watt et al 2018 leading to stomatal closure and result in a reduction in photosynthesis sade et al 2012 many previous studies have been demonstrated that prolonged and severe drought events decreased water availability in the soil which even caused forest mortality mcdowell et al 2008 allen et al 2010 vegetation productivity was much more impacted by spring and summer drought than autumn drought zhang et al 2016 spring drought can lead to a decrease in photosynthesis limiting canopy development and peak leaf area summer respiration is enhanced by spring drought because of a larger amount of labile carbon in the form of senescent biomass associated with spring drought induced mortality of understory plants scott et al 2009 as a result spring drought reduces annual net carbon uptake in addition spring drought restricts annual carbon uptake by regulating the soil moisture availability in the summer period noormets et al 2008 scott et al 2009 and shortening the length of the growing season zhang et al 2016 found that drought events had a lagged influence on vegetation productivity of the mixed and deciduous forests in the northeast and southwest china water stress is one of limiting factors controlling vegetation productivity farooq et al 2014 water stress can reduce co2 assimilation munjonji et al 2016 under soil moisture stress the reduction in photosynthesis is mainly attributed to stomatal closure which is a mechanism of forests to prevent xylem embolism cornic 2000 de souza et al 2005 limousin et al 2009 hartmann 2011 mild water stress resulted in the decrease of water use efficiency wue whereas severe drought stress led to a slight increase in wue janket et al 2013 drought also increased wue in jerusalem artichoke conde et al 1991 and cassava olanrewaju et al 2009 however ruttanaprasert et al 2016 reported that soil water stress reduced wue in jerusalem artichoke soil moisture depletion in the root zone drought may have a strong influence on carbon and water fluxes in forests which may affect regional environments and the growth of the forests ciais et al 2005 limousin et al 2009 hartmann 2011 drought index can be described by soil water content and water stress index plant water status is regulated by both soil moisture and atmospheric evaporation demand thus drought impacts on vegetation cannot be evaluated only by soil water content water stress index based on the remote sensing and plant growth however has been applying the evaluation on vegetation drought on the regional scale tree water status is assessed using xylem water potential stem water potential and stomatal conductance romero et al 2006 garcía tejero et al 2010 egea et al 2017 however continuous monitoring of tree water status using xylem water potential and stomatal conductance is limited ghrab et al 2013 the plant water stress index pwsi as introduced by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 can be used to quantify plant water stress and schedule irrigation kacira et al 2002 the pwsi is dependent on three components of dt the difference between air temperature t a and canopy temperature t c dold et al 2017 the limitation of the pwsi based on the idso and jackson methods is the primary calculation to obtain the upper and lower limit of canopy temperature and air temperature veysi et al 2017 additionally the idso and jackson methods can only be used under ideal conditions e g sunny skies dejonge et al 2015 in this study we used et versus potential evapotranspiration pet to determine the pwsi to overcome these limitations the pwsi has been applied in the crops erdem et al 2010 li et al 2010 dold et al 2017 and grasslands feldhake et al 1997 holifield collins et al 2008 dold et al 2017 however there has been little knowledge on the variation in pwsi in forests and pwsi relative to net ecosystem productivity nep to determine the impact of water stress on carbon flux of the forest ecosystems it is reported that north china has been experiencing severe dry periods since the late 1990s zou et al 2005 and the frequency of extreme drought events will increase in the 21st century wang et al 2012 the warmer climate further increases et enhancing water stress in this region zhang et al 2016 the plantation area is 8 72 106 ha in north china and the proportion of the plantation area to total forest area is more than 62 a reduction in rainfall in summer is projected in north china leading to the potential for increased occurrence of water stress during the latter part of the growing season of the plantation moreover the frequency of heat wave and high temperature increases in this region in recent years resulting in increasing water consumption by the trees and restricting tree growth the multi year observations of both carbon and water fluxes in the mixed plantation provide a unique opportunity to determine the impact of environmental variables on the pwsi furthermore this study will evaluate the links between nep wue and pwsi to help us understand carbon sequestration and water use strategy of trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this

of soil moisture on soil and canopy resistances were not taken into account in pet estimation whereas the effects were included in actual et calculation the pwsi value of 0 represents well watered condition and the value of 1 indicates a water stressed condition 3 results 3 1 et estimated by the s w model and the p m model fig 1 shows the comparison of simulated half hourly et and measured et over the mixed plantation at the half hourly time scale the simulated et by the s w model and the p m model was about 3 and 40 lower than the measured et respectively soil surface resistance was not taken into account in the p m model and therefore the simulated et values by the p m model were much lower than the measured ones compared with the p m model the et values simulated by the s w model were more consistent with the measured ones fig 1 the correlation coefficient of the regression and the index of agreement between measured et by the eddy covariance and simulated et by the s w model were 0 80 and 0 97 it is demonstrated that the s w model performed well in estimating et over the mixed plantation 3 2 diurnal course of pwsi results from this study showed that half hourly pwsi was higher between 9 00 and 15 30 h with a value about 0 72 in the vegetative growing season and the variation of pwsi was not obvious during this period fig 2 pwsi was lower in the early morning and late afternoon with a value of about 0 60 indicating that trees underwent moderate water stress at this site in a corn cropland mangus et al 2016 found that plant water stress peaked between 13 30 and 15 00 h in the actual field conditions whether the peak pwsi will occur and the occurrence time depends on current environmental conditions 3 3 seasonal pattern of pwsi during the period of the transition between the wet and dry seasons from mid may to early june with little rain and high evaporative demand soil water is exhausted up to the grass shrub rooting depth and pwsi increased fig 3 the pwsi was high in late spring and early summer with about the mean monthly values of 0 50 0 60 0 70 and 0 66 in 2006 2007 2008 and 2009 dry atmospheric and soil conditions in spring may inhibit canopy development and peak leaf area affecting plant c status by reducing carbon use efficiency ciais et al 2005 and hence resulting in the decrease of annual net carbon uptake flanagan et al 2002 although water stress in late may early june probably suppressed the gas exchange rates of all leaves the adverse impact on the development of new leaves was large in contrast to the existing foliage noormets et al 2008 the low pwsi lagged with large precipitation events implying that soil water content increased owing to large precipitation events but the restriction of water stress on the plantation did not stop the soil layer of this site is thin about 60 cm and the deeper soil layer contains high rock fractions the thin soil layer limits water holding capacity inducing less infiltration and hence draining much precipitation the amount of precipitation from july to september of 2008 was twice more than that during the same period of 2009 but it did little to sustain soil water content fig 3 and thus the difference of pwsi value was not pronounced compared with the same period of 2008 the pwsi was greater in june of 2009 due to stronger net radiation in spite of the same amount of precipitation the mean annual pwsi was 0 44 0 45 0 55 and 0 56 in the 2006 2009 periods it is demonstrated that the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress 3 4 responses of pwsi to environmental variables fig 4 shows the relationships between pwsi and environmental variables r n vpd and swc in the growing season of the mixed plantation r n and swc can explain 30 and 31 variation of pwsi respectively the moderate and severe water stress corresponded to high vpd and low swc figs 3 and 4 pwsi decreased from 0 83 to 0 15 as soil water content increased from 16 to 26 and it exhibited a sensitivity to the change of soil water content under mildly and moderately stressed conditions in contrast to under cloudy sky conditions pwsi had a strong relation with swc under sunny sky conditions fig 5 compared to r n and swc vpd had tighter relations with pwsi the 60 variation of pwsi can be explained by vpd it is illustrated that the moisture limitation was more pronounced through high evaporative demand than through energy and water supply limitations 3 5 effects of pwsi on carbon flux and wue 3 5 1 effects of pwsi on gpp rec and nep nep of the mixed plantation was depressed by pwsi figs 6 a and 7 the suppression of gpp and nep was large during water stressed conditions but r ec was insensitive to water stress fig 7 c assimilation was limited under water stress and reducing lue pronouncedly fig 8 a the long term influence of water stress on canopy assimilation is the decrease in lai fig 8b shows that low lai coincided with the high value of pwsi in this study g c was low under the high pwsi without the limitation of solar radiation and hence the decreased nep was strong stomatal control figs 7 and 8c 3 5 2 effect of pwsi on wue the change of wue with increasing pwsi was little when pwsi was 0 6 under moderate and severe water stressed conditions pwsi 0 6 net carbon uptake was more depressed than et due to the low g c and wue increased consistent with increasing pwsi figs 6 and 8 it demonstrates the conservative strategy of the mixed plantation toward water limitation forest canopies are coupled to the atmosphere grace et al 1981 in a coupled canopy carbon assimilation may be limited by stomatal closure less than transpiration g c was negatively correlated with pwsi p 0 001 fig 8c the decrease in canopy conductance will reduce plant transpiration however it is smaller important to photosynthesis because air co2 is affected by the canopy less than air vapor pressure steduto and hsiao 1998 fig 9 shows that the sensitivity of nep to water stress in sunny skies was same as in cloudy skies but et decreased more drastically in cloudy skies than in sunny skies during the water stressed period as a result wue would increase much more under cloudy sky conditions 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls on pwsi pwsi was strongly controlled by vpd and the 60 variation of pwsi can be explained by vpd fig 4 it is demonstrated that atmospheric drought was the main factor causing plant water stress in the mixed plantation pwsi was negatively correlated with swc in the growing season and swc can explain 31 variation of pwsi fig 4 garcía tejero et al 2017 found that pwsi of an olive orchard had significant relations with swc and hence resulting in a reduction in net co2 assimilation and transpiration a similar relationship between pwsi and soil water content was found in a prairie dold et al 2017 and a corn ecosystems carcova et al 1998 mangus et al 2016 the pwsi is strongly sensitive to the change of soil water content under mild water stressed conditions in apple trees osroosh et al 2016 as a proxy of soil water content vegetation water content was negatively correlated with pwsi in a sugarcane field veysi et al 2017 however an increase in pwsi with high soil water content was reported in a soybean crop and a cotton field reicosky et al 1985 dold et al 2017 demonstrating that excess water in the soil profile enhanced plant water stress as a result of water logging the site of this study cannot occur water logging owing to its slope and thus pwsi dropped with the increasing soil water content fig 4 4 2 effects of pwsi on gpp rec and nep under water stressed conditions gpp was more limited than r ec over the mixed plantation fig 7 gpp depends on how much water is available to roots in the whole soil profile reichstein et al 2002 whereas r ec is mainly controlled by soil temperature of the upper soil layers tong et al 2012 the soil of this site contains high rock fractions in deeper soil layer and it has low deep soil water storage capacity in addition water stress reduces leaf mesophyll conductance reddy et al 2003 limiting the transfer of co2 from the intercellular air spaces to the carboxylation sites bogi and loreto 1989 and thus causing a reduction in photosynthesis carbon assimilation was limited under water stress conditions leading to the decrease of lue figs 7 and 8 similar results have been reported by chasmer et al 2008 for a jack pine pereira et al 2007 for a eucalypts plantation and allen et al 2004 for irrigated and non irrigated sweetgum and sycamore stands compared to r ec gpp was more sensitive to water stress fig 7 consistent with the results in an oak grass savanna ecosystem tang and baldocchi 2005 and temperate deciduous and evergreen forests novick et al 2015 in contrast to this study mild and moderate water stress reduced r ec for a boreal aspen forest but it had little effect on gpp causing an increase in nep barr et al 2007 gpp was insensitive to water stress in a loblolly pine stand noormets et al 2010 the drought sensitivity of gpp was masked by high lai and strong par in the dry year the response of gpp to water stress was almost similar to r ec for a pinus elliottii stand resulting in a stable annual nep powell et al 2008 low soil water content significantly reduced r ec but gpp was unaffected in a deciduous forest stand in the 1st drought year kljun et al 2007 both et and gpp decreased during the 2nd and 3rd years of the drought indicating the occurrence of tree water stress gpp was low due to a reduction in lai under high pwsi figs 7a and 8b the depression of lai with increasing pwsi was significant p 0 001 it is an agreement with the finding of çolak and yazar 2017 who found a negative relationship between lai and the pwsi in a royal table grape field water stress reduces lai by folding wilting slowing leaf expansion and shutting off the supply of carbohydrates collino et al 2001 reddy et al 2003 a decrease in leaf area reduces the ability of capturing light resources by plants collino et al 2001 causing a negative influence on nep in the mixed plantation figs 7c and 8b in the glasshouse plant water stress index had a weak correlation with final leaf area with larger water stress corresponding to smaller leaf area carroll ii et al 2017 it is possible as a result of the changing degrees of both water and nitrogen stress in the growing season nep was inhibited under moderate and severe water stressed conditions pwsi 0 4 figs 6 and 7 at the same time water stress reduces the activity of the enzyme ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase known as ribusco parry et al 2002 and thereby restricting ribulose biphosphate synthesis related to lower atp content resulting from loss of atp synthase tezara et al 1999 xylem elements lost part of their hydraulic efficiency under water stressed conditions due to cavitation induced loss of conductivity tyree and sperry 1989 demonstrating the hypothesized physiological limitation of gpp by water stress noormets et al 2010 under water stressed conditions a reduction in co2 flux was reported in a jack pine chasmer et al 2008 a grassland holifield collins et al 2008 a wheat maize cropland li et al 2010 a corn and soybean crop and a prairie dold et al 2017 pingintha et al 2010 also found that nep was remarkably depressed under soil water stressed conditions with high photosynthetically active radiation 4 3 effect of pwsi on wue canopy conductance an index of open stoma decreased with water stress which reduced nep and et figs 5 and 6 the reduction in nep was less than et under moderate and severe water stressed conditions and thus increasing wue similar to the results obtained in jerusalem artichoke conde et al 1991 janket et al 2013 and in cassava olanrewaju et al 2009 during the summer drought wue increased at two semi arid pine forests and the young plantation experienced more severe water stress than the mature ponderosa pine forest vickers et al 2012 it is also found that wue was high at a deciduous boreal forest in the dry year brümmer et al 2012 in an arid zone acacia savanna woodland a high wue occurred at low soil moisture eamus et al 2013 the physiological responses of the vegetation to water stress are involved in the decline of enzymatic activities for preventing water loss van der molen et al 2011 additionally the response of plants to water stress is stomatal closure which causing the decline of the conductivity of water vapor and co2 mccree and fernandez 1989 stomatal closure is a mechanism of forest ecosystems to prevent xylem embolism during water stress conditions hartmann 2011 wue enhanced with increasing pwsi because water stress induced stomatal closure limited co2 uptake less than water loss cowan 1981 5 conclusions a 4 year dataset of eddy covariance measurement and the s w model were used to evaluate the influence of pwsi on co2 and wue of the mixed plantation in north china water stress arose in spring and early summer because it was dependent on precipitation with high interannual variation mean annual pwsi was 0 49 0 07 revealing that there was remarkable moderate water stress pwsi decreased with an increase in swc and it is demonstrated there was a close relation between plant water stress and water in the soil profile both et and nep decreased with increasing pwsi due to stomata closure as a reaction to water stress the pwsi approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in the forest ecosystems these findings will contribute to developing policies for better management of the mixed plantation under water stressed conditions however other factors e g timing of drought stress should be taken into account when tree growth is simulated furthermore the models on water consumption and carbon uptake in the water limited ecosystems during the extreme environmental conditions are needed to develop to predict long term variability in nep more reliably conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the national natural science foundation of

6672,accurate estimation of field scale root zone soil moisture rzsm is essential for hydro meteorological and agricultural management the cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is an innovative technique for field scale soil moisture observation however it is limited at deeper depths and requires suitable methods for scaling the crnp effective depth to represent the root zone layer up to 100 cm depth a merging framework was developed in this study for improving field scale rzsm with the crnp via coupling the representative ancillary rzsm information with cosmic ray soil moisture by using ancillary rzsm retrieved at the most time stable location this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets while maintaining scale representativeness a linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets the cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm and a reference product which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location the variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts and subsequently merging the ancillary rzsm and cosmic ray soil moisture performance of the merged rzsm in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter based rzsm over three different environments was evaluated against the reference rzsm product the results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged rzsm and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field scale rzsm measurement compared to other products this study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method with respect to variations of crnp effective depths overall the merging framework is simple to apply enables unrestricted use in different environments and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources keywords cosmic ray soil moisture root zone soil moisture merging framework temporal stability analysis original linear combination of forecasts linear autoregressive model 1 introduction soil moisture plays a fundamental role in governing the exchange of water and energy fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere brocca et al 2011 vereecken et al 2008 and was listed as an essential climate variable ecv when characterizing the earth s climate gcos 2010 the soil moisture status in the root zone frequently up to 100 cm depth is a storage variable that controls the partitioning of important hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration choi and jacobs 2007 das and mohanty 2006 knowledge of root zone soil moisture rzsm is crucial for better understanding of plant available water root water uptake and water deficit which are the major factors affecting plant growth and vigor in the ecosystem gonzález zamora et al 2016 santos et al 2014 therefore accurately capturing rzsm variability at relevant scales contributes to effective hydro meteorological and agricultural monitoring in accordance with natural disasters mitigation entekhabi et al 2010 vereecken et al 2008 weather and climate prediction zohaib et al 2017 agriculture management barker et al 2017 pardossi et al 2009 drought monitoring bolten et al 2010 han et al 2014 flood forecasting brocca et al 2012 and dust outbreak risk assessment kim et al 2017 kim and choi 2015 various methods have been developed to predict rzsm from near surface soil moisture at shallower depths and they are fundamentally classified into data assimilation analytical and statistical approaches wang et al 2017 data assimilation generates profile soil moisture by integrating the surface soil water content products ranging from in situ network crnp and remote sensing into hydrological models baatz et al 2017 das and mohanty 2006 dumedah et al 2015 han et al 2015 rosolem et al 2014 however the use of data assimilation is complex due to its high computational cost and its accuracy strongly depends on the quality of numerous model parameters soil properties atmospheric forcing and vegetation coverage etc which may lead to biased estimations of rzsm albergel et al 2008 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 alternatively there is a growing interest in analytical methods which mathematically simulate the physically based relationships of water flows by following the simple water balance assumption such methods have demonstrated the potential of converting surface measurements to profile soil moisture because of their simplicity and higher efficiency albergel et al 2008 manfreda et al 2014 the exponential filter proposed by wagner et al 1999 is a commonly used analytical method that has been successfully applied to different surface soil moisture products over various soil conditions and climatic regions albergel et al 2008 ford et al 2014 peterson et al 2016 however its limitation is that the use of a single input parameter t the characteristic time length in the exponential filter cannot fully represent the influences of physical processes controlling soil moisture variation manfreda et al 2014 statistical methods such as regression models srivastava et al 1997 time stability analysis gao et al 2015 peterson et al 2016 landscape units disaggregation peterson et al 2016 and artificial neural network kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 have been also adopted to characterize the statistical relationship between surface and profile soil moisture of these techniques the simple regression model approach was widely employed in the past however two main drawbacks were present site specific variables showed no clear relationship against regression parameters and the prediction accuracy decreases at deeper depths srivastava et al 1997 the cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for use in field scale rzsm monitoring over a variety of environments which can bridge the scale gap between point measurements made with in situ sensors and large scale observations using remote sensing products bogena et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 zreda et al 2012 2008 in particular the crnp measures low energy fast neutrons generated by collisions of high energy cosmic rays which came to the earth from galactic origin with atmospheric and soil nuclei zreda et al 2012 2008 due to a remarkable inverse correlation between these fast neutrons and the hydrogen atoms which are mostly present in total soil water contents bogena et al 2013 a nonlinear calibration function has been developed to directly convert the fast neutron signal observed at the crnp into soil moisture time series desilets et al 2010 theoretically the crnp is feasible to provide continuous field averaged soil moisture measurement over a footprint of hectares 18 ha at a high frequency e g hourly 6 hr interval etc and the penetration depth which depends on total soil water equivalent soil bulk density and distance from the probe ranging from 15 cm in wet soils and up to 83 cm in dry soil conditions köhli et al 2015 although it holds the potential for use in rzsm measurement the effective depth of the cosmic ray soil moisture product is usually limited due to the sensitivity of the crnp measured neutron signal to other hydrogen sources franz et al 2012 peterson et al 2016 moreover monitoring rzsm with cosmic ray neutron technology is also a challenge since the vertical soil moisture profile was reported as one of the major factors contributing to the large uncertainty of soil moisture measurement when using standalone crnp baroni et al 2018 therefore accurately representing the field scale soil moisture profile variation by extending the crnp measurement depth is in high demand lv et al 2014 peterson et al 2016 although efforts to extend the effective depth of cosmic ray soil moisture to deeper layers has been reported in several previous studies improving rzsm estimation using the crnp has not yet been gained much attention since the direct use of standalone crnp often shows considerable uncertainties caused by surrounding hydrogen sources presence a practical solution for improving field scale rzsm using the crnp is integrating representative point scale in situ soil moisture measurements within its footprint together baroni et al 2018 baroni and oswald 2015 additionally in the context of data limited regions urban complex terrain dense vegetation regions where further soil moisture observations from remote sensing satellites and models are still challenges the standalone field scale soil moisture might be retrieved only by ground based measurements mostly the crnp and in situ network however constructing densely distributed in situ sensors networks at these areas is costly difficult labor and time consuming so that raising a need for optimization of these monitoring networks with few measurement points as a result thanks to the research of vachaud et al 1985 temporal stability of a field mean soil moisture can be identified by a single soil moisture location gao et al 2015 peterson et al 2016 and zhu et al 2017 also demonstrated the potential of the temporal stability analysis in representing field scale rzsm despite the theoretical field average representativeness independent use of time stable location could not fully stand for field mean soil moisture in several complex regions typically heterogeneous areas brocca et al 2010 ran et al 2017 whereas the effects of spatial soil moisture variability on the crnp measurement are trivial baroni et al 2018 nguyen et al 2017 consequently coupling ancillary information of in situ rzsm measured at a time stable location together with the crnp observation is probably be a feasible solution for improving field scale rzsm previous studies have pointed out the feasibility of merging independent resources to produce a more accurate hybrid product that provides a considerable reduction in noise kim et al 2018 2015 yilmaz et al 2012 typically the original linear combination of forecasts which was introduced by bates and granger 1969 can generate a combined product that minimizes the mean square error mse from two original products and is widely used in many hydro meteorological applications in this respect chowdhury and sharma 2011 focused on blending global sea surface temperature forecasts based on dynamic linear combination approaches the linear combination concept was also modified to improve the spatial interpolation of rainfall datasets wasko et al 2013 kim et al 2015 and kim et al 2016 developed a framework in accordance with this technique for combining multiple remote sensing soil moisture products with respect to maximizing temporal correlation in general due to its suitability over diverse disciplines it is reasonable to apply the linear combination concept to merge ancillary time stable location based rzsm into shallower crnp measurements it is important to stress that the original linear combination merges two input datasets the cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm based upon a reference rzsm dataset which is an assumed truth and can be used for validation of the merged product however the reference data used for evaluating the hybrid product during the validation period cannot be involved in the merging framework whereas the original linear combination of forecasts considers the error variances between two input products and the reference therefore to obtain an optimal weight for the merging framework the error datasets need to be accurately predicted since the rzsm usually responds to soil moisture signal at shallower depths after a lag period ford et al 2014 tobin et al 2017 it is reasonable to adopt a linear autoregressive model for forecasting the error datasets between original and reference products relying on their lagged measurements the estimated error datasets were subsequently used to compute the weight for generating merged field scale rzsm overall for the aforementioned reasons this study aimed to develop a simple economic and effective merging framework based on integration of the linear autoregressive model and the original linear combination of forecasts for improving field averaged rzsm measurements made with crnp by merging the ancillary rzsm provided by an in situ time stable location with cosmic ray soil moisture product in particular the specific objectives of this study are to 1 construct a merging framework for improving field scale rzsm measurements obtained with the crnp 2 evaluate the robustness of proposed merging method in estimating field averaged rzsm for different environments compared to the parent products and the exponential filter based rzsm against the reference rzsm and 3 discuss the impacts of original datasets uncertainties on the quality of merged rzsm products with regard to the variation of crnp effective depth 2 study area in this study three experimental sites using the crnps in different environments were selected to test our merging framework with one probe located in each site in particular two study sites consist of two crnps belonging to the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos network in the usa zreda et al 2012 the californian tonzi ranch and arizonan kendall sites whereas the remaining area is located in south korea namely the soil moisture fdr and cosmic ray sm fc site the tonzi ranch site 38 432 n 120 966 w is situated at an altitude of 177 m above sea level a s l in oak savanna in south west america where the terrain is fairly flat and the land cover is mainly grassland the dominant soils are clay loams and loams with bedrock at a depth of around 1 m and the presence of a minimal organic layer the kendall site 31 737 n 109 942 w is located at an elevation of 1548 m a s l within the walnut gulch experimental watershed where the soil texture is primarily loam and the dominant land cover type is shrubland in addition to crnps several in situ soil moisture observations belonging to the soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator soilscape network were located within the crnp footprint the sm fc site 37 292 n 126 966 e installed at an altitude of 46 m a s l in south korea lies within a densely forested area where the dominant climate is humid monsoon this study area has high degree of soil moisture heterogeneity due to the dense vegetation distribution and the reported typical soil textures are sandy loam and loamy sand the soil moisture monitoring network located at sm fc was constructed in late august 2015 and it contains one crnp and ten randomly distributed frequency domain reflectometry fdr stations nguyen et al 2017 fig 1 shows a map of the study areas including locations of crnps and in situ stations and table 1 provides detailed information about each station such as latitude longitude soil texture dominant land covers and distance from in situ station to the crnp 3 datasets 3 1 neutron counts measured by the crnp the crnps installed at tonzi ranch and kendall on may 2011 and june 2010 utilizes the bf3 and he3 neutron detectors respectively fig 1 they provide continuous neutron intensity measurements on an hourly basis thereby contributing to the largest cosmic ray soil moisture network in the usa the cosmos network zreda et al 2012 generally crnps belonging to cosmos network provided data on three different levels level 1 data are raw neutron counts observed from the probe level 2 data are quality controlled neutron counts corrected for local effects including air pressure and incoming neutron intensity and level 3 data are estimated cosmic ray soil moisture from the corrected neutron intensity detailed site information and associated data provided are available from the cosmos website http cosmos hwr arizona edu probes stationdat in this study level 2 data of corrected neutron intensity measured at tonzi ranch and kendall crnps were utilized the crnp located at the sm fc site is crs 1000 b model using bf3 neutron detector providing hourly observation data of fast neutron intensity from september 2015 fig 1 the observed neutron counts of the crnp at the sm fc were corrected based on general correction processes specifically for atmospheric pressure atmospheric water vapor and incoming neutron intensity variations a detailed description of these correction processes for the crnp at sm fc site is fully present in nguyen et al 2017 3 2 in situ soil moisture network measurements as previously mentioned section 2 the in situ soil moisture monitoring networks located within the crnp footprints of tonzi ranch and kendall sites belong to the soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator soilscape network the soilscape network was established to provide a local scale estimate of soil moisture at a high temporal resolution and to validate remote sensing data on a regional scale thereby contributing to the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 for each station within the soilscape network three fdr soil moisture sensors model ec 5 manufactured by decagon devices company were installed at three different depths 5 20 and 50 cm at tonzi ranch and 5 15 and 30 cm at kendall to provide hourly in situ soil water content data regarding the texture analysis for different measurement layers the dominant soil at tonzi ranch site was classified as loams down to a depth of 20 cm and clay loams for the layer of 20 50 cm whereas the topsoil down to 30 cm depth at kendall site was mainly composed by loams in this study a total of 19 stations were situated within the tonzi ranch crnp footprint and 7 stations within the kendall crnp footprint it is important to note that soil moisture measurements at the deepest depth 50 cm for tonzi ranch and 30 cm for kendall were then considered as reference rzsm however several stations provided low quality soil moisture data and a large amount of missing data were excluded therefore only seven stations for tonzi ranch and six stations for kendall site were ultimately used data can be freely accessed through the ismn website https ismn geo tuwien ac at a total of 10 frequency domain reflectometry fdr stations were constructed around the crnp at the sm fc site to support soil moisture measurements in this experimental region the soil texture at sm fc network varied within different fdr stations with four stations fdr 01 fdr 03 fdr 06 and fdr 07 were reported as sandy loams and the others are loamy sands for each station fdr sensors were installed at four different depths 10 20 30 and 50 cm to provide hourly in situ soil water content data from september 2015 from july 2016 nine fdr stations were de installed and a single station fdr 7 which is situated closest to the crnp was maintained for permanent soil moisture observation therefore total data for all stations were only available from september 2015 to june 2016 excluding a 4 month snow period december 2015 to march 2016 in this study because of the large amount of missing data at station fdr 4 and at the deepest depth of 50 cm at several stations only soil moisture measurements at a depth of 30 cm from nine stations excepting station fdr 4 were selected to represent the reference rzsm at the sm fc site detailed information on locations and soil characteristics for selected stations at three study sites are shown in table 1 4 methodology as suggested by baroni et al 2018 coupling representative point scale sensors together with the crnp has the potential to improve field scale rzsm estimation with cosmic ray technology this study aims to propose a simple economic and effective merging framework for extending the crnp effective depth based on combination of cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm retrieved from in situ temporally stable locations the merging framework procedure includes three primary steps first the temporal stability concept was implemented for the in situ network to select a most time stable location as an ancillary rzsm product and the remaining soil moisture stations were determined as the reference rzsm second linear autoregressive models were constructed to provide error estimates between the two parent products and reference data finally the original linear combination of forecasts was applied to merge the ancillary rzsm and the observed crnp soil moisture measurements using optimal weights computed from the estimated error datasets to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method its performance against reference rzsm was compared with two original products and the exponential filter a flowchart of the entire merging framework is shown in fig 2 and detailed descriptions of specific major techniques are presented below 4 1 temporal stability analysis applied for in situ soil moisture network 4 1 1 ancillary root zone soil moisture a single temporally stable location was selected from the in situ network to provide a field mean soil moisture representative following the concept of temporal stability analysis tsa vachaud et al 1985 various metrics have been adopted in previous studies with respect to time stability assessments however this study considered only the index of temporal stability its which includes both the mean mrd and standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd with the criterion that the lowest its values will indicate the time stable location from the in situ soil moisture network a more detailed description of the entire tsa procedure is present in appendix a a tsa was initially applied to separate the in situ soil moisture data into two independent sets a time stable station which was assumed as the ancillary rzsm and the remaining stations for which an appropriate weighting method can be applied to produce the reference rzsm data it is worth noticing that only the soil moisture measured at deepest depths of all the in situ stations within the network were selected to be applied with the tsa based on the assumption that these deepest layer soil moisture products can stand for rzsm measurements at three study sites since previous studies of hu et al 2010 demonstrated that the soil moisture temporal stability increased with increasing soil depth using soil moisture observed at deeper layers is expected to provide more accurate estimation of field mean soil water content rather than using shallow layer soil moisture 5 reference field scale soil moisture the reference field average soil moisture used for calibration and validation of the crnp requires applying relevant weighting methods to in situ measurements that can represent the corresponding neutrons distribution nguyen et al 2017 advanced findings of köhli et al 2015 provided an insight into crnp support volume and their revised weighting method showed the potential to qualify the contribution of the ground based soil moisture observation within the crnp footprint in addition schrön et al 2017 recently updated the study of köhli et al 2015 and provided a more accurate qualification in both vertical and horizontal distributions of neutron flux generally based on this nonlinear weighting method each in situ soil moisture measurement point and depth inside the crnp footprint were delivered with a corresponding horizontal and vertical weighting factors respectively considering the distance from each measurement point to the crnp and impacts of local environmental conditions such as air humidity atmospheric pressure vegetation and moisture contents on neutron distribution hence the revised non linear weighting method present in schrön et al 2017 can be applied to the remaining in situ soil moisture stations apart from the time stable location within the monitoring networks to estimate the reference field average soil moisture at three experimental sites detailed description of the main procedure for computing vertical and horizontal weighting factors was fully provided in köhli et al 2015 and schrön et al 2017 in this present study the near surface soil moisture used for calibrating and validating the crnp product was obtained by applying both vertical and horizontal weighting factors while the reference field scale rzsm used for calibrating the proposed merging framework and exponential filter as well as evaluating different rzsm products was retrieved only by horizontally weighting the in situ soil moisture measurements at an available deepest depth 5 1 field scale soil moisture estimated from the crnp 5 1 1 traditional calibration n0 method it is worth noticing that the raw neutron intensity retrieved from the crnp observation should be corrected for the variations of air pressure atmospheric water vapor and incoming neutron flux prior to apply the calibration detailed descriptions of correction factors computation for these aforementioned variables were fully provided in previous studies nguyen et al 2017 zreda et al 2012 subsequently the cosmic ray soil moisture θ m3m 3 product used in the merging framework can be directly converted from the corrected neutron flux ncorr counts per hour cph via a shape defining calibration function or n0 method proposed by desilets et al 2010 the n0 method which was developed based on the monte carlo n particle extended transport code mcnpx pelowitz 2008 is defined as follows 1 θ a 0 n corr n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ bd where three parameters a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 a2 0 115 are dimensionless and independent of soil chemical composition while the calibration parameter n0 cph which basically depends on site specific conditions represents neutron counts over dry soil and can be obtained via calibration of the crnp desilets et al 2010 it is important to note that the cosmic ray soil moisture product used in this current study represents total soil water content including soil moisture as well as water equivalent from aboveground and belowground biomass soil organic matter and lattice water in addition the effective depth z cm of the crnp which strongly depends on the total soil water content θ bulk density and distance from the crnp can be computed as schrön et al 2017 2 z 1 ρ bd 8 321 0 14249 0 96655 exp 0 01 r 20 0 θ 0 0429 θ where ρbd gcm 3 is an average soil bulk density θ m3m 3 is the total soil water content and r m is the footprint radius corrected for atmospheric pressure and vegetation which is expressed as 3 r r p h veg θ f p f veg θ r in which r is the distance from the crnp to a measurement point within its footprint in this current study we considered the distance between crnp and time stable location as r parameter to compute the effective depth at each site additionally fp and fveg represent correction factors for air pressure and vegetation respectively which can be defined as schrön et al 2017 4 f p 0 4922 0 86 e p 1013 5 f veg 1 0 17 1 e 0 41 h veg 1 e 9 25 θ where p mbar and hveg m are air pressure and vegetation height data respectively which herein can be collected at the field sites 5 1 2 exponential filter in order to compare the proposed merging framework to other rzsm estimation methods a commonly used exponential filter approach introduced by wagner et al 1999 was employed in this present study to characterize the rzsm time series from surface soil moisture signal basically this approach follows the soil water balance equation that assumes the changes in soil water content depending on both positive and negative water fluxes between the two soil layers albergel et al 2008 stroud 1999 proposed a recursive formulation for the original exponential filter which can be written as 6 sw i 2 t i s w i 2 t i 1 k i sw i 1 t i s w i 2 t i 1 where swi1 and swi2 are the soil water indices of layer 1 and layer 2 respectively it is important to note that layer 1 herein implies soil moisture observed from the crnp whereas layer 2 indicates that of root zone layer the gain ki at time ti can be calculated as follows 7 k i k i 1 k i 1 exp t i t i 1 t in which ki ranges from 0 to 1 the values of k1 and swi2 1 were initially set to 1 and swi1 1 respectively overall the exponential filter operation requires calibration for the optimal values of a single parameter t namely the characteristic time length furthermore the trade off between the soil moisture value and swi can be computed as wagner et al 1999 8 θ t θ min s w i t θ max θ min where θmin and θmax are the minimum and maximum soil moisture during the study period 5 2 merging framework for root zone soil moisture estimation the proposed merging framework for coupling representative ancillary rzsm retrieved from a point scale in situ measurement to the crnp measured soil moisture adopted the original linear combination of forecasts concept introduced by bates and granger 1969 this method is expected to generate a superior hybrid product with lower overall error than the individual original datasets when one of these two following criteria are met 1 one forecast is based on variables or information that the other has not considered and or 2 a different assumption of the relationship between variables is made by a forecast bates and granger 1969 kim et al 2015 computation of the linear combination method which requires two unbiased measurements of soil moisture θ1 and θ2 is provided as follows 9 θ merged w θ 1 1 w θ 2 in this study θ1 m3 m 3 is denoted as cosmic ray soil moisture θ2 m3 m 3 is denoted as ancillary rzsm measured at the temporally stable location and θmerged represents the merged rzsm product the weight w in eq 9 which is selected to minimize the error variance of the merged product θmerged is defined as bates and granger 1969 10 w σ 2 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 where σ1 2 and σ2 2 are variances of the errors computed from two original products and the reference and ρ is the pearson s correlation coefficient between their errors additionally to obtain unbiased estimates of θ1 and θ2 the original datasets θ1 and θ2 are normalized such that their mean and standard deviation values are identical to that of the reference data θref following the equation draper et al 2009 11 θ norm θ raw μ θ raw σ θ ref σ θ raw μ θ ref where θnorm is normalized soil moisture of the original data θraw and μ and σ are denoted as the mean and standard deviation respectively the weighted in situ soil moisture measurement except the time stable location was selected as the reference data θref for this study it is worth noting that for a given period computation of an optimal weight in eq 10 requires error datasets between two input and reference products since the error value at the commencement of merging is unknown it is necessary to accurately estimate the error datasets prior to conducting the merging technique assuming that only hindcasts of error data are available it is possible to adopt a linear autoregressive model to forecast the time series of errors relied on these known hindcasts the general form of linear autoregressive model with p order applied for error estimation so called ar p can be present as follows 12 e t i 1 p ϕ i e t i ε t in which et is the estimated error value at time t between a parent soil moisture product and the reference et i is the historical error value at the lagged i hours φi is the corresponding coefficient for et i and εt is denoted as white noise in this study a maximum order of p 12 was selected indicating that the error value at a given time was forecast according to the past 12 hindcasts an appropriate calibration was necessary to construct the ar 12 model before producing error estimates the weight w for the merging technique was then computed from the obtained error datasets for the entire given period 5 3 performance evaluation 5 3 1 cross validation a two fold cross validation was applied in this study to avoid the effects of overfitting problem when calibrating and validating different datasets it turns out that the datasets were separated into two periods of equal sizes and each dataset was one by one used as the calibration and validation periods however the lengths of datasets were not similar between the sites with 2 yr 2013 2014 1 yr 2016 and 6 month data available for tonzi ranch kendall and sm fc sites respectively therefore the years 2013 and 2014 were alternately applied for tonzi ranch site the first six months january june and last six months july december were one by one used for kendall site and the first three month period september november 2015 and last three month period april june 2016 at the sm fc site were respectively used for calibration and validation periods moreover in this study the first and second validation periods of the dataset for each site were denoted as p1 and p2 respectively 5 3 2 validation metrics commonly used root mean square error rmse and bias associated with the modified kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 were utilized in this study to evaluate performance of the proposed merging framework based rzsm in comparison to other rzsm products against the reference rzsm the kge which considers the measures of three different features correlation bias and variability and is defined as follows 13 kge 1 r 1 2 γ 1 2 ε 1 2 where r is the pearson s correlation coefficient γ μ θe μ θr is the bias ratio and ε σ θe μ θe σ θr μ θr is the variability ratio μ θe and μ θr are denoted as average values of estimated and reference soil moisture and σ θe and σ θr correspond to the standard deviations of estimated and reference soil moisture respectively the kge score can range from to 1 where a value of 1 corresponds to a perfect fit furthermore a taylor diagram taylor 2001 was used to represent multiple evaluation statistics in one chart specifically the taylor diagram provides a statistical summary of three different metrics the centered root mean square difference e the correlation coefficient r and the normalized standard deviation ratio of standard deviation between estimated and reference products sdv in this diagram the relationship of these statistical metrics can be characterized as follows 14 e 2 s d v 2 1 2 s d v r where sdv is given as 15 sdv σ θ e σ θ r 6 results 6 1 selection of ancillary root zone soil moisture the selection of ancillary rzsm which was then combined with cosmic ray soil moisture for providing the merged rzsm was implemented following the application of tsa to in situ rzsm measurements at the three experimental sites fig 3 fig 3 shows that the mean relative difference mrd ranged from 53 2 to 31 7 for tonzi ranch 76 9 to 94 6 for kendall and 55 6 to 37 1 for sm fc site whereas the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd for these study areas ranged from 5 6 to 16 8 13 2 to 37 8 and 8 2 to 33 1 respectively at tonzi ranch site its values which were considered as criteria for selecting the time stable location varied between 6 and 55 8 the lowest its value 6 which was recorded at node 401 demonstrated that rzsm provided by this station could be used to represent field scale measurements and it was thus selected as an ancillary rzsm product for the tonzi ranch site fig 3a as regards kendall and sm fc sites the its s ranges were 15 3 97 7 and 11 9 64 7 respectively while the time stable location providing ancillary rzsm for the kendall site was node 1402 with the lowest its value of 15 3 fig 3b and fdr 8 with its of 11 9 fig 3c for the sm fc site the remaining stations at each site could then be used to provide field scale soil moisture reference data 6 2 field scale near surface soil moisture measurement from the crnp relevant calibration according to the n0 method is required to convert neutron intensity measured by the crnp to field average soil moisture the recent findings of heidbuchel et al 2016 illustrated that a two point calibration conducted in both wet and dry conditions can improve the performance of cosmic ray soil moisture retrieval as a result in this study we applied a two point calibration procedure to the three crnp sites both vertical and horizontal weighting functions were applied to generate field scale weighted soil moisture for each area which was used to calibrate and evaluate the performance of cosmic ray soil moisture table 2 provides general calibration and validation information while fig 4 presents time series of cosmic ray soil moisture with corresponding effective depths for the three crnp sites according to table 2 the calibration parameters n0 obtained for tonzi ranch kendall and sm fc was 3247 cph 2770 cph and 1424 cph respectively validation results showed a superior performance at tonzi ranch with r 0 94 rmse 0 027 m3 m 3 bias 0 006 m3 m 3 however reasonable results were recorded at the two remaining sites with r 0 75 rmse 0 035 m3 m 3 bias 0 020 m3 m 3 for the kendall and r 0 77 rmse 0 060 m3 m 3 bias 0 051 m3 m 3 for the sm fc site the generated cosmic ray soil moisture at tonzi ranch site varied between 0 036 0 444 m3 m 3 with a mean value of 0 139 m3 m 3 and a standard deviation of 0 074 m3 m 3 fig 4a whereas fig 4b indicates the range of cosmic ray soil moisture at kendall as 0 033 0 250 m3 m 3 with average value of 0 090 m3 m 3 and standard deviation of 0 040 m3 m 3 for the sm fc site soil moisture retrieved from the crnp ranged from 0 169 to 0 546 m3 m 3 with mean and standard deviation of 0 288 and 0 055 m3 m 3 respectively fig 4c the values of effective depth at tonzi ranch kendall and the sm fc sites ranged from 13 to 47 cm 16 to 44 cm and 10 to 17 cm with corresponding average depths at these study sites of approximately 27 cm 30 cm and 13 cm respectively fig 4 6 3 calibration of optimal t value for exponential filter the exponential filter used for producing rzsm from surface soil moisture requires calibration for the optimal t value topt in this study cosmic ray soil moisture estimated at each crnp can be considered as surface soil moisture and is denoted as layer 1 whereas reference rzsm was selected to provide measurements at layer 2 prior to conducting the calibration soil moisture in both layers was converted to swi using eq 8 in this study the kge was used as a criterion for calibrating the topt whereas the t value which provides the highest kge compared to the reference rzsm was selected as the topt for each site in addition as with the merging framework a two fold cross validation was also adopted with the exponential filter table 3 provides general information about the calibration parameters employed in each study period for the three crnp sites the topt values retrieved from the calibration were subsequently utilized in the validation periods to generate rzsm from layer 1 measurements of cosmic ray soil moisture products 6 4 merging framework based on integration of linear autoregressive models and linear combination of forecasts 6 4 1 error estimates using linear autoregressive models a linear autoregressive model of order 12 or ar 12 was adopted to estimate the error time series between two input products and the reference specifically an ar 12 model can provide the prediction of an error value at a given measurement time based on its lagged 12 error hindcasts an ar 12 model calibration was required to define the corresponding coefficients of lagged 12 error values and a two fold cross validation was conducted for each study site table 4 reports the corresponding coefficients of ar 12 generated for each validation datasets at the three crnp areas in this study only statistically significant coefficients at α level of 0 05 p values 0 05 were selected to generate the error time series forecasts assuming that the measurements for the first 12 h of errors are known the obtained ar 12 model was then applied to simulate remaining error values a scatter plot is used fig 5 to show a comparison between the estimated error datasets computed from ar 12 models against reference error datasets for each validation period at the three study sites in general ar 12 models successfully forecast the error data between normalized ancillary and reference rzsm e2 with a high averaged coefficient of determination r2 of approximately 0 98 for all cases the estimated errors between normalized cosmic ray soil moisture against the reference rzsm e1 showed reasonable results for tonzi ranch site with averaged r2 over both validation periods of 0 71 fig 5a and b whereas superior performances were achieved at kendall and sm fc sites with averaged r2 values of 0 99 and 0 96 respectively fig 5c f these results demonstrated that the linear autoregressive model of lagged 12 h hindcasts ar 12 can be used to provide accurate forecasts of error datasets between two parent products and the reference rzsm which is used in the merging framework over the three crnp sites 6 4 2 estimated weighting factors using original linear combination of forecasts the weighting factors w in percentages computed using eq 10 which implied the contribution of cosmic ray soil moisture used in the merged rzsm products are illustrated in the bar charts in fig 6 together with the corresponding crnp effective depth for different validation periods as shown in fig 6 the weights computed using forecasted error datasets grey bars were compared to the optimal weighting factor estimated using the reference error datasets orange bars in particular the estimated weights over period p1 and p2 were 27 and 4 for tonzi ranch 49 and 63 for kendall 7 and 27 for the sm fc site respectively considering all validation periods the absolute difference values between the estimated and optimal weighting factors ranged from 1 to 7 with the most difference 7 present in period p1 and the least difference 1 in period p2 for tonzi ranch site overall the values of estimated weighting factor were close to those of optimal weighting factor with slight errors between the estimated and optimal weights were achieved this result demonstrated that ar 12 model is viable to accurately predict the error datasets which can be used as the inputs for computing the weights in original linear combination method the red line in fig 6 shows the level of equal weights added for each original product and the dashed line demonstrates the in situ measurement depth taking the reference rzsm into account overall there was less contribution of cosmic ray soil moisture added to the merged products compared to the ancillary rzsm for both periods of tonzi ranch and sm fc sites which is expressed in the lower heights of orange bars compared to the red line with the corresponding optimal weights for period p1 and p2 of 20 and 3 for tonzi ranch 5 and 24 for sm fc respectively at kendall site the optimal weights added to cosmic ray soil moisture were higher than those of ancillary rzsm with 52 obtained for period p1 and 58 for period p2 these results imply that a lower weight of cosmic ray soil moisture was gained during study periods when the crnp effective depth including both average and maximum values was shallower than the reference rzsm measurement depth for both periods at tonzi ranch and sm fc sites whereas higher weights were added to cosmic ray soil moisture at kendall site when the crnp effective depths were deeper than those of reference rzsm 6 4 3 time series of root zone soil moisture products fig 7 plots the time series of rzsm produced using the merging framework against the reference rzsm which was obtained by applying horizontal weighting function for soil moisture measurements at deepest depths in comparison to the time series for the exponential filter product an analysis for coefficient of variation cv was also conducted to each rzsm product at each study area to determine how different rzsm products temporally varied across different land covers on the average the highest temporal variation of rzsm was recorded at tonzi ranch site where cv values reached the peak at 42 64 41 75 and 28 35 for reference merging method and exponentially filter based rzsm respectively a moderate variation was obtained at kendall site with cvs of 31 63 for reference rzsm 28 18 for merged rzsm and 27 98 for exponentially filtered rzsm whereas rzsm at sm fc site showed less temporal variation with cv values of 15 98 15 66 and 11 95 for reference merging framework and exponential filter rzsm products respectively in general the results of cv implied that the temporal variation of rzsm changed under different vegetation cover regions where grasslands indicated the highest soil moisture variability over time followed by shrublands and mixed forests among the rzsm estimation methods although the reference rzsm merging framework and exponential filter based rzsm shared the similar patterns only the merged rzsm was able to capture a closer temporal variability to that of the reference rzsm with unbiased measurements whereas the exponential filter based rzsm were biased to the reference in several cases 6 4 4 performance evaluation the validation of rzsm generated from the proposed merging framework against the reference rzsm in comparison with two parent datasets and the exponentially filtered rzsm for the three study sites are illustrated in table 5 with respect to rmse bias and kge according to table 5 the merged rzsm products generally show unbiased measurements for all cases whereas the rmse and kge sets for the merging method during period p1 p2 at tonzi ranch kendall and sm fc sites were 0 014 0 017 0 018 0 023 and 0 004 0 010 m3 m 3 and 0 96 0 97 0 89 0 63 and 0 96 0 88 respectively a comparison with two original products shows that the merged rzsm provided a superior performance for all three crnp sites during both periods with regard to the rzsm estimation techniques the merging framework also outperformed the conventional exponential filter method for almost all cases except for the period p2 at kendall site where although the larger values of rmse 0 029 m3 m 3 and bias 0 017 m3 m 3 for rzsm generated using the exponential filter were obtained its rzsm performed marginally better in term of kge compared to the merged rzsm product with kge values of 0 65 for the exponential filter and 0 63 for the merging method similar validation results are also present in the taylor diagrams fig 8 with respect to r and normalized standard deviation or sdv the sdv which is the ratio between standard deviations of each single product and the reference reveals that the products have more similar temporal variability to the reference when their sdv values are close to 1 where sdv 1 implies a lower temporal variability of products than that of the reference and vice versa as shown in fig 8 the merging method based rzsm outperformed the input soil moisture products and other rzsm estimation methods in almost all cases excluding period p2 at kendall site with r value sets during periods p1 p2 of 0 97 0 97 0 96 0 65 and 0 98 0 93 for tonzi ranch kendall and the sm fc site respectively with sdv values closer to 1 in general over almost all validation periods cosmic ray soil moisture showed higher variability than reference rzsm as demonstrated by sdv values 1 whilst the temporal variability of rzsm products generated from the merging framework and exponential filter were lower than that of the reference one as interpreted with the sdv values 1 however for the kendall site all soil moisture products showed intermediate correlation with reference rzsm for the second period with an approximate average r value of 0 60 period p2 at the kendall site was the only case where the exponential filter provided a better performance compared to merging method and the remaining products r value reached a peak at 0 68 and sdv was closer to 1 fig 8d 7 discussion 7 1 effects of local conditions on merged rzsm soil water content estimated from the crnp showed better agreement with the field mean soil moisture computed by the in situ monitoring network at tonzi ranch which is situated in a grassland dominated area compared to shrubland and densely forested regions of kendall and sm fc sites this result underlines the impact of vegetation especially the hydrogen presence in biomass on the accuracy of crnp measurements andreasen et al 2017 baatz et al 2015 bogena et al 2013 coopersmith et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 the lower accumulation of total aboveground and belowground biomass in grasslands compared to shrublands and forests indicates that less additional hydrogen sources were present within the tonzi ranch crnp footprint and the field average soil moisture was mostly explained by the observed neutron intensity resulting in the highest agreement between crnp measured and field average soil moisture in a grassland region rather than remaining ones discrepancies in temporal variability of rzsm retrievals across different land covers which indicated by the coefficient of variation cv results highlighted the effects of site specific vegetation covers on controlling infiltrated rainfall water the general results referred that the highest temporal variation of rzsm was reported with grassland site whereas the lowest one was in a mixed forest region in particular previous findings demonstrated the superiority in root water uptake rate of grasses compared to forested trees when the fine root length per unit soil volume was around 20 times greater in grasslands rather than in forests jackson et al 1997 james et al 2003 this higher root water uptake rate obtained with grasses led to an increase in soil moisture temporal variation within root zone profile at tonzi ranch site where grasslands is dominant vegetation cover moreover the relationship between canopy density and rainfall interception is also a main factor contributing to the differences in rzsm variation across distinct vegetation cover types the larger rainfall water amount that can pass through low vegetation density of grasslands resulted in a higher variation of field mean soil moisture in this area related to temporal variability of precipitation whereas it tends to be intercepted by massive canopies at forested areas finally larger seasonal soil moisture variation venkatesh et al 2011 and poisson noise of fast neutron counts rivera villarreyes et al 2011 which were captured with longer study period recorded at tonzi ranch might contribute to a higher temporal variability of rzsm at grasslands compared to those from shrubland and mixed forest sites 7 2 robustness of merging framework for improving field scale rzsm with the crnp the lower validation results for both cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm retrieved from a time stable location against the reference rzsm demonstrated that individual original products are not capable of representing field scale rzsm undoubtedly although holding the potential of providing field average soil moisture the crnp is limited in depth and it shows more sensitivity to the first decimeters of the subsurface baroni et al 2018 franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 nguyen et al 2017 regarding the ancillary rzsm independent use of a time stable station might be insufficient to significantly represent the field average rzsm at several complex regions with high degree of heterogeneity brocca et al 2010 ran et al 2017 additionally this explained a limitation of using single time stable locations as soil moisture representatives within the crnp footprint since they were installed distantly to the crnps distance r is greater than 50 m table 1 whereas the non linear weighting method applied in the reference rzsm product fundamentally consider the major contributions from closest point measurements schrön et al 2017 on the other hand the superior validation results of the merged rzsm compared with the two parent products indicates the robust skill of the merging framework in combining the advantages of individual products the original linear combination of forecasts adopted in the merging technique can generate a hybrid product with lower error variances than those of the original ones thereby reducing the large uncertainty of each single product bates and granger 1969 the outperformance of proposed merging framework compared to exponential filter not only revealed its potential application in simulating field scale rzsm but also indicated the limitations of exponential filter technique in particular since the soil water loss due to several important processes such as root water uptake evapotranspiration or deep drainage is not considered in exponential filter this technique is not feasible to fully interpret the physical processes controlling infiltrated water underneath the soil profile manfreda et al 2014 wagner et al 1999 furthermore despite the convenience of exponential filter when only one parameter topt optimized characteristic time length is required to directly convert surface soil moisture signal to rzsm time series this single parameter is sensitive to surface layer soil wetness soil texture and varied under different climate conditions albergel et al 2008 ford et al 2014 wang et al 2017 on the other hand soil characteristics variation with depths low correlation between soil moisture measured at surface and root zone layers and significant discrepancies in site specific conditions are the major factors contributing to high variability of topt retrieved at different calibration periods then leading to the large uncertainties in rzsm estimation using exponential filter ford et al 2014 7 3 the dependence of merged rzsm on the quality of original and reference products the quality of the hybrid rzsm strongly depends on the relationship between parent products and reference rzsm as demonstrated in bates and granger 1969 the original linear combination concept considers the error variances between two single input datasets and the reference and it then takes into account greater contributions from the superior product by giving it a higher weight specifically over the tonzi ranch and sm fc sites where the ancillary rzsm provided better validation results in term of r and sdv fig 8a b e f more weight was given to the ancillary rzsm product fig 6 in contrast for the kendall site cosmic ray soil moisture outperformed the ancillary rzsm during period p2 resulting in a higher weight being added to crnp soil moisture for period p1 ancillary rzsm had a sdv value closer to 1 but cosmic ray soil moisture showed a higher correlation with the reference product thus a nearly equal weight was provided for both input datasets furthermore the change in optimal weights added to cosmic ray soil moisture also related to the crnp effective depth fig 6 in particular over tonzi ranch and sm fc sites the average and maximum values of effective depths for both periods did not exceed the measurement depth of in situ soil moisture where reference rzsm was obtained this led to a smaller weight being added to cosmic ray soil moisture due to the reduced contribution however at kendall site the maximum and mean values of crnp effective depth covered the depth of reference rzsm resulting in nearly similar weights being provided for both input products these results also enhance our motivation that the crnp observation is limited at deeper layers and it requires incorporation of a good ancillary rzsm retrieved from representative point scale in situ sensors for improving field scale rzsm measurements with the promising cosmic ray neutron technique 8 conclusion in line with the suggestion provided by baroni et al 2018 a simple economic and effective merging framework was developed in this study to couple a representative ancillary in situ rzsm into observed cosmic ray soil moisture with the aim of improving field scale rzsm measurement made with the crnp the ancillary rzsm was obtained with a deepest soil moisture observation at the most time stable location within the monitoring network whereas the rzsm from remaining stations were considered to generate a reference rzsm product by applying a relevant spatial weighting method a linear autoregressive model was initially applied to forecast the errors between two input datasets cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm and the reference rzsm then the variances of estimated errors were utilized as the inputs for the original linear combination of forecasts to compute suitable weights for each single product the performance of generated hybrid rzsm in comparison to original datasets and the exponential filter was validated against the reference rzsm product the proposed merging framework was tested across three different environments and a two fold cross validation was applied the results show that impacts of vegetation coverages in distinct land covers particularly the differences in total biomass accumulation root water uptake rate and canopy density on field average rzsm patterns can be revealed with the merging framework procedure the merged rzsm significantly improved two original products in its representation of field scale rzsm based on reducing large uncertainties of each single dataset of the rzsm estimation techniques the merging framework outperformed commonly used exponential filter method demonstrating its robustness in characterizing soil moisture information at the root zone layer the performance of the merging framework strongly depends on the relationship between the parent products and reference rzsm specifically the original linear combination of forecasts employed in the merging framework produced a higher weight with regard to the superior input product furthermore when the crnp effective depth was shallower and unable to cover readings at the measurement depth of the reference rzsm a reduced contribution of cosmic ray soil moisture was added to the hybrid rzsm product and vice versa overall notwithstanding discrepancies between different environments the proposed merging framework shows that its application in other environments is feasible the framework is flexible to extend for merging cosmic ray soil moisture with different independent ancillary datasets retrieved from various sources for example the soil moisture products simulated from land surface model lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2008 umair et al 2018 in the case of unavailable in situ soil moisture networks when several further field scale soil moisture datasets are provided for a given site a pre selection of ancillary rzsm which has higher correlation and lower associated uncertainties to reference dataset is strongly recommended to improve the quality of research outputs this study results provide insights into operational hydrological management using the cosmic ray neutrons technique and could contribute to weather and climate forecast as well as natural disaster mitigation declaration of interest none

6672,accurate estimation of field scale root zone soil moisture rzsm is essential for hydro meteorological and agricultural management the cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is an innovative technique for field scale soil moisture observation however it is limited at deeper depths and requires suitable methods for scaling the crnp effective depth to represent the root zone layer up to 100 cm depth a merging framework was developed in this study for improving field scale rzsm with the crnp via coupling the representative ancillary rzsm information with cosmic ray soil moisture by using ancillary rzsm retrieved at the most time stable location this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets while maintaining scale representativeness a linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets the cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm and a reference product which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location the variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts and subsequently merging the ancillary rzsm and cosmic ray soil moisture performance of the merged rzsm in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter based rzsm over three different environments was evaluated against the reference rzsm product the results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged rzsm and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field scale rzsm measurement compared to other products this study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method with respect to variations of crnp effective depths overall the merging framework is simple to apply enables unrestricted use in different environments and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources keywords cosmic ray soil moisture root zone soil moisture merging framework temporal stability

root zone frequently up to 100 cm depth is a storage variable that controls the partitioning of important hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration choi and jacobs 2007

plant growth and vigor in the ecosystem gonzález zamora et al 2016 santos et al 2014 therefore accurately capturing rzsm variability at relevant scales contributes to effective hydro meteorological

have been developed to predict rzsm from near surface soil moisture at shallower depths and they are fundamentally classified into data assimilation analytical and statistical approaches wang et al 2017 data assimilation generates profile soil moisture by integrating the surface soil water content products ranging from in situ network crnp and remote sensing into hydrological models baatz et al 2017 das and mohanty 2006 dumedah et al 2015 han et al 2015 rosolem et al 2014 however the use of data assimilation is complex due to its high computational cost and its accuracy strongly depends on the quality of numerous model parameters soil properties atmospheric forcing and vegetation coverage etc which may lead to biased estimations of rzsm albergel et al 2008 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 alternatively there is a growing interest in analytical methods which mathematically simulate the physically based relationships of water flows by following the simple water balance assumption such methods have demonstrated the potential of converting surface measurements to profile soil moisture because of their simplicity and higher efficiency albergel et al 2008 manfreda et al 2014 the exponential filter proposed by wagner et al 1999 is a commonly used analytical method that has been successfully applied to different surface soil moisture products over various soil conditions and climatic regions albergel et al 2008 ford et al 2014 peterson et al 2016 however its limitation is that the use of a single input parameter t the characteristic time length in the exponential filter cannot fully represent the influences of physical processes controlling soil moisture variation manfreda et al 2014 statistical methods such as regression models srivastava et al 1997 time stability analysis gao et al 2015 peterson et al 2016 landscape units disaggregation peterson et al 2016 and artificial neural network kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 have been also adopted to characterize the statistical relationship between surface and profile soil moisture of these techniques the simple regression model approach was widely employed in the past however two main drawbacks were present site specific variables showed no clear relationship against regression parameters and the prediction accuracy decreases at deeper depths srivastava et al 1997 the cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for use in field scale rzsm monitoring over a variety of environments which can bridge the scale gap between point measurements made with in situ sensors and large scale observations using remote sensing products bogena et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 zreda et al 2012 2008 in particular the crnp measures low energy fast neutrons generated by collisions of high energy cosmic rays which came to the earth from galactic origin with atmospheric and soil nuclei zreda et al 2012 2008 due to a remarkable inverse correlation between these fast neutrons and the hydrogen atoms which are mostly present in total soil water contents bogena et al 2013 a nonlinear calibration function has been developed to directly convert the fast neutron signal observed at the crnp into soil moisture time series desilets et al 2010 theoretically the crnp is feasible to provide continuous field averaged soil moisture measurement over a footprint of hectares 18 ha at a high frequency e g hourly 6 hr interval etc and the penetration depth which depends on total soil water equivalent soil bulk density and distance from the probe ranging from 15 cm in wet soils and up to 83 cm in dry soil conditions köhli et al 2015 although it holds the potential for use in rzsm measurement the effective depth of the cosmic ray soil moisture product is usually limited due to the sensitivity of the crnp measured neutron signal to other hydrogen sources franz et al 2012 peterson et al 2016 moreover monitoring rzsm with cosmic ray neutron technology is also a challenge since the vertical soil moisture profile was reported as one of the major factors contributing to the large uncertainty of soil moisture measurement when using standalone crnp baroni et al 2018 therefore accurately representing the field scale soil moisture profile variation by extending the crnp measurement depth is in high demand lv et al 2014 peterson et al 2016 although efforts to extend the effective depth of cosmic ray soil moisture to deeper layers has been reported in several previous studies improving rzsm estimation using the crnp has not yet been gained much attention since the direct use of standalone crnp often shows considerable uncertainties caused by surrounding hydrogen sources presence a practical solution for improving field scale rzsm using the crnp is integrating representative point scale in situ soil moisture measurements within its footprint together baroni et al 2018 baroni and oswald 2015 additionally in the context of data limited regions urban complex terrain dense vegetation regions where further soil moisture observations from remote sensing satellites and models are still challenges the standalone field scale soil moisture might be retrieved only by ground based measurements mostly the crnp and in situ network however constructing densely distributed in situ sensors networks at these areas is costly difficult labor and time consuming so that raising a need for optimization of these monitoring networks with few measurement points as a result thanks to the research of vachaud et al 1985 temporal stability of a field mean soil moisture can be identified by a single soil moisture location gao et al 2015 peterson et al 2016 and zhu et al 2017 also demonstrated the potential of the temporal stability analysis in representing field scale rzsm despite the theoretical field average representativeness independent use of time stable location could not fully stand for field mean soil moisture in several complex regions typically heterogeneous areas brocca et al 2010 ran et al 2017 whereas the effects of spatial soil moisture variability on the crnp measurement are trivial baroni et al 2018 nguyen et al 2017 consequently coupling ancillary information of in situ rzsm measured at a time stable location together with the crnp observation is probably be a feasible solution for improving field scale rzsm previous studies have pointed out the feasibility of merging independent resources to produce a more accurate hybrid product that provides a considerable reduction in noise kim et al 2018 2015 yilmaz et al 2012 typically the original linear combination of forecasts which was introduced by bates and granger 1969 can generate a combined product that minimizes the mean square error mse from two original products and is widely used in many hydro meteorological applications in this respect chowdhury and sharma 2011 focused on blending global sea surface temperature forecasts based on dynamic linear combination approaches the linear combination concept was also modified to improve the spatial interpolation of rainfall datasets wasko et al 2013 kim et al 2015 and kim et al 2016 developed a framework in accordance with this technique for combining multiple remote sensing soil moisture products with respect to maximizing temporal correlation in general due to its suitability over diverse disciplines it is reasonable to apply the linear combination concept to merge ancillary time stable location based rzsm into shallower crnp measurements it is important to stress that the original linear combination merges two input datasets the cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm based upon a reference rzsm dataset which is an assumed truth and can be used for validation of the merged product however the reference data used for evaluating the hybrid product during the validation period cannot be involved in the merging framework whereas the original linear combination of forecasts considers the error variances between two input products and the reference therefore to obtain an optimal weight for the merging framework the error datasets need to be accurately predicted since the rzsm usually responds to soil moisture signal at shallower depths after a lag period ford et al 2014 tobin et al 2017 it is reasonable to adopt a linear autoregressive model for forecasting the error datasets between original and reference products relying on their lagged measurements the estimated error datasets were subsequently used to compute the weight for generating merged field scale rzsm overall for the aforementioned reasons this study aimed to develop a simple economic and effective merging framework based on integration of the linear autoregressive model and the original linear combination of forecasts for improving field averaged rzsm measurements made with crnp by merging the ancillary rzsm provided by an in situ time stable location with cosmic ray soil moisture product in particular the specific objectives of this study are to 1 construct a merging framework for improving field scale rzsm measurements obtained with the crnp 2 evaluate the robustness of proposed merging method in estimating field averaged rzsm for different environments compared to the parent products and the exponential filter based rzsm against the reference rzsm and 3 discuss the impacts of original datasets uncertainties on the quality of merged rzsm products with regard to the variation of crnp effective depth 2 study area in this study three experimental sites using the crnps in different environments were selected to test our merging framework with one probe located in each site in particular two study sites consist of two crnps belonging to the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos network in the usa zreda et al 2012 the californian tonzi ranch and arizonan kendall sites whereas the remaining area is located in south korea namely the soil moisture fdr and cosmic ray sm fc site the tonzi ranch site 38 432 n 120 966 w is situated at an altitude of 177 m above sea level a s l in oak savanna in south west america where the terrain is fairly flat and the land cover is mainly grassland the dominant soils are clay loams and loams with bedrock at a depth of around 1 m and the presence of a minimal organic layer the kendall site 31 737 n 109 942 w is located at an elevation of 1548 m a s l within the walnut gulch experimental watershed where the soil texture is primarily loam and the dominant land cover type is shrubland in addition to crnps several in situ soil moisture observations belonging to the soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator soilscape network were located within the crnp footprint the sm fc site 37 292 n 126 966 e installed at an altitude of 46 m a s l in south korea lies within a densely forested area where the dominant climate is humid monsoon this study area has high degree of soil moisture heterogeneity due to the dense vegetation distribution and the reported typical soil textures are sandy loam and loamy sand the soil moisture monitoring network located at sm fc was constructed in late august 2015 and it contains one crnp and ten randomly distributed frequency domain reflectometry fdr stations nguyen et al 2017 fig 1 shows a map of the study areas including locations of crnps and in situ stations and table 1 provides detailed information about each station such as latitude longitude soil texture dominant land covers and distance from in situ station to the crnp 3 datasets 3 1 neutron counts measured by the crnp the crnps installed at tonzi ranch and kendall on may 2011 and june 2010 utilizes the bf3 and he3 neutron detectors respectively fig 1 they provide continuous neutron intensity measurements on an hourly basis thereby contributing to the largest cosmic ray soil moisture network in the usa the cosmos network zreda et al 2012 generally crnps belonging to cosmos network provided data on three different levels level 1 data are raw neutron counts observed from the probe level 2 data are quality controlled neutron counts corrected for local effects including air pressure and incoming neutron intensity and level 3 data are estimated cosmic ray soil moisture from the corrected neutron intensity detailed site information and associated data provided are available from the cosmos website http cosmos hwr arizona edu probes stationdat in this study level 2 data of corrected neutron intensity measured at tonzi ranch and kendall crnps were utilized the crnp located at the sm fc site is crs 1000 b model using bf3 neutron detector providing hourly observation data of fast neutron intensity from september 2015 fig 1 the observed neutron counts of the crnp at the sm fc were corrected based on general correction processes specifically for atmospheric pressure atmospheric water vapor and incoming neutron intensity variations a detailed description of these correction processes for the crnp at sm fc site is fully present in nguyen et al 2017 3 2 in situ soil moisture network measurements as previously mentioned section 2 the in situ soil moisture monitoring networks located within the crnp footprints of tonzi ranch and kendall sites belong to the soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator soilscape network the soilscape network was established to provide a local scale estimate of soil moisture at a high temporal resolution and to validate remote sensing data on a regional scale thereby contributing to the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 for each station within the soilscape network three fdr soil moisture sensors model ec 5 manufactured by decagon devices company were installed at three different depths 5 20 and 50 cm at tonzi ranch and 5 15 and 30 cm at kendall to provide hourly in situ soil water content data regarding the texture analysis for different measurement layers the dominant soil at tonzi ranch site was classified as loams down to a depth of 20 cm and clay loams for the layer of 20 50 cm whereas the topsoil down to 30 cm depth at kendall site was mainly composed by loams in this study a total of 19 stations were situated within the tonzi ranch crnp footprint and 7 stations within the kendall crnp footprint it is important to note that soil moisture measurements at the deepest depth 50 cm for tonzi ranch and 30 cm for kendall were then considered as reference rzsm however several stations provided low quality soil moisture data and a large amount of missing data were excluded therefore only seven stations for tonzi ranch and six stations for kendall site were ultimately used data can be freely accessed through the ismn website https ismn geo tuwien ac at a total of 10 frequency domain reflectometry fdr stations were constructed around the crnp at the sm fc site to support soil moisture measurements in this experimental region the soil texture at sm fc network varied within different fdr stations with four stations fdr 01 fdr 03 fdr 06 and fdr 07 were reported as sandy loams and the others are loamy sands for each station fdr sensors were installed at four different depths 10 20 30 and 50 cm to provide hourly in situ soil water content data from september 2015 from july 2016 nine fdr stations were de installed and a single station fdr 7 which is situated closest to the crnp was maintained for permanent soil moisture observation therefore total data for all stations were only available from september 2015 to june 2016 excluding a 4 month snow period december 2015 to march 2016 in this study because of the large amount of missing data at station fdr 4 and at the deepest depth of 50 cm at several stations only soil moisture measurements at a depth of 30 cm from nine stations excepting station fdr 4 were selected to represent the reference rzsm at the sm fc site detailed information on locations and soil characteristics for selected stations at three study sites are shown in table 1 4 methodology as suggested by baroni et al 2018 coupling representative point scale sensors together with the crnp has the potential to improve field scale rzsm estimation with cosmic ray technology this study aims to propose a simple economic and effective merging framework for extending the crnp effective depth based on combination of cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm retrieved from in situ temporally stable locations the merging framework procedure includes three primary steps first the temporal stability concept was implemented for the in situ network to select a most time stable location as an ancillary rzsm product and the remaining soil moisture stations were determined as the reference rzsm second linear autoregressive models were constructed to provide error estimates between the two parent products and reference data finally the original linear combination of forecasts was applied to merge the ancillary rzsm and the observed crnp soil moisture measurements using optimal weights computed from the estimated error datasets to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method its performance against reference rzsm was compared with two original products and the exponential filter a flowchart of the entire merging framework is shown in fig 2 and detailed descriptions of specific major techniques are presented below 4 1 temporal stability analysis applied for in situ soil moisture network 4 1 1 ancillary root zone soil moisture a single temporally stable location was selected from the in situ network to provide a field mean soil moisture representative following the concept of temporal stability analysis tsa vachaud et al 1985 various metrics have been adopted in previous studies with respect to time stability assessments however this study considered only the index of temporal stability its which includes both the mean mrd and standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd with the criterion that the lowest its values will indicate the time stable location from the in situ soil moisture network a more detailed description of the entire tsa procedure is present in appendix a a tsa was initially applied to separate the in situ soil moisture data into two independent sets a time stable station which was assumed as the ancillary rzsm and the remaining stations for which an appropriate weighting method can be applied to produce the reference rzsm data it is worth noticing that only the soil moisture measured at deepest depths of all the in situ stations within the network were selected to be applied with the tsa based on the assumption that these deepest layer soil moisture products can stand for rzsm measurements at three study sites since previous studies of hu et al 2010 demonstrated that the soil moisture temporal stability increased with increasing soil depth using soil moisture observed at deeper layers is expected to provide more accurate estimation of field mean soil water content rather than using shallow layer soil moisture 5 reference field scale soil moisture the reference field average soil moisture used for calibration and validation of the crnp requires applying relevant weighting methods to in situ measurements that can represent the corresponding neutrons distribution nguyen et al 2017 advanced findings of köhli et al 2015 provided an insight into crnp support volume and their revised weighting method showed the potential to qualify the contribution of the ground based soil moisture observation within the crnp footprint in addition schrön et al 2017 recently updated the study of köhli et al 2015 and provided a more accurate qualification in both vertical and horizontal distributions of neutron flux generally based on this nonlinear weighting method each in situ soil moisture measurement point and depth inside the crnp footprint were delivered with a corresponding horizontal and vertical weighting factors respectively considering the distance from each measurement point to the crnp and impacts of local environmental conditions such as air humidity atmospheric pressure vegetation and moisture contents on neutron distribution hence the revised non linear weighting method present in schrön et al 2017 can be applied to the remaining in situ soil moisture stations apart from the time stable location within the monitoring networks to estimate the reference field average soil moisture at three experimental sites detailed description of the main procedure for computing vertical and horizontal weighting factors was fully provided in köhli et al 2015 and schrön et al 2017 in this present study the near surface soil moisture used for calibrating and validating the crnp product was obtained by applying both vertical and horizontal weighting factors while the reference field scale rzsm used for calibrating the proposed merging framework and exponential filter as well as evaluating different rzsm products was retrieved only by horizontally weighting the in situ soil moisture measurements at an available deepest depth 5 1 field scale soil moisture estimated from the crnp 5 1 1 traditional calibration n0 method it is worth noticing that the raw neutron intensity retrieved from the crnp observation should be corrected for the variations of air pressure atmospheric water vapor and incoming neutron flux prior to apply the calibration detailed descriptions of correction factors computation for these aforementioned variables were fully provided in previous studies nguyen et al 2017 zreda et al 2012 subsequently the cosmic ray soil moisture θ m3m 3 product used in the merging framework can be directly converted from the corrected neutron flux ncorr counts per hour cph via a shape defining calibration function or n0 method proposed by desilets et al 2010 the n0 method which was developed based on the monte carlo n particle extended transport code mcnpx pelowitz 2008 is defined as follows 1 θ a 0 n corr n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ bd where three parameters a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 a2 0 115 are dimensionless and independent of soil chemical composition while the calibration parameter n0 cph which basically depends on site specific conditions represents neutron counts over dry soil and can be obtained via calibration of the crnp desilets et al 2010 it is important to note that the cosmic ray soil moisture product used in this current study represents total soil water content including soil moisture as well as water equivalent from aboveground and belowground biomass soil organic matter and lattice water in addition the effective depth z cm of the crnp which strongly depends on the total soil water content θ bulk density and distance from the crnp can be computed as schrön et al 2017 2 z 1 ρ bd 8 321 0 14249 0 96655 exp 0 01 r 20 0 θ 0 0429 θ where ρbd gcm 3 is an average soil bulk density θ m3m 3 is the total soil water content and r m is the footprint radius corrected for atmospheric pressure and vegetation which is expressed as 3 r r p h veg θ f p f veg θ r in which r is the distance from the crnp to a measurement point within its footprint in this current study we considered the distance between crnp and time stable location as r parameter to compute the effective depth at each site additionally fp and fveg represent correction factors for air pressure and vegetation respectively which can be defined as schrön et al 2017 4 f p 0 4922 0 86 e p 1013 5 f veg 1 0 17 1 e 0 41 h veg 1 e 9 25 θ where p mbar and hveg m are air pressure and vegetation height data respectively which herein can be collected at the field sites 5 1 2 exponential filter in order to compare the proposed merging framework to other rzsm estimation methods a commonly used exponential filter approach introduced by wagner et al 1999 was employed in this present study to characterize the rzsm time series from surface soil moisture signal basically this approach follows the soil water balance equation that assumes the changes in soil water content depending on both positive and negative water fluxes between the two soil layers albergel et al 2008 stroud 1999 proposed a recursive formulation for the original exponential filter which can be written as 6 sw i 2 t i s w i 2 t i 1 k i sw i 1 t i s w i 2 t i 1 where swi1 and swi2 are the soil water indices of layer 1 and layer 2 respectively it is important to note that layer 1 herein implies soil moisture observed from the crnp whereas layer 2 indicates that of root zone layer the gain ki at time ti can be calculated as follows 7 k i k i 1 k i 1 exp t i t i 1 t in which ki ranges from 0 to 1 the values of k1 and swi2 1 were initially set to 1 and swi1 1 respectively overall the exponential filter operation requires calibration for the optimal values of a single parameter t namely the characteristic time length furthermore the trade off between the soil moisture value and swi can be computed as wagner et al 1999 8 θ t θ min s w i t θ max θ min where θmin and θmax are the minimum and maximum soil moisture during the study period 5 2 merging framework for root zone soil moisture estimation the proposed merging framework for coupling representative ancillary rzsm retrieved from a point scale in situ measurement to the crnp measured soil moisture adopted the original linear combination of forecasts concept introduced by bates and granger 1969 this method is expected to generate a superior hybrid product with lower overall error than the individual original datasets when one of these two following criteria are met 1 one forecast is based on variables or information that the other has not considered and or 2 a different assumption of the relationship between variables is made by a forecast bates and granger 1969 kim et al 2015 computation of the linear combination method which requires two unbiased measurements of soil moisture θ1 and θ2 is provided as follows 9 θ merged w θ 1 1 w θ 2 in this study θ1 m3 m 3 is denoted as cosmic ray soil moisture θ2 m3 m 3 is denoted as ancillary rzsm measured at the temporally stable location and θmerged represents the merged rzsm product the weight w in eq 9 which is selected to minimize the error variance of the merged product θmerged is defined as bates and granger 1969 10 w σ 2 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 where σ1 2 and σ2 2 are variances of the errors computed from two original products and the reference and ρ is the pearson s correlation coefficient between their errors additionally to obtain unbiased estimates of θ1 and θ2 the original datasets θ1 and θ2 are normalized such that their mean and standard deviation values are identical to that of the reference data θref following the equation draper et al 2009 11 θ norm θ raw μ θ raw σ θ ref σ θ raw μ θ ref where θnorm is normalized soil moisture of the original data θraw and μ and σ are denoted as the mean and standard deviation respectively the weighted in situ soil moisture measurement except the time stable location was selected as the reference data θref for this study it is worth noting that for a given period computation of an optimal weight in eq 10 requires error datasets between two input and reference products since the error value at the commencement of merging is unknown it is necessary to accurately estimate the error datasets prior to conducting the merging technique assuming that only hindcasts of error data are available it is possible to adopt a linear autoregressive model to forecast the time series of errors relied on these known hindcasts the general form of linear autoregressive model with p order applied for error estimation so called ar p can be present as follows 12 e t i 1 p ϕ i e t i ε t in which et is the estimated error value at time t between a parent soil moisture product and the reference et i is the historical error value at the lagged i hours φi is the corresponding coefficient for et i and εt is denoted as white noise in this study a maximum order of p 12 was selected indicating that the error value at a given time was forecast according to the past 12 hindcasts an appropriate calibration was necessary to construct the ar 12 model before producing error estimates the weight w for the merging technique was then computed from the obtained error datasets for the entire given period 5 3 performance evaluation 5 3 1 cross validation a two fold cross validation was applied in this study to avoid the effects of overfitting problem when calibrating and validating different datasets it turns out that the datasets were separated into two periods of equal sizes and each dataset was one by one used as the calibration and validation periods however the lengths of datasets were not similar between the sites with 2 yr 2013 2014 1 yr 2016 and 6 month data available for tonzi ranch kendall and sm fc sites respectively therefore the years 2013 and 2014 were alternately applied for tonzi ranch site the first six months january june and last six months july december were one by one used for kendall site and the first three month period september november 2015 and last three month period april june 2016 at the sm fc site were respectively used for calibration and validation periods moreover in this study the first and second validation periods of the dataset for each site were denoted as p1 and p2 respectively 5 3 2 validation metrics commonly used root mean square error rmse and bias associated with the modified kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 were utilized in this study to evaluate performance of the proposed merging framework based rzsm in comparison to other rzsm products against the reference rzsm the kge which considers the measures of three different features correlation bias and variability and is defined as follows 13 kge 1 r 1 2 γ 1 2 ε 1 2 where r is the pearson s correlation coefficient γ μ θe μ θr is the bias ratio and ε σ θe μ θe σ θr μ θr is the variability ratio μ θe and μ θr are denoted as average values of estimated and reference soil moisture and σ θe and σ θr correspond to the standard deviations of estimated and reference soil moisture respectively the kge score can range from to 1 where a value of 1 corresponds to a perfect fit furthermore a taylor diagram taylor 2001 was used to represent multiple evaluation statistics in one chart specifically the taylor diagram provides a statistical summary of three different metrics the centered root mean square difference e the correlation coefficient r and the normalized standard deviation ratio of standard deviation between estimated and reference products sdv in this diagram the relationship of these statistical metrics can be characterized as follows 14 e 2 s d v 2 1 2 s d v r where sdv is given as 15 sdv σ θ e σ θ r 6 results 6 1 selection of ancillary root zone soil moisture the selection of ancillary rzsm which was then combined with cosmic ray soil moisture for providing the merged rzsm was implemented following the application of tsa to in situ rzsm measurements at the three experimental sites fig 3 fig 3 shows that the mean relative difference mrd ranged from 53 2 to 31 7 for tonzi ranch 76 9 to 94 6 for kendall and 55 6 to 37 1 for sm fc site whereas the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd for these study areas ranged from 5 6 to 16 8 13 2 to 37 8 and 8 2 to 33 1 respectively at tonzi ranch site its values which were considered as criteria for selecting the time stable location varied between 6 and 55 8 the lowest its value 6 which was recorded at node 401 demonstrated that rzsm provided by this station could be used to represent field scale measurements and it was thus selected as an ancillary rzsm product for the tonzi ranch site fig 3a as regards kendall and sm fc sites the its s ranges were 15 3 97 7 and 11 9 64 7 respectively while the time stable location providing ancillary rzsm for the kendall site was node 1402 with the lowest its value of 15 3 fig 3b and fdr 8 with its of 11 9 fig 3c for the sm fc site the remaining stations at each site could then be used to provide field scale soil moisture reference data 6 2 field scale near surface soil moisture measurement from the crnp relevant calibration according to the n0 method is required to convert neutron intensity measured by the crnp to field average soil moisture the recent findings of heidbuchel et al 2016 illustrated that a two point calibration conducted in both wet and dry conditions can improve the performance of cosmic ray soil moisture retrieval as a result in this study we applied a two point calibration procedure to the three crnp sites both vertical and horizontal weighting functions were applied to generate field scale weighted soil moisture for each area which was used to calibrate and evaluate the performance of cosmic ray soil moisture table 2 provides general calibration and validation information while fig 4 presents time series of cosmic ray soil moisture with corresponding effective depths for the three crnp sites according to table 2 the calibration parameters n0 obtained for tonzi ranch kendall and sm fc was 3247 cph 2770 cph and 1424 cph respectively validation results showed a superior performance at tonzi ranch with r 0 94 rmse 0 027 m3 m 3 bias 0 006 m3 m 3 however reasonable results were recorded at the two remaining sites with r 0 75 rmse 0 035 m3 m 3 bias 0 020 m3 m 3 for the kendall and r 0 77 rmse 0 060 m3 m 3 bias 0 051 m3 m 3 for the sm fc site the generated cosmic ray soil moisture at tonzi ranch site varied between 0 036 0 444 m3 m 3 with a mean value of 0 139 m3 m 3 and a standard deviation of 0 074 m3 m 3 fig 4a whereas fig 4b indicates the range of cosmic ray soil moisture at kendall as 0 033 0 250 m3 m 3 with average value of 0 090 m3 m 3 and standard deviation of 0 040 m3 m 3 for the sm fc site soil moisture retrieved from the crnp ranged from 0 169 to 0 546 m3 m 3 with mean and standard deviation of 0 288 and 0 055 m3 m 3 respectively fig 4c the values of effective depth at tonzi ranch kendall and the sm fc sites ranged from 13 to 47 cm 16 to 44 cm and 10 to 17 cm with corresponding average depths at these study sites of approximately 27 cm 30 cm and 13 cm respectively fig 4 6 3 calibration of optimal t value for exponential filter the exponential filter used for producing rzsm from surface soil moisture requires calibration for the optimal t value topt in this study cosmic ray soil moisture estimated at each crnp can be considered as surface soil moisture and is denoted as layer 1 whereas reference rzsm was selected to provide measurements at layer 2 prior to conducting the calibration soil moisture in both layers was converted to swi using eq 8 in this study the kge was used as a criterion for calibrating the topt whereas the t value which provides the highest kge compared to the reference rzsm was selected as the topt for each site in addition as with the merging framework a two fold cross validation was also adopted with the exponential filter table 3 provides general information about the calibration parameters employed in each study period for the three crnp sites the topt values retrieved from the calibration were subsequently utilized in the validation periods to generate rzsm from layer 1 measurements of cosmic ray soil moisture products 6 4 merging framework based on integration of linear autoregressive models and linear combination of forecasts 6 4 1 error estimates using linear autoregressive models a linear autoregressive model of order 12 or ar 12 was adopted to estimate the error time series between two input products and the reference specifically an ar 12 model can provide the prediction of an error value at a given measurement time based on its lagged 12 error hindcasts an ar 12 model calibration was required to define the corresponding coefficients of lagged 12 error values and a two fold cross validation was conducted for each study site table 4 reports the corresponding coefficients of ar 12 generated for each validation datasets at the three crnp areas in this study only statistically significant coefficients at α level of 0 05 p values 0 05 were selected to generate the error time series forecasts assuming that the measurements for the first 12 h of errors are known the obtained ar 12 model was then applied to simulate remaining error values a scatter plot is used fig 5 to show a comparison between the estimated error datasets computed from ar 12 models against reference error datasets for each validation period at the three study sites in general ar 12 models successfully forecast the error data between normalized ancillary and reference rzsm e2 with a high averaged coefficient of determination r2 of approximately 0 98 for all cases the estimated errors between normalized cosmic ray soil moisture against the reference rzsm e1 showed reasonable results for tonzi ranch site with averaged r2 over both validation periods of 0 71 fig 5a and b whereas superior performances were achieved at kendall and sm fc sites with averaged r2 values of 0 99 and 0 96 respectively fig 5c f these results demonstrated that the linear autoregressive model of lagged 12 h hindcasts ar 12 can be used to provide accurate forecasts of error datasets between two parent products and the reference rzsm which is used in the merging framework over the three crnp sites 6 4 2 estimated weighting factors using original linear combination of forecasts the weighting factors w in percentages computed using eq 10 which implied the contribution of cosmic ray soil moisture used in the merged rzsm products are illustrated in the bar charts in fig 6 together with the corresponding crnp effective depth for different validation periods as shown in fig 6 the weights computed using forecasted error datasets grey bars were compared to the optimal weighting factor estimated using the reference error datasets orange bars in particular the estimated weights over period p1 and p2 were 27 and 4 for tonzi ranch 49 and 63 for kendall 7 and 27 for the sm fc site respectively considering all validation periods the absolute difference values between the estimated and optimal weighting factors ranged from 1 to 7 with the most difference 7 present in period p1 and the least difference 1 in period p2 for tonzi ranch site overall the values of estimated weighting factor were close to those of optimal weighting factor with slight errors between the estimated and optimal weights were achieved this result demonstrated that ar 12 model is viable to accurately predict the error datasets which can be used as the inputs for computing the weights in original linear combination method the red line in fig 6 shows the level of equal weights added for each original product and the dashed line demonstrates the in situ measurement depth taking the reference rzsm into account overall there was less contribution of cosmic ray soil moisture added to the merged products compared to the ancillary rzsm for both periods of tonzi ranch and sm fc sites which is expressed in the lower heights of orange bars compared to the red line with the corresponding optimal weights for period p1 and p2 of 20 and 3 for tonzi ranch 5 and 24 for sm fc respectively at kendall site the optimal weights added to cosmic ray soil moisture were higher than those of ancillary rzsm with 52 obtained for period p1 and 58 for period p2 these results imply that a lower weight of cosmic ray soil moisture was gained during study periods when the crnp effective depth including both average and maximum values was shallower than the reference rzsm measurement depth for both periods at tonzi ranch and sm fc sites whereas higher weights were added to cosmic ray soil moisture at kendall site when the crnp effective depths were deeper than those of reference rzsm 6 4 3 time series of root zone soil moisture products fig 7 plots the time series of rzsm produced using the merging framework against the reference rzsm which was obtained by applying horizontal weighting function for soil moisture measurements at deepest depths in comparison to the time series for the exponential filter product an analysis for coefficient of variation cv was also conducted to each rzsm product at each study area to determine how different rzsm products temporally varied across different land covers on the average the highest temporal variation of rzsm was recorded at tonzi ranch site where cv values reached the peak at 42 64 41 75 and 28 35 for reference merging method and exponentially filter based rzsm respectively a moderate variation was obtained at kendall site with cvs of 31 63 for reference rzsm 28 18 for merged rzsm and 27 98 for exponentially filtered rzsm whereas rzsm at sm fc site showed less temporal variation with cv values of 15 98 15 66 and 11 95 for reference merging framework and exponential filter rzsm products respectively in general the results of cv implied that the temporal variation of rzsm changed under different vegetation cover regions where grasslands indicated the highest soil moisture variability over time followed by shrublands and mixed forests among the rzsm estimation methods although the reference rzsm merging framework and exponential filter based rzsm shared the similar patterns only the merged rzsm was able to capture a closer temporal variability to that of the reference rzsm with unbiased measurements whereas the exponential filter based rzsm were biased to the reference in several cases 6 4 4 performance evaluation the validation of rzsm generated from the proposed merging framework against the reference rzsm in comparison with two parent datasets and the exponentially filtered rzsm for the three study sites are illustrated in table 5 with respect to rmse bias and kge according to table 5 the merged rzsm products generally show unbiased measurements for all cases whereas the rmse and kge sets for the merging method during period p1 p2 at tonzi ranch kendall and sm fc sites were 0 014 0 017 0 018 0 023 and 0 004 0 010 m3 m 3 and 0 96 0 97 0 89 0 63 and 0 96 0 88 respectively a comparison with two original products shows that the merged rzsm provided a superior performance for all three crnp sites during both periods with regard to the rzsm estimation techniques the merging framework also outperformed the conventional exponential filter method for almost all cases except for the period p2 at kendall site where although the larger values of rmse 0 029 m3 m 3 and bias 0 017 m3 m 3 for rzsm generated using the exponential filter were obtained its rzsm performed marginally better in term of kge compared to the merged rzsm product with kge values of 0 65 for the exponential filter and 0 63 for the merging method similar validation results are also present in the taylor diagrams fig 8 with respect to r and normalized standard deviation or sdv the sdv which is the ratio between standard deviations of each single product and the reference reveals that the products have more similar temporal variability to the reference when their sdv values are close to 1 where sdv 1 implies a lower temporal variability of products than that of the reference and vice versa as shown in fig 8 the merging method based rzsm outperformed the input soil moisture products and other rzsm estimation methods in almost all cases excluding period p2 at kendall site with r value sets during periods p1 p2 of 0 97 0 97 0 96 0 65 and 0 98 0 93 for tonzi ranch kendall and the sm fc site respectively with sdv values closer to 1 in general over almost all validation periods cosmic ray soil moisture showed higher variability than reference rzsm as demonstrated by sdv values 1 whilst the temporal variability of rzsm products generated from the merging framework and exponential filter were lower than that of the reference one as interpreted with the sdv values 1 however for the kendall site all soil moisture products showed intermediate correlation with reference rzsm for the second period with an approximate average r value of 0 60 period p2 at the kendall site was the only case where the exponential filter provided a better performance compared to merging method and the remaining products r value reached a peak at 0 68 and sdv was closer to 1 fig 8d 7 discussion 7 1 effects of local conditions on merged rzsm soil water content estimated from the crnp showed better agreement with the field mean soil moisture computed by the in situ monitoring network at tonzi ranch which is situated in a grassland dominated area compared to shrubland and densely forested regions of kendall and sm fc sites this result underlines the impact of vegetation especially the hydrogen presence in biomass on the accuracy of crnp measurements andreasen et al 2017 baatz et al 2015 bogena et al 2013 coopersmith et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 the lower accumulation of total aboveground and belowground biomass in grasslands compared to shrublands and forests indicates that less additional hydrogen sources were present within the tonzi ranch crnp footprint and the field average soil moisture was mostly explained by the observed neutron intensity resulting in the highest agreement between crnp measured and field average soil moisture in a grassland region rather than remaining ones discrepancies in temporal variability of rzsm retrievals across different land covers which indicated by the coefficient of variation cv results highlighted the effects of site specific vegetation covers on controlling infiltrated rainfall water the general results referred that the highest temporal variation of rzsm was reported with grassland site whereas the lowest one was in a mixed forest region in particular previous findings demonstrated the superiority in root water uptake rate of grasses compared to forested trees when the fine root length per unit soil volume was around 20 times greater in grasslands rather than in forests jackson et al 1997 james et al 2003 this higher root water uptake rate obtained with grasses led to an increase in soil moisture temporal variation within root zone profile at tonzi ranch site where grasslands is dominant vegetation cover moreover the relationship between canopy density and rainfall interception is also a main factor contributing to the differences in rzsm variation across distinct vegetation cover types the larger rainfall water amount that can pass through low vegetation density of grasslands resulted in a higher variation of field mean soil moisture in this area related to temporal variability of precipitation whereas it tends to be intercepted by massive canopies at forested areas finally larger seasonal soil moisture variation venkatesh et al 2011 and poisson noise of fast neutron counts rivera villarreyes et al 2011 which were captured with longer study period recorded at tonzi ranch might contribute to a higher temporal variability of rzsm at grasslands compared to those from shrubland and mixed forest sites 7 2 robustness of merging framework for improving field scale rzsm with the crnp the lower validation results for both cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm retrieved from a time stable location against the reference rzsm demonstrated that individual original products are not capable of representing field scale rzsm undoubtedly although holding the potential of providing field average soil moisture the crnp is limited in depth and it shows more sensitivity to the first decimeters of the subsurface baroni et al 2018 franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 nguyen et al 2017 regarding the ancillary rzsm independent use of a time stable station might be insufficient to significantly represent the field average rzsm at several complex regions with high degree of heterogeneity brocca et al 2010 ran et al 2017 additionally this explained a limitation of using single time stable locations as soil moisture representatives within the crnp footprint since they were installed distantly to the crnps distance r is greater than 50 m table 1 whereas the non linear weighting method applied in the reference rzsm product fundamentally consider the major contributions from closest point measurements schrön et al 2017 on the other hand the superior validation results of the merged rzsm compared with the two parent products indicates the robust skill of the merging framework in combining the advantages of individual products the original linear combination of forecasts adopted in the merging technique can generate a hybrid product with lower error variances than those of the original ones thereby reducing the large uncertainty of each single product bates and granger 1969 the outperformance of proposed merging framework compared to exponential filter not only revealed its potential application in simulating field scale rzsm but also indicated the limitations of exponential filter technique in particular since the soil water loss due to several important processes such as root water uptake evapotranspiration or deep drainage is not considered in exponential filter this technique is not feasible to fully interpret the physical processes controlling infiltrated water underneath the soil profile manfreda et al 2014 wagner et al 1999 furthermore despite the convenience of exponential filter when only one parameter topt optimized characteristic time length is required to directly convert surface soil moisture signal to rzsm time series this single parameter is sensitive to surface layer soil wetness soil texture and varied under different climate conditions albergel et al 2008 ford et al 2014 wang et al 2017 on the other hand soil characteristics variation with depths low correlation between soil moisture measured at surface and root zone layers and significant discrepancies in site specific conditions are the major factors contributing to high variability of topt retrieved at different calibration periods then leading to the large uncertainties in rzsm estimation using exponential filter ford et al 2014 7 3 the dependence of merged rzsm on the quality of original and reference products the quality of the hybrid rzsm strongly depends on the relationship between parent products and reference rzsm as demonstrated in bates and granger 1969 the original linear combination concept considers the error variances between two single input datasets and the reference and it then takes into account greater contributions from the superior product by giving it a higher weight specifically over the tonzi ranch and sm fc sites where the ancillary rzsm provided better validation results in term of r and sdv fig 8a b e f more weight was given to the ancillary rzsm product fig 6 in contrast for the kendall site cosmic ray soil moisture outperformed the ancillary rzsm during period p2 resulting in a higher weight being added to crnp soil moisture for period p1 ancillary rzsm had a sdv value closer to 1 but cosmic ray soil moisture showed a higher correlation with the reference product thus a nearly equal weight was provided for both input datasets furthermore the change in optimal weights added to cosmic ray soil moisture also related to the crnp effective depth fig 6 in particular over tonzi ranch and sm fc sites the average and maximum values of effective depths for both periods did not exceed the measurement depth of in situ soil moisture where reference rzsm was obtained this led to a smaller weight being added to cosmic ray soil moisture due to the reduced contribution however at kendall site the maximum and mean values of crnp effective depth covered the depth of reference rzsm resulting in nearly similar weights being provided for both input products these results also enhance our motivation that the crnp observation is limited at deeper layers and it requires incorporation of a good ancillary rzsm retrieved from representative point scale in situ sensors for improving field scale rzsm measurements with the promising cosmic ray neutron technique 8 conclusion in line with the suggestion provided by baroni et al 2018 a simple economic and effective merging framework was developed in this study to couple a representative ancillary in situ rzsm into observed cosmic ray soil moisture with the aim of improving field scale rzsm measurement made with the crnp the ancillary rzsm was obtained with a deepest soil moisture observation at the most time stable location within the monitoring network whereas the rzsm from remaining stations were considered to generate a reference rzsm product by applying a relevant spatial weighting method a linear autoregressive model was initially applied to forecast the errors between two input datasets cosmic ray soil moisture and ancillary rzsm and the reference rzsm then the variances of estimated errors were utilized as the inputs for the original linear combination of forecasts to compute suitable weights for each single product the performance of generated hybrid rzsm in comparison to original datasets and the exponential filter was validated against the reference rzsm product the proposed merging framework was tested across three different environments and a two fold cross validation was applied the results show that impacts of vegetation coverages in distinct land covers particularly the differences in total biomass accumulation root water uptake rate and canopy density on field average rzsm patterns can be revealed with the merging framework procedure the merged rzsm significantly improved two original products in its representation of field scale rzsm based on reducing large uncertainties of each single dataset of the rzsm estimation techniques the merging framework outperformed commonly used exponential filter method demonstrating its robustness in characterizing soil moisture information at the root zone layer the performance of the merging framework strongly depends on the relationship between the parent products and reference rzsm specifically the original linear combination of forecasts employed in the merging framework produced a higher weight with regard to the superior input product furthermore when the crnp effective depth was shallower and unable to cover readings at the measurement depth of the reference rzsm a reduced contribution of cosmic ray soil moisture was added to the hybrid rzsm product and vice versa overall notwithstanding discrepancies between different environments the proposed merging framework shows that its application in other environments is feasible the framework is flexible to extend for merging cosmic ray soil moisture with different independent ancillary datasets retrieved from various sources for example the soil moisture products simulated from land surface model lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2008 umair et al 2018 in the case of unavailable in situ soil moisture networks when several further field scale soil moisture datasets are provided for a given site a pre selection of ancillary rzsm which has higher correlation and lower associated uncertainties to reference dataset is strongly recommended to improve the quality of research outputs this study results provide insights into operational hydrological management using the cosmic ray neutrons technique and could contribute to weather and climate forecast as well as natural disaster mitigation declaration of interest none

6673,submarine groundwater discharge sgd acts as major pathway to transport solute laden terrestrial sourced fresh groundwater as well as re circulated marine water to the global oceans the study area bay of bengal bob a part of the indian ocean receives one of world s highest terrestrial riverine fresh water discharge sediment and solute flux from the adjacent himalayan and cratonic south asia thus together with the monsoon dominated tropical climate it forms one of the most complicated productive and interactive global hydrological systems however understanding such topical phenomena needs intricate mechanistic understanding based on high resolution data which are barely available from the bob delineation of stable isotopic and chemical signature of hydrologic sourced components in the sgd to the bob would help to identify the intra annual to diurnal scale impact of seasonality and tidal cycles as well as interactions with other surface water bodies this study provides one of the first documentation of such high resolution temporally variable stable isotope patterns of sgd in coastal systems of the bob and possibly of any tropical ocean during post monsoon season the discharging groundwater was observed to have depleted δ18o ranges 2 12 to 4 19 and low cl concentrations 745 to 11 500 ppm seepage water which is closely associated with the groundwater δ18o composition 3 18 to 4 05 and cl content 775 to 5900 ppm range in pre monsoon season depleted δ18o values suggests that regional groundwater contributes up to 45 m from high tide line htl up to 88 and re circulated seawater sourced sgd dominates 45 m to 110 m extent of study transect offshore in post monsoon season terrestrial sourced groundwater predominates the sgd composition up to 99 till 110 m changes in δ18o and cl content in pre monsoon season indicates enhanced infiltration of seawater in the seepage face due to lower terrestrial sourced freshwater discharge whereas in post monsoon terrestrial sourced resident freshwater dominates in the seepage face the study suggests that sgd are sourced to interactions between local regional hydrological systems and do reflect their compositional variability it also provides insight of influencing physico chemical mechanisms ranging from seasonal to daily tidal time scales the outcome of this study thus may provide intricate insights in delineating the coastal hydrologic and biogeochemical processes as well as detecting carbon sinks nutrient sources and primary productivity in a tropical ocean keywords hydrodynamics coastal hydrology seawater sgd porewater india 1 introduction the interaction of two largest hydrologic systems groundwater and sea water take place in the coastal areas either by sea water intrusion or submarine groundwater discharge sgd groundwater discharge has been suggested to be an important source of nutrients contaminants and trace elements to the coastal ocean cooper et al 1964 burnett et al 2003 slomp and van cappellen 2004 tamborski et al 2017 and is potentially largely influenced by the dynamics of the hydrological cycle mukherjee et al 2007 however the knowledge of the physical mechanisms controlling these dynamics and their impact on discharge are limited michael et al 2005 the most comprehensive definition of sgd suggests any and all flow of water on continental margins from the sea bed to the coastal ocean with scale lengths of meters to kilometers regardless of fluid composition or driving forces moore 2010 sgd comprises of both terrestrial sourced t sgd and re circulated marine sourced water m sgd which vary in spatio temporal scales santos et al 2012 rocha et al 2016 tamborski et al 2017 debnath et al 2018 petermann et al 2018 and being substantially driven by the precipitation seasonal and tidal cycles adjoining fresh water flux through fluvial systems etc edmunds 2003 michael et al 2005 santos et al 2009 the understanding of different

transfer of solutes through these terrestrial and re circulated marine pathways alter the original chemical and or isotopic signature in a non uniform way along the discharge path slomp and van cappellen 2004 the measurement and delineation of source components of sgd are not always possible by direct measurement techniques like seepage meter which is a reasonably efficient method for measurements of sgd flux to sea debnath and mukherjee 2016 seepage meter measurements alone may not be able to differentiate the multiple source contribution to sgd because seawater circulates through the seepage face of coastal areas povinec et al 2008a b moreover the spatial and temporal complexities in solute concentration associated with sgd make the quantification process difficult consequently natural tracers are being increasingly getting used in sgd studies burnett et al 2003 baudron et al 2015 the application of isotopes like 87 86sr 222ra and other radioisotopes are widely accepted in sgd studies cable et al 1996 swarzenski et al 2007 tamborski et al 2017 petermann et al 2018 chakrabarti et al 2018 and are providing reliable proxies for solute sources on the contrary stable isotopes such as δ18o are widely used in groundwater studies to delineate hydrological and climatic regime povinec et al 2008a b schiavo et al 2009 povinec et al 2012 lian et al 2013 stalker et al 2014 applications of δ18o have also been widely recorded in the coastal areas but mostly for recharge source evaluation and mixing processes schiavo et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2007 however they have only been very limitedly used in sgd studies to understand the source of the discharging groundwater povinec et al 2008a b lian et al 2013 rocha et al 2016 the bay of bengal bob a land ward extension of the indian ocean in the indian subcontinent serves as the discharge zone of several major rivers including the himalayan mega river system ganges brahmaputra meghna which forms the

additionally the coastal bob also hosts some of the densest human population of the world mukherjee 2018 hence understanding of hydrological interactions in the broad area becomes imperative to understand the present day ecological sustainability as well as resilience of one of the most climate change sensitive coastal areas notwithstanding this significance information on the sgd to the bob and its relationship to the other waters to the bob are limited debnath et al 2016 debnath and mukherjee 2016 with barely any information on the interactions between the atmospheric and surface fresh

hydrological cycle of a tropical coast in the south asia and elsewhere 2 methodology 2 1 study site the eastern coast of india is dominated by the freshwater flux both from the surface water and groundwater in the form of sgd this fresh water flux plays a crucial role by transporting nutrients to the sea which controls the productivity of ocean ecosystem flux of river ganges brahmaputra to

respective seasons debnath et al 2016 debnath et al 2018 the maximum discharge rate was at 5 m offshore from htl and was found to be 0 15 m3 m 2 h 1 for pre monsoon and 0 25 m3 m 2 h 1 for post monsoon seasons the highest discharge rate was observed in day 2 and day 15 of 16 experimental days of the lunar tidal cycle debnath and mukherjee 2016 along with the sgd estimated annual solute

mechanism between terrestrially sourced groundwater and the seawater on a larger scale involves two or more discrete end members due to convergence of multiple source water in discharging flow path in this work the mixing component in the discharging groundwater have been estimated by using two component end member mixing model following the numerical equation of stichler et al 1986 yehdegho et al 1997 it was assumed that the discharged groundwater seepage meter samples comprises of two components i e terrestrially sourced fresh groundwater gw and recirculates seawater sw in the numerical equation the fraction of discharge water has been expressed by eq 1 1 f sgd 1 f gw f sw where sgd denotes discharging water mainly seepage meter samples which have been considered here for mixing analysis gw and sw stands for groundwater and seawater respectively in this two component endmember mixing model f stands for the fraction of source water to find out the f sw and f gw contribution to f sgd we assumed δ18o composition as a conservative tracer which is not usually removed from the system f sw was calculated by the weighing up the seawater contribution from the sgd sample δ18o composition δ18osgd and the terrestrial fresh groundwater δ18o composition δ18ogw in a solute mass balance equation eq 2 output of f sw from the generic mass balance equation was used in eq 1 to get

observed at 110 m offshore distance 6246 ppm and lowest in 5 m offshore distance 871 ppm in post monsoon season highest na 5439 ppm content was observed at 110 m offshore distance and lower concentration at 5 m offshore distance 818 ppm highest cl content 13 461 ppm was observed at 110 m offshore distance in pre monsoon season and lowest 745 ppm at 5 m offshore distance in post monsoon season fig 3 comparatively cl and na concentration of discharging water was observed to be lower in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season 3 1 2 stable isotopic signature a seasonal variability the porewater temporal variability for δ18o signature ranges from 5 86 to 1 17 and δd ranges from 48 to 2 8 within the hydrologic year of 2014 15 fig 3 table 1 the post monsoonal and monsoonal porewater isotope data were found to be highly depleted in composition δ18o 4 0 located up to 40 m offshore zones near shore zone fig 3 fig 4 samples with lower depletion δ18o ranges 2 to 4 were observed in mid transect zone 40 60 m offshore beyond 60 m 60 100 m offshore offshore zone most of the porewater samples were found to be isotopically heavier δ18o 2 fig 4 which varies seasonally collected seepage water samples from htl to 110 m offshore distance was more depleted δ18o in post monsoon 4 19 to 2 12 than pre monsoon seasons 2 93 to 0 54 table 2 b diurnal variability across tidal cycle in diurnal scale isotopic composition range of seepage water are found to be much more enriched at high tide than at low tide time in both seasons fig 4a and b table 2 but in seasonal scale during both ht and lt time sgd has been observed isotopically depleted in post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season fig 4 spatially and temporally the range of isotopic depletion of discharging water extended up to 70 m on new moon day and up to 40 m offshore on the full moon day fig 4 3 2 regional hydrological components 3 2 1 rainwater global meteoric water line gmwl was plotted after craig 1961 to identify the meteoric water contribution in this interaction process fig 6 the local meteoric water line lmwl was constructed through linear regression of the rain water isotopic composition collected during this study the slope 6 56 of lmwl δd 6 56 δ18o 1 25 r2 0 99 is lower than the gmwl whereas the slope of regional meteoric water line rmwl for the bengal basin is 7 2 δd 7 2 δ18o 7 7 r2 0 93 mukherjee et al 2007 the isotopic variability of rainfall in regional scale is close to the reported study of sengupta and sarkar 2006 and mukherjee et al 2007 the slope of multi depth porewater in post monsoon season is 7 36 δd 7 36 δ18o 1 98 r2 0 96 and in pre monsoon season is 6 64 δd 6 64 δ18o 1 94 r2 0 97 fig 6 whereas for seepage water samples slope in post monsoon season is 4 42 δd 4 42 δ18o 16 32 r2 0 91 and in pre monsoon season is 4 65 δd 4 65 δ18o 17 55 r2 0 89 which deviated from the gmwl rmwl and lmwl fig 7 3 2 2 groundwater river water and sea water the δ18o composition of studied groundwater samples are more depleted in post monsoon season 4 06 to 3 18 than pre monsoon season 2 70 to 2 55 cl concentration of regional groundwater samples were found to be within the range from 832 to 3831 ppm in pre monsoon and 775 to 3211 ppm in post monsoon season the river bhagirathi hooghly samples δ18o of 5 4 to 8 8 were found to be more depleted than the river buribalam 4 1 to 5 6 and river subarnarekha 3 4 to 4 8 respectively seawater samples showed narrow δ18o range of 0 85 to 0 9 and 0 087 to 0 095 for pre and post monsoon seasons the seasonal variations of δ18o signature of bob in relation to salinity are similar to the reported study of sengupta et al 2013 3 2 3 geochemistry of regional hydrologic components the annual average seawater salinity was found to be as 34 2 ppt with a maximum in pre monsoon season 41 5 ppt and minimum in monsoon season 16 3 ppt the salinity of the local groundwater samples were found to be in the range of 0 3 1 7 ppt with a maximum 1 7 ppt in the pre monsoon season and minimum 0 2 ppt in the post monsoon season cl content of collected groundwater samples were within the range of 832 6441 ppm in pre monsoon season and 775 5934 ppm in post monsoon season salinity of the collected monsoonal river water samples ranged between 0 1 and 5 2 ppt with a maximum in the mouth strip of buribalam river salinity of river bhagirathi hooghly was observed within the range of 0 1 0 18 ppt with an average of 0 15 ppt cl content of river bhagirathi hooghly was found to be within the range from upstream 1 7 ppm to downstream 93 28 ppm 3 3 mixing of different hydrologic components with sgd from stable water isotopic signature the average of δ18o composition of the regional groundwater gw was found to be 2 60 and 3 69 and average seawater sw δ18o composition was 1 92 and 0 09 for the pre and post monsoon season are considered in the present study to estimate the mixing proportion the δ18o composition of the seepage water samples sgd across the transect ranged from 2 89 to 1 77 in pre monsoon season and 4 51 to 2 80 in post monsoon season fig 3 to estimate the fraction of respective hydrological components of the discharging groundwater sgd mean seasonal δ18o composition of regional groundwater gw and seawater sw was applied in eq 1 and 2 from the end member mixing analysis it was observed that from htl to 45 m offshore distance f gw contributes 88 to 50 with highest at 25 m f gw 99 93 in pre monsoon season f sw contributes to discharging water 97 37 at 50 110 m offshore distance in pre monsoon season whereas in post monsoon season f gw contributes 91 at htl with highest 99 27 at 50 m offshore distance f sw contributes highest 24 at 40 m offshore distance in post monsoon season fig 8 f gw contribution in discharging groundwater was recoded highest in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season 4 discussion 4 1 sgd sources and mixing process 4 1 1 terrestrial and marine sourced sgd the seasonal variation of porewater δ18o composition and cl content with depth and offshore distance is presented in fig 4 δ18o composition was observed to be more depleted in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season gradually δ18o composition was getting depleted with the depth in both season but highest values were recorded in post monsoon season cl concentration was getting lower from the offshore towards htl and with increasing depth in post monsoon season porewater with lower cl concentration have relatively more depleted δ18o value than pre monsoon season fig 4 which is close to the regional groundwater δ18o composition similarly a significant variation of δ18o signature of seepage water was observed with tidal cycle and offshore distance seepage water samples have much depleted δ18o values with low cl concentration up to 45 m offshore distance in post monsoon than pre monsoon season fig 3a b distribution of cl and δ18o along depth and offshore distance suggests that circulation of seawater was taking place at the top layer up to a depth of 30 cm bsbl at htl in pre monsoon season whereas in post monsoon season circulation of seawater takes place within the depth of 15 cm the depleted δ18o and lower cl concentration on post monsoon season than pre monsoon season suggests that the terrestrially derived fresh water discharge was dominant in post monsoon season which controls the sgd rate and also involves in flushing out the saline water to the ocean the monsoonal porewater isotopic composition with low salinity is close to the groundwater regime while rest of the porewater salinity 4 ppt exist near to the monsoonal seawater regime the relatively high enrichment of δ18o in porewater has been observed in most of the far offshore samples beyond 40 m offshore this trend is consistent with the associated non conservative mixing processes between groundwater and seawater hence the seasonal isotope data suggests different aspects of local water balance a pre monsoonal porewater indicates seawater infiltration high evaporation rates might be due to the atmospheric temperature effects on the upper portion of the sediment b post monsoonal porewater indicates a net terrestrial input from regional groundwater sources and c monsoonal porewater indicates that the less saline monsoonal seawater probably diluted due large river water flux across east coast of india infiltrates into the intertidal zone and mixes with the groundwater and again discharges into the ocean 4 1 2 meteoric water influx porewater δd and d excess signatures fig 9 a and b conformed local meteoric sources input at the near shore location and the marine component input at far offshore within studied distance it indicates regional groundwater have dominant influence on discharging process within near shore zone where discharge rate was high and have less influence with increasing offshore distance but the rate of groundwater discharge and isotope signature varies seasonally depending on local meteoric input terrestrial water load and regional river water flux to sea the seasonal variation of the d excess values clearly indicates that the driver and sources of the porewater inputs varied seasonally however the magnitudes of variation in terms of absolute value are subjected to the evaporative enrichment and exposure time of evaporation thus d excess pattern and δ18o signature of discharging water in different season would lead to fingerprint the influence of regional hydrological cycle on the interaction process this information also helps to identify the distinct nature of sgd across the east coast of india and the discharging pathways into the system 4 2 influence of hydrological systems on sgd isotopic composition 4 2 1 influence of seasonal and tidal cycles the seasonal variation of isotopic signature of porewater regional groundwater and seawater with the lmwl figs 6 and 7 clearly demonstrates discharging groundwater in post monsoon season was highly influenced by the local meteoric sources the post monsoonal porewater isotopic values are close to the regional groundwater isotopic signature that indicates discharging groundwater is sourced from meteoric recharge except the re circulated seawater during high tide time the deviation of the early pre monsoon and monsoonal porewater signature from the lmwl suggested some evaporation occurred prior and during re circulation of sea water enrichment of porewater samples was also be a result of the pre monsoon rain or evaporated seawater rocha et al 2016 the stable isotope composition of seepage water groundwater and porewater within the inter tidal zone also varies within the tidal cycle the isotopic range of seepage water samples was found to be much wider at low tide compared to the high tide variation of isotopic composition in the pre monsoonal tidal cycle exactly mirrors the post monsoonal tidal cycle but showed more isotopic enrichment for high tide period therefore sgd at high tide time was comprised mostly of re circulated brackish water than low tide time at new moon day of both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons δ18o signatures of seepage water were found to be depleted as compared to the full moon day fig 5 the enrichment of δ18o in the seepage water during full moon day might be due to the enhanced brackish water recirculation at the inter tidal zone the diurnal δ18o signatures of the seepage water within the lunar tidal cycle demonstrate that the pre monsoonal seepage water samples were more enriched compared to the post monsoon season fig 5 porewater samples from the near shore area were found to be more depleted during low tide time and showed similar seasonal variation like seepage water samples during low tide the freshwater mass joins from the landward side to the seawater as a result the isotopic signature of the porewater and seepage water up to 40 m offshore were found to be very close to the regional groundwater signature figs 6 and 7 this phenomenon suggesting meteoric sourced water from the landward side discharges at inter tidal zone as part of the terrestrially derived sgd daily variation of isotopic enrichment during lunar tidal cycle was calculated as seasonal drift sd where sd is the difference of δ18o between the respective tidal day of post and pre monsoon season the maximum sd 2 75 was observed on day 3 of the lunar tidal cycle period and the minimum sd 0 6 on day 16 of the lunar tidal cycle the groundwater samples in the vicinity of bob showed similar δ18o signature like seepage water within the tidal cycle the isotopic pattern of the groundwater within the tidal cycle with multi depth porewater and seepage water provides the evidence of hydraulic connection between groundwater and sea water figs 3 4 therefore tidal pumping varying by diurnal to seasonal scale is responsible for re circulation of seawater within the discharging groundwater flowpath however the similarity in pattern of the δ18o signatures within the lunar tidal cycles during pre and post monsoon season signifies the tidal set up as a major triggering factor that have a control on sgd composition in the seepage face such mechanisms have been recently explored in adjoin inland areas by burgess et al 2017 suggesting the influence of matrix compressibility on groundwater level heterogeneity 4 2 2 influence of meteoric water sources lmwl differed significantly from the rmwl and gmwl fig 6 the expression of lmwl was applied for evaluation of the isotopes signature of the discharging groundwater fig 6 the regression lines of pre monsoon and post monsoon porewater were found to be located slightly below the lmwl fig 6 the δd and d excess signatures fig 9 of the multi depth porewater samples collected between 40 and 80 m offshore conformed the brackish water recirculation while the local meteoric water input up to 40 m offshore from htl the isotopic composition of seepage water for the transect c c in both ht and lt time with lmwl are plotted in fig 7 in both diagrams it was observed that porewater and seepage water are depleted with respect to the lmwl during high tide the isotopic signature of both seepage water and porewater were found to be much closer to lmwl which is consistent with seasons 4 3 influence of surface water and seawater on sgd the regional map fig 1a shows that subarnarekha river basin is situated at 30 km ne the bhagirathi hooghly river is about 100 km ne and the bengal basin is 150 km ne from the study site both the bengal and subarnarekha river basin discharge a huge volume of freshwater to the bob during monsoon season accounted as river freshwater flux to the bob the annual discharge rate through the ganga brahmaputra meghna and bhagirathi hooghly basin is 2200 km3 yr dutta and subramanian 1997 of which 75 of the discharge occurs during monsoon season sarin et al 1989 milliman et al 1995 dutta and subramanian 1997 the addition of this huge amount of monsoonal surface water dilutes the salinity of seawater near the coast of bob reflects from the δ18o signature and salinity content although the changes in δ18o signature of bob is related to surface water discharge but its local influence is also identified by the changes in salinity content the isotopic composition of monsoonal porewater demonstrated that most of the low salinity porewater were close to groundwater regime and rest of the porewater salinity 4 ppt were near to the monsoonal seawater regime ironically none of the monsoonal porewater was found to coincide with the defined seawater regime of the study area the depleted isotope signatures of monsoonal porewater demonstrates discharging water mostly contain regional groundwater than sea water 4 4 influence of regional surface water flux on sgd spatial and temporal variation in δ18o values of groundwater and sgd are controlled by a range of geographical and climatic factors such as humidity temperature fluctuations in precipitation evaporation and surface water flux kendall and coplen 2001 in eastern coast of india especially in the coastal areas close to the western bengal basin a progressive decrease was observed in δ18o values of groundwater with latitude which extends towards sothern and south west part mukherjee et al 2007 significant temporal variations in porewater δ18o values indicate that the seasonal and inter annual temperature difference and precipitation evaporation may have some relative influence price et al 2008 relatively low salinity and depleted δ18o values were observed in porewater and seawater during monsoon season which indicates that bob experienced huge volume of local river water flux this regional scale contribution of surface water to this surface water groundwater interaction process was not separately identified but the changes in δ18o and salinity are similar to the local changes the magnitude of regional surface water contribution was might be low to the present study location due to the geographical distance but are connected through the hydrological cycle and sea water of bob the δ18o values of sgd in the study area were comparable to the values observed in the coastal areas of ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm basin by mukherjee et al 2007 suggesting that the groundwater and sgd in this area are influenced by tidal variations and seawater intrusion as a result there is a possibility of enrichment δ18o values in sgd end members during pre monsoon season when observed seawater intrusion rate was found to be maximum debnath and mukherjee 2016 further the eastern coast of india has by large number of rivers and its tributaries which added a huge volume of freshwater influx in this region during monsoon season that could dilute the seawater in the near shore zone of bob there is also a strong indication of evaporative alteration of isotopic composition by river water influx and regional groundwater inputs figs 6 and 7 the influx of river water and regional groundwater may cause changes in gw sw mixing process which lead to change in isotopic composition for our study site most of the monsoonal sgd samples including seawater have been observed with relatively depleted δ18o values compared to the other seasons this observation again indicates regional surface water inputs and its influence on the gw sw mixing process across the discharging pathways in coastal areas of bob however in most of the well known estuarine system of the world researchers observed that the evaporation is the dominant factor over the mixing process of sgd surge and lohmann 2002 dettman et al 2004 stalker et al 2009 gillanders et al 2012 while in case of bob estuarine system the phenomenon is totally reversed this confirms the strong influence of tidal pumping and regional hydrology on the sgd to bob where riverine input is expected to control the transport of sgd in different seasons 4 5 implications of sgd and surface water flux to the bob numbers of studies has been conducted on surface water and groundwater flux estimation to the bob by different isotopic compositions which have a great societal and environmental implication samples from the river bhagirathi hooghly with δ18o values of 5 4 to 8 8 were found to be more depleted in this study when compared to those reported by mukherjee et al 2007 range of 5 7 to 5 6 on the other hand the river buribalam and river subarnarekha have δ18o composition of 4 1 to 5 6 and 3 4 to 4 8 respectively in this present study basu et al 2001 estimated ganges river 87sr 86sr flux to the bob chakrabarti et al 2018 measured 87sr 86sr ratio with salinity and compared with basu et al 2001 study to identify the sgd derived flux which has a significant contribution to strontium budget of bob table 3 changes in the δ18o ratio of sgd river water and seawater showed a similar seasonal trend which may be a projection of significant regional hydraulic connection among groundwater river water and seawater although sgd contributes only 6 10 of the global surface water input to the coastal system our previous study shows sgd have significant contribution of nutrient to the bob 240 mm no3 m2 d1 and 224 mm fe m2 d1 debnath et al 2018 compared to other surface water sources these discharge processes involve in transportation of significant amount of nutrients and the salinity distribution near the coastal area of bob which have control on regional ecosystem dynamics further study in comparison with sgd surface water flux and changes in stable water isotopic composition can contribute seasonal to annual nutrient budget of bob because the bob is already considered to be a less biologically productive system due to limited nutrient supply from indian sub continent singh and chaturvedi 2010 prasanna et al 2002 4 6 comparison of bob δ18o signatures with other global sgd studies a conceptual model of δ18o signature variations with other hydrologic components is summarized in fig 10 the stable isotopic composition of sgd to the bob is a function of different hydrologic components like rain water yasumoto et al 2007 groundwater schiavo et al 2009 river water lian et al 2013 and sea water povinec et al 2012 across all seasons table 4 along with the hydrological influences discharging groundwater have depleted δ18o signature in shallow depths and get enriched with a gradual increase of depth povinec et al 2008a b stalker et al 2014 rocha et al 2016 the δ18o values are highly depleted in the present study than the study at ria formosa lagoon portugal east china sea ubatuba coast south eastern brazil and mauritious island indian ocean povinec et al 2008a b povinec et al 2012 lian et al 2013 rocha et al 2016 while quite similar the celestún lagoon mexico ubatuba coast south eastern brazil and south eastern sicily povinec et al 2008a b schiavo et al 2009 stalker et al 2014 and less depleted signatures than the sgd study at ariake bay japan yasumoto et al 2007 5 conclusion in the present study very high resolution isotopic variability of sgd with major solutes has been documenting and used to identify the major sink of terrestrial sourced fresh water to bob from the world s largest fluvial aquifer system we tried to address these objectives by studying the isotopic composition and solute exchanges between different hydrologic components viz rainwater groundwater porewater seawater and river water in the data scarce eastern coast of india adjoining the bob study results revealed daily to lunar tidal scale variability of the δ18o and cl the signature of sgd are controlled by tide induced pumping in diurnal scale while it varies with seasonal scale depending on terrestrial freshwater load however the similarity of compositional response across temporal scale suggested that physical behavior of the sediments do have a huge impact on the chemical signatures hence the isotopic fingerprint of sgd forms a useful indicator to evaluate the discharge mechanism of sgd in comparison to other hydrological components i e regional hydrogeology tidal pumping and riverine input the sgd to the tropical oceans is dominated by the terrestrial sourced fresh groundwater discharge in post monsoon season and recirculation of infiltrated seawater as marine sourced sgd in pre monsoon season with the highest discharge in either seasons being controlled by lunar tidal processes the terrestrial freshwater discharge is also related to the local to regional hydrologic component reflected from the local to regional isotopic variations the physical coastal dynamics do have a major influence on isotopic fractionation and solute concentration of discharging groundwater which varies spatially based on the sgd source terrestrially derived fresh water discharge dominates within nearshore location in pre monsoon season while it extended up to the offshore location from htl thus the results of this study provides a first hand understanding of the spatio temporal isotopic compositional variability in an area that display very rich and diverse biological productivity both in the coast e g the sunderban unesco biosphere reserve and adjoining shallow sea additionally the coastal bob also hosts some of the densest human population of the world the seasonal to tidal variability documented through this study should result to a new realm of understanding of the hydrologic variability and scalability and their influence

6673,submarine groundwater discharge sgd acts as major pathway to transport solute laden terrestrial sourced fresh groundwater as well as re circulated marine water to the global oceans the study area bay of bengal bob a part of the indian ocean receives one of world s highest terrestrial riverine fresh water discharge sediment and solute flux from the adjacent himalayan and cratonic south asia thus together with the monsoon dominated tropical climate it forms one of the most complicated productive and interactive global hydrological systems however understanding such topical phenomena needs intricate mechanistic understanding based on high resolution data which are barely available from the bob delineation of stable isotopic and chemical signature of hydrologic sourced components in the sgd to the bob would help to identify the intra annual to diurnal scale impact of seasonality and tidal cycles as well as interactions with other surface water bodies this study provides one of the first documentation of such high resolution temporally variable stable isotope patterns of sgd in coastal systems of the bob and possibly of any tropical ocean during post monsoon season the discharging groundwater was observed to have depleted δ18o ranges 2 12 to 4 19 and low cl concentrations 745 to 11 500 ppm seepage water which is closely associated with the groundwater δ18o composition 3 18 to 4 05 and cl content 775 to 5900 ppm range in pre monsoon season depleted δ18o values suggests that regional groundwater contributes up to 45 m from high tide line htl up to 88 and re circulated seawater sourced sgd dominates 45 m to 110 m extent of study transect offshore in post monsoon season terrestrial sourced groundwater predominates the sgd composition up to 99 till 110 m changes in δ18o and cl content in pre monsoon season indicates enhanced infiltration of seawater in the seepage face due to lower terrestrial sourced freshwater discharge whereas in post monsoon terrestrial sourced resident freshwater dominates in the seepage face the study suggests that sgd are sourced to interactions between local regional hydrological systems and do reflect their compositional variability it also provides insight of influencing physico chemical mechanisms ranging from seasonal to daily tidal time scales the outcome of this study thus may provide intricate insights in delineating the coastal hydrologic and biogeochemical processes as well as detecting carbon sinks nutrient sources and primary productivity in a tropical ocean keywords hydrodynamics coastal hydrology seawater sgd porewater india 1 introduction the interaction of two largest hydrologic systems groundwater and sea water take place in the coastal areas either by sea water intrusion or submarine groundwater discharge sgd groundwater discharge has been suggested to be an important source of nutrients contaminants and trace elements to the coastal ocean cooper et al 1964 burnett et al 2003 slomp and van cappellen 2004 tamborski et al 2017 and is potentially largely influenced by the dynamics of the hydrological cycle mukherjee et al 2007 however the knowledge of the physical mechanisms controlling these dynamics and their impact on discharge are limited michael et al 2005 the most comprehensive definition of sgd suggests any and all flow of water on continental margins from the sea bed to the coastal ocean with scale lengths of meters to kilometers regardless of fluid composition or driving forces moore 2010 sgd comprises of both terrestrial sourced t sgd and re circulated marine sourced water m sgd which vary in spatio temporal scales santos et al 2012 rocha et al 2016 tamborski et al 2017 debnath et al 2018 petermann et al 2018 and being substantially driven by the precipitation seasonal and tidal cycles adjoining fresh water flux through fluvial systems etc edmunds 2003 michael et al 2005 santos et al 2009 the understanding of different hydrological source inputs to marine environment through t sgd is important because it acts as the nutrient substrate for the littoral to neritic life forms miller and ullman 2004 rocha et al 2015 transfer of solutes through these terrestrial and re circulated marine pathways alter the original chemical and or isotopic signature in a non uniform way along the discharge path slomp and van cappellen 2004 the measurement and delineation of source components of sgd are not always possible by direct measurement techniques like seepage meter which is a reasonably efficient method for measurements of sgd flux to sea debnath and mukherjee 2016 seepage meter measurements alone may not be able to differentiate the multiple source contribution to sgd because seawater circulates through the seepage face of coastal areas povinec et al 2008a b moreover the spatial and temporal complexities in solute concentration associated with sgd make the quantification process difficult consequently natural tracers are being increasingly getting used in sgd studies burnett et al 2003 baudron et al 2015 the application of isotopes like 87 86sr 222ra and other radioisotopes are widely accepted in sgd studies cable et al 1996 swarzenski et al 2007 tamborski et al 2017 petermann et al 2018 chakrabarti et al 2018 and are providing reliable proxies for solute sources on the contrary stable isotopes such as δ18o are widely used in groundwater studies to delineate hydrological and climatic regime povinec et al 2008a b schiavo et al 2009 povinec et al 2012 lian et al 2013 stalker et al 2014 applications of δ18o have also been widely recorded in the coastal areas but mostly for recharge source evaluation and mixing processes schiavo et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2007 however they have only been very limitedly used in sgd studies to understand the source of the discharging groundwater povinec et al 2008a b lian et al 2013 rocha et al 2016 the bay of bengal bob a land ward extension of the indian ocean in the indian subcontinent serves as the discharge zone of several major rivers including the himalayan mega river system ganges brahmaputra meghna which forms the largest fluvio deltaic system of the world thereby the bob receives the one of the largest inflow of sediment and surface water flux moore 1997 and provides one of the most intricate and elaborate surface water groundwater interaction site across the world aggarwal et al 2000 mukhjerjee et al 2007 debnath et al 2015 the huge inflow of solutes from the rapidly weathering himalayan and indian cratonic masses basu et al 2001 mukherjee et al 2012 under a tropical monsoon dominated climate provides a unique condition for water and solute exchanges e g moore 1997 basu et al 2001 mukherjee et al 2012 chakrabarti et al 2018 this conducive natural set up has resulted to very rich and diverse biological productivity both in coast e g the sunderban unesco biosphere reserve and shallow sea additionally the coastal bob also hosts some of the densest human population of the world mukherjee 2018 hence understanding of hydrological interactions in the broad area becomes imperative to understand the present day ecological sustainability as well as resilience of one of the most climate change sensitive coastal areas notwithstanding this significance information on the sgd to the bob and its relationship to the other waters to the bob are limited debnath et al 2016 debnath and mukherjee 2016 with barely any information on the interactions between the atmospheric and surface fresh water on bob sgd in the present work the stable isotope ratios of δ18o and δd and selected solute compositions of various hydrologic end members are used to determine a the primary source s of discharging groundwater through the shallow aquifers and or recirculated surface water and b that result to large flux of terrestrial sourced fresh groundwater solutes and nutrients to the bob the specific objectives of the study are to delineate the potential sgd sources and their contributions to the discharging groundwater we also tried to recognize the intra annual scale to lunar tidal cycle scale daily heterogeneities of stable isotope and solute compositional variability in the sgd and the existing mechanisms including mixing and exchange processes between these hydrological cycle components which might have resulted to such variabilities to our knowledge this study provides one of the first high resolution stable isotope observations of sgd and their relation to regional hydrological cycle of a tropical coast in the south asia and elsewhere 2 methodology 2 1 study site the eastern coast of india is dominated by the freshwater flux both from the surface water and groundwater in the form of sgd this fresh water flux plays a crucial role by transporting nutrients to the sea which controls the productivity of ocean ecosystem flux of river ganges brahmaputra to the bob reported by basu et al 2001 was 1 07 1015 l year whereas groundwater flux was 0 2 1015 and calculated combined flux of sr is 1 55 109 m year calculation of sgd by dowling et al 2003 and mukherjee et al 2007 to the bob were found to be as 6 6 2 1011 m3 y and 1 2 108 m3 y a more recent estimate of the sr flux for entire eastern coast of india to the bob by chakrabarti et al 2018 is 13 5 40 5 105 m year study of sgd to the bob has been conducted in chandipur fig 1 d 21 26 11 6 n and 87 01 3 1 e which is a micro tidal coastal zone with extensive tidal flats adjoining the bob mukherjee et al 1987 mukhopadhyay et al 2011 debnath et al 2015 2018 the tidal height varies from 0 4 to 1 m at low tide and 1 9 2 9 m during high tide geomorphic features of the area are recent paleo

mechanism between terrestrially sourced groundwater and the seawater on a larger scale involves two or more discrete end members due to convergence of multiple source water in discharging flow path in this work the mixing component in the discharging groundwater have been estimated by using two component end member mixing model following the numerical equation of stichler et al 1986 yehdegho et al 1997 it was assumed that the discharged groundwater seepage meter samples comprises of two components i e terrestrially sourced fresh groundwater gw and recirculates seawater sw in the numerical equation the fraction of discharge water has been expressed by eq 1 1 f sgd 1 f gw f sw where sgd denotes discharging water mainly seepage meter samples which have been considered here for mixing analysis gw and sw stands for groundwater and seawater respectively in this two component endmember mixing model f stands for the fraction of source water to find out the f sw and f gw contribution to f sgd we assumed δ18o composition as a conservative tracer which is not usually removed from the system f sw was calculated by the weighing up the seawater contribution from the sgd sample δ18o composition δ18osgd and the terrestrial fresh groundwater δ18o composition δ18ogw in a solute mass balance equation eq 2 output of f sw from the generic mass balance equation was used in eq 1 to get the proportional fraction of f gw 2 f sw δ 18 o sgd δ 18 o gw δ 18 o sw δ 18 o gw 3 results 3 1 discharging groundwater 3 1 1 geochemistry the maximum salinity of seepage water samples was observed

seasonally debnath et al 2015 debnath and mukherjee 2016 na and cl were found to be the dominant dissolved solutes in the collected seepage meter samples in pre monsoon season highest na content was observed at 110 m offshore distance 6246 ppm and lowest in 5 m offshore distance 871 ppm in post monsoon season highest na 5439 ppm content was observed at 110 m offshore distance and lower concentration at 5 m offshore distance 818 ppm highest cl content 13 461 ppm was observed at 110 m offshore distance in pre monsoon season and lowest 745 ppm at 5 m offshore distance in post monsoon season fig 3 comparatively cl and na concentration of discharging water was observed to be lower in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season 3 1 2 stable isotopic signature a seasonal variability the porewater temporal variability for δ18o signature ranges from 5 86 to 1 17 and δd ranges from 48 to 2 8 within the hydrologic year of 2014 15 fig 3 table 1 the post monsoonal and monsoonal porewater isotope data were found to be highly depleted in composition δ18o 4 0 located up to 40 m offshore zones near shore zone fig 3 fig 4 samples with lower depletion δ18o ranges 2 to 4 were observed in mid transect zone 40 60 m offshore beyond 60 m 60 100 m offshore offshore zone most of the porewater samples were found to be isotopically heavier δ18o 2 fig 4 which varies seasonally

cycle in diurnal scale isotopic composition range of seepage water are found to be much more enriched at high tide than at low tide time in both seasons fig 4a and b table 2 but in seasonal scale during both ht and lt time sgd has been observed isotopically depleted in post monsoon season than the pre monsoon season fig 4 spatially and temporally the range of isotopic depletion of discharging water extended up to 70 m on new moon day and up to 40 m offshore on the full moon day fig 4 3 2 regional hydrological components 3 2 1 rainwater global meteoric water line gmwl was plotted after craig 1961 to identify the meteoric water contribution in this interaction process fig 6 the local meteoric water line lmwl was constructed through linear regression of the rain water isotopic composition collected during this study the slope 6 56 of lmwl δd 6 56 δ18o 1 25 r2 0 99 is lower than the gmwl whereas the slope of regional meteoric water line rmwl for the bengal basin is 7 2 δd 7

depth porewater in post monsoon season is 7 36 δd 7 36 δ18o 1 98 r2 0 96 and in pre monsoon season is 6 64 δd 6 64 δ18o 1 94 r2 0 97 fig 6 whereas for seepage water samples slope in post monsoon season is 4 42 δd 4 42 δ18o 16 32 r2 0 91 and in pre monsoon season is 4 65 δd 4 65 δ18o 17 55 r2 0 89 which deviated from the gmwl rmwl and lmwl fig 7 3 2 2 groundwater river water and sea water the δ18o composition of studied groundwater samples are more depleted in post monsoon season 4 06 to 3 18 than pre monsoon season 2 70 to 2 55 cl concentration of regional groundwater samples were found to be within the range from 832 to 3831 ppm in pre monsoon and 775 to 3211 ppm in post monsoon season the river bhagirathi hooghly samples δ18o of 5 4 to 8 8 were found to be more depleted than the river buribalam 4 1 to 5 6 and river subarnarekha 3 4 to 4 8 respectively seawater samples showed narrow δ18o range of 0 85 to 0 9 and 0 087 to 0 095 for pre and post monsoon seasons the seasonal variations of δ18o signature of bob in relation to salinity are similar to the reported study of sengupta et al 2013 3 2 3 geochemistry of regional hydrologic components the annual average seawater salinity was found to be as 34 2 ppt with a maximum in pre monsoon season 41 5 ppt and minimum in monsoon season 16 3 ppt the salinity of the local groundwater samples were found to be in the range of 0 3 1 7 ppt with a maximum 1 7 ppt in the pre monsoon season and minimum 0 2 ppt in the post monsoon season cl content of collected groundwater samples were within the range of 832 6441 ppm in pre monsoon season and 775 5934 ppm in post monsoon season salinity of the collected monsoonal river water samples ranged between 0 1 and 5 2 ppt with a maximum in the mouth strip of buribalam river salinity of river bhagirathi hooghly was observed within the range of 0 1 0 18 ppt with an average of 0 15 ppt cl content of river bhagirathi hooghly was found to be within the range from upstream 1 7 ppm to downstream 93 28 ppm 3 3 mixing of different hydrologic components with sgd from stable water isotopic signature the average of δ18o composition of the regional groundwater gw was found to be 2 60 and 3 69 and average seawater sw δ18o composition was 1 92 and 0 09 for the pre and post monsoon season are considered in the present study to estimate the mixing proportion the δ18o composition of the seepage water samples sgd across the transect ranged from 2 89 to 1 77 in pre monsoon season and 4 51 to 2 80 in post monsoon season fig 3 to estimate the fraction of respective hydrological components of the discharging groundwater sgd mean seasonal δ18o composition of regional groundwater gw and seawater sw was applied in eq 1 and 2 from the end member mixing analysis it was observed that from htl to 45 m offshore distance f gw contributes 88 to 50 with highest at 25 m f gw 99 93 in pre monsoon season f sw contributes to discharging water 97 37 at 50 110 m offshore distance in pre monsoon season whereas in post monsoon season f gw contributes 91 at htl with highest 99 27 at 50 m offshore distance f sw contributes highest 24 at 40 m offshore distance in post monsoon season fig 8 f gw contribution in discharging groundwater was recoded highest in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season 4 discussion 4 1 sgd sources and mixing process 4 1 1 terrestrial and marine sourced sgd the seasonal variation of porewater δ18o composition and cl content with depth and offshore distance is presented in fig 4 δ18o composition was observed to be more depleted in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season gradually δ18o composition was getting depleted with the depth in both season but highest values were recorded in post monsoon season cl concentration was getting lower from the offshore towards htl and with increasing depth in post monsoon season porewater with lower cl concentration have relatively more depleted δ18o value than pre monsoon season fig 4 which is close to the regional groundwater δ18o composition similarly a significant variation of δ18o signature of seepage water was observed with tidal cycle and offshore distance seepage water samples have much depleted δ18o values with low cl concentration up to 45 m offshore distance in post monsoon than pre monsoon season fig 3a b distribution of cl and δ18o along depth and offshore distance suggests that circulation of seawater was taking place at the top layer up to a depth of 30 cm bsbl at htl in pre monsoon season whereas in post monsoon season circulation of seawater takes place within the depth of 15 cm the depleted δ18o and lower cl concentration on post monsoon season than pre monsoon season suggests that the terrestrially derived fresh water discharge was dominant in post monsoon season which controls the sgd rate and also involves in flushing out the saline water to the ocean the monsoonal porewater isotopic composition with low salinity is close to the groundwater regime while rest of the porewater salinity 4 ppt exist near to the monsoonal seawater regime the relatively high enrichment of δ18o in porewater has been observed in most of the far offshore samples beyond 40 m offshore this trend is consistent with the associated non conservative mixing processes between groundwater and seawater hence the seasonal isotope data suggests different aspects of local water balance a pre monsoonal porewater indicates seawater infiltration high evaporation rates might be due to the atmospheric temperature effects on the upper portion of the sediment b post monsoonal porewater indicates a net terrestrial input from regional groundwater sources and c monsoonal porewater indicates that the less saline monsoonal seawater probably diluted due large river water flux across east coast of india infiltrates into the intertidal zone and mixes with the groundwater and again discharges into the ocean 4 1 2 meteoric water influx porewater δd and d excess signatures fig 9 a and b conformed local meteoric sources input at the near shore location and the marine component input at far offshore within studied distance it indicates regional groundwater have dominant influence on discharging process within near shore zone where discharge rate was high and have less influence with increasing offshore distance but the rate of groundwater discharge and isotope signature varies seasonally depending on local meteoric input terrestrial water load and regional river water flux to sea the seasonal variation of the d excess values clearly indicates that the driver and sources of the porewater inputs varied seasonally however the magnitudes of variation in terms of absolute value are subjected to the evaporative enrichment and exposure time of evaporation thus d excess pattern and δ18o signature of discharging water in different season would lead to fingerprint the influence of regional hydrological cycle on the interaction process this information also helps to identify the distinct nature of sgd across the east coast of india and the discharging pathways into the system 4 2 influence of hydrological systems on sgd isotopic composition 4 2 1 influence of seasonal and tidal cycles the seasonal variation of isotopic signature of porewater regional groundwater and seawater with the lmwl figs 6 and 7 clearly demonstrates discharging groundwater in post monsoon season was highly influenced by the local meteoric sources the post monsoonal porewater isotopic values are close to the regional groundwater isotopic signature that indicates discharging groundwater is sourced from meteoric recharge except the re circulated seawater during high tide time the deviation of the early pre monsoon and monsoonal porewater signature from the lmwl suggested some evaporation occurred prior and during re circulation of sea water enrichment of porewater samples was also be a result of the pre monsoon rain or evaporated seawater rocha et al 2016 the stable isotope composition of seepage water groundwater and porewater within the inter tidal zone also varies within the tidal cycle the isotopic range of seepage water samples was found to be much wider at low tide compared to the high tide variation of isotopic composition in the pre monsoonal tidal cycle exactly mirrors the post monsoonal tidal cycle but showed more isotopic enrichment for high tide period therefore sgd at high tide time was comprised mostly of re circulated brackish water than low tide time at new moon day of both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons δ18o signatures of seepage water were found to be depleted as compared to the full moon day fig 5 the enrichment of δ18o in the seepage water during full moon day might be due to the enhanced brackish water recirculation at the inter tidal zone the diurnal δ18o signatures of the seepage water within the lunar tidal cycle demonstrate that the pre monsoonal seepage water samples were more enriched compared to the post monsoon season fig 5 porewater samples from the near shore area were found to be more depleted during low tide time and showed similar seasonal variation like seepage water samples during low tide the freshwater mass joins from the landward side to the seawater as a result the isotopic signature of the porewater and seepage water up to 40 m offshore were found to be very close to the regional groundwater signature figs 6 and 7 this phenomenon suggesting meteoric sourced water from the landward side discharges at inter tidal zone as part of the terrestrially derived sgd daily variation of isotopic enrichment during lunar tidal cycle was calculated as seasonal drift sd where sd is the difference of δ18o between the respective tidal day of post and pre monsoon season the maximum sd 2 75 was observed on day 3 of the lunar tidal cycle period and the minimum sd 0 6 on day 16 of the lunar tidal cycle the groundwater samples in the vicinity of bob showed similar δ18o signature like seepage water within the tidal cycle the isotopic pattern of the groundwater within the tidal cycle with multi depth porewater and seepage water provides the evidence of hydraulic connection between groundwater and sea water figs 3 4 therefore tidal pumping varying by diurnal to seasonal scale is responsible for re circulation of seawater within the discharging groundwater flowpath however the similarity in pattern of the δ18o signatures within the lunar tidal cycles during pre and post monsoon season signifies the tidal set up as a major triggering factor that have a control on sgd composition in the seepage face such mechanisms have been recently explored in adjoin inland areas by burgess et al 2017 suggesting the influence of matrix compressibility on groundwater level heterogeneity 4 2 2 influence of meteoric water sources lmwl differed significantly from the rmwl and gmwl fig 6 the expression of lmwl was applied for evaluation of the isotopes signature of the discharging groundwater fig 6 the regression lines of pre monsoon and post monsoon porewater were found to be located slightly below the lmwl fig 6 the δd and d excess signatures fig 9 of the multi depth porewater samples collected between 40 and 80 m offshore conformed the brackish water recirculation while the local meteoric water input up to 40 m offshore from htl the isotopic composition of seepage water for the transect c c in both ht and lt time with lmwl are plotted in fig 7 in both diagrams it was observed that porewater and seepage water are depleted with respect to the lmwl during high tide the isotopic signature of both seepage water and porewater were found to be much closer to lmwl which is consistent with seasons 4 3 influence of surface water and seawater on sgd the regional map fig 1a shows that subarnarekha river basin is situated at 30 km ne the bhagirathi hooghly river is about 100 km ne and the bengal basin is 150 km ne from the study site both the bengal and subarnarekha river basin discharge a huge volume of freshwater to the bob during monsoon season accounted as river freshwater flux to the bob the annual discharge rate through the ganga brahmaputra meghna and bhagirathi hooghly basin is 2200 km3 yr dutta and subramanian 1997 of which 75 of the discharge occurs during monsoon season sarin et al 1989 milliman et al 1995 dutta and subramanian 1997 the addition of this huge amount of monsoonal surface water dilutes the salinity of seawater near the coast of bob reflects from the δ18o signature and salinity content although the changes in δ18o signature of bob is related to surface water discharge but its local influence is also identified by the changes in salinity content the isotopic composition of monsoonal porewater demonstrated that most of the low salinity porewater were close to groundwater regime and rest of the porewater salinity 4 ppt were near to the monsoonal seawater regime ironically none of the monsoonal porewater was found to coincide with the defined seawater regime of the study area the depleted isotope signatures of monsoonal porewater demonstrates discharging water mostly contain regional groundwater than sea water 4 4 influence of regional surface water flux on sgd spatial and temporal variation in δ18o values of groundwater and sgd are controlled by a range of geographical and climatic factors such as humidity temperature fluctuations in precipitation evaporation and surface water flux kendall and coplen 2001 in eastern coast of india especially in the coastal areas close to the western bengal basin a progressive decrease was observed in δ18o values of groundwater with latitude which extends towards sothern and south west part mukherjee et al 2007 significant temporal variations in porewater δ18o values indicate that the seasonal and inter annual temperature difference and precipitation evaporation may have some relative influence price et al 2008 relatively low salinity and depleted δ18o values were observed in porewater and seawater during monsoon season which indicates that bob experienced huge volume of local river water flux this regional scale contribution of surface water to this surface water groundwater interaction process was not separately identified but the changes in δ18o and salinity are similar to the local changes the magnitude of regional surface water contribution was might be low to the present study location due to the geographical distance but are connected through the hydrological cycle and sea water of bob the δ18o values of sgd in the study area were comparable to the values observed in the coastal areas of ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm basin by mukherjee et al 2007 suggesting that the groundwater and sgd in this area are influenced by tidal variations and seawater intrusion as a result there is a possibility of enrichment δ18o values in sgd end members during pre monsoon season when observed seawater intrusion rate was found to be maximum debnath and mukherjee 2016 further the eastern coast of india has by large number of rivers and its tributaries which added a huge volume of freshwater influx in this region during monsoon season that could dilute the seawater in the near shore zone of bob there is also a strong indication of evaporative alteration of isotopic composition by river water influx and regional groundwater inputs figs 6 and 7 the influx of river water and regional groundwater may cause changes in gw sw mixing process which lead to change in isotopic composition for our study site most of the monsoonal sgd samples including seawater have been observed with relatively depleted δ18o values compared to the other seasons this observation again indicates regional surface water inputs and its influence on the gw sw mixing process across the discharging pathways in coastal areas of bob however in most of the well known estuarine system of the world researchers observed that the evaporation is the dominant factor over the mixing process of sgd surge and lohmann 2002 dettman et al 2004 stalker et al 2009 gillanders et al 2012 while in case of bob estuarine system the phenomenon is totally reversed this confirms the strong influence of tidal pumping and regional hydrology on the sgd to bob where riverine input is expected to control the transport of sgd in different seasons 4 5 implications of sgd and surface water flux to the bob numbers of studies has been conducted on surface water and groundwater flux estimation to the bob by different isotopic compositions which have a great societal and environmental implication samples from the river bhagirathi hooghly with δ18o values of 5 4 to 8 8 were found to be more depleted in this study when compared to those reported by mukherjee et al 2007 range of 5 7 to 5 6 on the other hand the river buribalam and river subarnarekha have δ18o composition of 4 1 to 5 6 and 3 4 to 4 8 respectively in this present study basu et al 2001 estimated ganges river 87sr 86sr flux to the bob chakrabarti et al 2018 measured 87sr 86sr ratio with salinity and compared with basu et al 2001 study to identify the sgd derived flux which has a significant contribution to strontium budget of bob table 3 changes in the δ18o ratio of sgd river water and seawater showed a similar seasonal trend which may be a projection of significant regional hydraulic connection among groundwater river water and seawater although sgd contributes only 6 10 of the global surface water input to the coastal system our previous study shows sgd have significant contribution of nutrient to the bob 240 mm no3 m2 d1 and 224 mm fe m2 d1 debnath et al 2018 compared to other surface water sources these discharge processes involve in transportation of significant amount of nutrients and the salinity distribution near the coastal area of bob which have control on regional ecosystem dynamics further study in comparison with sgd surface water flux and changes in stable water isotopic composition can contribute seasonal to annual nutrient budget of bob because the bob is already considered to be a less biologically productive system due to limited nutrient supply from indian sub continent singh and chaturvedi 2010 prasanna et al 2002 4 6 comparison of bob δ18o signatures with other global sgd studies a conceptual model of δ18o signature variations with other hydrologic components is summarized in fig 10 the stable isotopic composition of sgd to the bob is a function of different hydrologic components like rain water yasumoto et al 2007 groundwater schiavo et al 2009 river water lian et al 2013 and sea water povinec et al 2012 across all seasons table 4 along with the hydrological influences discharging groundwater have depleted δ18o signature in shallow depths and get enriched with a gradual increase of depth povinec et al 2008a b stalker et al 2014 rocha et al 2016 the δ18o values are highly depleted in the present study than the study at ria formosa lagoon portugal east china sea ubatuba coast south eastern brazil and mauritious island indian ocean povinec et al 2008a b povinec et al 2012 lian et al 2013 rocha et al 2016 while quite similar the celestún lagoon mexico ubatuba coast south eastern brazil and south eastern sicily povinec et al 2008a b schiavo et al 2009 stalker et al 2014 and less depleted signatures than the sgd study at ariake bay japan yasumoto et al 2007 5 conclusion in the present study very high resolution isotopic variability of sgd with major solutes has been documenting and used to identify the major sink of terrestrial sourced fresh water to bob from the world s largest fluvial aquifer system we tried to address these objectives by studying the isotopic composition and solute exchanges between different hydrologic components viz rainwater groundwater porewater seawater and river water in the data scarce eastern coast of india adjoining the bob study results revealed daily to lunar tidal scale variability of the δ18o and cl the signature of sgd are controlled by tide induced pumping in diurnal scale while it varies with seasonal scale depending on terrestrial freshwater load however the similarity of compositional response across temporal scale suggested that physical behavior of the sediments do have a huge impact on the chemical signatures hence the isotopic fingerprint of sgd forms a useful indicator to evaluate the discharge mechanism of sgd in comparison to other hydrological components i e regional hydrogeology tidal pumping and riverine input the sgd to the tropical oceans is dominated by the terrestrial sourced fresh groundwater discharge in post monsoon season and recirculation of infiltrated seawater as marine sourced sgd in pre monsoon season with the highest discharge in either seasons being controlled by lunar tidal processes the terrestrial freshwater discharge is also related to the local to regional hydrologic component reflected from the local to regional isotopic variations the physical coastal dynamics do have a major influence on isotopic fractionation and solute concentration of discharging groundwater which varies spatially based on the sgd source terrestrially derived fresh water discharge dominates within nearshore location in pre monsoon season while it extended up to the offshore location from htl thus the results of this study provides a first hand understanding of the spatio temporal isotopic compositional variability in an area that display very rich and diverse biological productivity both in the coast e g the sunderban unesco biosphere reserve and adjoining shallow sea additionally the coastal bob also hosts some of the densest human population of the world the seasonal to tidal variability documented through this study should result to a new realm of understanding of the hydrologic variability and scalability and their influence

6674,a complete water shortage mitigation plan which includes water shortage indicators and mitigation measures is essential in adaptive water resources management current water shortage triggers used to manage water supply shortages typically recognize only past and current hydrologic conditions and system states e g reservoir storage or water levels a systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of water shortage mitigation measures is often lacked this study proposes a general framework based on daily simulation optimization computation scheme to develop water shortage mitigation plan it includes an innovative simulation optimization based water shortage trigger framework incorporating both demand and supply side uncertainties to evaluate the state of a water supply system stochastically generated demand supply ensembles were used to simulate system decision variables that were used jointly with past and current hydrologic conditions to prescribe water shortage stages each water shortage stage was tied to specific demand and supply side adaptive management actions a mixed integer programming model optimizing source allocation from surface water harvesting groundwater production and a desalination plant was then used to minimize operational costs and protect the environment while meeting regional demand cumulative mitigation actions were implemented as the system moves progressively to a severe water shortage stage retrospective analysis using observed flow and demand in the past decade 2005 2015 was used to vet the approach and demonstrate the advantage of forward looking water shortage trigger development scheme a combination of mitigation measures is evaluated using stochastic flow and demand in the year 2030 revealing that increased magnitude of groundwater production under severe water shortage situations could be largely 50 reduced owing to proactive mitigation actions the framework was applied to tampa bay water and it has general applications to regional water resources management for utilities across us and beyond keywords water shortage mitigation proactive trigger development system uncertainty 1 introduction water use in the united states has increased from 180 billion gallons 0 68 billion cubic meter per day in the 1950s to 355 billion gallons per day in 2010 maupin et al 2014 at the same time increasing frequency of extreme events for instance the severe droughts in california and texas in recent years griffin and anchukaitis 2014 seager et al 2014 su and dickinson 2014 and potential drought risk under changing climate venkataraman et al 2016 cook et al 2015 have forced water suppliers to face unprecedented water shortage problems rijsberman 2006 hummu et al 2010 increased frequency of water shortages throughout the world have shaped the development of demand management and supply enhancement mitigation strategies the us epa recently released drought response and recovery guide to provide best practices of demand and supply options effective communication and partnerships for water utilities epa 2016 the guide recommends that regional water utilities should develop tailored strategies depending on customers water use supply source operational preferences and willingness and ability to enforce water use restrictions to enhance system reliability and resilience to water shortages many water utilities resort to diversified water supply sources whitler 2015 diversity of water supply sources for a water utility is often indicative of its ability to withstand water shortage situations resulting in a much more robust water supply system that is capable of absorbing system shocks a recent survey conducted by american water works association awwa reveals that among the 483 utilities surveyed nearly 91 have a formal or an informal water shortage preparedness plan awwa 2014 the frequency of water shortages could however be used to inform when and how infrastructure expansion could be triggered in an adaptation pathway framework haasnoot et al 2013 an effective water shortage mitigation plan aims to manage residual risk that cannot be met by existing infrastructure coping with infrequent but extended drought conditions such water shortage mitigation plans serve as a soft path for regional water management avoiding investment of an infrequently used supply infrastructure drought indicators are sometimes used as a surrogate of water shortage indicators by water practitioners to denote the severity of drought and its impact on water supply availability specific indices created to evaluate drought include days of supply remaining standardized precipitation index and palmer drought index in addition there are complex models that consider soil moisture and other relevant hydrologic variables for drought monitoring the handbook of drought indicators and indices world meteorological organization and global water partnership 2016 loucks and van beek 2005 provides a comprehensive review of distinct drought indices employed around the world among those indices u s drought monitor established in 1999 is a composite index that includes many indicators and is widely used by policymakers rather than using a single attribute comprehensive water shortage indicators incorporate multiple attributes such as precipitation streamflow drought index surface water reservoir storage and groundwater level based on the american water works association awwa 2014 survey the three most commonly employed water shortage indicators are current supply availability reservoir level or status and high demand periods recent hydrologic conditions and current reservoir levels reflect water shortage conditions and are commonly used by many utilities however those indicators fail to recognize the importance of future climatic hydrologic conditions or possible changes in supply system status variables hence such systems are ill equipped to implement proactive decision making incorporating mid range forecasts of precipitation and streamflow and other relevant information are paramount to developing proactive water shortage indicators that look at both supply and demand of a system utilization of hydrologic forecasts is limited in practice primarily due to three reasons first limited forecasting skills of seasonal precipitation and streamflow have prohibited their wide application with recent advancement in seasonal flow forecasting skills from hydrologic models and or advanced statistical models such limitation is becoming less of a barrier in its application in water resources management for instance the utility of seasonal precipitation and streamflow forecasts based on climate model outputs has been demonstrated in other studies sankarasubramanian et al 2014 li et al 2014 sankarasubramanian et al 2009 however applying research results to everyday water management decisions by utilities in making seasonal water resources decisions does not commonly occur second limited access to expertise required to make forecast useful to the stakeholder e g utilizing deterministic or probabilistic forecasts as well as effectively communicating ensemble outlooks is an additional barrier to forecast implementation changnon et al 1995 rayner et al 2005 third most water utility practitioners tend to utilize historical data to derive standard operation rules and hesitate to modify standard operation protocol missing opportunities to address regional water supply challenges such approach leaves them vulnerable to hydrologic shocks which may result in forced capital expenditures for infrastructure that may not be needed this study proposes to utilize probabilistic reservoir storage forecasts as one of water shortage indicators in addition to streamflow uncertainty seasonal demand uncertainty also plays an important role in affecting seasonal water supply operations this is particularly important for areas with high intra annual demand variability in the southeastern u s where surface reservoir storage is not as large as those in the western u s intra annual demand variability can be very important surface reservoirs developed in the western u s typically are sized to handle droughts that last for 1 3 years most water shortage triggers rely on past and current hydrologic conditions and a few considers system state variables in the coming months e g reservoir storage uncertainties in flow and demand are often neglected or oversimplified in reservoir storage forecasts with regards to evaluating water shortage measures water system modeling at coarse temporal resolution e g monthly or annual time scale is often used this study describes a framework based on a daily simulation optimization computation scheme to facilitate developing water shortage mitigation plan it incorporates both seasonal supply and demand uncertainties to define water shortage stages it application is demonstrated at a regional water supply utility the innovative aspects of this framework are the application of a system simulation optimization model and use of probabilistic flow and demand forecast as components of proactive water shortage mitigation the specific objectives of this study are to a develop probabilistic forecasts of reservoir storage elevation based on uncertain regional demand and streamflow b propose water shortage triggers that explicitly incorporate past hydrologic conditions and reservoir storage elevation forecasts and c evaluate the effectiveness of water shortage mitigation strategies in short term water resources management this paper is arranged as follows the introduction section is followed by a description of the study area and explanation of the methodology in section 2 results from both retrospective analysis using 2005 2015 actual flow and demand as well as future scenarios analysis using stochastic flow and demand data for the year 2030 are presented in section 3 in section 4 the main outcome of the proposed framework and the linkage between adaptive water shortage mitigation management and long term water supply planning is discussed finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 study area and methodology 2 1 a study area tampa bay water tbw formed in 1998 is a regional water utility in southwest florida that provides wholesale water to six member governments cities of tampa st petersburg and new port richey and counties of hillsborough pinellas and pasco fig 1 serving about 2 5 million residents regional average annual demand ranges between 220 and 259 million gallons per day mgd 0 83 0 98 million cubic meters per day among the six member governments city of tampa cot has its own surface water supply system and purchases potable water from tbw when a supply deficit occurs tbw has a diverse and integrated water supply system with 13 groundwater wellfields up to 121 1 mgd 0 455 million cubic meters per day permitted capacity on annual basis a 120 mgd 0 455 million cubic meters per day surface water treatment plant and a 15 billion gallon 5 68 107 cubic meter off stream reservoir and a 27 85 mgd 0 095 million cubic meters per day permitted capacity desalinated seawater plant this system can be effectively managed to optimize use of both the groundwater and surface water systems as stated in the agreement between member governments and tbw the authority tbw shall have the absolute and unequivocal obligation to meet water needs of the member governments interlocal agreement for tampa bay water 1998 hence tbw has the responsibility to avoid possible shortfall even under extended drought periods by effectively rotating supply sources tbw has three surface water sources tampa by pass canal tbc alafia river and the c w bill yong regional reservoir tbc primarily designed as a flooding control facility for use during flood events became a major water supply for tbw in 2002 the tbc is connected to the city of tampa s hillsborough river reservoir through a canal that allows not only flood water relief but water from the tbc can be pumped back to the city s reservoir to augment the city s surface water supply system under seasonal shortage and or drought conditions the permit for alafia river allows tbw to withdraw 10 of its flow up to 60 mgd 0 227 million cubic meters per day if river flow is above the minimum flow threshold as for groundwater tbw has a consolidated water use permit for 11 wellfields which is 90 mgd 0 341 million cubic meters per day regulated as a 12 month running average groundwater withdrawals from these wellfields are optimized to minimize water level drawdown in environmentally sensitive areas central florida as well as much of the southeast us experiences frequent droughts triggered by interannual climate variability primarily associated with enso cycles mo and schemm 2008 it is cost prohibitive for tbw to build supply infrastructure to meet all demand scenarios given demand uncertainty to mitigate water shortages tbw has developed demand side and supply side adaptive management options for incremental water shortage stages triggered by extended drought conditions on the demand side for example increasing outdoor water use restrictions from 2 day per week to 1 day per week is implemented when the service area is in severe water shortage conditions whereas as a supply side mitigation strategy tbw can temporarily increase withdraw from 10 to 19 from the alafia river if water is available in the river above its minimum flow requirements those mitigation strategies have successfully guided tbw through most water shortages events current water demands in tbw s service area have recovered to pre economic recession levels recent long term demand forecasts indicate a steady increase in water demands over the next 20 year planning horizon tbw continues to rely on its surface water system to meet increasing demands however with the potential for climate change to increase rainfall uncertainty the need to improve mid range rainfall and streamflow forecast became apparent in addition tbw has adopted a reliability based level of service strategy for future supply planning asefa et al 2015 a key management strategy is the implementation of a water shortage mitigation plan that allows the region to meet demands during infrequent but extreme hydrologically driven water shortage events by incorporating mid range forecasting into a water shortage mitigation plan this management strategy is the topic of this paper 2 2 b water shortage indicators tbw s original water shortage mitigation plan included three water shortage indicators including two hydrologic triggers and an indicator of current reservoir storage the two hydrologic triggers are 12 month rolling cumulative deficit rainfall rcd rainfall as an indicator of climatic and seasonal weather conditions and 12 month rolling median deficit flow rmd flow a surrogate for hydrologic response rcd rainfall is calculated based on rainfall data over 28 selected gauges in the region for each calendar month of the year long term mean monthly rainfall is first determined deviations from long term average at each station for the past 12 months are then obtained as temporal average surplus deficit rcd rainfall is calculated as the sum of regional average rainfall surplus deficit across all the stations essentially it is the total rainfall surplus or deficit over the most recent 12 month period as judged by average surplus or deficit conditions across multiple rainfall stations the trigger associated with streamflow rmd flow is calculated in a similar fashion to rcd rainfall except that the long term median is used instead of long term mean since the median is less sensitive to extreme values the third existing indicator is current reservoir storage at the beginning of a month which is combined with the two hydrologic indicators above to determine water shortage stage for the month as discussed earlier a trigger based on only current reservoir stage fails to recognize system uncertainties including regional demand and supply uncertainty and potential operation adjustments to overcome such shortcomings forecasted reservoir storage at the end of a three month ahead was developed to replace current reservoir storage as the third indicator to obtain reservoir storage three months ahead both supply and demand estimates from forecasting models are needed to run the system operation model the median of the ensemble reservoir storage forecasts is then compared to reservoir target levels explicitly accounting for within year seasonal water shortage risks in determining water shortage stages 2 3 c mathematical formulation of water supply system operation in this study different component models including a demand forecasting model a stochastic streamflow forecasting model and a system operation model developed in previous studies asefa et al 2015 asefa et al 2014 are used a long term demand forecasting model was developed using water demand data from 2003 to 2014 social economic projections for future years from moody s analytics and data from american community survey hazen and sawyer 2012 such model is used to generate monthly regional demand in future years and then disaggregated to daily resolution detailed description of the demand forecasting model is presented in asefa et al 2014 recent advancement in hydrologic research regarding to streamflow forecasting dechant and moradkhani 2012 mazrooei et al 2015 may further improve streamflow forecasts for tbw this would require further study and it is beyond the scope of this work in this study monthly scale seasonal markov mixture smm models asefa et al 2014 are applied to generate monthly rainfall time series ensemble for rainfall stations in the service area seasonal multivariate linear regression models are then used to generate monthly flow for both morris bridge station at hillsborough river and bells shoals at alafia river to obtain daily time scale streamflow at both stations multivariate nonparametric disaggregation procedure is implemented readers with interests in the details of these techniques and their validation for the study area are referred to asefa et al 2014 for flow simulation 1000 realizations of 100 year daily stochastic flow preserving historical flow characteristics e g long term mean and standard deviation were generated to capture flow uncertainty covering a range of long term flow magnitude similarly 1000 realizations of daily demand time series over 100 year for the time slice 2030 were generated capturing the characteristic of socio economic condition over a range of climatic condition with mean annual demand ranging from 230 to 330 mgd 0 871 to 1 249 million cubic meters per day latin hypercube sampling iman and conover 1982 asefa et al 2014 is used to generate pairs of flow and demand to represent bivariate distribution of the two variables one pair of flow and demand is defined as a realization in total 334 pairs instead of 1 million combinations of flow and demand realizations were found to be sufficient to represent the full distribution the system operation model was built in ampl a mathematic programming language fourer et al 2003 to reflect the flow network carrying water from various supply sources to wholesale delivery points the model incorporates operational preference and hydraulic constraints modeling components including water sources pumping facilities and pipe flows are represented in fig 2 flow at each pipeline is represented by q i where i denotes any connection illustrated in the schematic figure as shown in the schematic figure four connections are bi directional allowing water to be either withdrawn from the regional reservoir or sending back to replenish storage during rainy season a binary variable p i is introduced for those connections where i equals 3 4 6 or 7 to represent positive flow s i 1 or negative flow s i 0 two additional variables po s i and ne g i are introduced to represent positive and negative flow it is worth mentioning that when water is withdrawn from the c w bill young reservoir only one of the two paths leaving node r is online pipeline 6 denotes gravity flow when water level in the reservoir allows such occurrence if not reservoir pump would be turned on to move water through pipeline 5 hence a binary variable h i is introduced to denote if pipeline i i 5 or 6 is online h i 1 or offline h i 0 regional demand is satisfied through optimized use of the desalination plant groundwater source and the three surface water sources including tbc alafia river and the reservoir the objective function of the optimization problem is to minimize total operation cost as defined in eq 1 1 f i 1 9 c i q i where c i is a coefficient that represents operators preference in moving water through pipeline q i the sets of constraints and necessary expressions for defining the objective functions are described below eq 2 ensures that regional water demand represented by wd is met

introduced for each bi directional pipepine as shown in eq 11 eqs 12 and 13 set the boundary for positive flow where a binary variable s i denotes positive flow s i 1 or negative flow s i 0 similarly

water availability for the three surface water sources including tampa by pass canal tbc alafia river and the regional reservoir is calculated in a separated model surface water availability is then passed to the system operation model to determine optimal water use from different sources considering operational preference and costs actual surface water use is then passed back to surface water availability model to update initial status for the next time step in the simulation optimization framework inter process communication is used to send messages between surface water availability model and system operation model to reduce computing time computation of 334 realization is distributed across a computer cluster using matlab distributed computing toolbox the flowchart in fig 3 depicts all the processes involving different models 2 4 water shortage mitigation strategies identifying water shortage mitigation strategies is an essential part of an effective water shortage mitigation plan such often requires expert knowledge of the water supply system although there are some general guidelines identifying optimal mitigation strategies is beyond scope of this work both demand side and supply side mitigation options are proposed for stage iii and iv shortage conditions table 1 stage iii and iv declarations for tbw are often consistent with water restriction orders issued by southwest florida water management district regulatory agency which reduces outdoor water use from 2 day per week to 1 day per week nearly 1 demand reduction on supply side increased production from both tbc and alafia river would mitigate shortage situations previous study revealed that alafia river withdrawal increasing from 10 to 19 of river flow would enhance system reliability asefa et al 2013 during stage iii harney augmentation from tbc middle pool is activated and middle pool elevation can be lowered to 10 feet 3 05 m while under normal condition the pool elevation is at12 feet 3 66 m or above in stage iv further withdrawal from tbc lower pool by lowering low pool elevation to 7 5 feet 2 29 m supplements surface water treatment production to consider time needed for tbw s requests to be approved by its regulatory agency in practice delayed implementation of those mitigation strategies is considered in the model 2 5 evaluation of water shortage mitigation strategies to examine the difference between implementing the original water shortage triggers and the new set of triggers retrospective analysis using historical inflow demand data was first conducted the framework is then applied to the year 2030 to simulate future tbw operations with an average demand of up to 280 mgd 1 06 million cubic meters per day satisfying water demands over 280 mgd 1 06 million cubic meters per day would require extra infrastructure investment in evaluating the benefit of water shortage mitigation strategies for both historical and future years corresponding mitigation strategies are triggered when distinct water shortage stages are declared activation of such mitigation strategies were implemented through changing water source availability or regional demand in daily simulation optimization eqs 1 17 for instance when demand side mitigation action of lowering regional demand by 1 is activated a coefficient of 0 99 is applied to the left hand side of eq 2 a key indicator of increased benefit gained through employing the proactive water shortage mitigation plan is how much demand can be met without violation of the consolidated water use permit the characteristics of cwup permit violation is examined by its frequency magnitude and duration to calculate its frequency the number of months with 12 month average cwup production over 90 mgd is normalized by the total number of months in the 100 simulation years magnitude is defined as average overage for those months with cwup over production median magnitude is then calculated from all the cwup over production events in each realization similarly median duration is defined from multiple cwup over production events in one realization the advantage of using median statistic is to capture all over production events within one realization rather than focusing on a particular event with a large overage or duration 3 results in this section seasonal varying target level of reservoir stage is first presented for declaring distinct water shortage stages retrospective analysis that incorporates water shortage trigger and mitigation measures are then reported finally results from evaluation of mitigation strategies using future year simulation are discussed 3 1 trigger development four incremental stages i to iv namely drought alert drought warning regional supply shortage and water supply crisis are used to denote water shortage conditions with varying severity the first two stages drought alert and drought warning are primarily triggered by the two climatic and hydrologic indicators rcd rainfall and rmd flow preliminary analysis has determined thresholds for hydrologic indicators which is 5 in 12 7 cm for rcd rainfall and 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day for rcd flow table 1 note that threshold values for water shortage indicators should be derived based on historical data in study area a drought alert is the mildest indication of a potential water shortage conditions with a deficit in rainfall or streamflow but not necessarily both a drought warning is a more severe hydrologic indication of an upcoming water shortage condition for exiting this stage surface water flows must return to normal rules designed in table 1 ensure that triggered shortage stages advance or regress by at most one stage between months to trigger stage iii and iv the median of forecasted reservoir storage is compared to target level as discussed later in the discussion section there is no uniform way to utilize the forward looking probabilistic reservoir level in this study we use 50th percentile of forecasted ensemble of reservoir storage target level for each calendar month is derived using historical reservoir levels to recognize seasonal varying risk profiles of a surface water system stage iii and stage iv target level corresponds to 25th and 10th percentile of model simulations of historical reservoir levels respectively fig 4 by doing so a certain reservoir level in different months indicates distinct risk in surface water supply availability for instance reservoir level of 110 ft about 50 full in may which is a dry season with peak water demand pose much less risk than the same reservoir level in october right after the rainy season the exit levels for stage iii and iv correspond to 35th and 25th percentile of historical simulation values respectively by examining both current and one season ahead conditions this ensures the surface water system will be recovered a regional supply shortage is a more severe water shortage condition with rcd flow exceeding a 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day deficit and the median of reservoir forecasts ensemble for the three month look ahead is below the target level 25th percentile for that month for the system to exist this stage the reservoir storage needs to recover as indicated by both current reservoir level and forecasted reservoir level for the upcoming 3 months 35th percentile both are required to be above stage iii exit levels a water supply crisis is the most severe water shortage condition in this situation a prolonged shortage in streamflow has produced near or total exhaustion of reservoir storage which is less than 10th percentile when this stage occurs heavy reliance on other water sources is required soon similarly exit conditions for stage iv ensures streamflow is steady improving with rmd flow deficit less than 5 mgd 0 019 million cubic meters per day or both current reservoir level and forecasted reservoir level for the upcoming three months are above stage iv exit levels 25th percentile an illustrative example of water shortage stage declaration is presented in fig 5 for instance water shortage stage ii was declared for january 2007 both rcd rainfall and rmd flow evaluated at the end of january are above the threshold values to determine if stage iii should be declared for february 2007 the contingent condition is whether the median of forecasted reservoir level falls below the target level for april grey lines represent different realizations of reservoir level for the upcoming three months the median reservoir level forecasts represented by the blue line is below the target level for a phase iii regional supply shortage all entry conditions for water shortage stage iii listed in table 1 are met thus entering stage iii shortage is warranted 3 2 retrospective analysis retrospective analysis using historical flow and demand data in the period of 2005 2015 was conducted the primary purposes of retrospective analysis are to a validate the model by comparing observed and simulated water production and b examine the benefit of mitigation strategies retrospective analysis with no activation of mitigation actions is defined as no mitigation scenario and the retrospective analysis with mitigation actions is defined as mitigation scenario fig 6 a shows simulated water shortage stages in different colors as well as rcd rainfall and rmd flow for the simulation period for the no mitigation scenario as expected rainfall and streamflow indicators are highly correlated with correlation coefficient of 0 80 for shortage stage iii and iv both hydrologic indicators well exceed their trigger values fig 6 b shows water shortage stages when the new mitigation methodology is implemented results indicate that proactive mitigation actions can delay the start of a severe shortage situation reducing the duration of stage iv during the processes of the water supply system recovering from severe conditions proactive actions e g increased alafia river withdrawal result in a higher reservoir elevation leading to prolonged duration of stage ii increased emergency withdrawal from alafia river is one of the most effective mitigation actions in enhancing surface water production fig 7 compares alafia river withdrawal between the no mitigation scenario and mitigation scenario increased permit from alafia is not activated until the system is under regional supply shortage stage iii or supply crisis stage iv average withdrawal from alafia river in stage iii and iv is increased by 45 from 12 2 mgd to 17 9 mgd it is worth noting that even with increased permitted withdrawal under those circumstance limited flow availability does not always allow water pumping from the alafia river due to permit constraints for 11 out of 52 months 21 2 of such shortage months there is no water to harvest from river additional validation of the system operation model includes simulating historical operations such as tbw finished water delivery to city of tampa and comparing simulated values to actual data finished water delivery from tbw to city of tampa only occurs during drier than normal conditions as shown in fig 8 consistence is observed between model simulation and actual delivery data most of the purchases are in stage iii and iv situations with an exception in 2010 which is due to decreasing streamflow in the hillsborough river since 2012 city of tampa has managed to satisfy its own demand without purchasing any finished water from tbw primary due to favorable hydrologic conditions indicated by rcd rainfall and rmd flow as shown in fig 5 3 3 future year simulation stochastic daily demand and flow for the year 2030 are used as input to run the system operation model the length of different water shortage stages is normalized by the total number of months in 100 years as shown in fig 9 a for the mitigation scenario each boxplot is comprised of such percentage values from all realizations results show that the median percent of time for stage iv is 26 which is larger than that of other shortage stages this reflects the fact that the severity of stage iv shortage would take longer for the system to recover although the occurrence of such severe shortage is very infrequent this is validated by fig 9 b which illustrates that the number of stage iv shortage events is the least results presented in fig 9 for the mitigation scenario is similar for the no mitigation scenario not shown which is consistent with retrospective analysis that mitigation actions may delay the start of a severe stage but cannot eliminate its occurrence all together to examine the benefits of mitigation strategies in reducing groundwater production characteristics of cwup over production is compared between the no mitigation scenario and mitigation scenario results reveal that the potential risk of violating cwup permit is substantially reduced in the mitigation scenario fig 10 a shows the scatterplot between long term monthly average demand and percentage of cwup overproduction for all realizations for those with long term demand less than 235 mgd 0 89 million cubic meters per day there is no occurrence of cwup overproduction with increasing demand there is an increased chance for 12 month cwup production exceeding 90 mgd 0 34 million cubic meters per day the maximum percentage for one realization with long term average demand close to 280 mgd 1 06 million cubic meters per day is 3 8 similar observation is found in fig 10 b for the mitigation scenario compared to the no mitigation scenario there are strikingly less number of realizations from 104 to 56 with cwup overproduction the maximum percentage is decreased from 3 8 to 3 3 the number of realizations with percentage value over 2 0 is reduced from 11 realizations for the no mitigation scenario to only 2 realizations for the mitigation scenario fig 11 displays the median magnitude of cwup overproduction events for all the realizations in both no mitigation and mitigation scenarios the maximum of the median magnitude across all the realizations in the no mitigation scenario is 25 mgd 0 095 million cubic meters per day which is greater than for the mitigation scenario of 20 mgd 0 076 million cubic meters per day in addition the number of realizations with median cwup overage greater than 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day is substantially reduced from 18 to 6 combined with the magnitude of cwup overproduction duration of an event can be used to represent the severity of potential permit violations fig 12 a shows the median duration of over production events across all the realizations for the no mitigation scenario similar information for the mitigation scenario is shown in fig 12 b the maximum of median duration is 26 months compared to 20 months for the mitigation scenario the number of realizations with median magnitude greater than 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day is reduced from 13 for the no mitigation scenario to 5 for the mitigation scenario therefore implementing the new mitigation strategies e g increasing surface water harvest would lead to lower groundwater production 4 discussion important features of the new methodology include 1 consideration of seasonal supply and demand uncertainty 2 application of forward looking system storage reservoir level as one indicator in declaring current month s water shortage stage and 3 recognition of seasonal varying risk profiles of a water supply system as discussed earlier most water shortage triggers recognize drought related hydrologic conditions although those indices are informative in indicating potential regional water shortage they do not explicitly consider uncertainties in regional water supply and demand it can be argued that supply source decreases are foreseeable when it is in drought condition still the magnitude of supply reduction and potential demand reduction due to demand management options should be explicitly considered to evaluate near term water shortage situations stochastic simulations of a water supply system incorporating both seasonal demand and supply uncertainties will address this issue with recent advances in climate modeling techniques and data assimilation methods the application of data assimilation using updated modeling outputs or on ground observation has been addressed e g wang and fu 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2016 which can be easily incorporated into the proposed framework the second feature of the new methodology is applying forward looking system storage reservoir level as one indicator in declaring current month s water shortage stage in doing so water managers are more proactive in preparing for severe water shortage if this situation is likely to occur in practice there is often a delay in demand side and supply side action implementation this is due to the time it takes for regulatory agencies to approve emergency orders having a proactive tool such as the one presented here facilitate regional water supply managers in facing water shortage conditions it is worth mentioning that there is no uniform way to utilize the forward looking probabilistic forecasts e g reservoir level in this study ensemble median 50th percentile of forecasted reservoir level is compared with target levels one may use a different percentile of the forecasting ensemble for comparison purpose to a certain degree it reflects one s subjective belief in the forecasted reservoir level with uncertainty propagated from the system operation model and forecasted demand flow data it is also indicative of one s risk attitude in managing the water supply system for instance if a severe stage is defined when 80th percentile of the forecasted reservoir level is below the target level one takes the risk not to declare the severe shortage stage even if the chance of lowering the reservoir to the target level is 75 which could be considered incautious on the contrary if 20th percentile of the forecasted reservoir level is used then one could be considered conservative or too cautious as there is 80 chance that the reservoir level could be higher than the target level the third feature of the new methodology is the recognition of seasonal varying risk profiles of a water supply system as previously stated the same reservoir storage in different month may indicate a distinct risk level for the water supply system this approach is consistent with standard reservoir operations where operation curves are of changing target levels in different seasons there is a typical drawdown and refill cycle for surface storage reservoirs which follows the seasonality of water use and rainfall throughout the year reservoir refill occurs through and after the rainy season when surplus flows are available if the amount of stored water falls below targets this denotes that river flows are below seasonal climatology and the water supply system is potentially at risk of not meeting demands in the future by recognizing seasonal varying risk profiles the proposed framework better captures potential risks of regional water shortages this is especially useful for water supply systems that have within year reservoirs where short term operation and mitigation actions are important in managing within year water shortage risks the proposed framework is intended to complement level of service based supply planning where building infrastructure for less frequent but extreme situation is cost prohibitive the water shortage mitigation framework presented in this study aims to guide short term water resources operation during extended drought condition possibly avoiding investment of an infrequently used supply infrastructure at an earlier and unnecessary time it can also be used as a decision trigger tool of when long term infrastructure investment is needed if the occurrence of severe water shortage stages has now become more frequent than before for instance it has been shown in fig 9 that the chance of groundwater over production becomes higher as system long term demand increases such relationship can be used to determine at what level of water demand additional infrastructure should be invested to avoid increasing risk of groundwater permit violation 5 conclusion an effective water shortage mitigation plan is important for water managers to guide though different shortage situations avoiding regional supply shortfalls and potential regulatory violations to achieve this such plan should include well defined water shortage triggers and effective mitigation strategies this study presents an approach based on proactive water shortage triggers that incorporate uncertainties in three month ahead demand and supply water shortage triggers are primarily comprised of antecedent hydrologic conditions and a future reservoir storage condition allowing for proactive mitigations actions incremental water shortage conditions as well as both demand side and supply side mitigation strategies are defined based on water shortage severities overall the three main characteristics of the framework are a the consideration of seasonal supply and demand uncertainty b the application of forward looking reservoir level as one indicator in declaring current month s water shortage stage and c the recognition of seasonal varying risk profiles of a water supply system the framework is demonstrated for a regional water supply agency tampa bay water in the southeast u s retrospective analysis using actual flow and demand data as well as future scenarios using stochastic flow demand data for 2030 were conducted although severe water shortage situations cannot be eliminated proactive water shortage triggers foresee such severe conditions and mitigation actions help to delay their start increased surface water harvesting when allowed from alafia river is one of the most effective mitigation actions in enhancing surface water production during the period 2005 2015 average withdrawal from alafia river in stage iii and iv for the mitigation scenario is increased by 45 from 12 2 mgd to 17 9 mgd 0 046 to 0 068 million cubic meters per day the proposed framework is effective in reducing the failure of meeting demand and lowering the risk of groundwater permit violation compared to the no mitigation scenario there are striking less number of realizations with cwup overproduction which is nearly 50 reduction from 104 to 56 the magnitude and duration of cwup overproduction events are also reduced owing to the mitigation strategies this framework has board application to those areas which rely on surface waters and have limited reservoir storage especially for those with increasing skills of seasonal climate forecasts and enso state prediction declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6674,a complete water shortage mitigation plan which includes water shortage indicators and mitigation measures is essential in adaptive water resources management current water shortage triggers used to manage water supply shortages typically recognize only past and current hydrologic conditions and system states e g reservoir storage or water levels a systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of water shortage mitigation measures is often lacked this study proposes a general framework based on daily simulation optimization computation scheme to develop water shortage mitigation plan it includes an innovative simulation optimization based water shortage trigger framework incorporating both demand and supply side uncertainties to evaluate the state of a water supply system stochastically generated demand supply ensembles were used to simulate system decision variables that were used jointly with past and current hydrologic conditions to prescribe water shortage stages each water shortage stage was tied to specific demand and supply side adaptive management actions a mixed integer programming model optimizing source allocation from surface water harvesting groundwater production and a desalination plant was then used to minimize operational costs and protect the environment while meeting regional demand cumulative mitigation actions were implemented as the system moves progressively to a severe water shortage stage retrospective analysis using observed flow and demand in the past decade 2005 2015 was used to vet the approach and demonstrate the advantage of forward looking water shortage trigger development scheme a combination of mitigation measures is evaluated using stochastic flow and demand in the year 2030 revealing that increased magnitude of groundwater production under severe water shortage situations could be largely 50 reduced owing to proactive mitigation actions the framework was applied to tampa bay water and it has general applications to regional water resources management for utilities across us and beyond keywords water shortage mitigation proactive trigger development system uncertainty 1 introduction water use in the united states has increased from 180 billion gallons 0 68 billion cubic meter per day in the 1950s to 355 billion gallons per day in 2010 maupin et al 2014 at the same time increasing frequency of extreme events for instance the severe droughts in california and texas in recent years griffin and anchukaitis 2014 seager et al 2014 su and dickinson 2014 and potential drought risk under changing climate venkataraman et al 2016 cook et al 2015 have forced water suppliers to face unprecedented water shortage problems rijsberman 2006 hummu et al 2010 increased frequency of water shortages throughout the world have shaped the development of demand management and supply enhancement mitigation strategies the us epa recently released drought response and recovery guide to provide best practices of demand and supply options effective communication and partnerships for water utilities epa 2016 the guide recommends that regional water utilities should develop tailored strategies depending on customers water use supply source operational preferences and willingness and ability to enforce water use restrictions to enhance system reliability and resilience to water shortages many water utilities resort to diversified water supply sources whitler 2015 diversity of water supply sources for a water utility is often indicative of its ability to withstand water shortage situations resulting in a much more robust water supply system that is capable of absorbing system shocks a recent survey conducted by american water works association awwa reveals that among the 483 utilities surveyed nearly 91 have a formal or an informal water shortage preparedness plan awwa 2014 the frequency of water shortages could however be used to inform when and how infrastructure expansion could be triggered in an adaptation pathway framework haasnoot et al 2013 an effective water shortage mitigation plan aims to manage residual risk that cannot be met by existing infrastructure coping with infrequent but extended drought conditions such water shortage mitigation plans serve as a soft path for regional water management avoiding investment of an infrequently used supply infrastructure drought indicators are sometimes used as a surrogate of water shortage indicators by water practitioners to denote the severity of drought and its impact on water supply availability specific indices created to evaluate drought include days of supply remaining standardized precipitation index and palmer drought index in addition there are complex models that consider soil moisture and other relevant hydrologic variables for drought monitoring the handbook of drought indicators and indices world meteorological organization and global water partnership 2016 loucks and van beek 2005 provides a comprehensive review of distinct drought indices employed around the world among those indices u s drought monitor established in 1999 is a composite index that includes many indicators and is widely used by policymakers rather than using a single attribute comprehensive water shortage indicators incorporate multiple attributes such as precipitation streamflow drought index surface water reservoir storage and groundwater level based on the american water works association awwa 2014 survey the three most commonly employed water shortage indicators are current supply availability reservoir level or status and high demand periods recent hydrologic conditions and current reservoir levels reflect water shortage conditions and are commonly used by many utilities however those indicators fail to recognize the importance of future climatic hydrologic conditions or possible changes in supply system status variables hence such systems are ill equipped to implement proactive decision making incorporating mid range forecasts of precipitation and streamflow and other relevant information are paramount to developing proactive water shortage indicators that look at both supply and demand of a system utilization of hydrologic forecasts is limited in practice primarily due to three reasons first limited forecasting skills of seasonal precipitation and streamflow have prohibited their wide application with recent advancement in seasonal flow forecasting skills from hydrologic models and or advanced statistical models such limitation is becoming less of a barrier in its application in water resources management for instance the utility of seasonal precipitation and streamflow forecasts based on climate model outputs has been demonstrated in other studies sankarasubramanian et al 2014 li et al 2014 sankarasubramanian et al 2009 however applying research results to everyday water management decisions by utilities in making seasonal water resources decisions does not commonly occur second limited access to expertise required to make forecast useful to the stakeholder e g utilizing deterministic or probabilistic forecasts as well as effectively communicating ensemble outlooks is an additional barrier to forecast implementation changnon et al 1995 rayner et al 2005 third most water utility practitioners tend to utilize historical data to derive standard operation rules and hesitate to modify standard operation protocol missing opportunities to address regional water supply challenges such approach leaves them vulnerable to hydrologic shocks which may result in forced capital expenditures for infrastructure that may not be needed this study proposes to utilize probabilistic reservoir storage forecasts as one of water shortage indicators in addition to streamflow uncertainty seasonal demand uncertainty also plays an important role in affecting seasonal water supply operations this is particularly important for areas with high intra annual demand variability in the southeastern u s where surface reservoir storage is not as large as those in the western u s intra annual demand variability can be very important surface reservoirs developed in the western u s typically are sized to handle droughts that last for 1 3 years most water shortage triggers rely on past and current hydrologic conditions and a few considers system state variables in the coming months e g reservoir storage uncertainties in flow and demand are often neglected or oversimplified in reservoir storage forecasts with regards to evaluating water shortage measures water system modeling at coarse temporal resolution e g monthly or annual time scale is often used this study describes a framework based on a daily simulation optimization computation scheme to facilitate developing water shortage mitigation plan it incorporates both seasonal supply and demand uncertainties to define water shortage stages it application is demonstrated at a regional water supply utility the innovative aspects of this framework are the application of a system simulation optimization model and use of probabilistic flow and demand forecast as components of proactive water shortage mitigation the specific objectives of this study are to a develop probabilistic forecasts of reservoir storage elevation based on uncertain regional demand and streamflow b propose water shortage triggers that explicitly incorporate past hydrologic conditions and reservoir storage elevation forecasts and c evaluate the effectiveness of water shortage mitigation strategies in short term water resources management this paper is arranged as follows the introduction section is followed by a description of the study area and explanation of the methodology in section 2 results from both retrospective analysis using 2005 2015 actual flow and demand as well as future scenarios analysis using stochastic flow and demand data for the year 2030 are presented in section 3 in section 4 the main outcome of the proposed framework and the linkage between adaptive water shortage mitigation management and long term water supply planning is discussed finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 study area and methodology 2 1 a study area tampa bay water tbw formed in 1998 is a regional water utility in southwest florida that provides wholesale water to six member governments cities of tampa st petersburg and new port richey and counties of hillsborough pinellas and pasco fig 1 serving about 2 5 million residents regional average annual demand ranges between 220 and 259 million gallons per day mgd 0 83 0 98 million cubic meters per day among the six member governments city of tampa cot has its own surface water supply system and purchases potable water from tbw when a supply deficit occurs tbw has a diverse and integrated water supply system with 13 groundwater wellfields up to 121 1 mgd 0 455 million cubic meters per day permitted capacity on annual basis a 120 mgd 0 455 million cubic meters per day surface water treatment plant and a 15 billion gallon 5 68 107 cubic meter off stream reservoir and a 27 85 mgd 0 095 million cubic meters per day permitted capacity desalinated seawater plant this system can be effectively managed to optimize use of both the groundwater and surface water systems as stated in the agreement between member governments and tbw the authority tbw shall have the absolute and unequivocal obligation to meet water needs of the member governments interlocal agreement for tampa bay water 1998 hence tbw has the responsibility to avoid possible shortfall even under extended drought periods by effectively rotating supply sources tbw has three surface water sources tampa by pass canal tbc alafia river and the c w bill yong regional reservoir tbc primarily designed as a flooding control facility for use during flood events became a major water supply for tbw in 2002 the tbc is connected to the city of tampa s hillsborough river reservoir through a canal that allows not only flood water relief but water from the tbc can be pumped back to the city s reservoir to augment the city s surface water supply system under seasonal shortage and or drought conditions the permit for alafia river allows tbw to withdraw 10 of its flow up to 60 mgd 0 227 million cubic meters per day if river flow is above the minimum flow threshold as for groundwater tbw has a consolidated water use permit for 11 wellfields which is 90 mgd 0 341 million cubic meters per day regulated as a 12 month running average groundwater withdrawals from these wellfields are optimized to minimize water level drawdown in environmentally sensitive areas central florida as well as much of the southeast us experiences frequent droughts triggered by interannual climate variability primarily associated with enso cycles mo and schemm 2008 it is cost prohibitive for tbw to build supply infrastructure to meet all demand scenarios given demand uncertainty to mitigate water shortages tbw has developed demand side and supply side adaptive management options for incremental water shortage stages triggered by extended drought conditions on the demand side for example increasing outdoor water use restrictions from 2 day per week to 1 day per week is implemented when the service area is in severe water shortage conditions whereas as a supply side mitigation strategy tbw can temporarily increase withdraw from 10 to 19 from the alafia river if water is available in the river above its minimum flow requirements those mitigation strategies have successfully guided tbw through most water shortages events current water demands in tbw s service area have recovered to pre economic recession levels recent long term demand forecasts indicate a steady increase in water demands over the next 20 year planning horizon tbw continues to rely on its surface water system to meet increasing demands however with the potential for climate change to increase rainfall uncertainty the need to improve mid range rainfall and streamflow forecast became apparent in addition tbw has adopted a reliability based level of service strategy for future supply planning asefa et al 2015 a key management strategy is the implementation of a water shortage mitigation plan that allows the region to meet demands during infrequent but extreme hydrologically driven water shortage events by incorporating mid range forecasting into a water shortage mitigation plan this management strategy is the topic of this paper 2 2 b water shortage indicators tbw s original water shortage mitigation plan included three water shortage indicators including two hydrologic triggers and an indicator of current reservoir storage the two hydrologic triggers are 12 month rolling cumulative deficit rainfall rcd rainfall as an indicator of climatic and seasonal weather conditions and 12 month rolling median deficit flow rmd flow a surrogate for hydrologic response rcd rainfall is calculated based on rainfall data over 28 selected gauges in the region for each calendar month of the year long term mean monthly rainfall is first determined deviations from long term average at each station for the past 12 months are then obtained as temporal average surplus deficit rcd rainfall is calculated as the sum of regional average rainfall surplus deficit across all the stations essentially it is the total rainfall surplus or deficit over the most recent 12 month period as judged by average surplus or deficit conditions across multiple rainfall stations the trigger associated with streamflow rmd flow is calculated in a similar fashion to rcd rainfall except that the long term median is used instead of long term mean since the median is less sensitive to extreme values the third existing indicator is current reservoir storage at the beginning of a month which is combined with the two hydrologic indicators above to determine water shortage stage for the month as discussed earlier a trigger based on only current reservoir stage fails to recognize system uncertainties including regional demand and supply uncertainty and potential operation adjustments to overcome such shortcomings forecasted reservoir storage at the end of a three month ahead was developed to replace current reservoir storage as the third indicator to obtain reservoir storage three months ahead both supply and demand estimates from forecasting models are needed to run the system operation model the median of the ensemble reservoir storage forecasts is then compared to reservoir target levels explicitly accounting for within year seasonal water shortage risks in determining water shortage stages 2 3 c mathematical formulation of water supply system operation in this study different component models including a demand forecasting model a stochastic streamflow forecasting model and a system operation model developed in previous studies asefa et al 2015 asefa et al 2014 are used a long term demand forecasting model was developed using water demand data from 2003 to 2014 social economic projections for future years from moody s analytics and data from american community survey hazen and sawyer 2012 such model is used to generate monthly regional demand in future years and then disaggregated to daily resolution detailed description of the demand forecasting model is presented in asefa et al 2014 recent advancement in hydrologic research regarding to streamflow forecasting dechant and moradkhani 2012 mazrooei et al 2015 may further improve streamflow forecasts for tbw this would require further study and it is beyond the scope of this work in this study monthly scale seasonal markov mixture smm models asefa et al 2014 are applied to generate monthly rainfall time series ensemble for rainfall stations in the service area seasonal multivariate linear regression models are then used to generate monthly flow for both morris bridge station at hillsborough river and bells shoals at alafia river to obtain daily time scale streamflow at both stations multivariate nonparametric disaggregation procedure is implemented readers with interests in the details of these techniques and their validation for the study area are referred to asefa et al 2014 for flow simulation 1000 realizations of 100 year daily stochastic flow preserving historical flow characteristics e g long term mean and standard deviation were generated to capture flow uncertainty covering a range of long term flow magnitude similarly 1000 realizations of daily demand time series over 100 year for the time slice 2030 were generated capturing the characteristic of socio economic condition over a range of climatic condition with mean annual demand ranging from 230 to 330 mgd 0 871 to 1 249 million cubic meters per day latin hypercube sampling iman and conover 1982 asefa et al 2014 is used to generate pairs of flow and demand to represent bivariate distribution of the two variables one pair of flow and demand is defined as a realization in total 334 pairs instead of 1 million combinations of flow and demand realizations were found to be sufficient to represent the full distribution the system operation model was built in ampl a mathematic programming language fourer et al 2003 to reflect the flow network carrying water from various supply sources to wholesale delivery points the model incorporates operational preference and hydraulic constraints modeling components including water sources pumping facilities and pipe flows are represented in fig 2 flow at each pipeline is represented by q i where i denotes any connection illustrated in the schematic figure as shown in the schematic figure four connections are bi directional allowing water to be either withdrawn from the regional reservoir or sending back to replenish storage during rainy season a binary variable p i is introduced for those connections where i equals 3 4 6 or 7 to represent positive flow s i 1 or negative flow s i 0 two additional variables po s i and ne g i are introduced to represent positive and negative flow it is worth mentioning that when water is withdrawn from the c w bill young reservoir only one of the two paths leaving node r is online pipeline 6 denotes gravity flow when water level in the reservoir allows such occurrence if not reservoir pump would be turned on to move water through pipeline 5 hence a binary variable h i is introduced to denote if pipeline i i 5 or 6 is online h i 1 or offline h i 0 regional demand is satisfied through optimized use of the desalination plant groundwater source and the three surface water sources including tbc alafia river and the reservoir the objective function of the optimization problem is to minimize total operation cost as defined in eq 1 1 f i 1 9 c i q i where c i is a coefficient that represents operators preference in moving water through pipeline q i the sets of constraints and necessary expressions for defining the objective functions are described below eq 2 ensures that regional water demand represented by wd is met

introduced for each bi directional pipepine as shown in eq 11 eqs 12 and 13 set the boundary for positive flow where a binary variable s i denotes positive flow s i 1 or negative flow s i 0 similarly

water availability for the three surface water sources including tampa by pass canal tbc alafia river and the regional reservoir is calculated in a separated model surface water availability is then passed to the system operation model to determine optimal water use from different sources considering operational preference and costs actual surface water use is then passed back to surface water availability model to update initial status for the next time step in the simulation optimization framework inter process communication is used to send messages between surface water availability model and system operation model to reduce computing time computation of 334 realization is distributed across a computer cluster using matlab distributed computing toolbox the flowchart in fig 3 depicts all the processes involving different models 2 4 water shortage mitigation strategies identifying water shortage mitigation strategies is an essential part of an effective water shortage mitigation plan such often requires expert knowledge of the water supply system although there are some general guidelines identifying optimal mitigation strategies is beyond scope of this work both demand side and supply side mitigation options are proposed for stage iii and iv shortage conditions table 1 stage iii and iv declarations for tbw are often consistent with water restriction orders issued by southwest florida water management district regulatory agency which reduces outdoor water use from 2 day per week to 1 day per week nearly 1 demand reduction on supply side increased production from both tbc and alafia river would mitigate shortage situations previous study revealed that alafia river withdrawal increasing from 10 to 19 of river flow would enhance system reliability asefa et al 2013 during stage iii harney augmentation from tbc middle pool is activated and middle pool elevation can be lowered to 10 feet 3 05 m while under normal condition the pool elevation is at12 feet 3 66 m or above in stage iv further withdrawal from tbc lower pool by lowering low pool elevation to 7 5 feet 2 29 m supplements surface water treatment production to consider time needed for tbw s requests to be approved by its regulatory agency in practice delayed implementation of those mitigation strategies is considered in the model 2 5 evaluation of water shortage mitigation strategies to examine the difference between implementing the original water shortage triggers and the new set of triggers retrospective analysis using historical inflow demand data was first conducted the framework is then applied to the year 2030 to simulate future tbw operations with an average demand of up to 280 mgd 1 06 million cubic meters per day satisfying water demands over 280 mgd 1 06 million cubic meters per day would require extra infrastructure investment in evaluating the benefit of water shortage mitigation strategies for both historical and future years corresponding mitigation strategies are triggered when distinct water shortage stages are declared activation of such mitigation strategies were implemented through changing water source availability or regional demand in daily simulation optimization eqs 1 17 for instance when demand side mitigation action of lowering regional demand by 1 is activated a coefficient of 0 99 is applied to the left hand side of eq 2 a key indicator of increased benefit gained through employing the proactive water shortage mitigation plan is how much demand can be met without violation of the consolidated water use permit the characteristics of cwup permit violation is examined by its frequency magnitude and duration to calculate its frequency the number of months with 12 month average cwup production over 90 mgd is normalized by the total number of months in the 100 simulation years magnitude is defined as average overage for those months with cwup over production median magnitude is then calculated from all the cwup over production events in each realization similarly median duration is defined from multiple cwup over production events in one realization the advantage of using median statistic is to capture all over production events within one realization rather than focusing on a particular event with a large overage or duration 3 results in this section seasonal varying target level of reservoir stage is first presented for declaring distinct water shortage stages retrospective analysis that incorporates water shortage trigger and mitigation measures are then reported finally results from evaluation of mitigation strategies using future year simulation are discussed 3 1 trigger development four incremental stages i to iv namely drought alert drought warning regional supply shortage and water supply crisis are used to denote water shortage conditions with varying severity the first two stages drought alert and drought warning are primarily triggered by the two climatic and hydrologic indicators rcd rainfall and rmd flow preliminary analysis has determined thresholds for hydrologic indicators which is 5 in 12 7 cm for rcd rainfall and 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day for rcd flow table 1 note that threshold values for water shortage indicators should be derived based on historical data in study area a drought alert is the mildest indication of a potential water shortage conditions with a deficit in rainfall or streamflow but not necessarily both a drought warning is a more severe hydrologic indication of an upcoming water shortage condition for exiting this stage surface water flows must return to normal rules designed in table 1 ensure that triggered shortage stages advance or regress by at most one stage between months to trigger stage iii and iv the median of forecasted reservoir storage is compared to target level as discussed later in the discussion section there is no uniform way to utilize the forward looking probabilistic reservoir level in this study we use 50th percentile of forecasted ensemble of reservoir storage target level for each calendar month is derived using historical reservoir levels to recognize seasonal varying risk profiles of a surface water system stage iii and stage iv target level corresponds to 25th and 10th percentile of model simulations of historical reservoir levels respectively fig 4 by doing so a certain reservoir level in different months indicates distinct risk in surface water supply availability for instance reservoir level of 110 ft about 50 full in may which is a dry season with peak water demand pose much less risk than the same reservoir level in october right after the rainy season the exit levels for stage iii and iv correspond to 35th and 25th percentile of historical simulation values respectively by examining both current and one season ahead conditions this ensures the surface water system will be recovered a regional supply shortage is a more severe water shortage condition with rcd flow exceeding a 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day deficit and the median of reservoir forecasts ensemble for the three month look ahead is below the target level 25th percentile for that month for the system to exist this stage the reservoir storage needs to recover as indicated by both current reservoir level and forecasted reservoir level for the upcoming 3 months 35th percentile both are required to be above stage iii exit levels a water supply crisis is the most severe water shortage condition in this situation a prolonged shortage in streamflow has produced near or total exhaustion of reservoir storage which is less than 10th percentile when this stage occurs heavy reliance on other water sources is required soon similarly exit conditions for stage iv ensures streamflow is steady improving with rmd flow deficit less than 5 mgd 0 019 million cubic meters per day or both current reservoir level and forecasted reservoir level for the upcoming three months are above stage iv exit levels 25th percentile an illustrative example of water shortage stage declaration is presented in fig 5 for instance water shortage stage ii was declared for january 2007 both rcd rainfall and rmd flow evaluated at the end of january are above the threshold values to determine if stage iii should be declared for february 2007 the contingent condition is whether the median of forecasted reservoir level falls below the target level for april grey lines represent different realizations of reservoir level for the upcoming three months the median reservoir level forecasts represented by the blue line is below the target level for a phase iii regional supply shortage all entry conditions for water shortage stage iii listed in table 1 are met thus entering stage iii shortage is warranted 3 2 retrospective analysis retrospective analysis using historical flow and demand data in the period of 2005 2015 was conducted the primary purposes of retrospective analysis are to a validate the model by comparing observed and simulated water production and b examine the benefit of mitigation strategies retrospective analysis with no activation of mitigation actions is defined as no mitigation scenario and the retrospective analysis with mitigation actions is defined as mitigation scenario fig 6 a shows simulated water shortage stages in different colors as well as rcd rainfall and rmd flow for the simulation period for the no mitigation scenario as expected rainfall and streamflow indicators are highly correlated with correlation coefficient of 0 80 for shortage stage iii and iv both hydrologic indicators well exceed their trigger values fig 6 b shows water shortage stages when the new mitigation methodology is implemented results indicate that proactive mitigation actions can delay the start of a severe shortage situation reducing the duration of stage iv during the processes of the water supply system recovering from severe conditions proactive actions e g increased alafia river withdrawal result in a higher reservoir elevation leading to prolonged duration of stage ii increased emergency withdrawal from alafia river is one of the most effective mitigation actions in enhancing surface water production fig 7 compares alafia river withdrawal between the no mitigation scenario and mitigation scenario increased permit from alafia is not activated until the system is under regional supply shortage stage iii or supply crisis stage iv average withdrawal from alafia river in stage iii and iv is increased by 45 from 12 2 mgd to 17 9 mgd it is worth noting that even with increased permitted withdrawal under those circumstance limited flow availability does not always allow water pumping from the alafia river due to permit constraints for 11 out of 52 months 21 2 of such shortage months there is no water to harvest from river additional validation of the system operation model includes simulating historical operations such as tbw finished water delivery to city of tampa and comparing simulated values to actual data finished water delivery from tbw to city of tampa only occurs during drier than normal conditions as shown in fig 8 consistence is observed between model simulation and actual delivery data most of the purchases are in stage iii and iv situations with an exception in 2010 which is due to decreasing streamflow in the hillsborough river since 2012 city of tampa has managed to satisfy its own demand without purchasing any finished water from tbw primary due to favorable hydrologic conditions indicated by rcd rainfall and rmd flow as shown in fig 5 3 3 future year simulation stochastic daily demand and flow for the year 2030 are used as input to run the system operation model the length of different water shortage stages is normalized by the total number of months in 100 years as shown in fig 9 a for the mitigation scenario each boxplot is comprised of such percentage values from all realizations results show that the median percent of time for stage iv is 26 which is larger than that of other shortage stages this reflects the fact that the severity of stage iv shortage would take longer for the system to recover although the occurrence of such severe shortage is very infrequent this is validated by fig 9 b which illustrates that the number of stage iv shortage events is the least results presented in fig 9 for the mitigation scenario is similar for the no mitigation scenario not shown which is consistent with retrospective analysis that mitigation actions may delay the start of a severe stage but cannot eliminate its occurrence all together to examine the benefits of mitigation strategies in reducing groundwater production characteristics of cwup over production is compared between the no mitigation scenario and mitigation scenario results reveal that the potential risk of violating cwup permit is substantially reduced in the mitigation scenario fig 10 a shows the scatterplot between long term monthly average demand and percentage of cwup overproduction for all realizations for those with long term demand less than 235 mgd 0 89 million cubic meters per day there is no occurrence of cwup overproduction with increasing demand there is an increased chance for 12 month cwup production exceeding 90 mgd 0 34 million cubic meters per day the maximum percentage for one realization with long term average demand close to 280 mgd 1 06 million cubic meters per day is 3 8 similar observation is found in fig 10 b for the mitigation scenario compared to the no mitigation scenario there are strikingly less number of realizations from 104 to 56 with cwup overproduction the maximum percentage is decreased from 3 8 to 3 3 the number of realizations with percentage value over 2 0 is reduced from 11 realizations for the no mitigation scenario to only 2 realizations for the mitigation scenario fig 11 displays the median magnitude of cwup overproduction events for all the realizations in both no mitigation and mitigation scenarios the maximum of the median magnitude across all the realizations in the no mitigation scenario is 25 mgd 0 095 million cubic meters per day which is greater than for the mitigation scenario of 20 mgd 0 076 million cubic meters per day in addition the number of realizations with median cwup overage greater than 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day is substantially reduced from 18 to 6 combined with the magnitude of cwup overproduction duration of an event can be used to represent the severity of potential permit violations fig 12 a shows the median duration of over production events across all the realizations for the no mitigation scenario similar information for the mitigation scenario is shown in fig 12 b the maximum of median duration is 26 months compared to 20 months for the mitigation scenario the number of realizations with median magnitude greater than 10 mgd 0 038 million cubic meters per day is reduced from 13 for the no mitigation scenario to 5 for the mitigation scenario therefore implementing the new mitigation strategies e g increasing surface water harvest would lead to lower groundwater production 4 discussion important features of the new methodology include 1 consideration of seasonal supply and demand uncertainty 2 application of forward looking system storage reservoir level as one indicator in declaring current month s water shortage stage and 3 recognition of seasonal varying risk profiles of a water supply system as discussed earlier most water shortage triggers recognize drought related hydrologic conditions although those indices are informative in indicating potential regional water shortage they do not explicitly consider uncertainties in regional water supply and demand it can be argued that supply source decreases are foreseeable when it is in drought condition still the magnitude of supply reduction and potential demand reduction due to demand management options should be explicitly considered to evaluate near term water shortage situations stochastic simulations of a water supply system incorporating both seasonal demand and supply uncertainties will address this issue with recent advances in climate modeling techniques and data assimilation methods the application of data assimilation using updated modeling outputs or on ground observation has been addressed e g wang and fu 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2016 which can be easily incorporated into the proposed framework the second feature of the new methodology is applying forward looking system storage reservoir level as one indicator in declaring current month s water shortage stage in doing so water managers are more proactive in preparing for severe water shortage if this situation is likely to occur in practice there is often a delay in demand side and supply side action implementation this is due to the time it takes for regulatory agencies to approve emergency orders having a proactive tool such as the one presented here facilitate regional water supply managers in facing water shortage conditions it is worth mentioning that there is no uniform way to utilize the forward looking probabilistic forecasts e g reservoir level in this study ensemble median 50th percentile of forecasted reservoir level is compared with target levels one may use a different percentile of the forecasting ensemble for comparison purpose to a certain degree it reflects one s subjective belief in the forecasted reservoir level with uncertainty propagated from the system operation model and forecasted demand flow data it is also indicative of one s risk attitude in managing the water supply system for instance if a severe stage is defined when 80th percentile of the forecasted reservoir level is below the target level one takes the risk not to declare the severe shortage stage even if the chance of lowering the reservoir to the target level is 75 which could be considered incautious on the contrary if 20th percentile of the forecasted reservoir level is used then one could be considered conservative or too cautious as there is 80 chance that the reservoir level could be higher than the target level the third feature of the new methodology is the recognition of seasonal varying risk profiles of a water supply system as previously stated the same reservoir storage in different month may indicate a distinct risk level for the water supply system this approach is consistent with standard reservoir operations where operation curves are of changing target levels in different seasons there is a typical drawdown and refill cycle for surface storage reservoirs which follows the seasonality of water use and rainfall throughout the year reservoir refill occurs through and after the rainy season when surplus flows are available if the amount of stored water falls below targets this denotes that river flows are below seasonal climatology and the water supply system is potentially at risk of not meeting demands in the future by recognizing seasonal varying risk profiles the proposed framework better captures potential risks of regional water shortages this is especially useful for water supply systems that have within year reservoirs where short term operation and mitigation actions are important in managing within year water shortage risks the proposed framework is intended to complement level of service based supply planning where building infrastructure for less frequent but extreme situation is cost prohibitive the water shortage mitigation framework presented in this study aims to guide short term water resources operation during extended drought condition possibly avoiding investment of an infrequently used supply infrastructure at an earlier and unnecessary time it can also be used as a decision trigger tool of when long term infrastructure investment is needed if the occurrence of severe water shortage stages has now become more frequent than before for instance it has been shown in fig 9 that the chance of groundwater over production becomes higher as system long term demand increases such relationship can be used to determine at what level of water demand additional infrastructure should be invested to avoid increasing risk of groundwater permit violation 5 conclusion an effective water shortage mitigation plan is important for water managers to guide though different shortage situations avoiding regional supply shortfalls and potential regulatory violations to achieve this such plan should include well defined water shortage triggers and effective mitigation strategies this study presents an approach based on proactive water shortage triggers that incorporate uncertainties in three month ahead demand and supply water shortage triggers are primarily comprised of antecedent hydrologic conditions and a future reservoir storage condition allowing for proactive mitigations actions incremental water shortage conditions as well as both demand side and supply side mitigation strategies are defined based on water shortage severities overall the three main characteristics of the framework are a the consideration of seasonal supply and demand uncertainty b the application of forward looking reservoir level as one indicator in declaring current month s water shortage stage and c the recognition of seasonal varying risk profiles of a water supply system the framework is demonstrated for a regional water supply agency tampa bay water in the southeast u s retrospective analysis using actual flow and demand data as well as future scenarios using stochastic flow demand data for 2030 were conducted although severe water shortage situations cannot be eliminated proactive water shortage triggers foresee such severe conditions and mitigation actions help to delay their start increased surface water harvesting when allowed from alafia river is one of the most effective mitigation actions in enhancing surface water production during the period 2005 2015 average withdrawal from alafia river in stage iii and iv for the mitigation scenario is increased by 45 from 12 2 mgd to 17 9 mgd 0 046 to 0 068 million cubic meters per day the proposed framework is effective in reducing the failure of meeting demand and lowering the risk of groundwater permit violation compared to the no mitigation scenario there are striking less number of realizations with cwup overproduction which is nearly 50 reduction from 104 to 56 the magnitude and duration of cwup overproduction events are also reduced owing to the mitigation strategies this framework has board application to those areas which rely on surface waters and have limited reservoir storage especially for those with increasing skills of seasonal climate forecasts and enso state prediction declaration of interests the authors declare that
