12895,the coexistence of tetracycline ttc and cu ii in various water bodies has been frequently detected but their simultaneous removal efficiency is far from satisfactory in this study potassium permanganate kmno4 was utilized to remove ttc and cu ii simultaneously from the aqueous solution the removal efficiency of ttc 10 μm and cu ii 10 μm was 92 8 and 78 5 respectively after 30 mins reaction under the condition of ph 6 0 and kmno4 dose at 50 μm ttc was mainly removed by kmno4 oxidation and cu ii was removed by adsorption on mno2 formed in situ afterward the effects of initial concentrations of ttc and cu ii kmno4 dose solution ph temperature and water matrix on simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii were comprehensively evaluated the increase of kmno4 dose and reaction temperature is more favorable to the improved removal efficiency of ttc and cu ii specifically ttc was almost 100 removed at ph 4 0 while the highest cu ii removal efficiency was 84 9 obtained at ph 7 0 the removal efficiency of ttc and cu ii in surface water remained higher than 79 and 80 respectively the molecular orbital calculations supported that the complexation of ttc with cu ii inhibited the oxidation of ttc by kmno4 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x ray diffraction confirmed that the solid product formed from the reduction of kmno4 was amorphous mno2 furthermore the plausible transformation pathways of ttc were proposed based on the identified intermediates this work provides a cost effective approach for the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii from water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetracycline copper complexation potassium permanganate oxidation 1 introduction tetracycline antibiotics tcs including tetracycline ttc oxytetracycline otc and chlorotetracycline ctc have been adopted extensively to treat human and animal infectious diseases throughout the world 1 2 these chemicals are frequently detected in various aquatic environments such as wastewater drinking water groundwater and surface water due to incomplete digestion and absorption in the human and animal digestive systems 1 3 it has been reported that the long term presence of tcs in aquatic environments poses threats to the ecosystems 3 furthermore tcs could accelerate the generation of antibiotics resistance genes args and antibiotics resistance bacteria arb which are considered as one of the most important public health concerns of this century 4 5 on the other side copper cu ii a non biodegradable toxic heavy metal is also extensively found in wastewater groundwater and surface water because it is considered the most valuable and commonly used metal in many industrial applications 6 7 therefore the co contamination of tcs and cu ii in the aquatic environment is frequently observed worldwide 8 especially tcs and cu ii are widely used in animal production industries to treat infectious diseases or to promote growth 9 the co presence of tcs and cu ii is very common in the wastewater discharged from these industries moreover tcs contain multiple electron rich functional groups such as acetamides and β diketone moieties which cause a strong tendency to interact with cu ii to form metal complexes 10 it has been reported that the interaction of tcs with cu ii makes tcs and cu ii more stable in the environment in addition to accelerating the spread of args 11 12 in this regard simultaneous removal of tcs and cu ii from aqueous solution is of great significance for elimination of their risks to the environment and human health in past decades numerous studies have been focused on the removal of tcs or cu ii separately adsorption 13 chemical oxidation 14 15 and biological treatment 16 have been successfully applied for tcs removal while adsorption 17 18 membrane filtration 19 and precipitation 20 have been used for cu ii removal however only a few studies attempted to remove tcs and cu ii simultaneously via adsorption 21 phytoremediation 22 photocatalysis 23 flocculation 24 and compositing redox with adsorption 25 although these approaches have been verified to provide excellent capacity to simultaneously remove tcs and cu ii they still have some drawbacks such as long time consumption high energy input and a large amount of toxic solid waste generation which limit their practical applications moreover some approaches such as adsorption and flocculation cannot degrade tcs efficiently leading to the horizontal and vertical transfer of args and bringing potential risk to the ecosystem 26 thus there is still an increasing demand for the development of efficient and cost effective treatment technologies for the simultaneous removal of tcs and cu ii from aqueous solution over the past few decades potassium permanganate kmno4 has been widely selected to degrade organic pollutants in water treatment due to its high efficiency relatively low cost comparative stability and easy handling 27 28 the usepa has approved the adoption of kmno4 in drinking water treatment which serves as an oxidant before sedimentation and filtration to remove organic pollutants 29 previous studies have shown that the second order rate constant for the reaction between ttc and kmno4 is determined to be 11 7 m 1 s 1 30 in addition the reduction of kmno4 could produce insoluble manganese dioxide mno2 that facilitates oxidation coagulation and flocculation 28 29 moreover our previous study has demonstrated the feasibility of mno2 formed in situ for the efficient removal of heavy metals 31 therefore it is believed that kmno4 could be applied to control the combined pollution of tcs and cu ii in aqueous solution unfortunately to date scarce information is available on the simultaneous removal of tcs and cu ii by kmno4 and such knowledge is essential for the practical implementation of kmno4 to control the combined pollution of tcs and cu ii in water in this study kmno4 was firstly proposed to simultaneously remove ttc and cu ii a series of operating parameters including initial concentrations of ttc and cu ii kmno4 dose solution ph temperature and water matrix were evaluated the transformation products of ttc were identified by a high performance liquid chromatography system with a mass spectrometer hplc ms the solid products were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd finally the mechanism of simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii by kmno4 was revealed by combination of controlled experiments and theoretical calculations 2 materials and methods 2 1

flask in the dark with 0 02 m nano3 as background electrolyte under magnetic stirring typically predetermined volumes of ttc and cu ii stock solutions were first added to the reactor afterward the experiments were triggered by adding an aliquot of the kmno4 stock solution into the reactor at desired concentrations the solution ph was adjusted to the desired value using 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh if necessary samples were withdrawn at specified time intervals filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters and immediately quenched with excess hydroxylamine before analysis all the experiments were

orbital calculations based on the density functional theory were performed using gaussian 16 program b3lyp 6 31g firstly geometry optimization was employed to obtain the molecular conformation with minimum energy then the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy e homo was determined for the copper atom the calculation was carried out at the lanl2dz basis set 3 results and discussion 3 1 simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii by kmno4 is shown in fig 1 ttc can be effectively removed by kmno4 with and without cu ii after 30 mins reaction the removal efficiency of ttc was achieved by 87 7 without cu ii in the presence of cu ii the enhanced removal of ttc was observed and the removal efficiency was about 92 8 in addition to removing ttc cu ii can be also removed in the presence of ttc and the removal efficiency was as high as 78 5 after 30 mins reaction however no significant removal of cu ii was observed in the absence of ttc indicating that cu ii cannot be oxidized by kmno4 directly the oxidation reduction potential of kmno4 is 1 70 v under acidic conditions 33 while the theoretical oxidation reduction potential of cu iii cu ii is 2 3 v 34 denoting that the oxidation of cu ii by kmno4 is thermodynamically unfavorable overall these results indicated that ttc and cu ii can be simultaneously removed with appreciably high efficiencies by kmno4 treatment it has been reported that ttc can be removed by kmno4 oxidation with a second order rate constant of 11 7 m 1 s 1 and kmno4 can be reduced to mno2 solids at ph ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 30 previous studies have also shown that tcs can be removed by mno2 adsorption and oxidation 35 36 however the pseudo second order rate constant of tcs by mno2 oxidation is relatively lower than 0 01 m 1 s 1 35 therefore the removal of ttc by mno2 oxidation might be negligible in our study to distinguish the removal of ttc by kmno4 oxidation from mno2 adsorption other experiments were conducted and experimental conditions were set same as described above except for sampling where samples were withdrawn and immediately quenched with excess hydroxylamine and filtered through 0 22 μm filters preliminary experiments demonstrated that mno2 formed in the kmno4 oxidation process can be reduced to dissolved manganese ions by hydroxylamine consequently the removal of ttc was mainly attributed to kmno4 oxidation in this experimental procedure then the removal of ttc by mno2 adsorption was obtained total ttc removal minus the removal of ttc by kmno4 oxidation as shown in fig 2 a small amount of ttc can be removed by mno2 adsorption in the absence of cu ii the removal efficiency was 7 6 at 1 min and gradually decreased to 4 4 at 30 mins the decreasing removal of ttc by mno2 adsorption probably resulted from the fact that the adsorbed ttc was further oxidized by kmno4 interestingly cu ii significantly promoted ttc removal by mno2 adsorption the removal efficiency of ttc was 35 6 at 1 min however ttc removal by kmno4 oxidation seemed to be slightly inhibited by cu ii the degradation rate constant k min 1 obtained from the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s2 was 0 062 and 0 055 min 1 in single and binary systems respectively showing that the oxidation rate of ttc was reduced by 11 3 in the presence of cu ii these results clearly showed that the enhanced removal of ttc in the presence of cu ii was mainly due to increased ttc adsorption ttc has multiple electron donor functional groups including acetamides phenolic β diketone moieties and dimethyl ammonium groups which are capable of complexing with cu ii to form strong ttc cu complexes 10 the ph dependent speciation of ttc in the presence of cu ii is shown in fig 3 at ph 6 0 the predominant complex species were cuhttc and cuttc as cu ii can be removed from the combined pollution during kmno4 treatment fig 1 the removal of cu ii might be accompanied by the removal of ttc previous studies have verified that cu ii could enhance ttc adsorption on various adsorbents by forming ternary surface complexes involving cu ii adsorption 21 37 38 therefore adsorptive removal of ttc could be enhanced through the removal of cu ii which acted as a bridge between mno2 particles and ttc in this study 3 2 effect of parameters on simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii pollutant removal from aqueous solution by various techniques is highly dependent on various operating parameters 6 39 in this study the effects of initial concentrations of ttc and cu ii kmno4 dose solution ph temperature and water matrix were investigated systematically fig 4 3 2 1 effect of initial cu ii concentration as shown in fig 4a the removal of ttc increased with the concentration of cu ii from 3 to 20 μm after 1 min reaction more than 90 of ttc was removed in the examined reaction time 30 mins however when the cu ii concentration was further increased from 20 to 30 μm the removal of ttc slightly decreased probably due to the inhibition effect of cu ii on the oxidation of ttc as shown in fig 2 moreover cu ii could be removed by mno2 adsorption which might compete with ttc for the adsorption sites on mno2 surface leading to a decrease in ttc removal on the other hand the removal of cu ii gradually increased with time the removal efficiency of cu ii was achieved by 90 3 with 30 mins at an initial cu ii concentration of 3 μm however the removal of cu ii decreased significantly with the increase of initial cu ii concentration this could be attributed to the fact that more active sites are required for higher concentrations of cu ii to achieve the same removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of initial ttc concentration as shown in fig 4b the removal behavior of ttc at lower initial ttc concentrations was similar due to the high ratio of kmno4 ttc the removal efficiency of ttc was 93 9 and 92 8 after 30 mins reaction with initial ttc concentrations of 5 and 10 μm respectively however as the initial concentration of ttc increased from 20 to 40 μm the removal of ttc decreased this could be ascribed to the reason that existent kmno4 is not enough for ttc to get removed fig 4b also shows the removal of cu ii as a function of initial ttc concentration it can be observed that the removal efficiency of cu ii increased from 62 0 to 86 8 with the growth of initial ttc concentration from 5 to 20 μm as mno2 was the main solid product of kmno4 reduction a high concentration of ttc will form a large amount of mno2 which was beneficial for cu ii removal interestingly a significant decrease was observed as the initial ttc concentration increased from 20 to 40 μm this shows up as expected because of two possible reasons 1 more active sites on the mno2 surface will be covered by ttc and or its degradation intermediates leading to lower removal efficiency of cu ii 40 41 2 due to the complexation of cu ii with ttc and or its degradation intermediates the higher concentration of ttc led to the higher concentration of cu ii complexes with few positive charge and finally reduced the contact between cu ii and mno2 via electrostatic attraction 37 40 3 2 3 effect of kmno4 dose kmno4 dose dramatically influences the oxidation of organic pollutants and the formation of mno2 fig 4c illustrates the effect of kmno4 dose on simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii the removal of ttc notably increased with the increase of kmno4 dose due to much more oxidant addition after 30 mins reaction ttc was removed by 56 6 79 2 85 8 and 92 8 with the kmno4 doses of 10 20 30 and 50 μm respectively in addition the removal of cu ii also increased with the enhancement of kmno4 dose after 30 mins reaction cu ii was removed by 22 2 59 1 73 8 and 78 5 with the kmno4 doses of 10 20 30 and 50 μm respectively as shown in fig 4c a higher ttc removal could be obtained with a higher kmno4 dose consequently more mno2 particles could be formed which can further capture more cu ii 31 overall these results indicated that a higher kmno4 dose was beneficial for the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii 3 2 4 effect of initial solution ph solution ph plays an important role in ttc removal by kmno4 since ph variation could alter the species of ttc in aqueous solution and the oxidation reduction potential e 0 of kmno4 as shown in fig 4d the removal of ttc was highly dependent on the solution ph the removal efficiency of ttc increased with decreasing ph after 30 mins reaction the removal efficiencies of ttc were 75 6 at ph 9 0 and almost 100 at ph 4 0 the highest removal efficiency was obtained at ph 4 0 which might be attributed to the high oxidation reduction potential of kmno4 the half cell reactions of kmno4 under environmental conditions ph 3 5 12 are shown as follows 33 mno 4 3e 2h 2 o mno 2 4oh e 0 0 59 v neutral or alkaline conditions mno 4 3e 4h mno 2 2h 2 o e 0 1 70 v acidic conditions however the removal of ttc without cu ii by kmno4 increased with the increase of ph in a previous study which was considered to be due to the change of ttc species 30 ttc exists in three pk a of 3 3 7 7 and 9 7 42 therefore four species of cation h3ttc zwitterion h2ttc0 anion httc and dianion ttc2 are presented and their distribution curves as a function of ph are shown in fig s3 it can be seen that the species of ttc without cu ii have a more negative charge with the increasing ph however in the presence of cu ii ttc exists as cationic species at ph 6 0 and neutral species at ph 9 0 fig 3 this suggested that the different removal tendency of ttc by kmno4 as a function of ph with without cu ii might be ascribed to the variation of ttc species as shown in fig 4d the removal of cu ii increased as ph increased from 4 0 to 7 0 while the removal of cu ii decreased with ph further increased from 8 0 to 9 0 the highest cu ii removal efficiency obtained at ph 7 0 was 84 9 since mno2 formed via reduction of kmno4 and the phpzc point of zero charge of mno2 is most probably low 1 4 phpzc 4 5 43 the surface of mno2 carries a negative surface charge at ph greater than 4 5 which is beneficial for cu ii adsorption 44 however cu ii could exist as neutral species between ph 8 0 and ph 9 0 fig s4 which had a lower affinity to the negative charged mno2 surfaces than cu ii itself moreover the slow removal rate of ttc at higher ph led to fewer mno2 particles formation resulting in lower removal of cu ii to verify this proposal all solid products were collected using 0 22 μm membrane filters after 30 mins reaction as shown in fig s5 the amount of solid product seemed to decrease with increasing ph according to the color change of the solid which further confirmed that fewer mno2 particles have been formed at higher ph although more mno2 particles formed at lower ph the mno2 surface had fewer negative surface charge at such ph therefore the removal of cu ii at lower ph started to decrease but the exact effect of complexation on cu ii removal is still unclear with further studies as necessity 3 2 5 effect of temperature fig 4e shows the effect of temperature on the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii by kmno4 as the temperature increased from 5 to 30 c the removal efficiency of ttc increased remarkably from 72 1 to 97 0 indicating that higher temperature facilitated the removal of ttc this could be resulted from the enhancement of molecular collision to overcome the energy barrier at high temperatures 45 the removal of cu ii also increased with the increase of temperature from 5 to 30 c the possible reasons might be ascribed to 1 more mno2 could form at a higher temperature which provides more adsorption sites 2 adsorption of heavy metals by mno2 is usually an endothermic process which is favored at a higher temperature 44 46 47 3 2 6 effect of water matrix the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii in various water matrices is shown in fig 4f the characteristics of the water matrix are listed in table s1 as shown in fig 4f the removal efficiency of ttc was 92 8 87 2 and 79 5 with 30 mins reaction in deionized water tap water and river water respectively the low removal efficiency of ttc in river water might result from the higher solution ph and more organic matters nevertheless the removal efficiency of ttc still sustained higher than 79 in all water matrices demonstrating that kmno4 was an efficient oxidant for ttc removal in surface water the removal efficiency of cu ii in deionized water tap water and river water was 78 5 87 4 and 80 4 respectively the reason for the remaining high cu ii removal efficiency in tap water and river water was complicated due to the co existing organic matters and various ions for instance the removal of cu ii increased in the presence of humic acid but decreased in the presence of fe2 fig s6 whatever these results have provided evidence that kmno4 can be used for simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii in practical water treatment and the solid product formed from the reduction of kmno4 can be subsequently removed by sedimentation or filtration 3 3 mechanism of simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii 3 3 1 removal of ttc ttc can be removed by kmno4 oxidation and mno2 adsorption as described above in the presence of cu ii adsorptive removal of ttc was enhanced due to formation of ternary surface complexes however oxidative removal of ttc was inhibited with cu ii especially at ph 9 0 fig s7 at ph 9 0 the main species of ttc was httc without cu ii fig s3 after the addition of cu ii the predominant species of ttc was cuttc at ph 9 0 fig 3 previous studies have shown that ttc with a negative charge facilitated kmno4 oxidation due to the high electronic density in the ring system 48 49 therefore it can be speculated that the reaction rate of cuttc by kmno4 oxidation was relatively lower than that of httc to further validate the assumption molecular orbital calculations were carried out to obtain the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy e homo it has been reported that a higher e homo of an organic pollutant leads to easier degradation via electrophilic reaction 50 the chemical structure of cuttc was obtained from previous reports 51 52 as shown in table 1 the overlapping of the electron clouds in the homo of httc and cuttc were different suggesting that the reaction activities of httc and cuttc with kmno4 were probably different the calculated e homo of httc was found to be larger than that of cuttc which further confirmed that the complexation of ttc with cu ii inhibited ttc oxidation by kmno4 the removal of toc was also measured to determine the mineralization of ttc by kmno4 oxidation data not shown no significant elimination of toc was obtained indicating that ttc was mainly degraded into organic products then ttc degradation products were identified using hplc ms as shown in fig s8 four products m z 431 459 461 475 were primarily identified in the treatment sample the identified degradation products in our study were similar to the previous study which investigated the oxidation of ttc by kmno4 30 the product with m z 459 was considered to be formed from the oxidation of the phenolic group of ttc since the phenolic group could react with kmno4 via an electron transfer pathway to form a hydroxylation product 53 the hydroxylation at the phenolic group forming hydroquinone structure can undergo stepwise hydrogen abstraction to produce p459 on the other hand many studies have reported that kmno4 can react with alkenes via cycloaddition to form a transient intermediate which subsequently decomposes into a diol compound 54 therefore the hydroxylation process could also occur at the alkene moiety of p459 followed by rearrangement at the alkene position in the generation of p475 similarly the hydroxylation process could first occur at the alkene moiety of ttc to generate p461 and subsequent oxidation of the phenolic group to form p475 the product with m z 431 might come from the elimination of the methyl group from the n ch3 2 group in ttc due to the presence of mno2 36 according to the chemical structure of the intermediates and previous studies on ttc oxidation the possible transformation pathways of ttc by kmno4 are illustrated in fig 5 3 3 2 removal of cu ii xps analysis was carried out to characterize the surface composition and oxidation states of the mno2 formed in situ fig 6a shows the xps survey spectra of solids formed in ttc kmno4 and ttc cu ii kmno4 systems it can be observed that manganese mn oxygen o and carbon c elements were present in the solids formed in ttc kmno4 system the existence of the copper cu element in the solids formed in the ttc cu ii kmno4 system indicated that cu ii was captured by this solid product the detected carbon c element might come from ttc and or its degradation intermediates the mn 2p spectrum is shown in fig 6b two sharp peaks at binding energies of 653 9 and 642 2 ev corresponded to mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 respectively 55 the energy separation δe of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 was 11 7 ev this is in agreement with the observed value of mno2 in previous reports 55 56 indicating the formation of mno2 in both systems to further confirm the formation of mno2 the peak splitting of mn 3 s was also investigated as shown in fig 6b the observed δe was 4 70 and 4 80 ev for solids obtained in ttc kmno4 and ttc cu ii kmno4 systems respectively these values were close to 4 78 ev for the reference sample of mno2 57 58 indicating that the reduction of kmno4 was mno2 in cu 2p spectrum fig s9 the peaks at 954 4 and 934 5 ev corresponded to cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 respectively 59 the satellite peaks located at 944 5 and 940 7 ev were also observed suggesting that copper existed as the form of cu ii 60 the crystalline structures of mno2 obtained in ttc kmno4 and ttc cu ii kmno4 systems were measured using xrd as shown in fig s10 the absence of sharp peaks in both xrd patterns suggested that mno2 formed was amorphous no noticeable difference between the two xrd patterns was observed indicating that cu ii ions could not change the crystalline structure of mno2 in addition our previous studies have verified that the removal of heavy metals by mno2 formed in situ was mainly attributed to adsorption 31 based on the above results it seems reasonable to conclude that the removal of cu ii in this study is mainly attributed to adsorption by mno2 formed via the reduction of kmno4 4 conclusions in this study kmno4 was used to simultaneously remove ttc and cu ii from aqueous solution the results showed that ttc and cu ii can be effectively co removed by kmno4 from both deionized water and surface water the efficiency of simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii highly depended on initial concentrations of ttc and cu ii kmno4 dose solution ph and temperature the maximum removal efficiency of ttc and cu ii was achieved at ph 4 0 and ph 7 0 respectively mechanism analysis indicated that ttc complexation with cu ii inhibited ttc oxidation due to the lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy of ttc cu complexes hplc ms detection indicated that four transformation products stemming from hydroxylation and loss of methyl group of ttc were identified the solid products produced from the reduction of kmno4 were verified to be amorphous mno2 furthermore cu ii was mainly removed by mno2 adsorption this study reveals that kmno4 treatment is an effective technique for simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii which could provide in depth insights on the potential application of kmno4 for simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii from practical waterbody declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii by kmno4 is shown in fig 1 ttc can be effectively removed by kmno4 with and without cu ii after 30 mins reaction the removal efficiency of ttc was achieved by 87 7 without cu ii in the presence of cu ii the enhanced removal of ttc was observed and the removal efficiency was about 92 8 in addition to removing ttc cu ii can be also removed in the presence of ttc and the removal efficiency was as high as 78 5 after 30 mins reaction however no significant removal of cu ii was observed in the absence of ttc indicating that cu ii cannot be oxidized by kmno4 directly the oxidation reduction potential of kmno4 is 1 70 v under acidic conditions 33 while the theoretical oxidation reduction potential of cu iii cu ii is 2 3 v 34 denoting that the oxidation of cu ii by kmno4 is thermodynamically unfavorable overall these results indicated that ttc and cu ii can be simultaneously removed with appreciably high efficiencies by kmno4 treatment it has been reported that ttc can be removed by kmno4 oxidation with a second order rate constant of 11 7 m 1 s 1 and kmno4 can be reduced to mno2 solids at ph ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 30 previous studies have also shown that tcs can be removed by mno2 adsorption and oxidation 35 36 however the pseudo second order rate constant of tcs by mno2 oxidation is relatively lower than 0 01 m 1 s 1 35 therefore the removal of ttc by mno2 oxidation might be negligible in our study to distinguish the removal of ttc by kmno4 oxidation from mno2 adsorption other experiments were conducted and experimental conditions were set same as described above except for sampling where samples were withdrawn and immediately quenched with excess hydroxylamine and filtered through 0 22 μm filters preliminary experiments demonstrated that mno2 formed in the kmno4 oxidation process can be reduced to dissolved manganese ions by hydroxylamine consequently the removal of ttc was mainly attributed to kmno4 oxidation in this experimental procedure then the removal of ttc by mno2 adsorption was obtained total ttc removal minus the removal of ttc by kmno4 oxidation as shown in fig 2 a small amount of ttc can be removed by mno2 adsorption in the absence of cu ii the removal efficiency was 7 6 at 1 min and gradually decreased to 4 4 at 30 mins the decreasing removal of ttc by mno2 adsorption probably resulted from the fact that the adsorbed ttc was further oxidized by kmno4 interestingly cu ii significantly promoted ttc removal by mno2 adsorption the removal efficiency of ttc was 35 6 at 1 min however ttc removal by kmno4 oxidation seemed to be slightly inhibited by cu ii the degradation rate constant k min 1 obtained from the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s2 was 0 062 and 0 055 min 1 in single and binary systems respectively showing that the oxidation rate of ttc was reduced by 11 3 in the presence of cu ii these results clearly showed that the enhanced removal of ttc in the presence of cu ii was mainly due to increased ttc adsorption ttc has multiple electron donor functional groups including acetamides phenolic β diketone moieties and dimethyl ammonium groups which are capable of complexing with cu ii to form strong ttc cu complexes 10 the ph dependent speciation of ttc in the presence of cu ii is shown in fig 3 at ph 6 0 the predominant complex species were cuhttc and cuttc as cu ii can be removed from the combined pollution during kmno4 treatment fig 1 the removal of cu ii might be accompanied by the removal of ttc previous studies have verified that cu ii could enhance ttc adsorption on various adsorbents by forming ternary surface complexes involving cu ii adsorption 21 37 38 therefore adsorptive removal of ttc could be enhanced through the removal of cu ii which acted as a bridge between mno2 particles and ttc in this study 3 2 effect of parameters on simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii pollutant removal from aqueous solution by various techniques is highly dependent on various operating parameters 6 39 in this study the effects of initial concentrations of ttc and cu ii kmno4 dose solution ph temperature and water matrix were investigated systematically fig 4 3 2 1 effect of initial cu ii concentration as shown in fig 4a the removal of ttc increased with the concentration of cu ii from 3 to 20 μm after 1 min reaction more than 90 of ttc was removed in the examined reaction time 30 mins however when the cu ii concentration was further increased from 20 to 30 μm the removal of ttc slightly decreased probably due to the inhibition effect of cu ii on the oxidation of ttc as shown in fig 2 moreover cu ii could be removed by mno2 adsorption which might compete with ttc for the adsorption sites on mno2 surface leading to a decrease in ttc removal on the other hand the removal of cu ii gradually increased with time the removal efficiency of cu ii was achieved by 90 3 with 30 mins at an initial cu ii concentration of 3 μm however the removal of cu ii decreased significantly with the increase of initial cu ii concentration this could be attributed to the fact that more active sites are required for higher concentrations of cu ii to achieve the same removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of initial ttc concentration as shown in fig 4b the removal behavior of ttc at lower initial ttc concentrations was similar due to the high ratio of kmno4 ttc the removal efficiency of ttc was 93 9 and 92 8 after 30 mins reaction with initial ttc concentrations of 5 and 10 μm respectively however as the initial concentration of ttc increased from 20 to 40 μm the removal of ttc decreased this could be ascribed to the reason that existent kmno4 is not enough for ttc to get removed fig 4b also shows the removal of cu ii as a function of initial ttc concentration it can be observed that the removal efficiency of cu ii increased from 62 0 to 86 8 with the growth of initial ttc concentration from 5 to 20 μm as mno2 was the main solid product of kmno4 reduction a high concentration of ttc will form a large amount of mno2 which was beneficial for cu ii removal interestingly a significant decrease was observed as the initial ttc concentration increased from 20 to 40 μm this shows up as expected because of two possible reasons 1 more active sites on the mno2 surface will be covered by ttc and or its degradation intermediates leading to lower removal efficiency of cu ii 40 41 2 due to the complexation of cu ii with ttc and or its degradation intermediates the higher concentration of ttc led to the higher concentration of cu ii complexes with few positive charge and finally reduced the contact between cu ii and mno2 via electrostatic attraction 37 40 3 2 3 effect of kmno4 dose kmno4 dose dramatically influences the oxidation of organic pollutants and the formation of mno2 fig 4c illustrates the effect of kmno4 dose on simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii the removal of ttc notably increased with the increase of kmno4 dose due to much more oxidant addition after 30 mins reaction ttc was removed by 56 6 79 2 85 8 and 92 8 with the kmno4 doses of 10 20 30 and 50 μm respectively in addition the removal of cu ii also increased with the enhancement of kmno4 dose after 30 mins reaction cu ii was removed by 22 2 59 1 73 8 and 78 5 with the kmno4 doses of 10 20 30 and 50 μm respectively as shown in fig 4c a higher ttc removal could be obtained with a higher kmno4 dose consequently more mno2 particles could be formed which can further capture more cu ii 31 overall these results indicated that a higher kmno4 dose was beneficial for the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii 3 2 4 effect of initial solution ph solution ph plays an important role in ttc removal by kmno4 since ph variation could alter the species of ttc in aqueous solution and the oxidation reduction potential e 0 of kmno4 as shown in fig 4d the removal of ttc was highly dependent on the solution ph the removal efficiency of ttc increased with decreasing ph after 30 mins reaction the removal efficiencies of ttc were 75 6 at ph 9 0 and almost 100 at ph 4 0 the highest removal efficiency was obtained at ph 4 0 which might be attributed to the high oxidation reduction potential of kmno4 the half cell reactions of kmno4 under environmental conditions ph 3 5 12 are shown as follows 33 mno 4 3e 2h 2 o mno 2 4oh e 0 0 59 v neutral or alkaline conditions mno 4 3e 4h mno 2 2h 2 o e 0 1 70 v acidic conditions however the removal of ttc without cu ii by kmno4 increased with the increase of ph in a previous study which was considered to be due to the change of ttc species 30 ttc exists in three pk a of 3 3 7 7 and 9 7 42 therefore four species of cation h3ttc zwitterion h2ttc0 anion httc and dianion ttc2 are presented and their distribution curves as a function of ph are shown in fig s3 it can be seen that the species of ttc without cu ii have a more negative charge with the increasing ph however in the presence of cu ii ttc exists as cationic species at ph 6 0 and neutral species at ph 9 0 fig 3 this suggested that the different removal tendency of ttc by kmno4 as a function of ph with without cu ii might be ascribed to the variation of ttc species as shown in fig 4d the removal of cu ii increased as ph increased from 4 0 to 7 0 while the removal of cu ii decreased with ph further increased from 8 0 to 9 0 the highest cu ii removal efficiency obtained at ph 7 0 was 84 9 since mno2 formed via reduction of kmno4 and the phpzc point of zero charge of mno2 is most probably low 1 4 phpzc 4 5 43 the surface of mno2 carries a negative surface charge at ph greater than 4 5 which is beneficial for cu ii adsorption 44 however cu ii could exist as neutral species between ph 8 0 and ph 9 0 fig s4 which had a lower affinity to the negative charged mno2 surfaces than cu ii itself moreover the slow removal rate of ttc at higher ph led to fewer mno2 particles formation resulting in lower removal of cu ii to verify this proposal all solid products were collected using 0 22 μm membrane filters after 30 mins reaction as shown in fig s5 the amount of solid product seemed to decrease with increasing ph according to the color change of the solid which further confirmed that fewer mno2 particles have been formed at higher ph although more mno2 particles formed at lower ph the mno2 surface had fewer negative surface charge at such ph therefore the removal of cu ii at lower ph started to decrease but the exact effect of complexation on cu ii removal is still unclear with further studies as necessity 3 2 5 effect of temperature fig 4e shows the effect of temperature on the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii by kmno4 as the temperature increased from 5 to 30 c the removal efficiency of ttc increased remarkably from 72 1 to 97 0 indicating that higher temperature facilitated the removal of ttc this could be resulted from the enhancement of molecular collision to overcome the energy barrier at high temperatures 45 the removal of cu ii also increased with the increase of temperature from 5 to 30 c the possible reasons might be ascribed to 1 more mno2 could form at a higher temperature which provides more adsorption sites 2 adsorption of heavy metals by mno2 is usually an endothermic process which is favored at a higher temperature 44 46 47 3 2 6 effect of water matrix the simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii in various water matrices is shown in fig 4f the characteristics of the water matrix are listed in table s1 as shown in fig 4f the removal efficiency of ttc was 92 8 87 2 and 79 5 with 30 mins reaction in deionized water tap water and river water respectively the low removal efficiency of ttc in river water might result from the higher solution ph and more organic matters nevertheless the removal efficiency of ttc still sustained higher than 79 in all water matrices demonstrating that kmno4 was an efficient oxidant for ttc removal in surface water the removal efficiency of cu ii in deionized water tap water and river water was 78 5 87 4 and 80 4 respectively the reason for the remaining high cu ii removal efficiency in tap water and river water was complicated due to the co existing organic matters and various ions for instance the removal of cu ii increased in the presence of humic acid but decreased in the presence of fe2 fig s6 whatever these results have provided evidence that kmno4 can be used for simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii in practical water treatment and the solid product formed from the reduction of kmno4 can be subsequently removed by sedimentation or filtration 3 3 mechanism of simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii 3 3 1 removal of ttc ttc can be removed by kmno4 oxidation and mno2 adsorption as described above in the presence of cu ii adsorptive removal of ttc was enhanced due to formation of ternary surface complexes however oxidative removal of ttc was inhibited with cu ii especially at ph 9 0 fig s7 at ph 9 0 the main species of ttc was httc without cu ii fig s3 after the addition of cu ii the predominant species of ttc was cuttc at ph 9 0 fig 3 previous studies have shown that ttc with a negative charge facilitated kmno4 oxidation due to the high electronic density in the ring system 48 49 therefore it can be speculated that the reaction rate of cuttc by kmno4 oxidation was relatively lower than that of httc to further validate the assumption molecular orbital calculations were carried out to obtain the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy e homo it has been reported that a higher e homo of an organic pollutant leads to easier degradation via electrophilic reaction 50 the chemical structure of cuttc was obtained from previous reports 51 52 as shown in table 1 the overlapping of the electron clouds in the homo of httc and cuttc were different suggesting that the reaction activities of httc and cuttc with kmno4 were probably different the calculated e homo of httc was found to be larger than that of cuttc which further confirmed that the complexation of ttc with cu ii inhibited ttc oxidation by kmno4 the removal of toc was also measured to determine the mineralization of ttc by kmno4 oxidation data not shown no significant elimination of toc was obtained indicating that ttc was mainly degraded into organic products then ttc degradation products were identified using hplc ms as shown in fig s8 four products m z 431 459 461 475 were primarily identified in the treatment sample the identified degradation products in our study were similar to the previous study which investigated the oxidation of ttc by kmno4 30 the product with m z 459 was considered to be formed from the oxidation of the phenolic group of ttc since the phenolic group could react with kmno4 via an electron transfer pathway to form a hydroxylation product 53 the hydroxylation at the phenolic group forming hydroquinone structure can undergo stepwise hydrogen abstraction to produce p459 on the other hand many studies have reported that kmno4 can react with alkenes via cycloaddition to form a transient intermediate which subsequently decomposes into a diol compound 54 therefore the hydroxylation process could also occur at the alkene moiety of p459 followed by rearrangement at the alkene position in the generation of p475 similarly the hydroxylation process could first occur at the alkene moiety of ttc to generate p461 and subsequent oxidation of the phenolic group to form p475 the product with m z 431 might come from the elimination of the methyl group from the n ch3 2 group in ttc due to the presence of mno2 36 according to the chemical structure of the intermediates and previous studies on ttc oxidation the possible transformation pathways of ttc by kmno4 are illustrated in fig 5 3 3 2 removal of cu ii xps analysis was carried out to characterize the surface composition and oxidation states of the mno2 formed in situ fig 6a shows the xps survey spectra of solids formed in ttc kmno4 and ttc cu ii kmno4 systems it can be observed that manganese mn oxygen o and carbon c elements were present in the solids formed in ttc kmno4 system the existence of the copper cu element in the solids formed in the ttc cu ii kmno4 system indicated that cu ii was captured by this solid product the detected carbon c element might come from ttc and or its degradation intermediates the mn 2p spectrum is shown in fig 6b two sharp peaks at binding energies of 653 9 and 642 2 ev corresponded to mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 respectively 55 the energy separation δe of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 was 11 7 ev this is in agreement with the observed value of mno2 in previous reports 55 56 indicating the formation of mno2 in both systems to further confirm the formation of mno2 the peak splitting of mn 3 s was also investigated as shown in fig 6b the observed δe was 4 70 and 4 80 ev for solids obtained in ttc kmno4 and ttc cu ii kmno4 systems respectively these values were close to 4 78 ev for the reference sample of mno2 57 58 indicating that the reduction of kmno4 was mno2 in cu 2p spectrum fig s9 the peaks at 954 4 and 934 5 ev corresponded to cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 respectively 59 the satellite peaks located at 944 5 and 940 7 ev were also observed suggesting that copper existed as the form of cu ii 60 the crystalline structures of mno2 obtained in ttc kmno4 and ttc cu ii kmno4 systems were measured using xrd as shown in fig s10 the absence of sharp peaks in both xrd patterns suggested that mno2 formed was amorphous no noticeable difference between the two xrd patterns was observed indicating that cu ii ions could not change the crystalline structure of mno2 in addition our previous studies have verified that the removal of heavy metals by mno2 formed in situ was mainly attributed to adsorption 31 based on the above results it seems reasonable to conclude that the removal of cu ii in this study is mainly attributed to adsorption by mno2 formed via the reduction of kmno4 4 conclusions in this study kmno4 was used to simultaneously remove ttc and cu ii from aqueous solution the results showed that ttc and cu ii can be effectively co removed by kmno4 from both deionized water and surface water the efficiency of simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii highly depended on initial concentrations of ttc and cu ii kmno4 dose solution ph and temperature the maximum removal efficiency of ttc and cu ii was achieved at ph 4 0 and ph 7 0 respectively mechanism analysis indicated that ttc complexation with cu ii inhibited ttc oxidation due to the lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy of ttc cu complexes hplc ms detection indicated that four transformation products stemming from hydroxylation and loss of methyl group of ttc were identified the solid products produced from the reduction of kmno4 were verified to be amorphous mno2 furthermore cu ii was mainly removed by mno2 adsorption this study reveals that kmno4 treatment is an effective technique for simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii which could provide in depth insights on the potential application of kmno4 for simultaneous removal of ttc and cu ii from practical waterbody declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

modern society globalization and industrialization have heightened awareness of conserving freshwater 1 it has become increasingly difficult for people to meet their water needs because of a widening gap between the supply and demand due to a rise in environmental pollution 2 3 textile factories regularly discharge the dye contaminated wastewater including heavy metals industrial dyes and other contaminants that harm humans and aquatic animals causing ailments 4 5 few dyes are hazardous and cause ailments whereas others are not degrading biochemically the textile dye industry discharged wastes containing a variety of organic dyes including rhodamine b methylene blue congo red etc a thiazine pollutant called methylene blue mb is well known and very dangerous it has been made and used in many industries such as dyeing cotton wool and fabrics coloring paper and making hair dye 6 mb can harm the nervous system and eyes when consumed other symptoms include nausea diarrhea vomiting and breathing issues thus improved ways to eliminate the harmful pollutants from the water bodies are required 7 various methods for removing the toxic contaminants from the aqueous media have been known to solve this environmental issue the most common are adsorption photo oxidation ion exchange removal and photocatalytic degradation 8 11 among the various methods photocatalytic degradation is one of the most often described methods for removing the dyes due to its various advantages such as using solar light as a renewable resource simple operation complete removal and remineralizing of the remaining dye 7 presently photocatalysis is one of the most efficient strategies for wastewater treatment thus this process removes all pollutants from the contaminated water compared to the other methods the photocatalysis phenomenon in semiconductors produces the electron hole pairs by irradiating the semiconductor with light which is then utilized to carry out the oxidation and reduction reactions 12 tungstate 13 15 molybdate 16 and ferrite 17 18 nanostructured materials were recently reported as efficient photocatalysts in dye degradation reactions for environmental remediation nowadays iron based nanomaterials have received much technical consideration for electronic and environmental applications due to their high chemical stability biocompatibility and tunable optical characteristics 19 20 therefore much interest has been seen in the production of spinel nanoferrites based photocatalysts due to their short band gap 1 2 5 ev and applications in removing hazardous pollutants among the various spinel nanoferrites zinc magnesium zn mg nanoferrites have attracted the whole world due to their unique properties 21 in addition modification of multiple cations within the zinc magnesium matrix structure plays a vital role in tuning their physical and chemical characteristics there are different approaches for synthesizing the spinel ferrite based nanophotocatalysts but the sol gel auto combustion technique is the best method for the preparation of the superior nanoparticles with controlled morphology 22 23 numerous research groups have shown that metal cations doping has promising effects on the zn mg nanoferrite systems to degrade methylene blue mb pollutant in wastewater via photocatalytic means employing sunlight vasiljevic et al 2020 synthesize iron titanate oxide nanoparticles using a low cost straightforward modified sol gel approach the elevated degrading efficiency of fe2tio5 in a strongly alkaline solution may be owing to the higher concentration of hydroxyl ions 24 mansour et al 2020 synthesized samarium modified zn mg photocatalysts for the photodegradation of rhodamine b rhb dye an enhancement in the photocatalytic efficiency of rhb from 10 76 to 94 13 was observed with the increasing sm3 modification within the matrix of zinc magnesium crystal structure 25 mansour et al 2020 reported a series of la3 modified zn mg

stirred at 60 c after that a few drops of ammonia solution were used to bring the ph up to 7 and then ethylene glycol was added to the aqueous solution the water gets evaporated during the heating of solution at 90 c to form a wet gel after a while the gel started to burn itself this turned the sample into ash followed by grinding and annealing at 600 c for 5 h finally the annealed specimens were

performing a degradation process of methylene blue dye under sunlight 28 in the conical flask 50 ml of 20 mg l 1 methylene blue dye aqueous solution and an optimized amount of fabricated nanoferrites were added after that the reaction suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark under the ambient conditions to achieve equilibrium conditions before the irradiation treatment afterward the entire reaction setup was placed in the sunlight and the degrading process was allowed to occur while being constantly irradiated and stirred then 4 ml of the reaction mixture was pipetted out of the reaction mixture and put into the quartz cuvette for the uv visible spectroscopic examination after every 15 min interval the fluctuation in the distinctive peaks of methylene blue dye was seen for monitoring the photocatalytic reaction process using a uv visible spectrophotometer the impact of catalyst dosages was also examined by altering only one component at a time while maintaining all other factors constant 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural investigation the phase structure of the unmodified and copper modified zn mg nanoferrites is shown by xrd diffraction patterns as provided in fig 2 a the existence of characteristic peaks 220 311 222 400 422 511 and 440 in the observed xrd patterns indicate the formation of spinel cubic like crystal structure these indexed

were used to calculate the other structural characteristics table 1 35 38 1 2 a λ 2 sin θ h 2 k 2 l 2 1 3 d x 8 m n a 3 1 4 v cell a 3 1 5 l a a 3 4 1 6 l b a 2 4 where hkl are miller indices m is the molecular weight of the produced sample and n is avogadro s number the strongest intense peak 311 showed a minor but consistent change with the copper substitution as shown in fig 2 b a slight shift towards the higher angles from 35 30 to 35 31 has been observed for x 0 0 0 02 decreasing the lattice parameter a whereas a shift towards the lower angles from 35 31 to 35 25 has been observed for x 0 04 which is responsible for the lattice parameter increase table 1 further a slight change in peak position is observed from 35 25 to 35 32 for x 0 06 causing a decrease in the lattice parameter value 39 therefore the unit cell volume of the manufactured nanoferrites shows an anomalous phenomenon due to the anomalous behavior of the lattice parameter table 1 the x ray density dx depends on the prepared specimen s molecular weight therefore the rise in x ray density from 5 087 g cm3 to 5 148 g cm3 may be attributed to an increase in the total molecular weight of the manufactured specimens there is a direct correlation between hopping lengths at the tetrahedral site a site and octahedral site b site and the lattice parameter a in the crystal structure of fabricated nanoferrites an increasing and decreasing trend in hopping lengths at a site and b site was identified in the current analysis because of the abnormal behavior of a as shown in fig 3 b and table 1 3 2 morphological and elementary investigation the morphology study of zn0 7mg0 3 xcuxfe2o4 x 0 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 nanoferrites was carried out by fesem revealing the details regarding the grain size and shape of the produced nanoferrites the image j software was used to verify the nanoferrites grain size the fesem image with the grain size distribution of zmf1 and zmf2 specimens is provided in fig 4 the spherical dense and aggregated morphology with an average grain size of 31 nm and 39 nm was obtained for the zmf1 and zmf2 nanoferrites table 2 all these produced grains have well defined grain boundaries the agglomerated phenomena in this research work indicate the superior magnetic nature between the produced grains fig 4 shows the edx spectrum and atomic weight percentage of produced zmf1 and zmf2 nanoferrites each spectrum showed only zinc magnesium copper iron and oxygen concentrations indicating the synthesis of pure and modified nanoferrites fig 5 illustrates the elemental mapping and distribution of zn mg fe o and zn mg cu fe o for the zmf1 and zmf2 specimens the elemental mapping micrograph shows that all elements are equally distributed over the sample fig 6 a demonstrated the tem image along with particle size of zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 nanoferrite the particle size of the manufactured nanoferrites was determined from the tem micrograph using image j software the zmf1 specimen attains an average particle size of 40 nm with a cubic like structure the agglomeration phenomenon was also noticed between the cubic nanosized particles due to the strong magnetic interactions between the fabricated particles in addition the saed pattern of zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 nanoferrite is provided in fig 6 b which clearly indicates the bright diffraction rings connected to 220 311 400 422 and 511 peaks these bright diffraction rings and their sequence are exactly the same as those obtained using the xrd data also these bright fringes arise in the high level of crystallinity for the prepared magnetic nanoparticles 3 3 optical investigation the optical band gap eg is generally calculated using the following equation 1 7 αh ν k hν e g n where k denotes the proportionality constant h denotes planck s constant ν indicates photon frequency and n means the kind of electronic transition the n 1 2 value represents an indirect permitted transition the second power denotes that n 2 transitions are direct and allowed 40 the intercept of linear portions of plots on the energy axis estimates the average band gap values 41 fig 7 shows the tauc plots of synthesized nanoferrites the zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 is a mixed but unsubstituted sample with a band gap of 2 30 ev with the substitution of copper concentration within the undoped specimen the cu2 ions procedure does not produce a significant divergence the most notable change was found in the zmf2 specimen with a band gap of 2 18 ev the band gap values of the other substituted samples are 2 07 and 1 94 ev fig 7 the band gap values for undoped and doped mg zn nanoferrites have been reported in the literature 42 43 the observed band gap values of mg zn nanoferrites might be within 1 96 to 2 71 ev kumar et al synthesized the zinc doped magnesium nanoferrites and reported the band gap value ranges from 2 59 to 2 71 ev 42 in another research work somvanshi et al synthesized the magnesium doped zinc nanoferrites and reported band gap values ranging from 1 96 to 2 39 ev 43 fig 8 a shows ftir spectra of cu doped zn mg ferrite nanoparticles to determine the existence of stretching vibrations the presence of two prominent vibrational modes around 473 44 486 61 cm 1 and 617 48 619 12 cm 1 corresponds to forming a cation oxygen bond at the b site and fe o bond at the a site respectively which in turn confirmed the formation of cubic spinel nanoferrites 44 the octahedral mode is observed due to the m o stretching vibrational mode whereas the tetrahedral mode was observed due to the stretching vibration of the iron oxygen bond besides the standard vibrational modes a few other modes were also observed due to the free or absorbed water 45 46 raman spectroscopy is one of the most efficient techniques to know the synthesized material s microstructure crystallinity and order disorder states according to the group theory the five modes eg a1g and 3t2g correspond to the cubic spinel structure formation 47 48 fig 8 b shows the raman spectra for all the samples herein eg 292 298 cm 1 mode corresponds to the symmetric bending of m o cu o zn o mg o bonds at the b site the a1g 616 624 cm 1 669 680 cm 1 mode is due to the presence of symmetric stretching of the fe o bond at the a site whereas the three t2g 321 330 cm 1 421 437 cm 1 469 481 cm 1 modes are due to the stretching and bending vibrations of fe o bond 46 five modes were observed in all samples confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure the observed modes with the corresponding wavenumbers are presented in table 3 3 4 magnetic investigation the magnetic properties and the corresponding m h curves are shown in fig 9 a the magnetic parameters such as saturation magnetization ms coercivity hc rentivity mr aspect ratio mr ms anisotropy constant k1 and magnetic moment nb were calculated and shown in table 4 figure 9 b shows the variation of magnetic parameters ms hc k1 nb with dopant content the ms values were increased with an increase in cu2 ions doping this can be ascribed due to a spin disorder or spin canting effect inhibited by the presence of cu2 ions this behavior is also explained by super exchange interaction a predominant phenomenon in spinel nanoferrites in the grown nanoparticles cu2 ions occupy the position of the mg2 ions at the tetrahedral site and fe3 ions occupy the octahedral site since mg2 ions and zn2 ions are both non magnetic at the octahedral site the presence of cu2 ions at the octahedral site will bring a considerable imbalance in spin ordering resulting in spin canting this results in the super exchange interaction and non collinear nature of moments which contributes to the increase in ms value with the increase in doping 49 also it was observed that for x 0 04 zmf3 the ms value decreases significantly due to the presence of mg2 and cu2 ions simultaneously at both the octahedral and tetrahedral positions a complete saturation was not achieved which is the expected behavior of spinel structured nanoparticles 50 the value of hc shows an anomalous behavior in the range of 9 88 15 45 oe with the increasing copper content table 4 the aspect ratio mr ms and anisotropy constant k1 were calculated using the following formulas and shown in table 4 51 52 1 8 ar m r m s 1 9 k 1 h c m s 0 96 the aspect ratio was observed well within the limit and indicated the ferromagnetic behavior in all the samples however the anisotropy constant first decreases and then increases for x 0 06 zmf4 due to the spin imbalance in crystals because of cu2 ions doping the magnetic moment was calculated using the formula listed below 53 2 0 n b m s m 5585 the observed behavior of magnetic moment in all samples is also due to the strengthening and weakening of a b a a and b b super exchange interactions as of disordered spin within the crystal structure 3 5 photocatalytic degradation investigation of methylene blue dye 3 5 1 photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic effectiveness of fabricated nanoferrites was examined in the sunlight with the help of selective decolorization of methylene blue dye as a model process methylene blue dye absorption peaks are in the visible region its decolorization can be easily detected using a uv visible spectrometer by observing a decrease in the absorbance value with time at a wavelength of 665 nm the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye is significant because it can cause major issues such as vomiting cyanosis nausea mental disorientation increased heart rate jaundice tissue necrosis and methemoglobinemia when consumed directly through the mouth 54 the quantity of catalyst used in photocatalytic degradation significantly influences the degradation of the organic pollutants 55 the optimal catalyst loading must be observed for effective organic pollutant removal to avoid using too much catalyst the amount of catalyst must be optimized to get the maximum photocatalytic efficiency to investigate the impact of catalyst concentration we have changed the dosages from 15 mg to 90 mg these studies used the same dosage of methylene blue dye i e 20 mg l 1 fig 10a depicts the influence of catalyst concentration on the degradation of 20 mg l 1 dye in the presence of natural sunlight the results showed that methylene blue dye percentage degradation and decolorization were lowest with 15 mg catalyst dose whereas it was maximum at 45 mg dose after 60 min this was because the turbidity of the solution resulted in less sunlight penetration as the catalyst amount rise 55 the degradation rate was reduced when the photocatalyst dose level exceeded 45 mg a higher catalyst loading induced a light scattering and screening effect which lowered the specific activity of the catalyst under such circumstances a portion of the catalyst surface is likely unavailable for photon absorption and dye adsorption which results in little stimulation to the photocatalytic process 56 therefore an appropriate quantity of catalyst is required to boost the degradation rate and avoid unnecessary waste in the present study the optimized amount is 45 mg as a result an optimal amount of catalysts must be introduced to assure complete photon absorption for effective photocatalytic degradation 3 5 2 photocatalytic kinetics for methylene blue degradation numerous studies indicate that the rate of dye degradation is best fitted using a pseudo first order kinetic model 2 1 ln c 0 c t k app t where kapp denotes the apparent rate constant c0 denotes the dye concentration before illumination and ct indicates the dye concentration at time t 28 a control mb solution was also maintained without the addition of catalyst and the results revealed a slight drop in the methylene blue dye concentration fig 10b the linearity of the graph ln c0 ct versus time indicates the pseudo first order kinetics model for the degradation of mb by the prepared nanoferrites fig 10c the rate constants estimated from the kinetics graph for the methylene blue dye degradation by the zmf1 zmf2 zmf3 and zmf4 nanophotocatalysts are 0 0158 0 0186 0 0215 and 0 0252 min 1 respectively fig 10d during the photocatalyst and dye solution exposure to sunlight the shifting of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band results in electron hole e h pairs on the photocatalyst surface 57 in most situations the electrons in the valence band instantly recombine and de excite with the holes however photo induced electron hole pair recombination is substantially slower in the doped ferrite systems 58 the charge carriers are made accessible to degrade the dye molecules in solution due to the efficient separation and delayed recombination of the electron hole pairs these electrons reduce the ambient oxygen to superoxide anion o2 simultaneously holes react with the water molecules to make the hydroxyl radicals 54 the reactive radical species degrade the dye molecules into mineral acids carbon dioxide and water molecules fig 11 3 5 3 reusability and comparison study the catalyst s recyclability is crucial for the practical use of nanoferrites 59 the recyclability test was carried out using the prepared nanoferrites and the results are shown in fig 12 the prepared nanoferrites were separated using an external magnet and the recovered nanoferrites were employed for the subsequent photocatalytic tests after being washed multiple times with ethanol and distilled water 60 the results indicated a slight decline in prepared nanoferrites catalytic activity up to five catalytic cycles the present research study has recognized the usefulness of prepared nanoferrites as a catalyst for long term industrial applications the present research generates excellent results compared to the already reported degradation findings the comparative study of the photocatalytic degradation performance of several catalysts in past and current investigations is provided in table 5 3 5 4 mineralization pathways of methylene blue dye the breakdown products of methylene blue dye and their structures were studied from lcms analysis using the reported literature therefore a possible mechanism for the methylene blue dye has been proposed based on the reported literature examining a few of these intermediate masses and anticipating their structure based on the cleavage of the methyl groups substituent on the amine groups leads to the intermediate products with masses consistent with the eluted intermediates according to the literature 61 62 azure a m z 256 azure b m z 270 azure c m z 242 and thionin m z 228 are some of the produced intermediate compounds 63 64 based on these by products the possible dye degradation mechanism has been depicted in fig 13 4 conclusion in the present investigation a series of unsubstituted and copper substituted zinc magnesium nanoferrites with a chemical formula zn0 7mg0 3

structure using the debye scherrer formula the predicted crystallite size t was 13 25 nm fesem analysis reveals the aggregated and spherical nanoparticles with distinct grain boundaries the edx spectrum displays the zn mg cu fe and o peaks confirming the synthesis of pure and doped magnetic nanoparticles the magnetization ms indicates anomalous phenomena within the 4 44 12 92 emu g with the increasing cu2 content whereas coercivity hc indicates a declining trend up to x 0 04 and then again starts increasing for x 0 06 the effectiveness of photocatalytic degradation was increased by adding copper ions at the lattice sites of mg2 ions the zmf4 photocatalyst has the highest photocatalytic efficiency of 90 for eliminating the methylene blue pollutant the nanophotocatalyst is a

modern society globalization and industrialization have heightened awareness of conserving freshwater 1 it has become increasingly difficult for people to meet their water needs because of a widening gap between the supply and demand due to a rise in environmental pollution 2 3 textile factories regularly discharge the dye contaminated wastewater including heavy metals industrial dyes and other contaminants that harm humans and aquatic animals causing ailments 4 5 few dyes are hazardous and cause ailments whereas others are not degrading biochemically the textile dye industry discharged wastes containing a variety of organic dyes including rhodamine b methylene blue congo red etc a thiazine pollutant called methylene blue mb is well known and very dangerous it has been made and used in many industries such as dyeing cotton wool and fabrics coloring paper and making hair dye 6 mb can harm the nervous system and eyes when consumed other symptoms include nausea diarrhea vomiting and breathing issues thus improved ways to eliminate the harmful pollutants from the water bodies are required 7 various methods for removing the toxic contaminants from the aqueous media have been known to solve this environmental issue the most common are adsorption photo oxidation ion exchange removal and photocatalytic degradation 8 11 among the various methods photocatalytic degradation is one of the most often described methods for removing the dyes due to its various advantages such as using solar light as a renewable resource simple operation complete removal and remineralizing of the remaining dye 7 presently photocatalysis is one of the most efficient strategies for wastewater treatment thus this process removes all pollutants from the contaminated water compared to the other methods the photocatalysis phenomenon in semiconductors produces the electron hole pairs by irradiating the semiconductor with light which is then utilized to carry out the oxidation and reduction reactions 12 tungstate 13 15 molybdate 16 and ferrite 17 18 nanostructured materials were recently reported as efficient photocatalysts in dye degradation reactions for environmental remediation nowadays iron based nanomaterials have received much technical consideration for electronic and environmental applications due to their high chemical stability biocompatibility and tunable optical characteristics 19 20 therefore much interest has been seen in the production of spinel nanoferrites based photocatalysts due to their short band gap 1 2 5 ev and applications in removing hazardous pollutants among the various spinel nanoferrites zinc magnesium zn mg nanoferrites have attracted the whole world due to their unique properties 21 in addition modification of multiple cations within the zinc magnesium matrix structure plays a vital role in tuning their physical and chemical characteristics there are different approaches for synthesizing the spinel ferrite based nanophotocatalysts but the sol gel auto combustion technique is the best method for the preparation of the superior nanoparticles with controlled morphology 22 23 numerous research groups have shown that metal cations doping has promising effects on the zn mg nanoferrite systems to degrade methylene blue mb pollutant in wastewater via photocatalytic means employing sunlight vasiljevic et al 2020 synthesize iron titanate oxide nanoparticles using a low cost straightforward modified sol gel approach the elevated degrading efficiency of fe2tio5 in a strongly alkaline solution may be owing to the higher concentration of hydroxyl ions 24 mansour et al 2020 synthesized samarium modified zn mg photocatalysts for the photodegradation of rhodamine b rhb dye an enhancement in the photocatalytic efficiency of rhb from 10 76 to 94 13 was observed with the increasing sm3 modification within the matrix of zinc magnesium crystal structure 25 mansour et al 2020 reported a series of la3 modified zn mg crossbred photocatalysts having a chemical formula zn0 8mg0 2laxfe2 xo4 0 x 0 5 step 0 1 these nanophotocatalysts were produced by an auto combustion approach to degrade the rhb dye and therefore the zn0 8mg0 2la0 5fe1 5o4 x 0 5 nanophotocatalyst attained the maximum photodegradation efficiency of 84 43 26 dhiman et al 2021 reported the fabrication of nano photocatalysts of mg0 5 xcuxzn0 5fe2o4 x

degradation and 78 2 total organic carbon elimination increased apparent absorption and lower recombination due to the copper doping and metal redox cycles increase the elimination of carbamazepine cbz 27 the substitution of copper ions at the lattice sites of mg2 ions may lead to enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency of organic textile dyes therefore in the current study we have

nitrate copper nitrate ferric nitrate and citric acid were used as starting reagents to make nanoferrites they were of the analytical grade and were obtained from the loba company also the methylene blue pollutant was used and bought from the sigma aldrich company in india the stoichiometric amounts of all the metal nitrates and citric acid were taken in 60 ml of de ionized water separately to form an aqueous solution of both the precursors these aqueous solutions were stirred at room temperature until they became clear the nitrates aqueous solution was added to the citric acid solution and stirred at 60 c after that a few drops of ammonia solution were used to bring the ph up to 7 and then ethylene glycol was added to the aqueous solution the water gets evaporated during the heating of solution at 90 c to form a wet gel after a while the gel started to burn itself this turned the sample into ash followed by grinding and annealing at 600 c for 5 h finally the annealed specimens were subjected to microstructural optical and magnetic characteristics and photocatalytic activity the unsubstituted specimen zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 was named as zmf1 whereas the copper substituted zn mg

perkin elmer were used to report the optical properties of the fabricated nanomaterial the magnetic properties of produced nanoferrites at room temperature were studied using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm 2 3 procedure for the photocatalytic dye degradation of methylene blue mb dye the photocatalytic effectiveness of the unmodified and copper modified zn mg nanoferrites was proven by performing a degradation process of methylene blue dye under sunlight 28 in the conical flask 50 ml of 20 mg l 1 methylene blue dye aqueous solution and an optimized amount of fabricated nanoferrites were added after that the reaction suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark under the ambient conditions to achieve equilibrium conditions before the irradiation treatment afterward the entire reaction setup was placed in the sunlight and the degrading process was allowed to occur while being constantly irradiated and stirred then 4 ml of the reaction mixture was pipetted out of the reaction mixture and put into the quartz cuvette for the uv visible spectroscopic examination after every 15 min interval the fluctuation in the distinctive peaks of methylene blue dye was seen for monitoring the photocatalytic reaction process using a uv visible spectrophotometer the impact of catalyst dosages was also examined by altering only one component at a time while maintaining all other factors constant 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural investigation the phase structure of the unmodified and copper modified zn mg nanoferrites is shown by xrd diffraction patterns as provided in fig 2 a the existence of characteristic peaks 220 311 222 400 422 511 and 440 in the observed xrd patterns indicate the formation of spinel cubic like crystal structure these indexed characteristic peaks fully match the icdd card no 01 078 5430 for the zn mg nanoferrites 26 no extra phases were observed in xrd patterns which reveals the complete dissolution of copper ions in the spinel structure of the zn mg matrix nano crystallinity was visible in all produced samples as shown by the sharpness and broadening of the xrd peaks the crystallite size t of produced nanoferrites was determined from the 311 peak using the debye scherrer formula as listed below 22 29 33 1 1 t kλ βcosθ here k is a shape parameter equal to 0 89 λ shows x ray wavelength β represents full width at half maximum and θ shows diffracted bragg s angle the crystallite size shows anomalous phenomena on substituting cu ions within the structure of zn mg nanoferrites owing to the displacement of smaller ionic radii fe3 0 645 å by the larger ionic radii cu2 0 73 å ions table 1 34 the current work found smaller nanoparticles in the range of 13 25 nm the crystallite size achieved in this work is significantly less as reported by mansour et al 25 fig 3 a shows the variation of crystallite size t lattice parameter a and x ray density dx as a function of sample composition the following formulas were used to calculate the other structural characteristics table 1 35 38 1 2 a λ 2 sin θ h 2 k 2 l 2 1 3 d x 8 m n a 3 1 4 v cell a 3 1 5 l a a 3 4 1 6 l b a 2 4 where hkl are miller indices m is the molecular weight of the produced sample and n is avogadro s number the strongest intense peak 311 showed a minor but consistent change with the copper substitution as shown in fig 2 b a slight shift towards the higher angles from 35 30 to 35 31 has been observed for x 0 0 0 02 decreasing the lattice parameter a whereas a shift towards the lower angles from 35 31 to 35 25 has been observed for x 0 04 which is responsible for the lattice parameter increase table 1 further a slight change in peak position is observed from 35 25 to 35 32 for x 0 06 causing a decrease in the lattice parameter value 39 therefore the unit cell volume of the manufactured nanoferrites shows an anomalous phenomenon due to the anomalous behavior of the lattice parameter table 1 the x ray density dx depends on the prepared specimen s molecular weight therefore the rise in x ray density from 5 087 g cm3 to 5 148 g cm3 may be attributed to an increase in the total molecular weight of the manufactured specimens there is a direct correlation between hopping lengths at the tetrahedral site a site and octahedral site b site and the lattice parameter a in the crystal structure of fabricated nanoferrites an increasing and decreasing trend in hopping lengths at a site and b site was identified in the current analysis because of the abnormal behavior of a as shown in fig 3 b and table 1 3 2 morphological and elementary investigation the morphology study of zn0 7mg0 3 xcuxfe2o4 x 0 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 nanoferrites was carried out by fesem revealing the details regarding the grain size and shape of the produced nanoferrites the image j software was used to verify the nanoferrites grain size the fesem image with the grain size distribution of zmf1 and zmf2 specimens is provided in fig 4 the spherical dense and aggregated morphology with an average grain size of 31 nm and 39 nm was obtained for the zmf1 and zmf2 nanoferrites table 2 all these produced grains have well defined grain boundaries the agglomerated phenomena in this research work indicate the superior magnetic nature between the produced grains fig 4 shows the edx spectrum and atomic weight percentage of produced zmf1 and zmf2 nanoferrites each spectrum showed only zinc magnesium copper iron and oxygen concentrations indicating the synthesis of pure and modified nanoferrites fig 5 illustrates the elemental mapping and distribution of zn mg fe o and zn mg cu fe o for the zmf1 and zmf2 specimens the elemental mapping micrograph shows that all elements are equally distributed over the sample fig 6 a demonstrated the tem image along with particle size of zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 nanoferrite the particle size of the manufactured nanoferrites was determined from the tem micrograph using image j software the zmf1 specimen attains an average particle size of 40 nm with a cubic like structure the agglomeration phenomenon was also noticed between the cubic nanosized particles due to the strong magnetic interactions between the fabricated particles in addition the saed pattern of zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 nanoferrite is provided in fig 6 b which clearly indicates the bright diffraction rings connected to 220 311 400 422 and 511 peaks these bright diffraction rings and their sequence are exactly the same as those obtained using the xrd data also these bright fringes arise in the high level of crystallinity for the prepared magnetic nanoparticles 3 3 optical investigation the optical band gap eg is generally calculated using the following equation 1 7 αh ν k hν e g n where k denotes the proportionality constant h denotes planck s constant ν indicates photon frequency and n means the kind of electronic transition the n 1 2 value represents an indirect permitted transition the second power denotes that n 2 transitions are direct and allowed 40 the intercept of linear portions of plots on the energy axis estimates the average band gap values 41 fig 7 shows the tauc plots of synthesized nanoferrites the zn0 7mg0 3fe2o4 x 0 0 is a mixed but unsubstituted sample with a band gap of 2 30 ev with the substitution of copper concentration within the undoped specimen the cu2 ions

1 94 ev fig 7 the band gap values for undoped and doped mg zn nanoferrites have been reported in the literature 42 43 the observed band gap values of mg zn nanoferrites might be within 1 96 to 2 71 ev kumar et al synthesized the zinc doped magnesium nanoferrites and reported the band gap value ranges from 2 59 to 2 71 ev 42 in another research work somvanshi et al synthesized the magnesium doped zinc nanoferrites and reported band gap values ranging from 1 96 to 2 39 ev 43 fig 8 a shows ftir spectra of cu doped zn mg ferrite nanoparticles to determine the existence of stretching vibrations the presence of two prominent vibrational modes around 473 44 486 61 cm 1 and 617 48 619 12 cm 1 corresponds to forming a cation oxygen bond at the b site and fe o bond at the a site respectively which in turn confirmed the formation of cubic spinel nanoferrites 44 the octahedral mode is observed due to the m o stretching vibrational mode whereas the tetrahedral mode was observed due to the stretching vibration of the iron oxygen bond besides the standard vibrational modes a few other modes were also observed due to the free or absorbed water 45 46 raman spectroscopy is one of the most efficient techniques to know the synthesized material s microstructure crystallinity and order disorder states according to the group theory the five modes eg a1g and 3t2g correspond to the cubic spinel structure formation 47 48 fig 8 b shows the raman spectra for all the samples herein eg 292 298 cm 1 mode corresponds to the symmetric bending of m o cu o zn o mg o bonds at the b site the a1g 616 624 cm 1 669 680 cm 1 mode is due to the presence of symmetric stretching of the fe o bond at the a site whereas the three t2g 321 330 cm 1 421 437 cm 1 469 481 cm 1 modes are due to the stretching and bending vibrations of fe o bond 46 five modes were observed in all samples confirming the formation of cubic spinel structure the observed modes with the corresponding wavenumbers are presented in table 3 3 4 magnetic investigation the magnetic properties and the corresponding m h curves are shown in fig 9 a the magnetic parameters such as saturation magnetization ms coercivity hc rentivity mr aspect ratio mr ms anisotropy constant k1 and magnetic moment nb were calculated and shown in table 4 figure 9 b shows the variation of magnetic parameters ms hc k1 nb with dopant content the ms values were increased with an increase in cu2 ions doping this can be ascribed due to a spin disorder or spin canting effect inhibited by the presence of cu2 ions this behavior is also explained by super exchange interaction a predominant phenomenon in spinel nanoferrites in the grown nanoparticles cu2 ions occupy the position of the mg2 ions at the tetrahedral site and fe3 ions occupy the octahedral site since mg2 ions and zn2 ions are both non magnetic at the octahedral site the presence of cu2 ions at the octahedral site will bring a considerable imbalance in spin ordering resulting in spin canting this results in the super exchange interaction and non collinear nature of moments which contributes to the increase in ms value with the increase in doping 49 also it was observed that for x 0 04 zmf3 the ms value decreases significantly due to the presence of mg2 and cu2 ions simultaneously at both the octahedral and tetrahedral positions a complete saturation was not achieved which is the expected behavior of spinel structured nanoparticles 50 the value of hc shows an anomalous behavior in the range of 9 88 15 45 oe with the increasing copper content table 4 the aspect ratio mr ms and anisotropy constant k1 were calculated using the following formulas and shown in table 4 51 52 1 8 ar m r m s 1 9 k 1 h c m s 0 96 the aspect ratio was observed well within the limit and indicated the ferromagnetic behavior in all the samples however the anisotropy constant first decreases and then increases for x 0 06 zmf4 due to the spin imbalance in crystals because of cu2 ions doping the magnetic moment was calculated using the formula listed below 53 2 0 n b m s m 5585 the observed behavior of magnetic moment in all samples is also due to the strengthening and weakening of a b a a and b b super exchange interactions as of disordered spin within the crystal structure 3 5 photocatalytic degradation investigation of methylene blue dye 3 5 1 photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic effectiveness of fabricated nanoferrites was examined in the sunlight with the help of selective decolorization of methylene blue dye as a model process methylene blue dye absorption peaks are in the visible region its decolorization can be easily detected using a uv visible spectrometer by observing a decrease in the absorbance value with time at a wavelength of 665 nm the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye is significant because it can cause major issues such as vomiting cyanosis nausea mental disorientation increased heart rate jaundice tissue necrosis and methemoglobinemia when consumed directly through the mouth 54 the quantity of catalyst used in photocatalytic degradation significantly influences the degradation of the organic pollutants 55 the optimal catalyst loading must be observed for effective organic pollutant removal to avoid using too much catalyst the amount of catalyst must be optimized to get the maximum photocatalytic efficiency to investigate the impact of catalyst concentration we have changed the dosages from 15 mg to 90 mg these studies used the same dosage of methylene blue dye i e 20 mg l 1 fig 10a depicts the influence of catalyst concentration on the degradation of 20 mg l 1 dye in the presence of natural sunlight the results showed that methylene blue dye percentage degradation and decolorization were lowest with 15 mg catalyst dose whereas it was maximum at 45 mg dose after 60 min this was because the turbidity of the solution resulted in less sunlight penetration as the catalyst amount rise 55 the degradation rate was reduced when the photocatalyst dose level exceeded 45 mg a higher catalyst loading induced a light scattering and screening effect which lowered the specific activity of the catalyst under such circumstances a portion of the catalyst surface is likely unavailable for photon absorption and dye adsorption which results in little stimulation to the photocatalytic process 56 therefore an appropriate quantity of catalyst is required to boost the degradation rate and avoid unnecessary waste in the present study the optimized amount is 45 mg as a result an optimal amount of catalysts must be introduced to assure complete photon absorption for effective photocatalytic degradation 3 5 2 photocatalytic kinetics for methylene blue degradation numerous studies indicate that the rate of dye degradation is best fitted using a pseudo first order kinetic model 2 1 ln c 0 c t k app t where kapp denotes the apparent rate constant c0 denotes the dye concentration before illumination and ct indicates the dye concentration at time t 28 a control mb solution was also maintained without the addition of catalyst and the results revealed a slight drop in the methylene blue dye concentration fig 10b the linearity of the graph ln c0 ct versus time indicates the pseudo first order kinetics model for the degradation of mb by the prepared nanoferrites fig 10c the rate constants estimated from the kinetics graph for the methylene blue dye degradation by the zmf1 zmf2 zmf3 and zmf4 nanophotocatalysts are 0 0158 0 0186 0 0215 and 0 0252 min 1 respectively fig 10d during the photocatalyst and dye solution exposure to sunlight the shifting of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band results in electron hole e h pairs on the photocatalyst surface 57 in most situations the electrons in the valence band instantly recombine and de excite with the holes however photo induced electron hole pair recombination is substantially slower in the doped ferrite systems 58 the charge carriers are made accessible to degrade the dye molecules in solution due to the efficient separation and delayed recombination of the electron hole pairs these electrons reduce the ambient oxygen to superoxide anion o2 simultaneously holes react with the water molecules to make the hydroxyl radicals 54 the reactive radical species degrade the dye molecules into mineral acids carbon dioxide and water molecules fig 11 3 5 3 reusability and comparison study the catalyst s recyclability is crucial for the practical use of nanoferrites 59 the recyclability test was carried out using the prepared nanoferrites and the results are shown in fig 12 the prepared nanoferrites were separated using an external magnet and the recovered nanoferrites were employed for the subsequent photocatalytic tests after being washed multiple times with ethanol and distilled water 60 the results indicated a slight decline in prepared nanoferrites catalytic activity up to five catalytic cycles the present research study has recognized the usefulness of prepared nanoferrites as a catalyst for long term industrial applications the present research generates excellent results compared to the already reported degradation findings the comparative study of the photocatalytic degradation performance of several catalysts in past and current investigations is provided in table 5 3 5 4 mineralization pathways of methylene blue dye the breakdown products of methylene blue dye and their structures were studied from lcms analysis using the reported literature therefore a possible mechanism for the methylene blue dye has been proposed based on the reported literature examining a few of these intermediate masses and anticipating their structure based on the cleavage of the methyl groups substituent on the amine groups leads to the intermediate products with masses consistent with the eluted intermediates according to the literature 61 62 azure a m z 256 azure b m z 270 azure c m z 242 and thionin m z 228 are some of the produced intermediate compounds 63 64 based on these by products the possible dye degradation mechanism has been depicted in fig 13 4 conclusion in the present investigation a series of unsubstituted and copper substituted zinc magnesium nanoferrites with a chemical formula zn0 7mg0 3 xcuxfe2o4 x 0 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 were successfully synthesized by sol gel auto combustion technique according to xrd findings the undoped and copper doped zn mg nanoferrites have a cubic spinel structure using the debye scherrer formula the predicted crystallite size t was 13 25 nm fesem analysis reveals the aggregated and spherical nanoparticles with distinct grain boundaries the edx spectrum displays the zn mg cu fe and o peaks confirming the synthesis of pure and doped magnetic nanoparticles the magnetization ms indicates anomalous phenomena within the 4 44 12 92 emu g with the increasing cu2 content whereas coercivity hc indicates a declining trend up to x 0 04 and then again starts increasing for x 0 06 the effectiveness of photocatalytic degradation was increased by adding copper ions at the lattice sites of mg2 ions the zmf4 photocatalyst has the highest photocatalytic efficiency of 90 for eliminating the methylene blue pollutant the nanophotocatalyst is a

12897,the generation of wastewater is a universal practice in all spheres of life wastewater is generated from different stream sources including domestic industrial and commercial sources during the last years global volume of wastewater generated has witnessed a surge in developing countries after wastewater treatment sewage sludge is generated and is considered an asset rather than a by product this sludge is generally disposed of in landfills the practice of directing sewage sludge to landfills is not considered an optimal use of sludge as an asset however a comprehensive review of techniques for sewage sludge management is still inexistent in small island states as such this paper aims to conduct systematic literature reviewing of research papers published in the area of waste management to determine the transformation of sewage sludge in view of uncovering ideal global processes the findings out of the 111 scientific papers published from 1997 to 2021 were analysed on the sewage sludge management methods adopted in developing countries and the possibility of applying them in small island developing states the analysis indicates that the distribution of sewage sludge management techniques is inequitable and research on sewage sludge management in small island developing states is insufficient it is therefore crucial to evaluate the implications and challenges of the elements associative of sewage sludge in the establishment of a proper sewage sludge management plan for small island developing states keywords wastewater treatment sewage sludge management quantification characterisation and inventory analysis sludge management methods 1 introduction 1 1 overall global perspectives of wastewater generation wastewater is produced by various economic activities and is generally treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of its high pollution load 1 the volume of wastewater generated is witnessing a rise resulting from rapid urbanisation sewage network extensions new installations and upgrading of facilities 2 it is estimated globally that wastewater without appropriate treatment representing about 80 is discharged into the nature 3 these figures were predicted earlier from un wwap 4 though no time series data on the volume of wastewater generated globally was available a fluctuating increase was noted in the volume of wastewater generated in oecd countries from 2010 to 2019 graph 1 illustrates the volume of wastewater generated in the oecd countries 5 in view of the polluting characteristics of wastewater and the associated negative impacts on human beings and the environment it is imperative to treat the wastewater before it is released into the waterbodies 6 continuous increased discharges of inadequately treated wastewater further degrade groundwater untreated wastewater released into seas affects the aquatic bodies which subsequently affects aquatic organisms after the treatment procedures the water returns back to nature and waste in the solid state remains the resulting waste in the solid state at the wwtp is termed sludge 7 sewage sludge is the solid semisolid or slurry matter which is generated after the wastewater treatment operations this residual matter is usually categorized as primary and secondary sludge the chemical precipitation sedimentation and other primary processes result in the production of primary sludge whereas the biological treatments result in the generation of secondary sludge also known as activated sludge quite often the primary and secondary sludges are mixed together for further treatment and disposal 108 sewage sludge consists of particles of human faeces paper and bacteria and may be composed of considerable number of illness inducing agents parasites and intact chemicals the presence of these harmful components in the sewage sludge has a harmful impact on human health and the environment as a consequence of which the sewage sludge needs to be treated and managed 8 the annual production of sewage sludge in european union increased from some 5 5 million tonnes per year in 1992 to more than 9 0 9 5 million tons per year in 2017 whilst in china it increased to 39 0 million tons per year in 2019 110 in a developing country like china with a high population it was estimated that more than 36 million tons of sewage sludge with an 80 of moisture content were produced in 2019 9 and the complete treatment of sewage sludge in india would generate approximately 3955 thousand metric tonnes dry sewage sludge annually 10 therefore handling treatment and disposal of sludge becomes evidently a concerning issue in many developed countries across the globe several studies have provided peculiar attention to treatment of sludge in order to improve its quality and safe use whilst the management is not evident as they have their own nature characteristics and associated implications for developing countries and small island developing states 11 effective and efficient management of sludge thus remains among the most prominent and challenging matter throughout the world particularly in small island developing states like mauritius seychelles and singapore small island developing states sids are considered as those countries which face particular and enormous challenges in view of their geographical characteristics aloofness small population size small economic size small land area advanced influence to economic and environmental stresses and accelerated climate emergencies 12 challenges faced around the globe are having a dynamic effect on the economic conditions social upbringing and environmental situations of the small island states sids are especially more vulnerable to the climate change than developed countries and unfortunately being at ground level they are among the first countries suffering from the direct impact resulting from sea level rises and storms 5 due to their fragile ecosystem resource recovery is limited in sids and is considered vital for most sids as it blends with economic social and environmental challenges 5 it also helps reduce high dependence on imported products a considerable amount of sewage sludge is generated in sids though considered to be minimal as compared to the amount generated in developed countries there is a need to develop viable sewage sludge management strategies for sids however one of the barriers remains that no adequate research and lack of know how on the management of sludge exists for sids 11 the achievement of a sewage sludge management system not only rests on technical transformation but is also considerably guided by the elements contributing to sewage sludge management hence it is important for researchers to understand design and evaluate the fundamental elements focused on an effective and efficient sewage sludge management 2 as such this paper aims to conduct systematic literature reviewing of research papers published in the area of waste management to determine the underlying factors contributing in the development of proper sewage sludge management practices for small island states 2 bibliometric data analysis a preliminary literature review was conducted to provide a wide conceptualisation of the subject topic and the way to proceed with the review process this review was conducted on about 104 published articles full text research papers dated from 1997 to 2021 those published papers were indexed and searched on the international databases namely google scholar science direct scopus web of science using as keywords wastewater treatment sewage sludge management quantification and characterisation were used in the search of articles publicised 2 1 analysis of bibliometric information the phases of the process review are tabulated in the table 1 2 2 publishing trends the number of papers which were in conformity to sewage sludge management practices ranged from 1997 to 2021 as shown in fig 1 and a total of 111 publications were chosen from 1997 to 2009 the number of articles published which were consulted was 16 3 from 2010 to 2021 the number of published articles consulted was 83 7 this trend showed that from 2010 to 2021 there was an increased focus on sewage sludge management practices and during the past ten years many studies on sewage sludge management have gained an importance in this field the publication trend from fig 1 shows the trend in the number of articles with the highest number recorder in 2013 2017 2019 and 2020 an individual analysis was chosen to interpret the research documents there was no start date in the search query in order to retrieve all potential research papers focusing on management of sewage sludge various sewage sludge management strategies were also examined in different context but also observed that there were practically no articles on management of sewage sludge in small island developing states 2 3 assessment of the main elements in the research topics contributing to sewage sludge management studying the abstract of the papers published in the journals of the databases selected was the first step in the selection process papers which solely met the criteria of this paper were considered about 1500 articles were found during the search however only a few articles which could be associated to new technologies were considered then the keywords were narrowed down to treatment storage collection and transportation and the state of the art management techniques thereby bringing the number of publicised articles down to 104 for the purpose of this review nevertheless information from publicised documents such as unesco world bank unep were included in this review considering a preliminary literature review six main research topics were highlighted publications in the peer reviewed literature were used as a sample in order to i focus on the quantification characterisation and end use of sewage sludge ii enhance health and safety practices and underground water qualities iii demonstrate consequences of current practices and future challenges of sewage sludge management in small island developing states 3 literature analytics and findings the chosen articles that were in conformity with the outcome contributing to sewage sludge management practices are presented in this section there were different elements derived for the outcome which have been thoroughly discussed in this research in order to adopt proper sewage sludge management practices an overview of the elements have been analysed in depth which will enable to devise a proper sewage sludge management plan applicable for small island developing states a wastewater stream sources and sludge generation domestic sector with respect of the concentration and volume of domestic wastewater generated it represents the most important pollution resource domestic wastewater consists mainly of blackish wastewater generated from laundry and cleaning of dishes preparation of food and urine and faeces from the toilet 7 from treated wastewater solids or semisolid materials of sewage sludge are formed based on the development of urbanisation and industrialization in a developing country like china it has been observed that a significant sewage sludge quantity is produced 3 generally this sludge consists of a mixture of industrial sludge and may contain traces of heavy metals as a result of dyeing in industrial processes 13 the sewage sludge produced contains a percentage of moisture content 14 this sludge can be de watered to bring down the moisture content and can eventually be reused 15 industrial sector wastewater from industrial undertakings consists of used waters and manufacturing waste used sanitary tissue pads and water from cooling heating processes 16 it is also recognized for showing toxicity towards diverse aquatic creatures 17 large amount of sewage sludge is generated from industrial activities 18 matter of fact that it contains dangerously high level of pollutants comprising heavy metals its disposal is considered to be an issue of concern for the environment 19 the disposal of heavy metals is a serious environmental issue because of their non biodegradable properties and their likelihood to bioaccumulate 20 consequently sludge disposal is regarded as one of the most salient challenges in management of wastewater and sewage sludge 22 b domestic sludge as wastewater derivative sludge is generated after treatment and is considered as a by product 23 part of chemical oxygen demand cod removed is converted into biomass which result in biological sludge known as sewage sludge ghazy et al 112 defined sewage sludge as components generated at different phases of the treatment sewage sludge consists of constituents of high nutrient value heavy metals pollutants and small amount of calcium magnesium and sulphur 20 furthermore pathogens may also be present in the treated sewage sludge 21 due to its risks to human health and the environment and high treatment costs sludge is meant to be a matter of concern in several countries taking into consideration the evolution of urbanisation and industrialization in china sewage generation is meant to be enormous 24 dong et al 113 in their study stipulated that sewage sludge contains heavy metals some organic contaminants and pathogens incineration and sewage sludge applied in land are preferable options in eu 27 all member states one of the main difficulties encountered in the proper management of sludge is associated with the fact that domestic wastewater is mixed with a negligible amount of industrial waste whilst it is being channeled to the wastewater treatment stations thus the mixed sludge may contain heavy metals illness inducing agents and parasites which are environmentally harmful 26 sewage sludge also contains valuable resources such as phosphorus nitrogen and organic matter 27 in the absence of adequate treatment facilities considerable amount of sludge produced is largely sent for ultimate disposal at the landfill thereby increasing the pressure on the limited landfill space being given that the quantity generated is significant and disposal in landfill will continue to add pressure on the landfill space it is of utmost importance to quantify and characterize the sewage sludge consequently this necessitates development of a plan with necessary management aspects like financial implications transportation storage treatment which needs to be highlighted the focal point of this review seeks to raise conflicts concerned with the elements of a sewage sludge management plan for small island states and assess the benefits of sewage sludge as fertilizers in conditioning of soils in construction or in the generation of electricity c quantification and characterisation of sewage sludge the first step in formulating a sewage sludge management plan is to quantify and characterize the sewage sludge to be treated it is thus fundamental to determine the characteristics of sludge to be able to adopt the best selected options for the sewage sludge management practices 28 to be able to determine the sludge quantity involved in transportation as well as reuse or disposal it is of utmost importance to determine the concentration of dry solids in sludge 15 volume of sludge generated is approximately calculated taking into consideration the expected performance of thickening process of sludge and onsite dewatering the quantity of sewage sludge can be determined by measuring the tonnage of vehicle loaded 29 different organic and inorganic mixtures are contained in sewage sludge among the heavy metals zinc typically presents the highest contents in sewage sludge 30 copper lead chromium nickel manganese cobalt cadmium and arsenic may also be found in significant concentrations in sewage sludge mercury is usually present only at low concentrations usman et al 31 further mentioned that the level of treatment method of collection off site or onsite and amount and source of water flushed private and public toilet will reveal the characteristics of sludge nevertheless sludge contains primary nutrients for example phosphorus and nitrogen which can be used as fertilizer and can be changed for plants 28 since sewage can contain harmful waste material for example pharmaceuticals and heavy metals coming from different activities and industrial undertakings if adequately dry the sludge accumulated can be utilized for the recuperation of energy indirectly through gasification method anaerobic digestion and incineration 32 efficient operations of wastewater treatment plants produce vast quantities of sludge 33 the presence of secondary and tertiary treatment processes in the treatment of wastewater are the result of a rise in the quantity generated 6 the physico chemical characteristics of sewage sludge are tabulated in table 2 35 and it provides a broad outlook of the different elements which are usually present and tested in sewage sludge these elements will help in determining the different sludge disposal options to be adopted d treatment of sewage sludge sewage sludge treatment remains a crucial element in order to adopt a proper management plan 34 from a sustainable point of view resource recovery is considered to be very beneficial 40 in this context sludge treatment is highly recommended and it also applies to small island states to allow judicious use of this valuable by product in a cost effective way 37 several treatments are undertaken and these treatments as highly recommended by detr 2000 european commission 114 include thickening dewatering digestion thermal drying lime treatment and composting e storage mechanisms of sewage sludge at treatment plants once the sewage sludge treated it is usually kept aside in the open or in closed area for a certain period of time before transported to landfill or for other uses 39 normally the treated sewage sludge is kept aside for a time period between 1 week to 1 month before carting away or re use for other purposes 36 in small island developing states the storage space can be limited all depending on the amount generated f frequency of collection of sewage sludge generally sewage sludge is collected by transport companies to be carted away or re used 115 the quantity of sludge recuperated from a wastewater treatment plant will be changing and will depend on the sewage sludge facilities influenced by factors such as acceptability and encouraging management of sewage sludge 7 delay in the collection of the sludge particularly when it is stored in open sites can increase the water content after dewatering and increase the volume of sludge to be transported 42 in mauritius the sewage sludge is collected from the wastewater treatment station on a daily basis to be transported to the landfill for carting away g transportation of sludge another fundamental phase forming part in sewage sludge management plan in terms of cost and ecological impacts is transportation a sustainable transportation policy which considers carbon footprint issues odour noise and traffic impacts must be encouraged 29 in order to ensure that effluent emanating from wastewater treatment stations comply with accepted norms and standards one element which is crucial is the method used to remove wet sludge from the stations 43 the infrastructure for sewage sludge treatment at wastewater treatment stations have to be efficient with an adequate transportation policy so as to enhance removal of wet sludge from the site 44 h economic implications of sewage sludge plan due to the political and cost implications management systems of sewage sludge have not been set up integrally 116 this is mainly resulting from the number of stakeholders having multitude of cost interests in the sewage management system a sewage sludge system consists ordinarily of a group of stakeholders and transfer of money must be effected every time accountability is shifted from one stakeholder to another 36 operation and maintenance costs have to be taken into great consideration with dewatering and treatment of sludge stakeholders like end use industries use integral nutrients inherent properties of sewage sludge which have been treated end use industries are an emerging sector in the building block of sewage sludge process 48 sewage sludge end use should be taken into account when modelling the whole sewage sludge management system so that the best form of sewage sludge can be produced for final use 49 the agricultural and energy industries can be seen to be fundamental end use stakeholders taking into consideration the pressing need for local and cheap nutrients and sustainable source of energy 53 henceforth the cost benefits and environmental requirement of end use may help in improving management of sludge and determine models of the management systems 50 there is financial transfer for activities such as transport carting away and processing within a sewage sludge management system at specific frequency 2 to be able to achieve a cost effective business model selection of the types of transfer should be made in a judicious way discharge fee is a fee retained to allow discharge of sewage sludge at the landfill 49 the fee is charged ideally to ensure that responsibility is transferred to a stakeholder having technical abilities to process and convey sewage sludge to other liable stakeholders discharge incentive is a payment fee contrary to discharge fee and it helps wastewater treatment plants to meet their costs 28 costs of operation and maintenance o m of equipment in the wastewater treatment plants must be paid on a regular basis until the lifespan of the equipment has lapsed 9 sludge transport treatment and reuse provide a baseline for the overall cost estimates of the sewage sludge management plan 50 according to uisce irish water 29 the transportation to the landfill may cost approximately between 8 00 to 25 00 per tonne subject to the travel distance covered and the form of sewage sludge sludge transportation stands as a consequential magnitude of the costs associated with sewage sludge management 51 sludge dewatering has a comparatively higher cost of operation which is estimated to be between 10 to 15 million 52 the cost of sludge treatment and reuse may differ based on the sludge quantity generated and method of treatment used and is approximately 400 per tonne of dry solids generated 20 i environmental and occupational health problems associated with sewage sludge management according to shanthi et al 55 exposure to hazards associated with treatment processes at the wastewater treatment station cause specific health problems to the wastewater workers these hazards combine the physical chemical and biological hazards and they often result in occupational diseases 56 the health and safety executive hse 57 stipulates that different occupational activities expose workers to sewage every year several cases of workers suffering from one of the occupational illnesses have been recorded significant under reporting of cases could well exist because of inability to establish the relationship between illness and work 57 importance is given on utilization of sludge as auxiliary fuel supply in industries 60 this helps in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions utilization of raw materials and fossil fuels and the valorization of waste among others 28 nevertheless they were certain that sewage sludge can produce heavy metals and toxic gas dioxin people residing or working near the incinerator can experience an increase in health risks through inhalation when the toxic gas dioxin and heavy metals can make their way into soil and end up in the food chain 104 sludge applied on land may affect the health of humans via various routes of entry for example 10 soil through inhalation contaminated food items consumed skin contact with soil or volatile compounds ground and surface water via intake of animal and water consumed sewage sludge handled by employees and humans inhaling pollutants as well as particles several acute illnesses listed below have been recorded as a result of exposure to sewage sludge 57 i hepatitis characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice ii gastroenteritis associated with cramping stomach pains diarrhoea and vomiting iii dry cough and inflammation of the lungs i weil s disease ii infection of skin or eyes and iii attacks of breathlessness hung 59 in his study specified that there is practically no constituted evidence of the effects of sewage sludge on land use which remains a hurdle in the evaluation of effects since sewage contains various micro organisms the hazard cannot be easily eliminated however an appropriate risk assessment is important 57 one important way of mitigating the risks to the health of the sewage workers is to provide inocculation against tetanus and hepatitis a pre exposure prophylaxis immunization on a routine basis 61 exposure to hazards associated with sewage sludge can be reduced by drying the sludge before disposal using remote controlled robotic cameras for sewer inspection injection of sewage into land rather than spreading damming and bypass pumping of sewer sections prior to reconstruction and incineration of sludge 62 sludge dewatering can also be considered 63 the measures which follow can considerably minimize the risk of illness and infection 64 for example checking that line management and employees are well versed with the risks through proper training supervision and instruction catering for appropriate personal protective equipment choice of adequate equipment and an appropriate procedure for inspection and maintenance are of paramount importance ensuring that soap nailbrushes water and tissue papers are provided portable welfare facilities should be provided for distant locations j state of the art sewage sludge management techniques since some years back professionals in the field of wastewater unanimously agreed that universally sewage sludge is categorized as an origin of treasured resources instead of waste 2 environmental involvement and sustainability remain the leading factors behind this agreement increase in the cost of energy strict protocol for the disposal of sludge and outcry from general public and environmental departments 65 in a developing country like china a study conducted by domagoj nakić et al 30 revealed that it costs enormously to this country to treat its sewage sludge generated practically due to the absence of a proper disposal method the authorities in china are showing less interest in providing an appropriate sewage sludge disposal method in respect of the low budget allocated 66 restraint landfill space and obvious concerns with incineration evoke a high aspiration of considering sewage sludge as an environmental resource in the evolving sustainable society 15 according to relevant contextual information obtained for a small island state like mauritius it is clear that the sewage sludge management is not given proper attention by the fact that no experimental tests were carried out on the sewage sludge to determine its hazard potential before its disposal generally sewage sludge is sent to the sanitary landfill to be disposed of the choice of a sustainable method for the judicious management of sludge is a really difficult task for small island states 67 congruently tetteh et al 2 in their study pointed out that with an exhaustion of non renewable resources at a rapid pace because of increasing supply and demand downfall combined with a global rise in the cost of fuel climate change issues and public sensitization urge the association of scientists in using sewage sludge for recuperating renewable energy in small island states in small island states taking into account the agricultural oriented economy sewage sludge contains an essential source of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon elements and enhance soil quality 68 this process contributes enormously in fixing soil conditions to enable plant growth 69 k sewage sludge management hierarchy andreolis et al 70 stipulates that a sustainable means of disposal is required in this hierarchial system this will be applicable and will be fundamental in determining the means sewage sludge disposal in small island states and from this perspective the following should be taken into account production of sewage sludge cannot be eliminated completely with reinforcement of the effluent standards sewage sludge will keep on being generated and can witness a gain in the quantities produced with time accentuated by new wastewater treatment technologies and efficiencies recycling of the sewage sludge generated to its maximum land application of the treated dry sludge is accepted in developing countries like china in case the sludge quality does not allow its use in land application then incineration and landfilling as a last resort is considered but less applicable to small island states subject to its environmental vulnerability there is also a thriving interest in methods like thermal drying of the sludge sludge pelletization and other advanced processes that are geared towards enhancing the sludge quality such as production of compost 71 a sustainable means of disposal with minimum disposal costs and reduction in the amount of sludge carted away in landfill form part of managerial engagement for the safeguard of the environment 72 many countries have recognized the disposal of sewage sludge in landfill as being an unsustainable activity being given that it incurs enormous costs in transportation alone 73 recycling is regarded globally as a promising future trend because as an alternative it is considered to be cost effective and environment friendly in land application 70 i land application of biosolids the application of sewage sludge in land enhances soil texture recycles nutrients in the system and reduces or avoids the need for inorganic fertilizers 15 shaddel et al 117 are of the view that the authorities should ensure that the sewage sludge is free from heavy metals and pathogens before it is applied to the land the way and level of stabilization dictates the content of nitrogen 31 the intent is geared towards applying sewage sludge to the land and at the same time decreasing possible loopholes associated with its use 24 a significant quantity of phosphorus and nitrogen are found in sewage sludge 74 to produce fertilizers from sewage sludge a large amount of inorganic matter which include calcium compounds sulphuric acid magnesium potassium compounds or flyash is needed 75 this is needed to eliminate pathogens and form a hygienic product 43 the amount and accessibility of nutrients for development of plants is affected by the source and management 117 this method remains the dominating method of management in france the united states and united kingdom 76 despite that application of sewage sludge on land has been studied a lot with the resulting advancements in treating the sewage sludge yet in small island states it is still a matter of prejudice and resistance in accepting it as a waste management option because of its faecal origin however through the composting process the pathogen level can be eliminated to obtain a stable natural fertilizer 118 ii use as construction materials mageed et al 78 in a study laid emphasis that sewage sludge being re used in making of aggregates is considered to be a fundamental elucidation to problems associated with sludge management in japan 50 of sludge produced is used in the manufacture of construction materials 76 incineration of sludge producing ash is among those waste with content of quartz which is relatively elevated and there is a possibility for it to be integrated in the making of materials of construction 79 tay and show 80 in a study mentioned that the advantages associated with sludge ash which is used in making of construction materials entails cost reduction in treatment of sludge thus limiting conveyance of ashes to sanitary landfill moreover in view of development in the construction sector the increase in demand of construction materials has allowed determination of other methods for the manufacture of construction materials from ash of sewage sludge 81 takaoka et al 82 in a study pointed out that sludge may be used as a substitute to cement sewage sludge may be utilized as dried sludge powder dewatered sludge and incinerated ash 2 construction has witnessed a boom in small island states with the development of offshore business hotel development and property development associated with vested foreign investment the continuing reliance on imported cement and other reinforced construction materials will urge the economy to run in an unsustainable way 83 unfortunately no study has been conducted whereby small island states can look into the possibility of using sludge as a raw material to replace cement or mixed with cement iii gasification another effective means of converting sewage sludge in a useful resource is through gasification 84 nitrogen constituents are recuperated from the sludge during this process 85 as the sludge has been potentially dried this process can then prove to be very effective and it will generate significant quantity of nitrogen together with the fuel gas 86 in order to obtain the right energy characteristics sludge is blended with dry product namely wood or green waste during the previous years wastewater and sludge treatments have been considerably enhanced to comply with the new norms regarding the quality of effluents 87 treated sludge can generate a significant amount of energy and enhancing the process standard is meant to increase the demand in energy 40 this initiative represents an important challenge for small island states whereby it still represents an additional costs to import fossil fuels 119 a lot of emphasis should be laid on the use of renewable energy sources to reduce dependency on fuels thus reducing economic costs and emission of polluting gases iv wet air oxidation sludge is chemically oxidised during wet air oxidation at a temperature between 150 to 330o c and at an elevated pressure 89 the principal product of the wet air oxidation remains sludge with 3 inferior low molecular organic substances and an excessive of 95 of mineral components this process utilizes limited energy without use of fuel it improves de waterability mitigates emission of carbon dioxide and methane gases 66 however wet air oxidation involves investing enormous capital and cost of maintenance produces huge amount of ammonia 90 v pyrolysis when organic waste is thermally degraded to produce oil combustible gases and carbonaceous char in the absence of oxygen it is known as pyrolysis 91 gas obtained from waste can supply fuel for pyrolysis itself 92 oil products derived from this process are used to generate electricity 93 during pyrolysis sludge is heated under pressure between 350 and 500 c 2 pyrolysis is considered to be ecologically sound in contrast to incineration whereby unpolluted gas is released 94 vi biogas recovery around 30 of carbon dioxide 70 of methane and negligible quantity of hydrogen water vapour nitrogen and hydrogen sulphide are contained in biogas produced when sewage sludge undergo anaerobic digestion 76 for many years the utilization of anaerobic digestion to analyse agricultural wastes and sewage sludge has been greatly appraised in developing countries 95 roberts 96 mentioned in their study that under certain circumstances agricultural wastes or biodegradable sewage sludge are treated using anaerobic digestion it principal phase is heating and mixing the sewage sludge to produce biogas comprising carbon dioxide and methane remain the principal phase of anaerobic digestion 97 sludge with less than 38 organic content is inappropriate for anaerobic digestion 120 vii incineration hong et al 99 in a study emphasized that volume of sewage municipal sludge generated is reduced during incineration sewage sludge ash ssa is then produced and collected at the bottom of the furnace 9 ssa is classified as harmful as it contains particles of toxic nature 100 additionally a high proportion of organic compounds of hazardous nature furans dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also contained in the sewage sludge 121 viii landfilling owing to its low costs and expedient operation landfill is one of the preponderant methods for final disposal of sludge 122 however considering the possible environmental impact associated with disposal in landfills more and more countries have started drafting legislation in favour of controlling sludge landfill 103 when reuse options are available it is not advisable to consider landfilling as a viable option to dispose of the sewage sludge 91 land filling is less acceptable when there is a probable presence of elevated heavy metal content in the sewage sludge whereas there still exists the risk of groundwater contamination in the landfill site 106 unconventional utilization of sewage sludge is being favoured because of shortage of space in existing landfill site and also a concern in preservation of recuperable constituents of sewage sludge furthermore decrease in public acceptance and legislation in the global context are geared towards making landfill as a disposal option less accepted 112 the following table demonstrates the benefits pitfalls status and development of the different techniques of sewage sludge recovery 117 table 3 4 implications and challenges of associated elements of sewage sludge management for small island states after having demonstrated the research findings the possible outcomes are lengthily discussed in this section strengths and weaknesses this part also helps in shedding light on some key issues that will be required to be considered as enhancement for future works the impacts of quantification and characterisation have been thoroughly evaluated in this part the common sewage sludge disposal routes that have been proposed by the experts in the research findings were argued to be adaptive for small island developing states based on variable factors predominant in these small states also the health issues analysed demonstrates that common health problems might be a preoccupying issue and the need to establish a state of art technology englobing maintenance of the state of health of the workers exposed to sewage sludge arises nevertheless according to various analyses criticisms on the shortcomings that may prevent successful implementation of a sewage sludge management plan in small island states are noteworthy and ways to counteract these pitfalls have been positively elaborated ultimately the importance of the establishment of appropriate regulations policy measures to improve sewage sludge management have been highlighted in this section and selection of the best method appropriate for a small island like mauritius have been discussed a impact of volume of waste water generated quantification and characterisation of sewage sludge in sids the determination of the different characteristics of sewage sludge has allowed to make a proper analysis of the way the sludge can be managed taking the case of mauritius as a small island developing state the volume of wastewater generated sids is practically lower as compared to the volume generated in a developed and developing country taking into consideration the low volume generated the treatment and recovery technologies would be far more different research findings reveal that heavy metals are practically inexistent in domestic sludge in mauritius this explains the importance of exploring the possibilities of using sludge as a natural soil conditioner the only barrier which justifies the inadequate investigation of sludge used as natural fertilizer remains cultural perception and acceptability however through rigorous sensitization campaigns this impediment can be eliminated 105 b implications of treatment of sewage sludge in sids there is a need to ensure that there is no contamination of the food chain and in order to achieve it the pathogen level should be to the lowest standard as per accepted norms stabilization and composting can help to bring down the level of contaminants biogas produced from sludge on the other hand may be promoted in small island states in mauritius it is already a practice to produce biogas for the operation of a wastewater treatment plant only then it can be extended to a large scale to sustain the whole island s energy consumption the only barrier in this scenario is the maintenance of equipment involved in the operation due to frequent breakdown of the equipment this practice is discouraged particularly when it implies heavy costs of maintenance nevertheless with appropriate provision of funds which can be provided through institutional schemes and upgrading of equipment through technology financial implications should not be considered as a hurdle in the progress towards resource recovery another important way of promoting resource recovery of sewage sludge is by mixing its constituents with tar or cement for road construction and refurbishment thus minimizing the use of imported cement c implications of storage of sewage sludge in sids in the absence of adequate space for storage of sewage sludge and appropriate sewage sludge management plan for small island states it becomes difficult to manage the sludge in a sustainable way and can compromise with the environment and health and safety of the workers in the treatment stations in mauritius the only option presently considered for disposal of sewage sludge is landfill and to minimize the environmental burden and the health and safety issues the sewage sludge is collected and carted away on a daily basis to the landfill d implications of health and safety of disposal ofsewage sludge in sids in a small island state like mauritius in view of its characteristics it is well known for its environmental vulnerability the process of producing sewage sludge until its disposal that is carting away in landfill involves exposure to environmental and health and safety hazards at the initial point of production handling of sewage sludge by the workers can affect the health at work of workers involved in this process in various ways as mentioned above similarly at the collection points and during transportation workers safety and health are at risk if proper measures are not implemented moreover there are other physical hazards to which workers are usually exposed in the process for example slip and fall trapped in confined spaces like reactors and tanks present in the plant during maintenance noise problem associated with operation of noisy machines in the plant among others though no major health and safety issues have been locally reported the workers run a real risk of being affected by the process if appropriate measures are not observed and precautions taken the workers involved in the wastewater treatment and sewage sludge generation process in mauritius are inoculated against hepatitis and tetanus e implications of transportation of sewage sludge in sids a big gap exists in the transportation strategy adopted by a small island state like mauritius transportation of sewage sludge is carried out in developing countries like mauritius the transport of sewage sludge rests on a sub contractor who owns a low cost lorry and is involved in causing the transfer of sewage sludge to the landfill the subcontractor is remunerated by the main agency for the transfer on a daily basis which incurs an additional cost for the main agency this issue raised again leads to the financial implications faced by small island developing states in managing sewage sludge in the present circumstances with less costly transport vehicle to the transfer station or landfill 45 the unit cost of transportation per trip and per tonne of sewage sludge on a daily basis can cost around 10 per day for a small island state of mauritius 54 on average a total of about 18 t of sewage sludge are transported to the landfill on a daily basis and in a month the contractor engaged in the transportation of the sludge can claim up to a maximum of 5000 from the wastewater management facility only to dispose of this sludge to the landfill 54 this amount is significant for a small island state on the other side if financial resources are not provided to maintain the facility and make proper disposal of the sludge it can increase the environmental burden and compromise with the safety and health of the employees involved in operation handling storage and transportation it has been observed that the response to the implementation of a sewage sludge management plan because of its associated health benefits is high this means that sewage sludge management would certainly contribute to increased economic benefits good throughput reduction in the risk of fresh water contamination due to decrease in the volume of sewage sludge reaching the landfill reduction in the risk associated with contamination with water borne diseases minimization of risks to employees involved in handling and transportation of sewage sludge better productivity and ensuring sustainability 107 instead of spending an enormous sum of money to convey the sewage sludge to the landfill this cost could have been saved to invest in viable mechanisms encouraging resource recovery 5 conclusion this paper provides a review of existing sewage sludge management methods adopted in developed and developing countries based on the literature methods of properly managing sewage sludge like conversion of treated sewage sludge to biofertilizers for land application use as a substitute or supplement to cement and tar in road construction production of biogas to generate electricity and incineration were found to be suitable if practised in developed and to some extent in some developing countries however taking into consideration the topographic and demographic layout of the small island states common disposal routes which could apply in these islands were the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion to generate electricity re using as a by product for road construction and as biofertilizers for land application the different elements which have been lengthily discussed have showcased numerous bottlenecks in the choice of a proper sewage sludge management plan adaptive for small island development states however these results have also revealed that through improvement in the sustainability dimensions of the elements in an approach of developing a proper sewage sludge management plan for sids it can provide broader opportunities to explore and apply appropriate management technologies without jeopardizing with the environmental and health and safety facets associated with sewage sludge management given that amount of sludge generated is consequential with a surge in the wastewater treatment facilities in small island developing states the limited space as being one of the specificities of small island developing states is considered as an unsustainable way to dispose of this sludge in landfill as a starting point for future research it is

12897,the generation of wastewater is a universal practice in all spheres of life wastewater is generated from different stream sources including domestic industrial and commercial sources during the last years global volume of wastewater generated has witnessed a surge in developing countries after wastewater treatment sewage sludge is generated and is considered an asset rather than a by product this sludge is generally disposed of in landfills the practice of directing sewage sludge to landfills is not considered an optimal use of sludge as an asset however a comprehensive review of techniques for sewage sludge management is still inexistent in small island states as such this paper aims to conduct systematic literature reviewing of research papers published in the area of waste management to determine the transformation of sewage sludge in view of uncovering ideal global processes the findings out of the 111 scientific papers published from 1997 to 2021 were analysed on the sewage sludge management methods adopted in developing countries and the possibility of applying them in small island developing states the analysis indicates that the distribution of sewage sludge management techniques is inequitable and research on sewage sludge management in small island developing states is insufficient it is therefore crucial to evaluate the implications and challenges of the elements associative of sewage sludge in the establishment of a proper sewage sludge management plan for small island developing states keywords wastewater treatment sewage sludge management quantification characterisation and inventory analysis sludge management methods 1 introduction 1 1 overall global perspectives of wastewater generation wastewater is produced by various economic activities and is generally treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of its high pollution load 1 the volume of wastewater generated is witnessing a rise resulting from rapid urbanisation sewage network extensions new installations and upgrading of facilities 2 it is estimated globally that wastewater without appropriate treatment representing about 80 is discharged into the nature 3 these figures were predicted earlier from un wwap 4 though no time series data on the volume of wastewater generated globally was available a fluctuating increase was noted in the volume of wastewater generated in oecd countries from 2010 to 2019 graph 1 illustrates the volume of wastewater generated in the oecd countries 5 in view of the polluting characteristics of wastewater and the associated negative impacts on human beings and the environment it is imperative to treat the wastewater before it is released into the waterbodies 6 continuous increased discharges of inadequately treated wastewater further degrade groundwater untreated wastewater released into seas affects the aquatic bodies which subsequently affects aquatic organisms after the treatment procedures the water returns back to nature and waste in the solid state remains the resulting waste in the solid state at the wwtp is termed sludge 7 sewage sludge is the solid semisolid or slurry matter which is generated after the wastewater treatment operations this residual matter is usually categorized as primary and secondary sludge the chemical precipitation sedimentation and other primary processes result in the production of primary sludge whereas the biological treatments result in the generation of secondary sludge also known as activated sludge quite often the primary and secondary sludges are mixed together for further treatment and disposal 108 sewage sludge consists of particles of human faeces paper and bacteria and may be composed of considerable number of illness inducing agents parasites and intact chemicals the presence of these harmful components in the sewage sludge has a harmful impact on human health and the environment as a consequence of which the sewage sludge needs to be treated and managed 8 the annual production of sewage sludge in european union increased from some 5 5 million tonnes per year in 1992 to more than 9 0 9 5 million tons per year in 2017 whilst in china it increased to 39 0 million tons per year in 2019 110 in a developing country like china with a high population it was estimated that more than 36 million tons of sewage sludge with an 80 of moisture content were produced in 2019 9 and the complete treatment of sewage sludge in india would generate approximately 3955 thousand metric tonnes dry sewage sludge annually 10 therefore handling treatment and disposal of sludge becomes evidently a concerning issue in many developed countries across the globe several studies have provided peculiar attention to treatment of sludge in order to improve its quality and safe use whilst the management is not evident as they have their own nature characteristics and associated implications for developing countries and small island developing states 11 effective and efficient management of sludge thus remains among the most prominent and challenging matter throughout the world particularly in small island developing states like mauritius seychelles and singapore small island developing states sids are considered as those countries which face particular and enormous challenges in view of their geographical characteristics aloofness small population size small economic size small land area advanced influence to economic and environmental stresses and accelerated climate emergencies 12 challenges faced around the globe are having a dynamic effect on the economic conditions social upbringing and environmental situations of the small island states sids are especially more vulnerable to the climate change than developed countries and unfortunately being at ground level they are among the first countries suffering from the direct impact resulting from sea level rises and storms 5 due to their fragile ecosystem resource recovery is limited in sids and is considered vital for most sids as it blends with economic social and environmental challenges 5 it also helps reduce high dependence on imported products a considerable amount of sewage sludge is generated in sids though considered to be minimal as compared to the amount generated in developed countries there is a need to develop viable sewage sludge management strategies for sids however one of the barriers remains that no adequate research and lack of know how on the management of sludge exists for sids 11 the achievement of a sewage sludge management system not only rests on technical transformation but is also considerably guided by the elements contributing to sewage sludge management hence it is important for researchers to understand design and evaluate the fundamental elements focused on an effective and efficient sewage sludge management 2 as such this paper aims to conduct systematic literature reviewing of research papers published in the area of waste management to determine the underlying factors contributing in the development of proper sewage sludge management practices for small island states 2 bibliometric data analysis a preliminary literature review was conducted to provide a wide conceptualisation of the subject topic and the way to proceed with the review process this review was conducted on about 104 published articles full text research papers dated from 1997 to 2021 those published papers were indexed and searched on the international databases namely google scholar science direct scopus web of science using as keywords wastewater treatment sewage sludge management quantification and characterisation were used in the search of articles publicised 2 1 analysis of bibliometric information the phases of the process review are tabulated in the table 1 2 2 publishing trends the number of papers which were in conformity to sewage sludge management practices ranged from 1997 to 2021 as shown in fig 1 and a total of 111 publications were chosen from 1997 to 2009 the number of articles published which were consulted was 16 3 from 2010 to 2021 the number of published articles consulted was 83 7 this trend showed that from 2010 to 2021 there was an increased focus on sewage sludge management practices and during the past ten years many studies on sewage sludge management have gained an importance in this field the publication trend from fig 1 shows the trend in the number of articles with the highest number recorder in 2013 2017 2019 and 2020 an individual analysis was chosen to interpret the research documents there was no start date in the search query in order to retrieve all potential research papers focusing on management of sewage sludge various sewage sludge management strategies were also examined in different context but also observed that there were practically no articles on management of sewage sludge in small island developing states 2 3 assessment of the main elements in the research topics contributing to sewage sludge management studying the abstract of the papers published in the journals of the databases selected was the first step in the selection process papers which solely met the criteria of this paper were considered about 1500 articles were found during the search however only a few articles which could be associated to new technologies were considered then the keywords were narrowed down to treatment storage collection and transportation and the state of the art management techniques thereby bringing the number of publicised articles down to 104 for the purpose of this review nevertheless information from publicised documents such as unesco world bank unep were included in this review considering a preliminary literature review six main research topics were highlighted publications in the peer reviewed literature were used as a sample in order to i focus on the quantification characterisation and end use of sewage sludge ii enhance health and safety practices and underground water qualities iii demonstrate consequences of current practices and future challenges of sewage sludge management in small island developing states 3 literature analytics and findings the chosen articles that were in conformity with the outcome contributing to sewage sludge management practices are presented in this section there were different elements derived for the outcome which have been thoroughly discussed in this research in order to adopt proper sewage sludge management practices an overview of the elements have been analysed in depth which will enable to devise a proper sewage sludge management plan applicable for small island developing states a wastewater stream sources and sludge generation domestic sector with respect of the concentration and volume of domestic wastewater generated it represents the most important pollution resource domestic wastewater consists mainly of blackish wastewater generated from laundry and cleaning of dishes preparation of food and urine and faeces from the toilet 7 from treated wastewater solids or semisolid materials of sewage sludge are formed based on the development of urbanisation and industrialization in a developing country like china it has been observed that a significant sewage sludge quantity is produced 3 generally this sludge consists of a mixture of industrial sludge and may contain traces of heavy metals as a result of dyeing in industrial processes 13 the sewage sludge produced contains a percentage of moisture content 14 this sludge can be de watered to bring down the moisture content and can eventually be reused 15 industrial sector wastewater from industrial undertakings consists of used waters and manufacturing waste used sanitary tissue pads and water from cooling heating processes 16 it is also recognized for showing toxicity towards diverse aquatic creatures 17 large amount of sewage sludge is generated from industrial activities 18 matter of fact that it contains dangerously high level of pollutants comprising heavy metals its disposal is considered to be an issue of concern for the environment 19 the disposal of heavy metals is a serious environmental issue because of their non biodegradable properties and their likelihood to bioaccumulate 20 consequently sludge disposal is regarded as one of the most salient challenges in management of wastewater and sewage sludge 22 b domestic sludge as wastewater derivative sludge is generated after treatment and is considered as a by product 23 part of chemical oxygen demand cod removed is converted into biomass which result in biological sludge known as sewage sludge ghazy et al 112 defined sewage sludge as components generated at different phases of the treatment sewage sludge consists of constituents of high nutrient value heavy metals pollutants and small amount of calcium magnesium and sulphur 20 furthermore pathogens may also be present in the treated sewage sludge 21 due to its risks to human health and the environment and high treatment costs sludge is meant to be a matter of concern in several countries taking into consideration the evolution of urbanisation and industrialization in china sewage generation is meant to be enormous 24 dong et al 113 in their study stipulated that sewage sludge contains heavy metals some organic contaminants and pathogens incineration and sewage sludge applied in land are preferable options in eu 27 all member states one of the main difficulties encountered in the proper management of sludge is associated with the fact that domestic wastewater is mixed with a negligible amount of industrial waste whilst it is being channeled to the wastewater treatment stations thus the mixed sludge may contain heavy metals illness inducing agents and parasites which are environmentally harmful 26 sewage sludge also contains valuable resources such as phosphorus nitrogen and organic matter 27 in the absence of adequate treatment facilities considerable amount of sludge produced is largely sent for ultimate disposal at the landfill thereby increasing the pressure on the limited landfill space being given that the quantity generated is significant and disposal in landfill will continue to add pressure on the landfill space it is of utmost importance to quantify and characterize the sewage sludge consequently this necessitates development of a plan with necessary management aspects like financial implications transportation storage treatment which needs to be highlighted the focal point of this review seeks to raise conflicts concerned with the elements of a sewage sludge management plan for small island states and assess the benefits of sewage sludge as fertilizers in conditioning of soils in construction or in the generation of electricity c quantification and characterisation of sewage sludge the first step in formulating a sewage sludge management plan is to quantify and characterize the sewage sludge to be treated it is thus fundamental to determine the characteristics of sludge to be able to adopt the best selected options for the sewage sludge management practices 28 to be able to determine the sludge quantity involved in transportation as well as reuse or disposal it is of utmost importance to determine the concentration of dry solids in sludge 15 volume of sludge generated is approximately calculated taking into consideration the expected performance of thickening process of sludge and onsite dewatering the quantity of sewage sludge can be determined by measuring the tonnage of vehicle loaded 29 different organic and inorganic mixtures are contained in sewage sludge among the heavy metals zinc typically presents the highest contents in sewage sludge 30 copper lead chromium nickel manganese cobalt cadmium and arsenic may also be found in significant concentrations in sewage sludge mercury is usually present only at low concentrations usman et al 31 further mentioned that the level of treatment method of collection off site or onsite and amount and source of water flushed private and public toilet will reveal the characteristics of sludge nevertheless sludge contains primary nutrients for example phosphorus and nitrogen which can be used as fertilizer and can be changed for plants 28 since sewage can contain harmful waste material for example pharmaceuticals and heavy metals coming from different activities and industrial undertakings if adequately dry the sludge accumulated can be utilized for the recuperation of energy indirectly through gasification method anaerobic digestion and incineration 32 efficient operations of wastewater treatment plants produce vast quantities of sludge 33 the presence of secondary and tertiary treatment processes in the treatment of wastewater are the result of a rise in the quantity generated 6 the physico chemical characteristics of sewage sludge are tabulated in table 2 35 and it provides a broad outlook of the different elements which are usually present and tested in sewage sludge these elements will help in determining the different sludge disposal options to be adopted d treatment of sewage sludge sewage sludge treatment remains a crucial element in order to adopt a proper management plan 34 from a sustainable point of view resource recovery is considered to be very beneficial 40 in this context sludge treatment is highly recommended and it also applies to small island states to allow judicious use of this valuable by product in a cost effective way 37 several treatments are undertaken and these treatments as highly recommended by detr 2000 european commission 114 include thickening dewatering digestion thermal drying lime treatment and composting e storage mechanisms of sewage sludge at treatment plants once the sewage sludge treated it is usually kept aside in the open or in closed area for a certain period of time before transported to landfill or for other uses 39 normally the treated sewage sludge is kept aside for a time period between 1 week to 1 month before carting away or re use for other purposes 36 in small island developing states the storage space can be limited all depending on the amount generated f frequency of collection of sewage sludge generally sewage sludge is collected by transport companies to be carted away or re used 115 the quantity of sludge recuperated from a wastewater treatment plant will be changing and will depend on the sewage sludge facilities influenced by factors such as acceptability and encouraging management of sewage sludge 7 delay in the collection of the sludge particularly when it is stored in open sites can increase the water content after dewatering and increase the volume of sludge to be transported 42 in mauritius the sewage sludge is collected from the wastewater treatment station on a daily basis to be transported to the landfill for carting away g transportation of sludge another fundamental phase forming part in sewage sludge management plan in terms of cost and ecological impacts is transportation a sustainable transportation policy which considers carbon footprint issues odour noise and traffic impacts must be encouraged 29 in order to ensure that effluent emanating from wastewater treatment stations comply with accepted norms and standards one element which is crucial is the method used to remove wet sludge from the stations 43 the infrastructure for sewage sludge treatment at wastewater treatment stations have to be efficient with an adequate transportation policy so as to enhance removal of wet sludge from the site 44 h economic implications of sewage sludge plan due to the political and cost implications management systems of sewage sludge have not been set up integrally 116 this is mainly resulting from the number of stakeholders having multitude of cost interests in the sewage management system a sewage sludge system consists ordinarily of a group of stakeholders and transfer of money must be effected every time accountability is shifted from one stakeholder to another 36 operation and maintenance costs have to be taken into great consideration with dewatering and treatment of sludge stakeholders like end use industries use integral nutrients inherent properties of sewage sludge which have been treated end use industries are an emerging sector in the building block of sewage sludge process 48 sewage sludge end use should be taken into account when modelling the whole sewage sludge management system so that the best form of sewage sludge can be produced for final use 49 the agricultural and energy industries can be seen to be fundamental end use stakeholders taking into consideration the pressing need for local and cheap nutrients and sustainable source of energy 53 henceforth the cost benefits and environmental requirement of end use may help in improving management of sludge and determine models of the management systems 50 there is financial transfer for activities such as transport carting away and processing within a sewage sludge management system at specific frequency 2 to be able to achieve a cost effective business model selection of the types of transfer should be made in a judicious way discharge fee is a fee retained to allow discharge of sewage sludge at the landfill 49 the fee is charged ideally to ensure that responsibility is transferred to a stakeholder having technical abilities to process and convey sewage sludge to other liable stakeholders discharge incentive is a payment fee contrary to discharge fee and it helps wastewater treatment plants to meet their costs 28 costs of operation and maintenance o m of equipment in the wastewater treatment plants must be paid on a regular basis until the lifespan of the equipment has lapsed 9 sludge transport treatment and reuse provide a baseline for the overall cost estimates of the sewage sludge management plan 50 according to uisce irish water 29 the transportation to the landfill may cost approximately between 8 00 to 25 00 per tonne subject to the travel distance covered and the form of sewage sludge sludge transportation stands as a consequential magnitude of the costs associated with sewage sludge management 51 sludge dewatering has a comparatively higher cost of operation which is estimated to be between 10 to 15 million 52 the cost of sludge treatment and reuse may differ based on the sludge quantity generated and method of treatment used and is approximately 400 per tonne of dry solids generated 20 i environmental and occupational health problems associated with sewage sludge management according to shanthi et al 55 exposure to hazards associated with treatment processes at the wastewater treatment station cause specific health problems to the wastewater workers these hazards combine the physical chemical and biological hazards and they often result in occupational diseases 56 the health and safety executive hse 57 stipulates that different occupational activities expose workers to sewage every year several cases of workers suffering from one of the occupational illnesses have been recorded significant under reporting of cases could well exist because of inability to establish the relationship between illness and work 57 importance is given on utilization of sludge as auxiliary fuel supply in industries 60 this helps in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions utilization of raw materials and fossil fuels and the valorization of waste among others 28 nevertheless they were certain that sewage sludge can produce heavy metals and toxic gas dioxin people residing or working near the incinerator can experience an increase in health risks through inhalation when the toxic gas dioxin and heavy metals can make their way into soil and end up in the food chain 104 sludge applied on land may affect the health of humans via various routes of entry for example 10 soil through inhalation contaminated food items consumed skin contact with soil or volatile compounds ground and surface water via intake of animal and water consumed sewage sludge handled by employees and humans inhaling pollutants as well as particles several acute illnesses listed below have been recorded as a result of exposure to sewage sludge 57 i hepatitis characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice ii gastroenteritis associated with cramping stomach pains diarrhoea and vomiting iii dry cough and inflammation of the lungs i weil s disease ii infection of skin or eyes and iii attacks of breathlessness hung 59 in his study specified that there is practically no constituted evidence of the effects of sewage sludge on land use which remains a hurdle in the evaluation of effects since sewage contains various micro organisms the hazard cannot be easily eliminated however an appropriate risk assessment is important 57 one important way of mitigating the risks to the health of the sewage workers is to provide inocculation against tetanus and hepatitis a pre exposure prophylaxis immunization on a routine basis 61 exposure to hazards associated with sewage sludge can be reduced by drying the sludge before disposal using remote controlled robotic cameras for sewer inspection injection of sewage into land rather than spreading damming and bypass pumping of sewer sections prior to reconstruction and incineration of sludge 62 sludge dewatering can also be considered 63 the measures which follow can considerably minimize the risk of illness and infection 64 for example checking that line management and employees are well versed with the risks through proper training supervision and instruction catering for appropriate personal protective equipment choice of adequate equipment and an appropriate procedure for inspection and maintenance are of paramount importance ensuring that soap nailbrushes water and tissue papers are provided portable welfare facilities should be provided for distant locations j state of the art sewage sludge management techniques since some years back professionals in the field of wastewater unanimously agreed that universally sewage sludge is categorized as an origin of treasured resources instead of waste 2 environmental involvement and sustainability remain the leading factors behind this agreement increase in the cost of energy strict protocol for the disposal of sludge and outcry from general public and environmental departments 65 in a developing country like china a study conducted by domagoj nakić et al 30 revealed that it costs enormously to this country to treat its sewage sludge generated practically due to the absence of a proper disposal method the authorities in china are showing less interest in providing an appropriate sewage sludge disposal method in respect of the low budget allocated 66 restraint landfill space and obvious concerns with incineration evoke a high aspiration of considering sewage sludge as an environmental resource in the evolving sustainable society 15 according to relevant contextual information obtained for a small island state like mauritius it is clear that the sewage sludge management is not given proper attention by the fact that no experimental tests were carried out on the sewage sludge to determine its hazard potential before its disposal generally sewage sludge is sent to the sanitary landfill to be disposed of the choice of a sustainable method for the judicious management of sludge is a really difficult task for small island states 67 congruently tetteh et al 2 in their study pointed out that with an exhaustion of non renewable resources at a rapid pace because of increasing supply and demand downfall combined with a global rise in the cost of fuel climate change issues and public sensitization urge the association of scientists in using sewage sludge for recuperating renewable energy in small island states in small island states taking into account the agricultural oriented economy sewage sludge contains an essential source of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon elements and enhance soil quality 68 this process contributes enormously in fixing soil conditions to enable plant growth 69 k sewage sludge management hierarchy andreolis et al 70 stipulates that a sustainable means of disposal is required in this hierarchial system this will be applicable and will be fundamental in determining the means sewage sludge disposal in small island states and from this perspective the following should be taken into account production of sewage sludge cannot be eliminated completely with reinforcement of the effluent standards sewage sludge will keep on being generated and can witness a gain in the quantities produced with time accentuated by new wastewater treatment technologies and efficiencies recycling of the sewage sludge generated to its maximum land application of the treated dry sludge is accepted in developing countries like china in case the sludge quality does not allow its use in land application then incineration and landfilling as a last resort is considered but less applicable to small island states subject to its environmental vulnerability there is also a thriving interest in methods like thermal drying of the sludge sludge pelletization and other advanced processes that are geared towards enhancing the sludge quality such as production of compost 71 a sustainable means of disposal with minimum disposal costs and reduction in the amount of sludge carted away in landfill form part of managerial engagement for the safeguard of the environment 72 many countries have recognized the disposal of sewage sludge in landfill as being an unsustainable activity being given that it incurs enormous costs in transportation alone 73 recycling is regarded globally as a promising future trend because as an alternative it is considered to be cost effective and environment friendly in land application 70 i land application of biosolids the application of sewage sludge in land enhances soil texture recycles nutrients in the system and reduces or avoids the need for inorganic fertilizers 15 shaddel et al 117 are of the view that the authorities should ensure that the sewage sludge is free from heavy metals and pathogens before it is applied to the land the way and level of stabilization dictates the content of nitrogen 31 the intent is geared towards applying sewage sludge to the land and at the same time decreasing possible loopholes associated with its use 24 a significant quantity of phosphorus and nitrogen are found in sewage sludge 74 to produce fertilizers from sewage sludge a large amount of inorganic matter which include calcium compounds sulphuric acid magnesium potassium compounds or flyash is needed 75 this is needed to eliminate pathogens and form a hygienic product 43 the amount and accessibility of nutrients for development of plants is affected by the source and management 117 this method remains the dominating method of management in france the united states and united kingdom 76 despite that application of sewage sludge on land has been studied a lot with the resulting advancements in treating the sewage sludge yet in small island states it is still a matter of prejudice and resistance in accepting it as a waste management option because of its faecal origin however through the composting process the pathogen level can be eliminated to obtain a stable natural fertilizer 118 ii use as construction materials mageed et al 78 in a study laid emphasis that sewage sludge being re used in making of aggregates is considered to be a fundamental elucidation to problems associated with sludge management in japan 50 of sludge produced is used in the manufacture of construction materials 76 incineration of sludge producing ash is among those waste with content of quartz which is relatively elevated and there is a possibility for it to be integrated in the making of materials of construction 79 tay and show 80 in a study mentioned that the advantages associated with sludge ash which is used in making of construction materials entails cost reduction in treatment of sludge thus limiting conveyance of ashes to sanitary landfill moreover in view of development in the construction sector the increase in demand of construction materials has allowed determination of other methods for the manufacture of construction materials from ash of sewage sludge 81 takaoka et al 82 in a study pointed out that sludge may be used as a substitute to cement sewage sludge may be utilized as dried sludge powder dewatered sludge and incinerated ash 2 construction has witnessed a boom in small island states with the development of offshore business hotel development and property development associated with vested foreign investment the continuing reliance on imported cement and other reinforced construction materials will urge the economy to run in an unsustainable way 83 unfortunately no study has been conducted whereby small island states can look into the possibility of using sludge as a raw material to replace cement or mixed with cement iii gasification another effective means of converting sewage sludge in a useful resource is through gasification 84 nitrogen constituents are recuperated from the sludge during this process 85 as the sludge has been potentially dried this process can then prove to be very effective and it will generate significant quantity of nitrogen together with the fuel gas 86 in order to obtain the right energy characteristics sludge is blended with dry product namely wood or green waste during the previous years wastewater and sludge treatments have been considerably enhanced to comply with the new norms regarding the quality of effluents 87 treated sludge can generate a significant amount of energy and enhancing the process standard is meant to increase the demand in energy 40 this initiative represents an important challenge for small island states whereby it still represents an additional costs to import fossil fuels 119 a lot of emphasis should be laid on the use of renewable energy sources to reduce dependency on fuels thus reducing economic costs and emission of polluting gases iv wet air oxidation sludge is chemically oxidised during wet air oxidation at a temperature between 150 to 330o c and at an elevated pressure 89 the principal product of the wet air oxidation remains sludge with 3 inferior low molecular organic substances and an excessive of 95 of mineral components this process utilizes limited energy without use of fuel it improves de waterability mitigates emission of carbon dioxide and methane gases 66 however wet air oxidation involves investing enormous capital and cost of maintenance produces huge amount of ammonia 90 v pyrolysis when organic waste is thermally degraded to produce oil combustible gases and carbonaceous char in the absence of oxygen it is known as pyrolysis 91 gas obtained from waste can supply fuel for pyrolysis itself 92 oil products derived from this process are used to generate electricity 93 during pyrolysis sludge is heated under pressure between 350 and 500 c 2 pyrolysis is considered to be ecologically sound in contrast to incineration whereby unpolluted gas is released 94 vi biogas recovery around 30 of carbon dioxide 70 of methane and negligible quantity of hydrogen water vapour nitrogen and hydrogen sulphide are contained in biogas produced when sewage sludge undergo anaerobic digestion 76 for many years the utilization of anaerobic digestion to analyse agricultural wastes and sewage sludge has been greatly appraised in developing countries 95 roberts 96 mentioned in their study that under certain circumstances agricultural wastes or biodegradable sewage sludge are treated using anaerobic digestion it principal phase is heating and mixing the sewage sludge to produce biogas comprising carbon dioxide and methane remain the principal phase of anaerobic digestion 97 sludge with less than 38 organic content is inappropriate for anaerobic digestion 120 vii incineration hong et al 99 in a study emphasized that volume of sewage municipal sludge generated is reduced during incineration sewage sludge ash ssa is then produced and collected at the bottom of the furnace 9 ssa is classified as harmful as it contains particles of toxic nature 100 additionally a high proportion of organic compounds of hazardous nature furans dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also contained in the sewage sludge 121 viii landfilling owing to its low costs and expedient operation landfill is one of the preponderant methods for final disposal of sludge 122 however considering the possible environmental impact associated with disposal in landfills more and more countries have started drafting legislation in favour of controlling sludge landfill 103 when reuse options are available it is not advisable to consider landfilling as a viable option to dispose of the sewage sludge 91 land filling is less acceptable when there is a probable presence of elevated heavy metal content in the sewage sludge whereas there still exists the risk of groundwater contamination in the landfill site 106 unconventional utilization of sewage sludge is being favoured because of shortage of space in existing landfill site and also a concern in preservation of recuperable constituents of sewage sludge furthermore decrease in public acceptance and legislation in the global context are geared towards making landfill as a disposal option less accepted 112 the following table demonstrates the benefits pitfalls status and development of the different techniques of sewage sludge recovery 117 table 3 4 implications and challenges of associated elements of sewage sludge management for small island states after having demonstrated the research findings the possible outcomes are lengthily discussed in this section strengths and weaknesses this part also helps in shedding light on some key issues that will be required to be considered as enhancement for future works the impacts of quantification and characterisation have been thoroughly evaluated in this part the common sewage sludge disposal routes that have been proposed by the experts in the research findings were argued to be adaptive for small island developing states based on variable factors predominant in these small states also the health issues analysed demonstrates that common health problems might be a preoccupying issue and the need to establish a state of art technology englobing maintenance of the state of health of the workers exposed to sewage sludge arises nevertheless according to various analyses criticisms on the shortcomings that may prevent successful implementation of a sewage sludge management plan in small island states are noteworthy and ways to counteract these pitfalls have been positively elaborated ultimately the importance of the establishment of appropriate regulations policy measures to improve sewage sludge management have been highlighted in this section and selection of the best method appropriate for a small island like mauritius have been discussed a impact of volume of waste water generated quantification and characterisation of sewage sludge in sids the determination of the different characteristics of sewage sludge has allowed to make a proper analysis of the way the sludge can be managed taking the case of mauritius as a small island developing state the volume of wastewater generated sids is practically lower as compared to the volume generated in a developed and developing country taking into consideration the low volume generated the treatment and recovery technologies would be far more different research findings reveal that heavy metals are practically inexistent in domestic sludge in mauritius this explains the importance of exploring the possibilities of using sludge as a natural soil conditioner the only barrier which justifies the inadequate investigation of sludge used as natural fertilizer remains cultural perception and acceptability however through rigorous sensitization campaigns this impediment can be eliminated 105 b implications of treatment of sewage sludge in sids there is a need to ensure that there is no contamination of the food chain and in order to achieve it the pathogen level should be to the lowest standard as per accepted norms stabilization and composting can help to bring down the level of contaminants biogas produced from sludge on the other hand may be promoted in small island states in mauritius it is already a practice to produce biogas for the operation of a wastewater treatment plant only then it can be extended to a large scale to sustain the whole island s energy consumption the only barrier in this scenario is the maintenance of equipment involved in the operation due to frequent breakdown of the equipment this practice is discouraged particularly when it implies heavy costs of maintenance nevertheless with appropriate provision of funds which can be provided through institutional schemes and upgrading of equipment through technology financial implications should not be considered as a hurdle in the progress towards resource recovery another important way of promoting resource recovery of sewage sludge is by mixing its constituents with tar or cement for road construction and refurbishment thus minimizing the use of imported cement c implications of storage of sewage sludge in sids in the absence of adequate space for storage of sewage sludge and appropriate sewage sludge management plan for small island states it becomes difficult to manage the sludge in a sustainable way and can compromise with the environment and health and safety of the workers in the treatment stations in mauritius the only option presently considered for disposal of sewage sludge is landfill and to minimize the environmental burden and the health and safety issues the sewage sludge is collected and carted away on a daily basis to the landfill d implications of health and safety of disposal ofsewage sludge in sids in a small island state like mauritius in view of its characteristics it is well known for its environmental vulnerability the process of producing sewage sludge until its disposal that is carting away in landfill involves exposure to environmental and health and safety hazards at the initial point of production handling of sewage sludge by the workers can affect the health at work of workers involved in this process in various ways as mentioned above similarly at the collection points and during transportation workers safety and health are at risk if proper measures are not implemented moreover there are other physical hazards to which workers are usually exposed in the process for example slip and fall trapped in confined spaces like reactors and tanks present in the plant during maintenance noise problem associated with operation of noisy machines in the plant among others though no major health and safety issues have been locally reported the workers run a real risk of being affected by the process if appropriate measures are not observed and precautions taken the workers involved in the wastewater treatment and sewage sludge generation process in mauritius are inoculated against hepatitis and tetanus e implications of transportation of sewage sludge in sids a big gap exists in the transportation strategy adopted by a small island state like mauritius transportation of sewage sludge is carried out in developing countries like mauritius the transport of sewage sludge rests on a sub contractor who owns a low cost lorry and is involved in causing the transfer of sewage sludge to the landfill the subcontractor is remunerated by the main agency for the transfer on a daily basis which incurs an additional cost for the main agency this issue raised again leads to the financial implications faced by small island developing states in managing sewage sludge in the present circumstances with less costly transport vehicle to the transfer station or landfill 45 the unit cost of transportation per trip and per tonne of sewage sludge on a daily basis can cost around 10 per day for a small island state of mauritius 54 on average a total of about 18 t of sewage sludge are transported to the landfill on a daily basis and in a month the contractor engaged in the transportation of the sludge can claim up to a maximum of 5000 from the wastewater management facility only to dispose of this sludge to the landfill 54 this amount is significant for a small island state on the other side if financial resources are not provided to maintain the facility and make proper disposal of the sludge it can increase the environmental burden and compromise with the safety and health of the employees involved in operation handling storage and transportation it has been observed that the response to the implementation of a sewage sludge management plan because of its associated health benefits is high this means that sewage sludge management would certainly contribute to increased economic benefits good throughput reduction in the risk of fresh water contamination due to decrease in the volume of sewage sludge reaching the landfill reduction in the risk associated with contamination with water borne diseases minimization of risks to employees involved in handling and transportation of sewage sludge better productivity and ensuring sustainability 107 instead of spending an enormous sum of money to convey the sewage sludge to the landfill this cost could have been saved to invest in viable mechanisms encouraging resource recovery 5 conclusion this paper provides a review of existing sewage sludge management methods adopted in developed and developing countries based on the literature methods of properly managing sewage sludge like conversion of treated sewage sludge to biofertilizers for land application use as a substitute or supplement to cement and tar in road construction production of biogas to generate electricity and incineration were found to be suitable if practised in developed and to some extent in some developing countries however taking into consideration the topographic and demographic layout of the small island states common disposal routes which could apply in these islands were the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion to generate electricity re using as a by product for road construction and as biofertilizers for land application the different elements which have been lengthily discussed have showcased numerous bottlenecks in the choice of a proper sewage sludge management plan adaptive for small island development states however these results have also revealed that through improvement in the sustainability dimensions of the elements in an approach of developing a proper sewage sludge management plan for sids it can provide broader opportunities to explore and apply appropriate management technologies without jeopardizing with the environmental and health and safety facets associated with sewage sludge management given that amount of sludge generated is consequential with a surge in the wastewater treatment facilities in small island developing states the limited space as being one of the specificities of small island developing states is considered as an unsustainable way to dispose of this sludge in landfill as a starting point for future research it is fundamental to conduct extensive research in devising a proper sewage sludge management plan adaptable for sids about the authors poomalay poinen sohoraye part time lecturer school of sustainable

respectively also the performance of the reused catalyst was decreased based on the percentage of germination index of lepidium sativium seed the phytotoxicity of the treated dye solution has low toxicity 62 67 than the untreated dye solution 34 80 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation water hyacinth activated carbon free radical scavenger 1 introduction the textile industry has great economics worldwide which accounts for 14 of the total production of industries several chemicals and dyes are used in each step of textile processing it is noted that some dyes are highly toxic mutagenic carcinogenic decrease light penetration and photosynthetic activity cause oxygen deficiency and limit downstream beneficial uses such as drinking water recreation and irrigation as a result the removal of dyes from wastewater effluent takes attention over the past decades to decrease their impact on the environment 1 reactive dyes are excessively used for textile dyeing 1 2 cold reactive dyes such as drimarene k cibacron f and procion mx are used frequently reactive dyes have a low degree of fixation 50 90 and the reaming 10 50 loss as waste effluents 3 and also most reactive dyes are azo dye which cannot be degradable by the conventional treatment methods such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation adsorption and membrane processes instead transfer from one phase to another leading to secondary environmental pollution another emerging alternative of the textile wastewater treatment method is advanced oxidation processes aops which take place by the generation of free hydroxyl radicals ho the most commonly used oxidizing agents are fluoride hydroxyl radical oxygen atomic or molecular ozone hydrogen peroxide per hydroxyl hypochlorite chlorine dichromate permanganate etc 4 5 catalytic wet air oxidation cwao is a good and environmentally friendly manner that may decrease the operative conditions of wo enhance the reaction rate and shorten the reaction time the addition of catalysts makes the process achieve high conversion at lower temperature and pressure the preparation of efficient and durable catalysts remains the main challenge various heterogeneous catalysts have been used in cwao processes to reduce the cost of treatment by operating under milder conditions 6 the impregnation method is the most commonly applied for the preparation of supported catalyst using the precursor carbonate chlorides and nitrates salts solution and the well known catalyst supports are alumina silica zeolite and carbon in the preparation of supported metal or metal oxide catalysts 7 various researches were done on the application of the cwao process on the removal of different types of textile dye in the past the potential of the photocatalysis process for decolorization and cod removal of reactive red 2 textile dye using titanium oxide as catalyst the effect of catalyst loading 0 05 0 4 g ml and tio2 catalyst form bulk and nano size on the color and cod removal efficiency was observed thus at 0 4 g ml of bulk tio2 88 decolorization and 46 cod removal was reached and also using the same catalyst

of h2o2 concentration 44 mg l of fe2 concentration and at 11 11 min the 98 decolorization and cod removal was achieved 9 the performance of activated carbon supported iron catalyst for the removal of portion red mx 5x dye through the catalytic wet peroxidation process operating parameters are catalyst loading 0 1 0 5 g l hydrogen peroxide 1 8 mm ph 3 4 temperature 30 70 c and 100 ppm initial dye concentration at the optimum reaction conditions hydrogen peroxide 4 mm catalyst loading 0 25 g l ph 3 and temperature 50 c the toxicity was determined using lepidium sativum seed germination in dye solution before and after oxidation thus the treated dye solution has low growth inhibition 1 1 and finally the kinetic was evaluated with different temperatures and the optimum value of other factors 10 most of the time activated carbon ac is used as an adsorbent but some research can show it can be used as a catalyst or catalyst support ac is a relatively cheap material compared to metal oxides or noble metal catalysts and it can eliminate or reduce the leaching problem moreover ac can be used over a wide ph range due to its stability in various reaction conditions and its large surface area enables the high adsorption of organic molecules 11 the current research focuses on the preparation of activated carbon from the root of water hyacinth which is currently available in a huge amount in lake tana bahir dar ethiopia for the application catalyst support the general objective of this study is to investigate the cwao of azo dye rr2 over water hyacinth root derived activated carbon supported copper oxide catalyst 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and raw materials water hyacinth root was used as a precursor for activated carbon chemicals such as phosphoric acid 85 was used for activation of water hyacinth root powder hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide base 99 8 was used for ph adjustment of the dye solution reactive red 2 dye powder obtained from bahir dar textile share company was used as a model pollutant for the preparation of synthetic dye solution the general characteristics of the dye are presented in table 2 1 sodium chloride salt 98 5 was used for the determination of the point of zero charges sodium bicarbonate 99 8 and methanol 99 were used as hydroxyl scavengers oxygen 99 was used as an oxidant and nitrogen 99 9 gas is used leak test of the reactor and creating an inert atmosphere in the reactor and copper nitrate trihydrate 96 as a precursor of copper oxide catalyst 2 2 catalyst preparation water hyacinth plant was collected from bahir dar lake tanna around yifag then the roots of the water hyacinth were separated from its stem and the leaf was further cleaned with water to remove dust soil and other impurities it was chopped and dried using sunlight for one week after drying it was ground and sieved 0 5 1 mm sieve size range it was soaked with phosphoric acid 85 which gives an impregnation ratio equal to 1 and manually agitated with a metal rod for 8 h within a 30 min interval and stay for another 16 h then it was dried in an oven the carbonization takes place at 600 c for 1 h with a heating rate of 20 c min then it was washed many times with excess distilled water until the filtrate reached nearly a ph of 7 and dried in an oven finally it was sieved with a sieve size range of 63 180 μm and stored in a plastic sample holder for later use copper nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o salt was used as a precursor for the preparation of copper oxide due to its high catalytic activity than other transition metals as reported by other researchers 12 5 wt cu ac was prepared by wet impregnation methods following the procedure reported by 13 14 after impregnation it was heated with a hot plate until the water was evaporated and further dried in an oven finally it was calcined at 350 c for 3 h to produce cuo ac catalyst the overall preparation procedure was shown in fig 2 1 2 3 characterization the point of zero charges pzc was determined by applying the method stated elsewhere 15 16 the expected functional group percent in whr ac cuo ac and ruc2 were determined using an ftir spectrometer ft ir 6600 the surface morphology of the whr ac and cuo ac were analyzed using sem inspect f50 the thermal stability of ac cuo ac and ruc2were investigated using tga beijing hct 1 the analysis was performed by using x ray 7000 diffractometer shimadzu corporation kyoto japan the amount of copper metal present in the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst using ashing method and analyzed by aas 280fsaa 2 3 1 preparation of synthetic dye solution the dye stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of powder dye in 1 l of distilled water to get 1000 mg l it was further diluted to 100 mg l and the ph value was adjusted with 0 1naoh hcl the maximum absorbance dye and the calibration curve were of the was determined 2 3 2 toxicity assessment first the filter paper was placed into 3 different petri dishes and then added 20 seeds were to each petri dish 3 ml of untreated treated and distilled water was added to each petri dish respectively then finally petri dishes were covered and kept at room temperature 25 c for 72 h the number of seeds germinated was counted and root length was measured to determine the germination index 2 3 3 batch adsorption experiment a simple batch adsorption experiment was performed to determine the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent or catalyst and the adsorption process was evaluated using the 2 most known isotherm models langmuir and freundlich isotherm models 17 it was conducted with 0 6 g of ac or cuo ac was weighted and poured in 250 ml of the conical flask which contained 100 ml of different concentrations of dye solution 10 50 100 150 200 mg l by maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 25 c and agitated with a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 120 min then it was filtered by filter paper and analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometer 18 19 2 3 4 experimental setup and description for cwao experiment the cwao process was carried out on a laboratory scale in a high pressure autoclave reactor shown schematically in fig 2 2 it has a volume of 2 l maximum operation temperature and pressures are 150 c and 6 bar the laboratory autoclave reactor consists of 3 operations charging mixing and discharging first the reactor head assembly was untightened and charged the prepared synthetic dye solution and fresh catalyst then closed and tightened well the electrical control panels were connected to the power source then turn on the entire display switch and open the nitrogen gas cylinder to check the leak turn on the heater switch and set the desired temperature and the reaction mixture was heated by supplying 1 5 bar nitrogen gas until the desired temperature is reached once the desired temperature is reached turn on an agitator switch and adjust the agitator at 400 rpm using a regulator then agitator cooling water was opened replace the nitrogen gas flow with oxygen gas flow and supply to the reactor at the required pressure amount which is quantified by the pressure indicator or pressure gauge then a sample was taken via sampling valve at the required time interval with the volume that does not affect the volume of the reaction mixture when the reaction is finished turn off the agitator and the heating system open the gas outlet valve turn on the reactor cooling system and cooled until room temperature finally the sample in the reactor is discharged and cleaned for another cycle thus all experiments were conducted based on experimental design moreover cwao experiments using activated carbon catalyst and in the presence of hydroxyl radical scavenger sodium bicarbonate and methanol was conducted and also wet air oxidation wao without catalyst and an adsorption experiment were conducted at different temperatures in the absence of oxygen 2 3 5 analysis of batch adsorption experiment the batch adsorption was evaluated under the percentage of dye removal adsorption capacity and adsorption isotherm models 2 3 5 1 adsorption efficiency and capacity the percentage of dye removal was determined using eq 2 1 2 1 dye removal c 0 c t c 0 100 the adsorption capacity qe was computed via eq 2 2 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e concentration of dye mg l at initial and at equilibrium volume of dye solution l and m mass of the adsorbent g 2 3 5 2 adsorption isotherm models the langmuir isotherm model can describe and quantify sorption on a set of distinct localized adsorption sites and has been used to describe the adsorption process 1 17 it is represented in linear form in eq 2 3 2 3 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k l q m where ce equilibrium concentration mg l qe the amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g kl langmuir constant and qm maximum adsorption capacity mg g the values of qm and kl are calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line plotting of ce qe versus ce the essential characteristics of a langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless separation factor or equilibrium parameter rl which is defined by eq 2 4 2 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the value of rl indicates the shape of the isotherm to be either unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the freundlich isotherm describes equilibrium on heterogeneous surfaces and hence does not assume monolayer capacity it is represented as in eq 2 5 2 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf adsorption capacity and 1 n adsorption intensity 1 n and kf are calculated from the slope and intercept of the freundlich plot it has been shown that 1 n value between 0 and 1 represents good adsorption a value n for 1 n below one indicates a normal langmuir isotherm while 1 n above one is indicative of cooperative adsorption 20 2 3 6 analysis of cwao experiment the performance of the cwao process was mainly evaluated through the percentage of dye decolorization and cod conversion at selected reaction conditions that the maximum percentage of decolorization was recorded in addition to this its degradation is predicted by scanning using uv visible spectrophotometer before and after cwao 2 3 6 1 determination of the percentage of dye decolonization the percentage of dye decolonization calculated by using eq 2 6 2 6 decolorization c 0 a t c 0 100 where c0 ct initial and final

respectively mrlgds and mrlgc mean root length growing in dye solution before and after treatment and control distilled water respectively gi growth index 2 4 experimental design and operating conditions in this study full factorial experimental design was used to determine the experimental runs for cwao experiments three factors with 3 levels such as catalyst dose 2 4 and 6 g l reaction temperature 70 95 and 120 c and oxygen partial pressure 1 2 and 3 bar with a reaction time of 10 30 60 90 and 120 min were done in duplicate the initial dye concentration of 100 mg l was selected in the current study because most of the time the dye concentration is present in textile wastewater effluents in the range of 10 to 200 mg l as stated by previous researchers 10 25 the catalyst dose and the reaction temperature range were also selected from the previous studies on the cwao of orange 2 mono azo dye by 8 the oxygen partial pressure from the previous study 26 and also considering the reactor maximum operating condition the stirring speed of the agitator was set at 400 rpm for the safe operation of the reactor table 2 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ac and cuo ac catalyst 3 1 1 point of zero charges phpzc the phpzc value for ac and cuo ac were 5 227 and 6 413 respectively as shown in fig 3 1 the value of phpzc for cuo ac is greater than ac due to the effect of copper oxide which has a basic character a similar result was reported by 15 during their study on copper loaded on the activated carbon the surface of the catalyst is positively and negatively charged below and above their phpzc value respectively 3 1 2 ftir analysis the result of the ftir analysis for whrp ac cuo ac and ruc2 are shown in fig 3 2 in all samples the peak is around 3400 cm 1 which indicates the existence of the oh group and also the peak around 2380 cm 1 assigned for cc 27 in raw whr shown in fig 3 2 a the peak at 2932 cm 1 indicates the existence of ch vibrations in methyl and methylene group 1648 assigned for alkenyl cc stretch at 1420and 1276 cm 1 for vinyl and vinylidene ch in pane bends respectively at 1044 primary alcohol co stretch the last peak at 540 cm 1 aliphatic iodo compounds ci stretch has been assigned by other researchers 28 31 as shown in fig 3 2 b the peaks in prepared activated carbon at 1604 cm 1 indicated carboxylate around 1100 cm 1 phosphate ion and 732 and 516 for are assigned to aromatic structures or p c phosphorus containing compounds 30 the peaks at 2932 1420 and 1276 cm 1 in whr are disappeared due to the decomposition of the functional group present in oxygenated hydrocarbons referring to the carbohydrate structure of cellulose and hemicellulose by phosphoric acid this result has been confirmed by a previous study 31 the copper oxide loaded activated carbon has 2 unique peaks that appeared in the activated carbon at 532 and 493 cm 1 indicating the existence of copper oxide cuo as shown in fig 3 2 c which is a similar conclusion from previously reported by 13 29 in twice reused copper oxide catalysts have similar peaks as shown in fig 3 2 d generally the existence of those main functional groups such as oh co cc and co is responsible for the adsorption of copper metal and dye 3 1 3 sem analysis the micrograph with different magnification ranges 3041 5578 from sem analysis for whr ac and cuo ac was shown in fig 3 3 a b and c respectively as the micrograph shows the surface of raw whr has some irregular structures with flat cavities due to the presence of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin without any cracks 31 while the surface of ac and cuo ac showed the existence of several irregular structures with deep cavities and spongy structure especially observed on the surface of ac due to the removal of volatile matter by carbonization and by the activating agent 31 32 generally the presence of a heterogenous surface is favorable to the adsorption of copper or dye 3 1 4 tga dta analysis the thermal stability of ac cuo ac and ruc2 catalyst was investigated with the temperature range of 30 900 c and at a heating rate of 20 c min as shown in fig 3 4 weight losses occurred in 3 stages at the first stage temperature ranges 53 137 c 45 109 c and 59 174 c the percentage of weight loss for ac cuo ac and ruc2 were 6 43 4 17 and 7 246 respectively this is due to the removal of moisture from the surface that may be adsorbed during storage time 33 at the second stage temperature ranges 137 480 c 109 480 c and 174 396 c the percentage of weight loss for ac cuo ac and ruc2 were 9 5 and 4 4 respectively at the last stage temperature ranges 480 600 c 480 590 c and 396 585 c the percentage of weight loss of ac cuo ac and ruc2 were 20 13 and 29 respectively dta also showed the existence of the exothermic peak at a temperature of 558 534 and 449 c for ac cuo ac and ruc2 respectively this exothermic peak indicates the oxidation of catalysts as stated by 13 generally the second and the last stage of weight loss is due to the decomposition of surface groups that are formed during activation like carboxylic acids carboxylic anhydrides and lactones which are less thermally stable decompose with the liberating of carbon dioxide in the temperature range 300 400 c and also while it is the decomposition of other surface groups like phenol ethers takes place at higher temperatures above 400 c 33 after heating temperatures of 600 590and 585 c the tga analysis shows insignificant weight loss for ac cuo ac and ruc2 respectively the cuo ac shows higher thermal stability than the ac therefore the cuo ac catalyst is used in the cwao process without significant weight loss up to 480 c 3 1 5 xrd analysis the xrd peaks for both ac and cuo ac have followed a similar pattern as shown in fig 3 5 the appearance displays in the form of a wide angle range 2 θ 20 30 with the presence of sharp peaks the sharp peaks indicate the presence of crystalline structure due to the formation of graphite type of carbon 34 35 the existence of this broad peak has been reported by different researchers on the preparation of activated carbon from different precursors 27 32 36 37 the strongest sharp peaks were observed at 24 047 26 5854 and 23 33 in both ac and cuo ac generally the prepared ac and cuo ac catalysts are dominated by an amorphous nature this amorphous nature show the catalyst has a better surface area high exposed sites resulting in better catalytic activity 3 2 calibration curve for rr2 dye the maximum wavelength of the dye was investigated by uv scan of 100 mg l of dye solution which is 541 15 nm as shown in fig 3 6 a which is an agreement with the literature value of 538 nm reported elsewhere 10 25 the standard curve was prepared from known concentration ranges 0 01 100 mg l thus the developed linear equation was used for estimation of the dye concentration with a correlation coefficient r2 0 998 as shown in fig 3 6 b 3 3 adsorption efficiency capacity and isotherms to know the adsorption capacity of the prepared catalyst adsorption experiment was conducted using a catalyst as an adsorbent the percentage of dye removal and adsorption capacity for ac and cuo ac adsorbent or catalyst were investigated as it can be seen in fig 3 7 the percentage of dye removal was decreased as the dye concentration increased for both ac and cuo ac adsorbent while the adsorption capacity was increased as the dye concentration increased the percentage of dye removal by using ac and cuo ac as adsorbents was 63 and 52 respectively for the initial dye concentration of 100 mg l at the operating condition 6 g l of adsorbent dose at ph of 3 at room temperature with a contact time of 120 min the adsorption capacity of ac and cuo ac adsorbent was 10 467 and 8 735 mg g respectively the adsorption experimental result was evaluated through langmuir and freundlich isotherms models the results were well fitted with the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 9965 than the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 882 in the case of ac as adsorbent which is shown in fig 3 8 and similarly langmuir isotherm model r2 0 9931 was best fitted than the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 991 for the cuo ac adsorbent as shown in the fig 3 9 and table 3 1 the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity for ac and cuo ac were 11 68 and 11 12 mg g respectively 3 4 effect of operating parameters on dye decolorization and cod conversion the effect of operating parameters such as catalyst dose reaction temperature and oxygen partial pressure as a function of reaction time was studied on the percentage of dye decolorization and cod conversion the effect of ph on the percentage of dye decolorization and cod removal was presented in fig 3 10 over 99 99 and 96 64 dye decolorization were achieved at 120 min for ph values of 3 and 9 respectively similarly the conversion of cod is affected by ph value as shown in fig 3 11 as the ph value increased from 3 to 9 the conversion of cod was decreased from 88 57 to 54 28 it was observed that the initial ph of the dye solution decreased after treatment oxidation which was around 1 98 due to the formation of low molecular acids like carboxylic acids and other intermediate products during cwao in agreement with the work of 14 38 39 the effect of ph on the dye removal efficiency is related to the surface charge of the catalyst and the dye solution the dye is anionic which means negatively charged the phpzc of the catalyst was 6 414 as determined previously which indicates positively charged under this value and negatively charged above this value so when the initial dye solution at a low ph value will increase the positive charge of the catalyst surface which increases the adsorption of anionic dye also similar result reported on the study of catalytic wet peroxidation of reactive red 2 dye by fe ac as a catalyst by 10 13 during the study of cwao of nitrobenzene on copper loaded activated carbon catalyst 3 4 1 effect of catalyst dose the influence of catalyst dose on the percentage of dye decolorization and conversion of cod was investigated with a range of catalyst doses 2 6 g l as shown in fig 3 12 the percentage decolorization is found to be 93 056 95 598 and 99 99 for 2 4and 6 g l of catalyst dose respectively at a reaction time of 120 min the conversion of cod was 62 85 76 7 and 88 57 for 2 4and 6 g l of catalyst dose respectively as shown in fig 3 13 as the result showed both percentages decolorization and cod conversion increased as catalyst dose increased due to the presence of a more active site on the catalyst surface for adsorption of the dye which enhanced oxidation reaction a similar result was reported previously on cwao of pharmaceutical sludge using cu ce catalyst by 40 wao experiment was conducted at a temperature of 120 c and oxygen partial pressure of 3 bar within 120 min of reaction time and also cwao experiment was performed in the presence of ac and the result is presented in fig 3 14 the percentage of decolorization 33 76 and cod removal 7 62 was achieved by the wao process the removal was very low compared to the cwao process this indicates the effect of the catalyst the percentage of decolorization 94 89 and conversion of cod 60 95 were achieved by the cwao using ac as a catalyst it is revealed that conversion of cod in ac catalyzed cwao compared to cuo ac catalyzed this is a good indication of the presence of copper oxide catalyst on the support of activated carbon which enhances the cwao of the dye 3 4 2 effect of reaction temperature the studied reaction temperature was in the range of 70 to 120 c as shown in fig 3 15 the percentage of decolorization 77 52 92 6 and 99 99 was obtained for the reaction temperatures 70 95 and 120 c within 120 min of reaction time the conversion of cod is highly influenced by the reaction temperature as shown in fig 3 16 the cod conversion was 32 73 14 and 87 57 with a temperature of 70 95 and 120 c respectively that the reaction rate constant is increased as the reaction temperature increase a similar result was reported during the degradation of oxalic acid 41 at a reaction temperature of 120 c the percentage of decolorization reaches a maximum within 60 min and no more change was observed after this time this is due to the solubility of oxygen decreasing up to 100 c while increasing above 100 c as reported elsewhere 40 42 3 4 3 effect of oxygen partial pressure the effect of oxygen partial pressure on dye removal was studied in the range 1 3 bar the decolorization of dye at 120 min of reaction time 95 31 97 576 and 99 99 was achieved with 1 2 and 3 bar of oxygen partial pressure respectively as shown in fig 3 17 the conversion of cod was 78 09 81 90and 88 57 which is shown in fig 3 18 the result showed the removal efficacy of rr2 dye is increased as the amount of oxygen concentration increased similar results have been reported by other researchers studied on the removal of the pharmaceutical sludge by cwao process using a homogenous catalyst cu ce and fe3 catalyst 39 40 and also cwao of paper and mill wastewater by using platinum loaded activated carbon catalyst 38 541 25 nm while no peak existed after treatment oxidation this is due to the degradation of the azo dye a similar result was reported on the cwao of the methyl orange dye 8 if the oxygen amount increased it would increase its existence in the liquid phase which accelerates the oxidation of dye either directly or indirectly by forming another strong oxidative species hydroxyl oh and perhydroxyl radical ho2 as reported by 6 43 the percentage of dye decolorization was increased as the catalyst dose reaction temperature and oxygen partial pressure with time the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the decolorization and cod conversion followed by catalyst dose and oxygen partial pressure the nearly complete dye decolorization 100 and 88 57 of cod conversion were achieved at the maximum value of these operating parameters the previous studies on the removal of this azo dye using different advanced oxidation processes and operating conditions were reviewed those 91 6 decolorization and 47 5 cod conversion were achieved by catalytic wet peroxidation process 10 tio2 nano sized catalyst 98 decolorization and 56 cod conversion by photocatalysis 25 and above 98 decolorization and cod removal 9 here to understand the adsorption effect on dye removal an adsorption experiment was conducted at a temperature of 25 70 and 120 c with an autoclave reactor similar to the cwao experiment except for the absence of oxygen and the result is shown in fig 3 19 the maximum percentage of decolorization by adsorption process 47 887 63 59 and 88 11 was attained within 120 min of contact time for a temperature of 25 70 and 120 c respectively the decolorization increased with increasing temperature but not attained complete decolorization therefore complete decolorization of the dye is due to the cwao process the disappearance of the azo dye was also indicated by scanning the dye solution before and after treatment cwao using a uv vis spectrometer as shown in fig 3 20 the maximum peak existed in untreated dye at the wavelength of around 541 nm while after treatment there is no peak so it indicates its disappearance 3 5 effect free radical scavenger on the percentage of dye decolorization the effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger on the cwao of rr2 mono azo dye was studied using sodium bicarbonate as reported by 44 46 as shown in fig 3 21 at 120 min the percentage of decolorization 42 91 and 59 21 was obtained in the presence of nahco3 and ch3oh scavenger respectively the percentage of decolorization obtained in the presence of nahco3 is low indicating sodium bicarbonate has high scavenging activity than methanol under the same operating condition also supported by previous studies on cwao phenol in the presence of sodium bicarbonate and methanol as a radical scavenger by 47 in general the rate of cwao of the azo dye was inhibited in the presence of radical scavengers it indicates that cwao of azo dye was via free radical mechanism as discussed by previous researchers on azo dye removal by copper catalyze oxidation process 48 the reaction between bicarbonate and hydroxyl radical was reported by 45 49 as shown in eq 3 1 3 1 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o to compare the current result from previously studied on the removal of reactive red to dye by different advanced oxidation process were reviewed and presented in table 3 2 below 3 6 catalyst reusability and leaching test the reusability of the catalyst was evaluated by using catalyst reuse as shown in fig 3 22 the percentage of dye decolorization at 120 min for ruc1 and ruc2 was 97 94 and 92 respectively the performance of the catalyst was decreased as reused for the first time to the second time this indicates the catalytic activity of activated carbon supported copper oxide catalyst was lost maybe due to the leaching of copper the amount of copper present in the fresh catalyst used catalyst and reused catalyst first time was 56 515 39 845 and 37 498 mg l thus the amount of copper leached out from the first usage and the second usage is 16 67 and 19 017 mg l this is since the integrated effect of ph either the initial ph of the dye solution or acidic media developed during cwao and the reaction temperature also observed by other researchers 50 51 the amount of copper leached out within the treated dye solution was much greater than the allowed discharge limit reported by 52 3 7 toxicity assessment the phytotoxicity tests were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of the treated dye solution it was evaluated in terms of percent of rsg rrg and gi with comparison to growth in distilled water control as shown in fig 3 23 the growth of seed in the untreated and treated dye solution and in distilled water respectively the rsg rrg and gi for untreated were 84 41 38 and 34 85 respectively and for treated dye solution were 95 65 69 and 62 24 respectively the rsg rrg and gi values for treated dye were greater than the untreated dye solution thus the toxicity of treated dye solution less than that of the untreated yields better growth of lepidium sativum seed the previous studies 21 24 53 characterize the degree of toxicity based on the value of gi if gi above 80 indicates no phytotoxic substance between 50 80 moderate and below 50 presence of a strong phytotoxic substance thus based on this criteria the untreated dye was 34 85 which is less than 50 implies it is phytotoxic substance and treated dye solution was 62 69 which is between the range of 50 80 moderate phytotoxic substance was present this is due to the formation of other toxic products during the oxidation process of dye solution 4 conclusion cwao of reactive red 2 dye using whr derived activated carbon supported copper oxide catalyst shows remarkable results from a simple batch adsorption study langmuir adsorption isotherm is fitted well than the freundlich with maximum theoretical adsorption capacity for ac and cuo ac is 11 68 and 11 12 mg g respectively nearly 100 decolorization and over 88 57 cod conversion mineralization were achieved at maximum operating condition 6 g l of catalyst dose 120 c of reaction temperature and 3 bar of oxygen partial pressure of with the reaction time of 120 min reused catalysts until the second time showed similar performance with fresh catalysts but leaching copper was observed and increased with re usage from the first and second usage of the catalyst the amount of copper leached out was 16 67 to 19 017 mg l respectively which exceeds from allowed discharging limit the treated dye solution shows low toxicity compared to the untreated one based on the percentage of gi of lepidium sativum seed thus 62 2 and 34 80 respectively generally it was observed that the cwao process seems a potential candidate for decolorization and mineralization of the azo dye nevertheless further study is required to evaluate the complex interplay of mass and heat transfer in heterogeneous cwao

partial pressure within 120 min of reaction time the percentage of dye decolorization was 42 91 and 59 in the presence of free radical scavengers sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and methanol ch3oh respectively also the performance of the reused catalyst was decreased based on the percentage of germination index of lepidium sativium seed the phytotoxicity of the treated dye solution has low toxicity 62 67 than the untreated dye solution 34 80 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation water hyacinth activated carbon free radical scavenger 1 introduction the textile industry has great economics worldwide which accounts for 14 of the total production of industries several chemicals and dyes are used in each step of textile processing it is noted that some dyes are highly toxic mutagenic carcinogenic decrease light penetration and photosynthetic activity cause oxygen deficiency and limit downstream beneficial uses such as drinking water recreation and irrigation as a result the removal of dyes from wastewater effluent takes attention over the past decades to decrease their impact on the environment 1 reactive dyes are excessively used for textile dyeing 1 2 cold reactive dyes such as drimarene k cibacron f and procion mx are used frequently reactive dyes have a low degree of fixation 50 90 and the reaming 10 50 loss as waste effluents 3 and also most reactive dyes are azo dye which cannot be degradable by the conventional treatment methods such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation adsorption and membrane processes instead transfer from one phase to another leading to secondary environmental pollution another emerging alternative of the textile wastewater treatment method is advanced oxidation processes aops which take place by the generation of free hydroxyl radicals ho the most commonly used oxidizing agents are fluoride hydroxyl radical oxygen atomic or molecular ozone hydrogen peroxide per hydroxyl hypochlorite chlorine dichromate permanganate etc 4 5 catalytic wet air oxidation cwao is a good and environmentally friendly manner that may decrease the operative conditions of wo enhance the reaction rate and shorten the reaction time the addition of catalysts makes the process achieve high conversion at lower temperature and pressure the preparation of efficient and durable catalysts remains the main challenge various heterogeneous catalysts have been used in cwao processes to reduce the cost of treatment by operating under milder conditions 6 the impregnation method is the most commonly applied for the preparation of supported catalyst using the precursor carbonate chlorides and nitrates salts solution and the well known catalyst supports are alumina silica zeolite and carbon in the preparation of supported metal or metal oxide catalysts 7 various researches were done on the application of the cwao process on the removal of different types of textile dye in the past the potential of the photocatalysis process for decolorization and cod removal of reactive red 2 textile dye using titanium oxide as catalyst the effect of catalyst loading 0 05 0 4 g ml and tio2 catalyst form bulk and nano size on the color and cod removal efficiency was observed thus at 0 4 g ml of bulk tio2 88 decolorization and 46 cod removal was reached and also using the same catalyst loading with nanosize tio2 98 of decolorization and 56 cod removal was recorded 8 the degradation of reactive red 2 dyes by fenton oxidation process the effect of experimental factors such as concentration oxidant h2o2 the concentration of catalyst fe2 and reaction time on reactive red 2 oxidation was investigated at optimum operation condition 10 mg l of initial dye concentration 58 mg l of h2o2 concentration 44 mg l of fe2 concentration and at 11 11 min the 98 decolorization and cod removal was achieved 9 the performance of activated carbon supported iron catalyst for the removal of portion red mx 5x dye through the catalytic wet peroxidation process operating parameters are catalyst loading 0 1 0 5 g l hydrogen peroxide 1 8 mm ph 3 4 temperature 30 70 c and 100 ppm initial dye concentration at the optimum reaction conditions hydrogen peroxide 4 mm catalyst loading 0 25 g l ph 3 and temperature 50 c the toxicity was determined using lepidium sativum seed germination in dye solution before and after oxidation thus the treated dye solution has low growth inhibition 1 1 and finally the kinetic was evaluated with different temperatures and the optimum value of other factors 10 most of the time activated carbon ac is used as an adsorbent but some research can show it can be used as a catalyst or catalyst support ac is a relatively cheap material compared to metal oxides or noble metal catalysts and it can eliminate or reduce the leaching problem moreover ac can be used over a wide ph range due to its stability in various reaction conditions and its large surface area enables the high adsorption of organic molecules 11 the current research focuses on the preparation of activated carbon from the root of water hyacinth which is currently available in a huge amount in lake tana bahir dar ethiopia for the application catalyst support the general objective of this study is to investigate the cwao of azo dye rr2 over water hyacinth root derived activated carbon supported copper oxide catalyst 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and raw materials water hyacinth root was used as a precursor for activated carbon chemicals such as phosphoric acid 85 was used for activation of water hyacinth root powder hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide base 99 8 was used for ph adjustment of the dye solution reactive red 2 dye powder obtained from bahir dar textile share company was used as a model pollutant for the preparation of synthetic dye solution the general characteristics of the dye are presented in table 2 1 sodium chloride salt 98 5 was used for the determination of the point of zero charges sodium bicarbonate 99 8 and methanol 99 were used as hydroxyl scavengers oxygen 99 was used as an oxidant and nitrogen 99 9 gas is used leak test of the reactor and creating an inert atmosphere in the reactor and copper nitrate trihydrate 96 as a precursor of copper oxide catalyst 2 2 catalyst preparation water hyacinth plant was collected from bahir dar lake tanna around yifag then the roots of the water hyacinth were separated from its stem and the leaf was further cleaned with water to remove dust soil and other impurities it was chopped and dried using sunlight for one week after drying it was ground and sieved 0 5 1 mm sieve size range it was soaked with phosphoric acid 85 which gives an impregnation ratio equal to 1 and manually agitated with a metal rod for 8 h within a 30 min interval and stay for another 16 h then it was dried in an oven the carbonization takes place at 600 c for 1 h with a heating rate of 20 c min then it was washed many times with excess distilled water until the filtrate reached nearly a ph of 7 and dried in an oven finally it was sieved with a sieve size range of 63 180 μm and stored in a plastic sample holder for later use copper nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o salt was used as a precursor for the preparation of copper oxide due to its high catalytic activity than other transition metals as reported by other researchers 12 5 wt cu ac was prepared by wet impregnation methods following the procedure reported by 13 14 after impregnation it was heated with a hot plate until the water was evaporated and further dried in an oven finally it was calcined at 350 c for 3 h to produce cuo ac catalyst the overall preparation procedure was shown in fig 2 1 2 3 characterization the point of zero charges pzc was determined by applying the method stated elsewhere 15 16 the expected functional group percent in whr ac cuo ac and ruc2 were determined using an ftir spectrometer ft ir 6600 the surface morphology of the whr ac and cuo ac were analyzed using sem inspect f50 the thermal stability of ac cuo ac and ruc2were investigated using tga beijing hct 1 the analysis was performed by using x ray 7000 diffractometer shimadzu corporation kyoto japan the amount of copper metal present in the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst using ashing method and analyzed by aas 280fsaa 2 3 1 preparation of synthetic dye solution the dye stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of powder dye in 1 l of distilled water to get 1000 mg l it was further diluted to 100 mg l and the ph value was adjusted with 0 1naoh hcl the maximum absorbance dye and the calibration curve were of the was determined 2 3 2 toxicity assessment first the filter paper was placed into 3 different petri dishes and then added 20 seeds were to each petri dish 3 ml of untreated treated and distilled water was added to each petri dish respectively then finally petri dishes were covered and kept at room temperature 25 c for 72 h the number of seeds germinated was counted and root length was measured to determine the germination index 2 3 3 batch adsorption experiment a simple batch adsorption experiment was performed to determine the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent or catalyst and the adsorption process was evaluated using the 2 most known isotherm models langmuir and freundlich isotherm models 17 it was conducted with 0 6 g of ac or cuo ac was weighted and poured in 250 ml of the conical flask which contained 100 ml of different concentrations of dye solution 10 50 100 150 200 mg l by maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 25 c and agitated with a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 120 min then it was filtered by filter paper and analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometer 18 19 2 3 4 experimental setup and description for cwao experiment the cwao process was carried out on a laboratory scale in a high pressure autoclave reactor shown schematically in fig 2 2 it has a volume of 2 l maximum operation temperature and pressures are 150 c and 6 bar the laboratory autoclave reactor consists of 3 operations charging mixing and discharging first the reactor head assembly was untightened and charged the prepared synthetic dye solution and fresh catalyst then closed and tightened well the electrical control panels were connected to the power source then turn on the entire display switch and open the nitrogen gas cylinder to check the leak turn on the heater switch and set the desired temperature and the reaction mixture was heated by supplying 1 5 bar nitrogen gas until the desired temperature is reached once the desired temperature is reached turn on an agitator switch and adjust the agitator at 400 rpm using a regulator then agitator cooling water was opened replace the nitrogen gas flow with oxygen gas flow and supply to the reactor at the required pressure amount which is quantified by the pressure indicator or pressure gauge then a sample was taken via sampling valve at the required time interval with the volume that does not affect the volume of the reaction mixture when the reaction is finished turn off the agitator and the heating system open the gas outlet valve turn on the reactor cooling system and cooled until room temperature finally the sample in the reactor is discharged and cleaned for another cycle thus all experiments were conducted based on experimental design moreover cwao experiments using activated carbon catalyst and in the presence of hydroxyl radical scavenger sodium bicarbonate and methanol was conducted and also wet air oxidation wao without catalyst and an adsorption experiment were conducted at different temperatures in the absence of oxygen 2 3 5 analysis of batch adsorption experiment the batch adsorption was evaluated under the percentage of dye removal adsorption capacity and adsorption isotherm models 2 3 5 1 adsorption efficiency and capacity the percentage of dye removal was determined using eq 2 1 2 1 dye removal c 0 c t c 0 100 the adsorption capacity qe was computed via eq 2 2 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e concentration of dye mg l at initial and at equilibrium volume of dye solution l and m mass of the adsorbent g 2 3 5 2 adsorption isotherm models the langmuir isotherm model can describe and quantify sorption on a set of distinct localized adsorption sites and has been used to describe the adsorption process 1 17 it is represented in linear form in eq 2 3 2 3 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k l q m where ce equilibrium concentration mg l qe the amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g kl langmuir constant and qm maximum adsorption capacity mg g the values of qm and kl are calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line plotting of ce qe versus ce the essential characteristics of a langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless separation factor or equilibrium parameter rl which is defined by eq 2 4 2 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the value of rl indicates the shape of the isotherm to be either unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the freundlich isotherm describes equilibrium on heterogeneous surfaces and hence does not assume monolayer capacity it is represented as in eq 2 5 2 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf adsorption capacity and 1 n adsorption intensity 1 n and kf are calculated from the slope and intercept of the freundlich plot it has been shown that 1 n value between 0 and 1 represents good adsorption a value n for 1 n below one indicates a normal langmuir isotherm while 1 n above one is indicative of cooperative adsorption 20 2 3 6 analysis of cwao experiment the performance of the cwao process was mainly evaluated through the percentage of dye decolorization and cod conversion at selected reaction conditions that the maximum percentage of decolorization was recorded in addition to this its degradation is predicted by scanning using uv visible spectrophotometer before and after cwao 2 3 6 1 determination of the percentage of dye decolonization the percentage of dye decolonization calculated by using eq 2 6 2 6 decolorization c 0 a t c 0 100 where c0 ct initial and final concentration of dye at t 0 and t t respectively 2 3 6 2 conversion of cod the amount of cod before and after cwao were determined recently developed method using palintest tube test cod 400 using the photometric method the percentage of cod conversion was calculated using eq 2 7 2 7 cod conversion cod i cod f cod i 100 where cod i codf initial and final chemical oxygen demand mg o2 l respectively 2 3 7 toxicity assessment the toxicity of the treated dye solution was evaluated using a phytotoxicity test on lepidium sativum seed by applying the method used by previous researchers 21 24 it has a property of small high growth rates and vegetative propagation due to its capacity to grow in a wide range of ph values 23 2 8 rsg nsgds nsgc 100 2 9 rrg mrlgds mrlgc 100 2 10 gi rsg rrg 100 where rsg and relative root growth rrg relative seed germination and root growth respectively nsgds and nsgc numbers of seeds germinated in dye solution before and after treatment and control distilled water respectively mrlgds and mrlgc mean root length growing in dye solution before and after treatment and control distilled water respectively gi growth index 2 4 experimental design and operating conditions in this study full factorial experimental design was used to determine the experimental runs for cwao experiments three factors with 3 levels such as catalyst dose 2 4 and 6 g l reaction temperature 70 95 and 120 c and oxygen partial pressure 1 2 and 3 bar with a reaction time of 10 30 60 90 and 120 min were done in duplicate the initial dye concentration of 100 mg l was selected in the current study because most of the time the dye concentration is present in textile wastewater effluents in the range of 10 to 200 mg l as stated by previous researchers 10 25 the catalyst dose and the reaction temperature range were also selected from the previous studies on the cwao of orange 2 mono azo dye by 8 the oxygen partial pressure from the previous study 26 and also considering the reactor maximum operating condition the stirring speed of the agitator was set at 400 rpm for the safe operation of the reactor table 2 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ac and cuo ac catalyst 3 1 1 point of zero charges phpzc the phpzc value for ac and cuo ac were 5 227 and 6 413 respectively as shown in fig 3 1 the value of phpzc for cuo ac is greater than ac due to the effect of copper oxide which has a basic character a similar result was reported by 15 during their study on copper loaded on the activated carbon the surface of the catalyst is positively and negatively charged below and above their phpzc value respectively 3 1 2 ftir analysis the result of the ftir analysis for whrp ac cuo ac and ruc2 are shown in fig 3 2 in all samples the peak is around 3400 cm 1 which indicates the existence of the oh group and also the peak around 2380 cm 1 assigned for cc 27 in raw whr shown in fig 3 2 a the peak at 2932 cm 1 indicates the existence of ch vibrations in methyl and methylene group 1648 assigned for alkenyl cc stretch at 1420and 1276 cm 1 for vinyl and vinylidene ch in pane bends respectively at 1044 primary alcohol co stretch the last peak at 540 cm 1 aliphatic iodo compounds ci stretch has been assigned by other researchers 28 31 as shown in fig 3 2 b the peaks in prepared activated carbon at 1604 cm 1 indicated carboxylate around 1100 cm 1 phosphate ion and 732 and 516 for are assigned to aromatic structures or p c phosphorus containing compounds 30 the peaks at 2932 1420 and 1276 cm 1 in whr are disappeared due to the decomposition of the functional group present in oxygenated hydrocarbons referring to the carbohydrate structure of cellulose and hemicellulose by phosphoric acid this result has been confirmed by a previous study 31 the copper oxide loaded activated carbon has 2 unique peaks that appeared in the activated carbon at 532 and 493 cm 1 indicating the existence of copper oxide cuo as shown in fig 3 2 c which is a similar conclusion from previously reported by 13 29 in twice reused copper oxide catalysts have similar peaks as shown in fig 3 2 d generally the existence of those main functional groups such as oh co cc and co is responsible for the adsorption of copper metal and dye 3 1 3 sem analysis the micrograph with different magnification ranges 3041 5578 from sem analysis for whr ac and cuo ac was shown in fig 3 3 a b and c respectively as the micrograph shows the surface of raw whr has some irregular structures with flat cavities due to the presence of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin without any cracks 31 while the surface of ac and cuo ac showed the existence of several irregular structures with deep cavities and spongy structure especially observed on the surface of ac due to the removal of volatile matter by carbonization and by the activating agent 31 32 generally the presence of a heterogenous surface is favorable to the adsorption of copper or dye 3 1 4 tga dta analysis the thermal stability of ac cuo ac and ruc2 catalyst was investigated with the temperature range of 30 900 c and at a heating rate of 20 c min as shown in fig 3 4 weight losses occurred in 3 stages at the first stage temperature ranges 53 137 c 45 109 c and 59 174 c the percentage of weight loss for ac cuo ac and ruc2 were 6 43 4 17 and 7 246 respectively this is due to the removal of moisture from the surface that may be adsorbed during storage time 33 at the second stage temperature ranges 137 480 c 109 480 c and 174 396 c the percentage of weight loss for ac cuo ac and ruc2 were 9 5 and 4 4 respectively at the last stage temperature ranges 480 600 c 480 590 c and 396 585 c the percentage of weight loss of ac cuo ac and ruc2 were 20 13 and 29 respectively dta also showed the existence of the exothermic peak at a temperature of 558 534 and 449 c for ac cuo ac and ruc2 respectively this exothermic peak indicates the oxidation of catalysts as stated by 13 generally the second and the last stage of weight loss is due to the decomposition of surface groups that are formed during activation like carboxylic acids carboxylic anhydrides and lactones which are less thermally stable decompose with the liberating of carbon dioxide in the temperature range 300 400 c and also while it is the decomposition of other surface groups like phenol ethers takes place at higher temperatures above 400 c 33 after heating temperatures of 600 590and 585 c the tga analysis shows insignificant weight loss for ac cuo ac and ruc2 respectively the cuo ac shows higher thermal stability than the ac therefore the cuo ac catalyst is used in the cwao process without significant weight loss up to 480 c 3 1 5 xrd analysis the xrd peaks for both ac and cuo ac have followed a similar pattern as shown in fig 3 5 the appearance displays in the form of a wide angle range 2 θ 20 30 with the presence of sharp peaks the sharp peaks indicate the presence of crystalline structure due to the formation of graphite type of carbon 34 35 the existence of this broad peak has been reported by different researchers on the preparation of activated carbon from different precursors 27 32 36 37 the strongest sharp peaks were observed at 24 047 26 5854 and 23 33 in both ac and cuo ac generally the prepared ac and cuo ac catalysts are dominated by an amorphous nature this amorphous nature show the catalyst has a better surface area high exposed sites resulting in better catalytic activity 3 2 calibration curve for rr2 dye the maximum wavelength of the dye was investigated by uv scan of 100 mg l of dye solution which is 541 15 nm as shown in fig 3 6 a which is an agreement with the literature value of 538 nm reported elsewhere 10 25 the standard curve was prepared from known concentration ranges 0 01 100 mg l thus the developed linear equation was used for estimation of the dye concentration with a correlation coefficient r2 0 998 as shown in fig 3 6 b 3 3 adsorption efficiency capacity and isotherms to know the adsorption capacity of the prepared catalyst adsorption experiment was conducted using a catalyst as an adsorbent the percentage of dye removal and adsorption capacity for ac and cuo ac adsorbent or catalyst were investigated as it can be seen in fig 3 7 the percentage of dye removal was decreased as the dye concentration increased for both ac and cuo ac adsorbent while the adsorption capacity was increased as the dye concentration increased the percentage of dye removal by using ac and cuo ac as adsorbents was 63 and 52 respectively for the initial dye concentration of 100 mg l at the operating condition 6 g l of adsorbent dose at ph of 3 at room temperature with a contact time of 120 min the adsorption capacity of ac and cuo ac adsorbent was 10 467 and 8 735 mg g respectively the adsorption experimental result was evaluated through langmuir and freundlich isotherms models the results were well fitted with the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 9965 than the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 882 in the case of ac as adsorbent which is shown in fig 3 8 and similarly langmuir isotherm model r2 0 9931 was best fitted than the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 991 for the cuo ac adsorbent as shown in the fig 3 9 and table 3 1 the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity for ac and cuo ac were 11 68 and 11 12 mg g respectively 3 4 effect of operating parameters on dye decolorization and cod conversion the effect of operating parameters such as catalyst dose reaction temperature and oxygen partial pressure as a function of reaction time was studied on the percentage of dye decolorization and cod conversion the effect of ph on the percentage of dye decolorization and cod removal was presented in fig 3 10 over 99 99 and 96 64 dye decolorization were achieved at 120 min for ph values of 3 and 9 respectively similarly the conversion of cod is affected by ph value as shown in fig 3 11 as the ph value increased from 3 to 9 the conversion of cod was decreased from 88 57 to 54 28 it was observed that the initial ph of the dye solution decreased after treatment oxidation which was around 1 98 due to the formation of low molecular acids like carboxylic acids and other intermediate products during cwao in agreement with the work of 14 38 39 the effect of ph on the dye removal efficiency is related to the surface charge of the catalyst and the dye solution the dye is anionic which means negatively charged the phpzc of the catalyst was 6 414 as determined previously which indicates positively charged under this value and negatively charged above this value so when the initial dye solution at a low ph value will increase the positive charge of the catalyst surface which increases the adsorption of anionic dye also similar result reported on the study of catalytic wet peroxidation of reactive red 2 dye by fe ac as a catalyst by 10 13 during the study of cwao of nitrobenzene on copper loaded activated carbon catalyst 3 4 1 effect of catalyst dose the influence of catalyst dose on the percentage of dye decolorization and conversion of cod was investigated with a range of catalyst doses 2 6 g l as shown in fig 3 12 the percentage decolorization is found to be 93 056 95 598 and 99 99 for 2 4and 6 g l of catalyst dose respectively at a reaction time of 120 min the conversion of cod was 62 85 76 7 and 88 57 for 2 4and 6 g l of catalyst dose respectively as shown in fig 3 13 as the result showed both percentages decolorization and cod conversion increased as catalyst dose increased due to the presence of a more active site on the catalyst surface for adsorption of the dye which enhanced oxidation reaction a similar result was reported previously on cwao of pharmaceutical sludge using cu ce catalyst by 40 wao experiment was conducted at a temperature of 120 c and oxygen partial pressure of 3 bar within 120 min of reaction time and also cwao experiment was performed in the presence of ac and the result is presented in fig 3 14 the percentage of decolorization 33 76 and cod removal 7 62 was achieved by the wao process the removal was very low compared to the cwao process this indicates the effect of the catalyst the percentage of decolorization 94 89 and conversion of cod 60 95 were achieved by the cwao using ac as a catalyst it is revealed that conversion of cod in ac catalyzed cwao compared to cuo ac catalyzed this is a good indication of the presence of copper oxide catalyst on the support of activated carbon which enhances the cwao of the dye 3 4 2 effect of reaction temperature the studied reaction temperature was in the range of 70 to 120 c as shown in fig 3 15 the percentage of decolorization 77 52 92 6 and 99 99 was obtained for the reaction temperatures 70 95 and 120 c within 120 min of reaction time the conversion of cod is highly influenced by the reaction temperature as shown in fig 3 16 the cod conversion was 32 73 14 and 87 57 with a temperature of 70 95 and 120 c respectively that the reaction rate constant is increased as the reaction temperature increase a similar result was reported during the degradation of oxalic acid 41 at a reaction temperature of 120 c the percentage of decolorization reaches a maximum within 60 min and no more change was observed after this time this is due to the solubility of oxygen decreasing up to 100 c while increasing above 100 c as reported elsewhere 40 42 3 4 3 effect of oxygen partial pressure the effect of oxygen partial pressure on dye removal was studied in the range 1 3 bar the decolorization of dye at 120 min of reaction time 95 31 97 576 and 99 99 was achieved with 1 2 and 3 bar of oxygen partial pressure respectively as shown in fig 3 17 the conversion of cod was 78 09 81 90and 88 57 which is shown in fig 3 18 the result showed the removal efficacy of rr2 dye is increased as the amount of oxygen concentration increased similar results have been reported by other researchers studied on the removal of the pharmaceutical sludge by cwao process using a homogenous catalyst cu ce and fe3 catalyst 39 40 and also cwao of paper and mill wastewater by using platinum loaded activated carbon catalyst 38 541 25 nm while no peak existed after treatment oxidation this is due to the degradation of the azo dye a similar result was reported on the cwao of the methyl orange dye 8 if the oxygen amount increased it would increase its existence in the liquid phase which accelerates the oxidation of dye either directly or indirectly by forming another strong oxidative species hydroxyl oh and perhydroxyl radical ho2 as reported by 6 43 the percentage of dye decolorization was increased as the catalyst dose reaction temperature and oxygen partial pressure with time the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the decolorization and cod conversion followed by catalyst dose and oxygen partial pressure the nearly complete dye decolorization 100 and 88 57 of cod conversion were achieved at the maximum value of these operating parameters the previous studies on the removal of this azo dye using different advanced oxidation processes and operating conditions were reviewed those 91 6 decolorization and 47 5 cod conversion were achieved by catalytic wet peroxidation process 10 tio2 nano sized catalyst 98 decolorization and 56 cod conversion by photocatalysis 25 and above 98 decolorization and cod removal 9 here to understand the adsorption effect on dye removal an adsorption experiment was conducted at a temperature of 25 70 and 120 c with an autoclave reactor similar to the cwao experiment except for the absence of oxygen and the result is shown in fig 3 19 the maximum percentage of decolorization by adsorption process 47 887 63 59 and 88 11 was attained within 120 min of contact time for a temperature of 25 70 and 120 c respectively the decolorization increased with increasing temperature but not attained complete decolorization therefore complete decolorization of the dye is due to the cwao process the disappearance of the azo dye was also indicated by scanning the dye solution before and after treatment cwao using a uv vis spectrometer as shown in fig 3 20 the maximum peak existed in untreated dye at the wavelength of around 541 nm while after treatment there is no peak so it indicates its disappearance 3 5 effect free radical scavenger on the percentage of dye decolorization the effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger on the cwao of rr2 mono azo dye was studied using sodium bicarbonate as reported by 44 46 as shown in fig 3 21 at 120 min the percentage of decolorization 42 91 and 59 21 was obtained in the presence of nahco3 and ch3oh scavenger respectively the percentage of decolorization obtained in the presence of nahco3 is low indicating sodium bicarbonate has high scavenging activity than methanol under the same operating condition also supported by previous studies on cwao phenol in the presence of sodium bicarbonate and methanol as a radical scavenger by 47 in general the rate of cwao of the azo dye was inhibited in the presence of radical scavengers it indicates that cwao of azo dye was via free radical mechanism as discussed by previous researchers on azo dye removal by copper catalyze oxidation process 48 the reaction between bicarbonate and hydroxyl radical was reported by 45 49 as shown in eq 3 1 3 1 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o to compare the current result from previously studied on the removal of reactive red to dye by different advanced oxidation process were reviewed and presented in table 3 2 below 3 6 catalyst reusability and leaching test the reusability of the catalyst was evaluated by using catalyst reuse as shown in fig 3 22 the percentage of dye decolorization at 120 min for ruc1 and ruc2 was 97 94 and 92 respectively the performance of the catalyst was decreased as reused for the first time to the second time this indicates the catalytic activity of activated carbon supported copper oxide catalyst was lost maybe due to the leaching of copper the amount of copper present in the fresh catalyst used catalyst and reused catalyst first time was 56 515 39 845 and 37 498 mg l thus the amount of copper leached out from the first usage and the second usage is 16 67 and 19 017 mg l this is since the integrated effect of ph either the initial ph of the dye solution or acidic media developed during cwao and the reaction temperature also observed by other researchers 50 51 the amount of copper leached out within the treated dye solution was much greater than the allowed discharge limit reported by 52 3 7 toxicity assessment the phytotoxicity tests were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of the treated dye solution it was evaluated in terms of percent of rsg rrg and gi with comparison to growth in distilled water control as shown in fig 3 23 the growth of seed in the untreated and treated dye solution and in distilled water respectively the rsg rrg and gi for untreated were 84 41 38 and 34 85 respectively and for treated dye solution were 95 65 69 and 62 24 respectively the rsg rrg and gi values for treated dye were greater than the untreated dye solution thus the toxicity of treated dye solution less than that of the untreated yields better growth of lepidium sativum seed the previous studies 21 24 53 characterize the degree of toxicity based on the value of gi if gi above 80 indicates no phytotoxic substance between 50 80 moderate and below 50 presence of a strong phytotoxic substance thus based on this criteria the untreated dye was 34 85 which is less than 50 implies it is phytotoxic substance and treated dye solution was 62 69 which is between the range of 50 80 moderate phytotoxic substance was present this is due to the formation of other toxic products during the oxidation process of dye solution 4 conclusion cwao of reactive red 2 dye using whr derived activated carbon supported copper oxide catalyst shows remarkable results from a simple batch adsorption study langmuir adsorption isotherm is fitted well than the freundlich with maximum theoretical adsorption capacity for ac and cuo ac is 11 68 and 11 12 mg g respectively nearly 100 decolorization and over 88 57 cod conversion mineralization were achieved at maximum operating condition 6 g l of catalyst dose 120 c of reaction temperature and 3 bar of oxygen partial pressure of with the reaction time of 120 min reused catalysts until the second time showed similar performance with fresh catalysts but leaching copper was observed and increased with re usage from the first and second usage of the catalyst the amount of copper leached out was 16 67 to 19 017 mg l respectively which exceeds from allowed discharging limit the treated dye solution shows low toxicity compared to the untreated one based on the percentage of gi of lepidium sativum seed thus 62 2 and 34 80 respectively generally it was observed that the cwao process seems a potential candidate for decolorization and mineralization of the azo dye nevertheless further study is required to evaluate the complex interplay of mass and heat transfer in heterogeneous cwao

12899,phenol as the representative recalcitrant aromatic organic compounds aocs in wastewater has been listed as the priority pollutant due to its toxicity to organisms and ecosystem therefore the exploration of efficient and practical technology for phenol elimination from wastewater has become an important research topic peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation processes pms based aops have been developed to be an efficient phenol degrading strategy thereinto the development of high performance and cost effective catalyst is the crux of degrading pollutants in pms based aops in this study the ubiquitous ginkgo deciduous resource is expected to convert into low cost heteroatoms self doped biochar to activate pms for the removal of phenol the removal rate of phenol 10 mg l achieved 90 within 60 min in ph of 6 by using 1 0 mmol l of pms and 0 5 g l of catalyst the phenol degradation in the catalytic process was accomplished via oh so4 1o2 and electron transfer on the basis of the correlation analysis oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups were considered as the active sites that may be the most relevant to removal efficiency this study proposed a facile method for converting deciduous waste resource into catalyst for triggering efficient catalytic oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aromatic organic compounds phenol peroxymonosulfate biochar catalytic degradation 1 introduction with the continuous progress of society the aromatic compounds aocs as the synthetic intermediate and organic solvent are widely used in various industries including plastics industry resin industry pharmaceutical products papermaking etc 1 aocs can produce high toxicity and persistence through continuous accumulation in the environment and thus have a detrimental impact on the ecological environment 2 moreover it has low biodegradability due to the presence of the benzene ring in aocs and thus can hardly be removed by natural methods 3 4 among the all types of aocs phenol is regarded as a representative aromatic organic pollutant in wastewater treatment which has been promulgated as the priority pollutant by the us environmental protection agency us epa 5 however as similar to other aocs phenol is persistent and is difficult to reduce to a safe level in the aquatic environment therefore various advanced degradation technologies of wastewater e g membrane adsorption uv irradiation and advanced oxidation process aop have been developed for the elimination of organic pollutants 6 8 of these advanced technologies aop has been one of the most promising approaches for treating organic wastewater owing to the generation of the highly active radicals 9 in particular the novel strategy of persulfate based aop can produce sulfate radicals so4 with a longer lifespan 30 40 μs and higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v than the hydroxyl radicals oh less than 1 μs 1 8 2 7 v by the conventional aop 10 nevertheless persulfate can hardly degrade pollutants in the absence of activation due to the stable property 11 so the production of free radicals mainly relies on the catalytic efficiency of catalysts and therefore the development of efficient catalysts is the key to so4 based aop 12 at the early stage transition metals and its oxides were the research hotspots for persulfate activation whereas the detrimental drawbacks of metal based catalysts are scarcity and inevitable metal leaching which can cause the secondary pollution and hinder their practical application 13 14 as the typical metal free materials carbocatalysts are proposed as an alternative for activating persulfate in pioneering studies as they can avoid the inherent risks of metal catalysts and have the merits of large surface areas adjustable element composition and versatile preparation methods 15 in particular heteroatom modification is a promising strategy to directly improve the catalytic performance of carbon catalysts by doping heteroatoms in carbon materials the original carbon network of carbocatalysts can be activated resulting in the formation of abundant active sites because the charge density and spin density around neighboring carbon atoms are redistributed 16 17 in the previous studies graphene oxides gos by n dopant exhibited a higher catalytic activity to persulfate for pollutant degradation than the pristine go 18 cui et al demonstrated that carbon materials such as oxidized cnts with abundant oxygen functional groups by surface oxidation can improve both activity and selectivity 19 furthermore the synergies effect that facilitates persulfate decomposition appeared in the catalytic process of n s co doped ordered mesoporous carbon 16 however the lack of low cost starting materials for these carbon active materials largely restricts their practical application 20 among these carbon materials biochar prepared from biomass containing various heteroatoms have attracted extensive attention due to the simple preparation method low cost raw materials and the ubiquitous starting materials on earth 13 17 recently heteroatoms doped biochar prepared by different methods was used as catalyst to activate persulfate for degrading pollutants wan et al prepared a nitrogen doped biochar to activate persulfate and the removal efficiency of nitrogen doped biochar was higher than that of pristine biochar 21 ma et al reported that n s doped porous biochar possessed a high surface areas and abundant n s content and had an excellent removal efficiency toward bpa in 60 min 17 large amounts of fallen leaves throughout the years in the urban make the safe disposal and utilization of leaves as an issue 22 as an easily accessible feedstock leaves contain different kinds of heteroatoms and thereby providing a desirable pathway to obtain self doped heteroatoms biomass carbon through simple synthetic methods without additional agents moreover such utilization of deciduous resource can avoid the traditional treatment incineration landfill etc which usually leads to the severe environmental pollution 23 herein ginkgo leaves were collected to prepare into heteroatoms self doped biochar via pyrolysis process to activate peroxymonosulfate pms the comparative studies were conducted among the biochar pms system biochar alone and pms alone the catalytic performance was investigated under different various factors in this study ph of solution the dosage of pms and catalyst and the impact of inorganic anions additionally the properties on the surface of carbon materials were changed by altering the pyrolysis temperature to conduct correlation analysis for the investigation of active sites and the oxidation mechanism was estimated by various methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials phenol methanol meoh 99 9 and furfuryl alcohol ffa were purchased from tianjin damao chemical reagent factory tert butyl alcohol tba

from aladdin industrial corporation ginkgo leaves were collected from dalian maritime university china 2 2 preparation method and characterization of biochar the ginkgo leaf gk was collected in the autumn and washed with deionized water after dried in an oven the gk was pulverized into powder and the powder was placed in a homemade pyrolysis reactor at 100 c for 8 10 min under n2 atmosphere subsequently it was heated to 550 c at 45 c min in pyrolysis reactor the obtained samples were ground and carbonized at 550 700 850 and 1000 c in the tube furnace for 1 h heat rate 5 c min under n2 atmosphere to obtain biochar gk bc gk bc 550 gk bc 700 gk bc 850 and gk bc 1000 the scanning electron microscopy sem were applied to observe the surface morphology of biochar x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to analyze the elemental component of biochar surface the brunauer emmett teller specific surface area and pore structure were monitored by asap 2460 the raman spectra were obtained from labram hr evolution with a green laser at 532 nm the thermogravimetric tga was acquired to analyze the pyrolysis process 2 3 catalytic degradation process the adsorption experiments and catalytic oxidation experiments were carried out in the mix solution containing 50 ml of phenol 10 mg l on magnetic stirrers with 750 rpm at room temperature in addition the different dosages of pulverized biochar 0 4 g l 0 5 g l 0 6 g l and pms 0 5 mmol l 1 0 mmol l 1 5 mmol l were added to the initial solution as the catalyst and oxidant the initial ph value of solution was 6 which was regulated to 2 4 6 and 8 with naoh and h2so4 afterwards 0 2 ml of samples withdrawn from the mix reaction solution and injected into a vial containing 0 2 ml methanol as a quencher then the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane at certain intervals and then analyzed the concentration of phenol by high performance liquid chromatograph hplc ex1600 with test conditions the mobile phase of deionized water methanol 40 60 the flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and the detection wavelength was 270 nm furthermore the influence of inorganic anions cl with various concentrations were evaluated in quenching experiments the scavengers of meoh tba and ffa were added into initial solution to quench radicals the used biochar was collected and washed with ethanol several times after dried at 50 c for 5 h the biochar was reused for the next cycle pseudo first order kinetic model was employed to estimate the degradation kinetics of phenol and the kinetic model was based on the data obtained in initial 15 min ln c t c 0 k obs t where c0 and ct represent the initial concentration of phenol in the solution and the concentration of phenol at time t k obs is the rate constant 2 4 electrochemical analysis tests to identify the presence of non radical pathways in the degradation process the open circuit potential ocp tests were measured the experiments were conducted in 0 05 m na2so4 solution with a three electrodes configuration including a working electrode the glassy carbon electrode was coated by the gk bc 850 gce bc a counter electrode platinum electrode and a reference electrode saturated silver chloride electrode pms was added into the solution to monitor the changed potential of the gce bc after a certain time the phenol was added into solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the sem image of ginkgo leaf based biochar gk bc 850 was shown in fig 1a b c and d it can be observed that many irregular depressions and cracks appeared on the surface of the gk bc 850 the element distribution was then examined in fig 1e four main components of c n o s were revealed as can be seen in fig 1f a significant mass loss occurred before 100 c which can be ascribed to the decomposition of adsorbed water and small molecules subsequently the pyrolysis of cellulose in the leaves leaded to a rapid mass loss and the formation of a carbon skeleton to form biochar 24 fig 1g showed the nitrogen adsorption desorption curve and exhibited the iv types and h3 hysteresis loop indicating the existence of slit pore structure and not evenly distributed 25 moreover the pore distribution fig 1h of gk bc 850 showed the predominance of micropores and mesopores and gk bc 850 presented a bet surface area table s1 of 11 66 m2 g the raman spectrum fig 1i of gk bc 850 can observed the characteristic d defect band 1355 cm 1 and g graphitic band 1585 cm 1 and the ratio of d band to g band id ig was 1 32 indicating the existent of sp2 carbon and defect thereinto sp2 carbon in carbon materials generally acts as a platform for electron transfer for direct oxidative degradation of pollutants and the defect may be the one of the active sites of 1o2 6 the surface

biochar by tailoring the surface chemistry and physicochemical property 29 31 in addition the n 1s peak deconvolution fig 2d of gk bc displayed three peaks at 397 2 ev 399 1 ev and 400 5 ev were assigned to pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n 32 the nitrogen functional groups have been proven to be one of the most common dopants which can improve the anion exchange activity and even catalytic capability of the carbocatalysts 33 34 base on the above investigation it can confirm that biochar contained a variety of heteroatoms and was conducive to catalyze pms for phenol degradation 3 2 catalytic performance of ginkgo leaf based biochar in order to confirm that the biochar can improve the removal efficiency by catalyzing pms the performances of pms and biochar on phenol removal alone were also evaluated as control as depicted in the fig 3a the removal rate of phenol was merely 10 by biochar alone which was due to the adsorption of biochar on the other hand pms alone had no obvious effect on phenol removal demonstrating pms cannot direct oxidize the phenol without external activations after the coexist of pms and biochar an outstanding phenol removal efficiency was observed 90 which was significantly higher than the cases of sole biochar and sole pms in the biochar pms system biochar as a catalyst can effectively activate pms oxidant in the solution to generate highly active radicals to further improving the removal of phenol fig 3b revealed the effect of the pms dosage in the biochar pms system for the phenol degradation it can be found that the removal efficiency of phenol increased from 40 to 90 with the increase of pms dosage from 0 5 mmol l to 1 0 mmol l nevertheless when the pms dosage grew to 1 5 mmol l continuously the removal efficiency decreased to 80 this was because the active sites in the biochar were fully exploited to generate more radicals for the efficient degradation of phenol with the increasing pms dosage however when the dosage of pms increased to a certain amount the active sites on the surface of biochar were not sufficient to activate excessive amounts of pms moreover the excess hso5 can induce self scavenging reactions which can exert a negative effect on phenol degradation 35 therefore 1 0 mmol l was chosen as the appropriate dosage the catalyst quantity was an important factor in the generation of radicals and therefore the effect of biochar quantity for phenol degradation was demonstrated in the fig 3c with biochar quantity increasing from 0 4 g l to 0 5 g l the degradation rate was improved from 70 to 90 however further increasing biochar quantity to 0 6 g l the degradation efficiency only exhibited a negligible improvement these phenomena were attributed to an increasing number of active sites resulting from the increment of catalyst which can increase exposure to contaminant molecules and pms 36 therefore the pms can be activated by the sufficient active sites to produce more radicals and cause the improvement of the removal efficiency however since the amount of pms was fixed the ever increasing biochar quantity only produced a marginal effect in degradation efficiency therefore considering the utilization rate of biochar 0 5 g l was chosen as the optimal biochar quantity the ph of solution was a vital influence factor affecting the formation of radicals which may further affect the removal efficiency and therefore the effect of the different ph was investigated as depicted in fig 3d the degradation efficiency kept about 90 as the decreasing ph from 8 to 6 while the removal efficiency dropped dramatically to 40 under ph 4 however when the ph decreased to 2 the removal rate of phenol was significantly increased by 30 compared with that of ph 4 previous studies showed that base and phenolic oxides can simultaneously activate pms in the high alkaline solution 31 37 therefore the ph range was controlled below ph 9 to eliminate the influence of base condition moreover since the efficiency under ph 8 was only slightly higher than that under neutral condition ph 6 was chosen as the optimal experimental condition in practical application various inorganic anions in wastewater may react with the generated reactive species hindering the removal of target pollutants 38 therefore different concentrations of cl hco3 po4 3 were used as typical inorganic anions to investigate the effect of inorganic anions on the degradation of phenol in biochar pms system as depicted in fig 3e the removal efficiency decreased from 90 to 83 79 72 with the presence of 10 mm cl hco3 and po4 3 respectively when the concentration of cl hco3 and po4 3 increased to 20 mm the removal efficiency decreased to 75 66 and 65 respectively the inhibition effects of cl were attributed to the reaction between these anions and free radicals with the addition of cl so4 and oh were consumed rapidly to form weak reactive chlorine containing species such as cl2 and cloh eqs 1 4 39 moreover hco3 and po4 3 can also react with radicals to form hco3 co3 and po4 with lower redox potential eqs 5 8 40 41 therefore the phenol removal efficiency gradually decreased with the added of inorganic anions and the above results can further prove the generation of radicals so4 and oh but radicals did not play a dominant role in catalytic degradation process furthermore the reusability of gk bc 850 was estimated in fig 3f the removal efficiency of phenol remained at almost 50 in the fifth cycle which still more effective than the sole biochar system or sole pms system and therefore the above result can also exhibit the prominent efficiency of biochar pms system to degrade phenol moreover the factors of catalyst deactivation were analyzed by xps analysis and raman after catalytic degradation process the content of oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups decreased significantly fig s5d thereinto the content of co dropped dramatically from 19 at to 2 58 at indicating the co was involved in the catalytic degradation reactions fig s6d correspondingly an increase occurred to c oh from 2 59 at to 8 44 at which can be ascribed that the pollutants reacted with oh to generate intermediate on the catalyst 42 moreover the increased c oh may not improve the catalytic performance of biochar 43 leading to the deactivation of the catalyst the content of oxidized s reduced significantly fig s6h implying the oxidized s may affect the catalytic performance of catalyst previous study also demonstrated that the doped oxidized s can enhance the catalytic activity by regulating the electronic structure 44 and therefore reduced oxidized s will have a negative effect on catalytic degradation moreover raman results fig s2d showed the defect degree had a decline after catalytic degradation process indicating defect may have a contribution to catalytic process 1 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl 2 oh cl cloh 3 cloh h cl h 2 o 4 cl cl cl 2 5 hco 3 so 4 hco 3 so 4 2 6 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o 7 so 4 po 4 3 so 4 2 po 4 8 oh po 4 3 oh po 4 3 3 active sites and activation mechanism the surface of heteroatoms doped carbon materials contained a variety of functional groups which can play different roles in the catalytic process 45 therefore it was particularly important to identify the functional groups that played the most active effect in the catalytic process to explore the origin of catalytic degradation mechanism previous studies have shown that the change of pyrolysis temperature can lead to the variation of surface characteristics 46 47 therefore the main active sites can be explored by the characterization of surface of biochar under different pyrolysis temperatures as shown in fig 4a with the pyrolysis temperature increased from 550 c to 850 c the removal efficiency increased from 16 to 90 and the corresponding k obs fig s1 of 550 c 700 c and 850 c were 0 005 0 043 and 0 155 min 1 respectively when the pyrolysis temperature further rose to 1000 c the phenol removal efficiency decreased to 70 and the k obs was 0 018 min 1 based on the analysis of xps results tables s3 s4 and s5 it was worth noting that the content of o and s elements in the corresponding biochar also increased with the improvement of removal efficiency in order to prove the role of functional groups on the surface of biochar it was necessary to conduct correlation analysis between k obs and functional groups a good linear fitting relationship was obtained between the total oxygen content and k obs fig 5a indicating that oxygen functional groups were closely related to catalytic performance of biochar as demonstrated in fig 5b c and d the co showed a positive linear relationship and had the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 98 compared with other oxygen functional groups o c o or c oh it implied that excessive co may have contribution to the removal of phenol in the biochar pms system in addition to oxygen functional groups nitrogen and sulfur atoms have been also successfully doped into biochar however as shown in fig 6 not only the total nitrogen content but also the different types of nitrogen functional groups were all poorly correlated with k obs suggesting that nitrogen doping was not the main factor for biochar s catalytic activity in this study as depicted in fig 7a b c d and e the sulfur content had a positive linear relationship with phenol degradation especially oxidized s r2 0 99 indicating the important role of sulfur functional groups on phenol degradation in the biochar pms system according to the raman spectra of biochar under different pyrolysis temperatures the value of id ig was conducted correlation analysis with k obs as shown in fig s2 and fig 1i the corresponding value of id ig of 550 c 700 c 850 c and 1000 c were 0 94 1 17 1 32 and 1 15 moreover the correlation coefficient between k obs and the value of id ig was 0 59 fig 7f indicating the defects may not the main factor of catalytic degradation of phenol compared with oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups in addition to the determination of active sites the reactive oxygen species were also the important parts of the catalytic degradation process according to relevant reports the radicals so4 oh and non radicals 1o2 electron transfer pathway can be produced by activating pms on the surface of carbon materials to further clarify the contribution of reactive oxygen species in the biochar pms system the chemical quenching test and the electrochemical experiment were carried out to determine the main active substance in the quenching experiments excessive amounts 100 fold of initial pms dosage of meoh tba and ffa were introduced into solution for quenching so4 oh and 1o2 completely in the presence of tba and meoh the phenol removal efficiency decreased to 80 and 67 while the removal rate was significantly suppressed to 35 with the addition of excessive ffa fig 4b the above results demonstrated the generation of the oh and so4 if any were not the dominant reactive species and the effect on the removal efficiency of phenol was very limited what s more due to the sharp decrease of removal efficiency in the solution with ffa which can be deduced that the non radical pathway 1o2 played an important role in the phenol oxidation process to further identify the ros the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were conducted and shown in fig 4d and e the dmpo oh and dmpo so4 was observed in the reaction process demonstrating the present of oh and so4 a significant 1 1 1 triplet characteristic signal of temp 1o2 was clearly observed in the biochar pms system further proving the generation of 1o2 moreover due to the important role of 1o2 in the oxidation process the different removal rate at various ph environments may also relate to the generation of 1o2 and therefore the quenching experiments were conducted in the different conditions ph 2 ph 4 and ph 6 as can be seen in fig 4c the similar removal efficiency with the addition of ffa under the different ph ph 2 4 6 the inhibition by ffa was most significant in ph 6 indicating the important role of 1o2 in the oxidation process under ph 6 on the contrary the slight inhibition in the condition of ph 4 with the added of ffa suggesting the generation of 1o2 can be suppressed under the acidic condition which may account for the reduced removal efficiency in the acidic solution subsequently a significant inhibitory effect occurred in ph 2 compared with ph 4 with the addition of ffa indicating an increase in the amount of 1o2 being quenched which may be resulted by the increasing of 1o2 under the condition of ph 2 generally hydrogen bonds would be formed by the bond of h and the peroxy bonds o o of pms under acidic condition 48 consequently the interaction between biochar and pms can be suppressed to inhabit the production of 1o2 and therefore the removal efficiency under acidic condition was generally worse than that under neutral condition as previously reported electron rich phenolates can be degraded much faster by 1o2 under alkaline conditions than neutral conditions which may account for the slight increase in phenol degradation efficiency under alkaline conditions 49 apart from 1o2 directly electron transfer as a novel non radical pathway has also been monitored by the ocp it can be found fig 4f that the potential gradually elevated after the adding of pms while the potential was only slightly decreased with the addition of phenol fig 4g suggesting the electron transfer process if any may not be the crux of phenol degradation 50 by thinking over the above results the origin of the mechanism of the oxidation process in this study was proposed firstly pms could be readily adsorbed on the surface of oxygen sulfur nitrogen containing groups of carbon materials then the sulfur functional groups can lead an increase in the number of the positively charged carbon atoms and therefore cause the rupture of oo bonds to provoke the production of radicals oh and so4 in the pms adsorption and activation process 51 52 furthermore the adsorbed pms attacked the co on the biochar to form the adduct and then pms attacked the adduct to generate 1o2 for the degradation of phenol 53 and the present of defect can also contribute the generation of 1o2 54 in addition the sp2 carbon in biochar can serve as an electronic transfer platform for phenol electron donor and pms electron acceptor 55 it can be speculated that in the electron transfer process the intermediate was formulated on the surface of the biochar and triggered the oxidative degradation process by extracting the electrons in phenol which served as the electron donor base on the above discussion a possible mechanism was illustrated in the fig 8 which had the degradation pathways including the radicals oh and so4 and non radicals 1o2 electron transfer process 4 conclusion in this work ginkgo leaf as a waste resource was prepared into self doped biochar by pyrolysis process which could efficiently activate pms to degrade phenol furthermore the removal efficiency of biochar pms system was much higher than that of biochar alone and pms alone through the analysis of quenching experiments and open circuit potential ocp test showed that radical and non radical pathway were both aroused in phenol elimination while the contribution of non radicals 1o2 to phenol abatement was the dominant based on the results of linear fitting between functional groups defects and k obs of biochar at different pyrolysis temperatures it was proposed that oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups were the main account of the high catalytic degradation efficiency on phenol in summary this work provides a simple reuse strategy for leaf waste resource and a new opportunity for the design of metal free catalysts declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest

12899,phenol as the representative recalcitrant aromatic organic compounds aocs in wastewater has been listed as the priority pollutant due to its toxicity to organisms and ecosystem therefore the exploration of efficient and practical technology for phenol elimination from wastewater has become an important research topic peroxymonosulfate based advanced oxidation processes pms based aops have been developed to be an efficient phenol degrading strategy thereinto the development of high performance and cost effective catalyst is the crux of degrading pollutants in pms based aops in this study the ubiquitous ginkgo deciduous resource is expected to convert into low cost heteroatoms self doped biochar to activate pms for the removal of phenol the removal rate of phenol 10 mg l achieved 90 within 60 min in ph of 6 by using 1 0 mmol l of pms and 0 5 g l of catalyst the phenol degradation in the catalytic process was accomplished via oh so4 1o2 and electron transfer on the basis of the correlation analysis oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups were considered as the active sites that may be the most relevant to removal efficiency this study proposed a facile method for converting deciduous waste resource into catalyst for triggering efficient catalytic oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aromatic organic compounds phenol peroxymonosulfate biochar catalytic degradation 1 introduction with the continuous progress of society the aromatic compounds aocs as the synthetic intermediate and organic solvent are widely used in various industries including plastics industry resin industry pharmaceutical products papermaking etc 1 aocs can produce high toxicity and persistence through continuous accumulation in the environment and thus have a detrimental impact on the ecological environment 2 moreover it has low biodegradability due to the presence of the benzene ring in aocs and thus can hardly be removed by natural methods 3 4 among the all types of aocs phenol is regarded as a representative aromatic organic pollutant in wastewater treatment which has been promulgated as the priority pollutant by the us environmental protection agency us epa 5 however as similar to other aocs phenol is persistent and is difficult to reduce to a safe level in the aquatic environment therefore various advanced degradation technologies of wastewater e g membrane adsorption uv irradiation and advanced oxidation process aop have been developed for the elimination of organic pollutants 6 8 of these advanced technologies aop has been one of the most promising approaches for treating organic wastewater owing to the generation of the highly active radicals 9 in particular the novel strategy of persulfate based aop can produce sulfate radicals so4 with a longer lifespan 30 40 μs and higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v than the hydroxyl radicals oh less than 1 μs 1 8 2 7 v by the conventional aop 10 nevertheless persulfate can hardly degrade pollutants in the absence of activation due to the stable property 11 so the production of free radicals mainly relies on the catalytic efficiency of catalysts and therefore the development of efficient catalysts is the key to so4 based aop 12 at the early stage transition metals and its oxides were the research hotspots for persulfate activation whereas the detrimental drawbacks of metal based catalysts are scarcity and inevitable metal leaching which can cause the secondary pollution and hinder their practical application 13 14 as the typical metal free materials carbocatalysts are proposed as an alternative for activating persulfate in pioneering studies as they can avoid the inherent risks of metal catalysts and have the merits of large surface areas adjustable element composition and versatile preparation methods 15 in particular heteroatom modification is a promising strategy to directly improve the catalytic performance of carbon catalysts by doping heteroatoms in carbon materials the original carbon network of carbocatalysts can be activated resulting in the formation of abundant active sites because the charge density and spin density around neighboring carbon atoms are redistributed 16 17 in the previous studies graphene oxides gos by n dopant exhibited a higher catalytic activity to persulfate for pollutant degradation than the pristine go 18 cui et al demonstrated that carbon materials such as oxidized cnts with abundant oxygen functional groups by surface oxidation can improve both activity and selectivity 19 furthermore the synergies effect that facilitates persulfate decomposition appeared in the catalytic process of n s co doped ordered mesoporous carbon 16 however the lack of low cost starting materials for these carbon active materials largely restricts their practical application 20 among these carbon materials biochar prepared from biomass containing various heteroatoms have attracted extensive attention due to the simple preparation method low cost raw materials and the ubiquitous starting materials on earth 13 17 recently heteroatoms doped biochar prepared by different methods was used as catalyst to activate persulfate for degrading pollutants wan et al prepared a nitrogen doped biochar to activate persulfate and the removal efficiency of nitrogen doped biochar was higher than that of pristine biochar 21 ma et al reported that n s doped porous biochar possessed a high surface areas and abundant n s content and had an excellent removal efficiency toward bpa in 60 min 17 large amounts of fallen leaves throughout the years in the urban make the safe disposal and utilization of leaves as an issue 22 as an easily accessible feedstock leaves contain different kinds of heteroatoms and thereby providing a desirable pathway to obtain self doped heteroatoms biomass carbon through simple synthetic methods without additional agents moreover such utilization of deciduous resource can avoid the traditional treatment incineration landfill etc which usually leads to the severe environmental pollution 23 herein ginkgo leaves were collected to prepare into heteroatoms self doped biochar via pyrolysis process to activate peroxymonosulfate pms the comparative studies were conducted among the biochar pms system biochar alone and pms alone the catalytic performance was investigated under different various factors in this study ph of solution the dosage of pms and catalyst and the impact of inorganic anions additionally the properties on the surface of carbon materials were changed by altering the pyrolysis temperature to conduct correlation analysis for the investigation of active sites and the oxidation mechanism was

regulated to 2 4 6 and 8 with naoh and h2so4 afterwards 0 2 ml of samples withdrawn from the mix reaction solution and injected into a vial containing 0 2 ml methanol as a quencher then the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane at certain intervals and then analyzed the concentration of phenol by high performance liquid chromatograph hplc ex1600 with test conditions the mobile phase

quenching experiments the scavengers of meoh tba and ffa were added into initial solution to quench radicals the used biochar was collected and washed with ethanol several times after dried at 50 c for 5 h the biochar was reused for the next cycle pseudo first order kinetic model was employed to estimate the degradation kinetics of phenol and the kinetic model was based on the data obtained in

characterization the sem image of ginkgo leaf based biochar gk bc 850 was shown in fig 1a b c and d it can be observed that many irregular depressions and cracks appeared on the surface of the gk bc 850 the element distribution was then examined in fig 1e four main components of c n o s were revealed as can be seen in fig 1f a significant mass loss occurred before 100 c which can be ascribed to the decomposition of adsorbed water and small molecules subsequently the pyrolysis of cellulose in the leaves leaded to a rapid mass loss and the formation of a carbon skeleton to form biochar 24 fig

functional groups which can play different roles in the catalytic process 45 therefore it was particularly important to identify the functional groups that played the most active effect in the catalytic process to explore the origin of catalytic degradation mechanism previous studies have shown that the change of pyrolysis temperature can lead to the variation of surface characteristics 46 47 therefore the main active sites can be explored by the characterization of surface of biochar under different pyrolysis temperatures as shown in fig 4a with the pyrolysis temperature increased from 550 c to 850 c the removal efficiency increased from 16 to 90 and the corresponding k obs fig s1 of 550 c 700 c and 850 c were 0 005 0 043 and 0 155 min 1 respectively when the pyrolysis temperature further rose to 1000 c the phenol removal efficiency decreased to 70 and the k obs was 0 018 min 1 based on the analysis of xps results tables s3 s4 and s5 it was worth noting that the content of o and s elements in the corresponding biochar also increased with the improvement of removal efficiency in order to prove the role of functional groups on the surface of biochar it was necessary to conduct correlation analysis between k obs and functional groups a good linear fitting relationship was obtained between the total oxygen content and k obs fig 5a indicating that oxygen functional groups were closely related to catalytic performance of biochar as demonstrated in fig 5b c and d the co showed a positive linear relationship and had the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 98 compared with other oxygen functional groups o c o or c oh it implied that excessive co may have contribution to the removal of phenol in the biochar pms system in addition to oxygen functional groups nitrogen and sulfur atoms have been also successfully doped into biochar however as shown in fig 6 not only the total nitrogen content but also the different types of nitrogen functional groups were all poorly correlated with k obs suggesting that nitrogen doping was not the main factor for biochar s catalytic activity in this study as depicted in fig 7a b c d and e the sulfur content had a positive linear relationship with phenol degradation especially oxidized s r2 0 99 indicating the important role of sulfur functional groups on phenol degradation in the biochar pms system according to the raman spectra of biochar under different pyrolysis temperatures the value of id ig was conducted correlation analysis with k obs as shown in fig s2 and fig 1i the corresponding value of id ig of 550 c 700 c 850 c and 1000 c were 0 94 1 17 1 32 and 1 15 moreover the correlation coefficient between k obs and the value of id ig was 0 59 fig 7f indicating the defects may not the main factor of catalytic degradation of phenol compared with oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups in addition to the determination of active sites the reactive oxygen species were also the important parts of the catalytic degradation process according to relevant reports the radicals so4 oh and non radicals 1o2 electron transfer pathway can be produced by activating pms on the surface of carbon materials to further clarify the contribution of reactive oxygen species in the biochar pms system the chemical quenching test and the electrochemical experiment were carried out to determine the main active substance in the quenching experiments excessive amounts 100 fold of initial pms dosage of meoh tba and ffa were introduced into solution for quenching so4 oh and 1o2 completely in the presence of tba and meoh the phenol removal efficiency decreased to 80 and 67 while the removal rate was significantly suppressed to 35 with the addition of excessive ffa fig 4b the above results demonstrated the generation of the oh and so4 if any were not the dominant reactive species and the effect on the removal efficiency of phenol was very limited what s more due to the sharp decrease of removal efficiency in the solution with ffa which can be deduced that the non radical pathway 1o2 played an important role in the phenol oxidation process to further identify the ros the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were conducted and shown in fig 4d and e the dmpo oh and dmpo so4 was observed in the reaction process demonstrating the present of oh and so4 a significant 1 1 1 triplet characteristic signal of temp 1o2 was clearly observed in the biochar pms system further proving the generation of 1o2 moreover due to the important role of 1o2 in the oxidation process the different removal rate at various ph environments may also relate to the generation of 1o2 and therefore the quenching experiments were conducted in the different conditions ph 2 ph 4 and ph 6 as can be seen in fig 4c the similar removal efficiency with the addition of ffa under the different ph ph 2 4 6 the inhibition by ffa was most significant in ph 6 indicating the important role of 1o2 in the oxidation process under ph 6 on the contrary the slight inhibition in the condition of ph 4 with the added of ffa suggesting the generation of 1o2 can be suppressed under the acidic condition which may account for the reduced removal efficiency in the acidic solution subsequently a significant inhibitory effect occurred in ph 2 compared with ph 4 with the addition of ffa indicating an increase in the amount of 1o2 being quenched which may be resulted by the increasing of 1o2 under the condition of ph 2 generally hydrogen bonds would be formed by the bond of h and the peroxy bonds o o of pms under acidic condition 48 consequently the interaction between biochar and pms can be suppressed to inhabit the production of 1o2 and therefore the removal efficiency under acidic condition was generally worse than that under neutral condition as previously reported electron rich phenolates can be degraded much faster by 1o2 under alkaline conditions than neutral conditions which may account for the slight increase in phenol degradation efficiency under alkaline conditions 49 apart from 1o2 directly electron transfer as a novel non radical pathway has also been monitored by the ocp it can be found fig 4f that the potential gradually elevated after the adding of pms while the potential was only slightly decreased with the addition of phenol fig 4g suggesting the electron transfer process if any may not be the crux of phenol degradation 50 by thinking over the above results the origin of the mechanism of the oxidation process in this study was proposed firstly pms could be readily adsorbed on the surface of oxygen sulfur nitrogen containing groups of carbon materials then the sulfur functional groups can lead an increase in the number of the positively charged carbon atoms and therefore cause the rupture of oo bonds to provoke the production of radicals oh and so4 in the pms adsorption and activation process 51 52 furthermore the adsorbed pms attacked the co on the biochar to form the adduct and then pms attacked the adduct to generate 1o2 for the degradation of phenol 53 and the present of defect can also contribute the generation of 1o2 54 in addition the sp2 carbon in biochar can serve as an electronic transfer platform for phenol electron donor and pms electron acceptor 55 it can be speculated that in the electron transfer process the intermediate was formulated on the surface of the biochar and triggered the oxidative degradation process by extracting the electrons in phenol which served as the electron donor base on the above discussion a possible mechanism was illustrated in the fig 8 which had the degradation pathways including the radicals oh and so4 and non radicals 1o2 electron transfer process 4 conclusion in this work ginkgo leaf as a waste resource was prepared into self doped biochar by pyrolysis process which could efficiently activate pms to degrade phenol furthermore the removal efficiency of biochar pms system was much higher than that of biochar alone and pms alone through the analysis of quenching experiments and open circuit potential ocp test showed that radical and non radical pathway were both aroused in phenol elimination while the contribution of non radicals 1o2 to phenol abatement was the dominant based on the results of linear fitting between functional groups defects and k obs of biochar at different pyrolysis temperatures it was proposed that oxygen functional groups and sulfur functional groups were the main account of the high catalytic degradation efficiency on phenol in summary this work provides a simple reuse strategy for leaf waste resource and a new opportunity for the design of metal free catalysts declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest
