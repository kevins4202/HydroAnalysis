larkana sindh 1 introduction groundwater is essential for human survival agriculture industrial development and ecosystem conservation the groundwater is necessary for the arid and semi arid areas where surface water and precipitation are generally rare the groundwater is also being used to supplement the surface water for irrigation wu et al 2017 there has been an increase in the demand for groundwater in the last few decades due to the rapid population growth and industrialization many diseases are caused in the human by drinking water of poor quality kavitha and elangovan 2010 the more significant portion of the groundwater soluble components come from dissolved minerals in sedimentary and soil rock the soluble features include sodium calcium sulfate and bicarbonate ions the chloride ions mostly come from seawater and sewage wastes the groundwater in pakistan contributes about one third of whole water sources and is a source for water supplies in several cities pakistan

chandka during british rule the larkana was given the status of the district the larkana has the honor of being the seat of one of the world s oldest civilizations the indus valley civilization moen jo daro is located 25 km away from larkana city the taluka larkana is situated on the right bank of river indus and is located at 27 33 north latitude 68 13 east longitude the total area of taluka larkana is 7423 square km with a population of 738 069 based on 2017 senses the rural and urban populations are 247 561 and 490 508 respectively larkana district is divided into four talukas and 48 union councils the larkana is hot in the summer and cold in winter and the temperature varies from 3 to 49 c with rainfall about 245 mm annually kori et al 2018 district larkana comprises plain grounds and many muddy fields for cultivation mainly rice and wheat 2 1 2 geography of the area this district larkana is within the lower indus plain of sindh it is bordered in the west by qambar shahdadkot in the south by dadu khairpure is on the south and shikarpur and jacobabad districts are in the east and north east 2 1 3 geology and hydrogeology sedimentary rocks mainly cover the study area the area s surface is covered by the quaternary deposits of extinct streams and older terrace deposits stream deposits are dominated by the streambed and meander belt deposits the old terrace deposits consist of loess and flood plain deposits of the middle terrace the sindh province geology comprises tertiary and cretaceous formations which are based on limestone chalky limestone dolomite marl marly limestone and chert interaction shah 2009 the geology of sindh is distributed into three chief regions the ranges of kirthar mountain and pab are comprising a chain of the minor hills in the west in the north sindh larkana kamber shahdahkot and dadu contain rocks of laki spreading to suleiman range the rocks sub surface are approximately 20 000 feet thick and belong to the pre cretaceous and cretaceous periods generally rocks are the sedimentary origin of clastic and non clastic and belong to the marine and fluvial depositional environments the rich irrigation structure mostly from the indus river is the chief source of recharge it contains about 5 million cubic kilometers of generally shallow groundwater in the sindh particularly in irrigated areas ali et al 2019 the river indus flow on the east of the study area at a distance of 20 km from larkana town the soil is commonly sandy clay the soils are usually calcareous with calcium carbonate caco3 content ranging up to 21 5 and the soil s features are moderate saline about 30 area is salt affected by waterlogging and salinity 2 1 4 water resources the rich irrigation system is mainly from the pakistan s biggest indus river and is the primary source of recharge in the study area indus water flow data into reservoirs of pakistan 2007 the two unlined canals rice canal and dadu canal also flow from the study area and recharge to the aquifer mostly rice canal which flows from the middle of larkana fig 1 the extensive rice cultivation helps to recharge freshwater with practical effects on the groundwater of larkana and is suitable primarily for drinking and irrigation the high demand for irrigation water with low utilization efficiency is a cause of soil salinization in the study area 2 1 5 sampling the 30 groundwater samples were collected randomly from taluka larkana locations in 2019 most of the samples were collected from larkana town to examine the quality of drinking water a few samples were also collected from villagers to explore the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater quality groundwater was collected from hand pumps at 50 80 feet and contained in 1 5 l polythene bottles fig 2 two sampling bottles were collected from each sampling station one for physicochemical examination and the other for metal analysis the water samples were collected after allowing the pump to drain for at least 5 min the samples for metals analyses were acidified immediately with 1 5 ml nitric acid in a 1 5 l bottle lanjwani et al 2020b 2 1 6 laboratory analysis the electrical conductivity ph and tds were measured using orion star 5 electrical conductivity meter orion inc boston usa nitrate nitrite sulfate total phosphate and orthophosphate were determined by hitachi model 220 hitachi pvt ltd tokyo japan double beam spectrophotometer using 1 cm dual quartz cuvettes the titration methods determined alkalinity chloride and hardness apha 1992 the calcium magnesium sodium potassium iron copper zinc lead cadmium cobalt chromium manganese and nickel were determined using air acetylene flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer model aa 800 perkinelmer flame aas singhapur using standard burner head sodium potassium calcium and magnesium were analyzed after appropriate dilution of the samples with deionized distilled water and fe cu zn pb cd cr co mn and ni were analyzed after preconcentration of at least ten times by evaporation of solvent below the boiling point 90 c the analysis was carried out at the condition recommended by the manufacturer at least in triplicate and average values are reported 2 2 the geographical information system gis the geographical information system gis method was used to examine the spatial variation in groundwater levels the arc map software version 10 5 was used to draw the parameters gis map the groundwater level variations were interpolated spatially using inverse distance weighted idw method the idw method highlighted the values of near locations and examined the study area s specific distance kumar et al 2018 the wqi was calculated to examine the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation the water quality parameters were applied for computing the wqi and weight was given for each parameter depending upon the human life effect the parameters were given weight wi from 1 to 5 where a maximum weight of 5 was assigned to those parameters which have a high impact on human life such as fluoride lead arsenic and cadmium ketata rokbani et al 2001 the wqi was calculated by the following formula ketata rokbani et al 2011 eq 1 w i w i i 1 n w i wi is weight of each parameter wi is the relative weight and n is a number of parameters in the second steps the quality rating scale qi of each water quality parameter was measured using eq 2 2 qi ci si 100 where qi is quality rating ci is the value of each parameter and si is the who standard limit of each parameter then wqi was calculated by eq 3 3 w q i w i q i 2 2 1 data analysis different multivariate statistical techniques principal components analysis pca cluster analysis and coefficient of correlation r were calculated using spss version 22 statistical software hydrochemical faces piper diagram were drawn by aquachem software the gibbs chadha minimum maximum mean and standard deviation were determined by microsoft excel 2013 these techniques helped achieve a relationship between groundwater parameters and sampling stations the groundwater samples were also analyzed for water quality for the irrigation including salinity hazards sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium and permeability index pi the concentrations are expressed as meq l for sar na and pi the salinity hazard of water is categorized into four classes on the basis of the electrical conductivity using the reported method chandel 2008 the following formula determined the sar value alam et al 2012 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 the na is used to examine the quality of water for irrigation the results of na of water are divided into three categories 20 40 na good 40 60 na permissible and 60 80 na doubtful lanjwani et al 2020c the na was calculated following na na k ca2 mg2 na k 100 the pi of water is affected by constant use for irrigation the water is affected by hco3 and na ca2 mg2 substances present in water the water s permeability for irrigation is based on the permeability index pi bashir et al 2017 the following formula calculated the pi pi na hco3 ca 2 mg 2 na 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical analysis the physico chemical analysis was carried out to evaluate the study area s groundwater quality the ph ranged from 7 24 to 7 98 ph of all groundwater samples was within the who limits for drinking 6 5 8 5 the conductivity ranged from 326 to 2565 μs cm while tds ranged from 209 to 1642 mg l ec and tds of 7 samples were higher than permissible limits 1500 μs cm and 1000 mg l the ec and tds maximum value were observed at sample number 14 and the lowest value was observed at samples number 23 total hardness was observed from 60 to 320 mg l as caco3 nitrate nitrite total phosphate and orthophosphate are nutrients and were present in range 0 72 1 89 mg l 0 1 1 88 μg l 0 27 1 46 mg l and 0 11 0 98 mg l respectively table 1 and are indicators of contamination due to human action however observed results were within the allowable limits for guidelines for drinking 3 2 anions and cations alkalinity and chloride results were observed between 80 and 360 mg l as caco3 and 21 291 mg l chloride respectively the alkalinity and cl results showed that most of the samples were within the who limit for drinking purposes the sulfate so4 was also present as a major anion in the groundwater within the range from 20 to 206 mg l the anions were present in decreasing order hco3 cl so4 the concentration of essential metals plays an important role in groundwater quality the na k ca and mg were present in the range 15 202 mg l na 1 38 23 68 mg l k 19 124 mg l ca and 15 113 mg l mg table 2 the essential cations were present in decreasing order na ca mg k and were present within permissible limits 3 3 heavy metals heavy metals occur in groundwater at low concentrations commonly at the microgram per liter in recent times pollutants especially metals have developed higher in natural water levels this condition has arisen due to the rapid growth of the population exploitation exploration of natural resources expansion of industrial activities increased urbanization and the extension of the agriculture and non enforcement of environmental principles biney et al 1994 the major routes of heavy metal uptake by humans are drinking water food and air for instance heavy metals iron copper and zinc are necessary for the human body to maintain metabolism at higher levels they may have poisoning effects the elements lead pb arsenic as and cadmium cd are frequently considered toxic the chromium is required by the body in low levels but may be harmful in higher amounts biney et al 1994 ni fe cr cd co zn pb and cu were examined at all sampling locations trace elements are usually considered those with values less than one mg l they may enter the groundwater from the weathering of rocks drainage and human activities the concentrations of zn mn fe cu and co were lower than permissible limits 500 μg l zn 300 μg l fe 500 μg l mn 100 μg l co and 200 μg l cu and results were in range 36 460 μg l zn 20 3 205 3 μg l fe 10 6 71 3 μg l mn 5 2 56 7 μg l co and 10 3 101 3 μg l cu the pb was observed below the limit of detection bld to 21 9 μg l and 9 samples exceeded the who s limit 10 μg l cd was observed bld 25 2 μg l and eight samples crossed the allowable limit for drinking 3 0 μg l cd cr ranged from 10 4 to 47 1 μg l and five samples exceeded the who limit 30 μg l cr ni was observed from 10 4 to 41 3 μg l and six samples crossed the limit 30 μg l ni table 2 the metal s obtained levels may be from geological origin and minerals present in the area the trace elements were present in the following decreasing order zn fe cu mn co pb cd there are some reported values of essential and heavy metals in sindh province pakistan such as lanjwani et al 2019 indicated results of taluka kamber which ranged na 25 1186 mg l k 6 117 mg l ca 27 590 mg l mg 18 557 mg l cr 9 2 138 μg l cd bld to 29 4 μg l pb bld to 60 μg l and ni bld to 158 μg l the taluka larkana is less affected by essential and heavy metals than taluka kamber sindh pakistan because of the better quality of groundwater of larkana taluka than kamber because of nearer to river indus and rice canal which helped to recharge groundwater of larkana taluka with fresh water 3 4 arsenic and fluoride results the observed range of arsenic was from 0 to 25 μg l with a mean value of 6 0 μg l and one sample 19 exceeded the permissible limit 10 μg l table 2 the result agrees with the reported values for arsenic 0 01 17 μg l by kori et al 2018 however the observed values did not concur with reported values of ali et al 2019 for arsenic ranged from 2 to 275 μg l the groundwater of larkana is better and safer than other areas of sindh province in terms of arsenic contents jakhrani et al 2011 reported 0 01 126 μg l from gambat kandhro et al 2016 reported 10 200 μg l from nawabshah memon et al 2016 reported 8 67 μg l from dadu baig et al 2009 13 106 μg l from jamshoro lanjwani et al 2019 from 0 to 25 μg l from kamber the fluoride f is naturally present in the earth s crust f in groundwater has been challenged worldwide because of its significant impact on human physiology kundu et al 2001 a little fluoride is necessary for the normal mineralization and development of dental enamel and bones but at higher concentrations it has toxic effects including dental and skeletal fluorosis who 2004 the primary fluoride source in the human body is drinking water zohouri et al 2000 fluoride results varied from bdl to 5 27 mg l table 2 the fluoride result of 7 samples crossed the who guideline 1 5 mg l and 23 samples were under the limits it was observed that the concentration of fluoride was directly proportional to the concentration of tds and it was considered that the concentration of fluoride in the water was of geological sources 3 5 spatial analysis of groundwater quality parameters gis map geographic information system gis is applied as a powerful tool for analyzing presenting and storing spatial data the spatial variations in groundwater quality are plans for sustainable water resources management geospatial is an important method for managing groundwater anand et al 2020 the spatial method in the gis was used to study the spatial changes in groundwater levels the inverse distance weighted idw method was applied to highlight neighboring sample locations values with a definite distance of the research area kumar et al 2018 the gis is a very capable tool to describe the sampling data spatially and is widely used by many researchers for plotting the physical and chemical parameters taloor et al 2020 the 25 groundwater sampling locations of larkana city were used in arc map to interpolate the results fig 3 showed gis map of the anions and cations a ca 2 b cl c mg 2 d hco3 e na and f so4 respectively the gis map showed the majority of groundwater samples of the study area were suitable for drinking purposes based on anions and cations and were found under the desirable limits hco3 mg 2 and na in a few locations crossed the permissible limits cl in six locations were above the permissible limits based on gis map fig 4 showed spatial distribution gis map of toxic heavy metals a pb b cd c cr and d ni parameters and results showed a majority of samples were within the who limits but some samples which were collected from the centre of the larkana city crossed the who guideline especially for pb and cd and showed health risk for peoples which were drinking contaminated groundwater fig 5 a as and 5b f map also showed most of the samples were within who guidelines and were suitable for drinking purposes as at one sample being above the limit and f in a few locations crossed the who limit 3 6 water quality index wqi for drinking and irrigation wqi tool was computed using groundwater quality parameters and were related to who guidelines the wqi was applied to know the suitability of groundwater for drinking the weight wi of parameters from 1 to 5 was given the maximum weight of 5 was given for those parameters which have a higher effect on human life table 3 the wqi is classified in 5 groups excellent less than 50 good between 50 and 100 poor between 100 and 200 very poor between 200 and 300 and unfit for drinking uses 300 shabbir and ahmad 2015 ketata rokbani et al 2011 the wqi in groundwater samples ranged from 27 02 to 120 02 the results of wqi of groundwater of taluka larkana indicated that samples 18 60 0 were in the excellent category 6 20 0 samples were good and 6 20 0 samples were in poor and no any sample was found in very poor category table 4 the wqi results showed that most of the taluka larkana groundwater was suitable for drinking purposes but 20 0 were classified as poor in water quality the wqi for irrigation was also examined to know groundwater s suitability for crops the wqi results for irrigation varied from 14 87 to 45 57 and showed 12 40 samples were found in the excellent category and 18 60 samples were in the good water category the results showed all samples were fit for irrigation based on wqi the gis map was also drawn to define the wqi for drinking and irrigation purposes the results showed that most samples were found excellent and good water category for drinking but five locations showed poor water quality for drinking fig 6 a the irrigation map s water quality index showed that all samples were found in excellent and good water quality for irrigation fig 6b 3 7 classifications and estimation of hydrochemistry of study area 3 7 1 weathering and ion exchange process the weathering and ion exchange are the main processes controlling the study area s geochemistry the scatter diagram in fig 7 a hco3 versus na is drawn to know the study area s weathering process if sample dots are gathered left side of the trend line it shows carbonate weathering if dots gather right side of the trendline it shows silicate weathering mgbenu and egbueri 2019 fig 7a showed that most of the sample dots gathered on both sides of the diagram and indicated that carbonate weathering and silicate weathering were the main characters in releasing hco3 and na ions fig 7b ca versus hco3 showed that sample dots gathered on both sides of the diagram and indicated that carbonate mineral calcite dissolution and carbonic acid weathering were the main characters in the release of ca ions from the waters the sample dots gathered on the left side of the trend line showed carbonic acid silicate weathering and dots gattered on the right side of the trendline indicated carbonate minerals weathering sample dots gathered along with the trendline showed calcite dissolution egbueri 2019 fig 7c showed that most samples were in reverse ion exchange and forward ion exchange process the na cl ratio equal to 1 shows the dissolution of halite however silicate weathering is responsible for na production if na cl ratio is 1 egbueri et al 2019 na cl ratio 1 shows forward exchange process fig 7d ca versus so4 showed both gypsum dissolution and also silicate weathering are predominant processes managed by the chemistry of major ions and hydrogeochemical progress of the selected study area the samples dots were gathered on both the side of the trend line the scatter plot also shows the correlation of parameters to each other the plot of ca2 mg2 against so4 2 hco3 was used to examine the effects of sulfate and carbonate minerals distribution in system the sample points along the 1 1 line are recognized to weathering of sulfate and carbonate minerals reverse ion exchange processes cause the points above the 1 1 line the data points below the aquiline are considered because of sulfates and carbonates dissolution the fig 7e showed that a few points fall around the 1 1 line some points were above the aquiline indicating the impacts of cation exchange and weathering of silicate minerals the 43 points dropped below the line and indicated the impact of the dissolution of sulfate and carbonate minerals garrels and mckenzie 1967 the evaporation may raise the level of species in water if evaporation dominates na cl ratio may be unchanged jankowski and acworth 1997 the plot na cl against ec could be a horizontal line the na cl molar ratio will be almost equal to one na is usually considered released from the silicate weathering meyback 1987 the molar ratio of na cl of groundwater samples in larkana was observed from 0 44 to 2 20 fig 7f more than half of samples of larkana had na cl molar ratio less than one 60 indicating the dissolution of halite as a primary process which was replaced due to the weathering of silicates in the area and 40 locations indicated na cl ratio greater than one the scatter diagram of ec versus na cl of groundwater samples displays that the trend line is inclined which showed that evaporation couldn t be a significant geochemical process based on monitoring groundwater geochemistry another factor affecting the groundwater is ion exchange and it regulates the transport of chemicals in aquifers and soil appelo and postma 2005 the ion exchange is studied in terms of chloro alkaline indices ca1 1 when ca 2 or mg 2 exchange takes place with na or k the values of ca1 1 was calculated using the following formula ca1 1 cl na k cl the results in indicate that 14 samples have negative values and 16 samples positive the negative values indicate an abundance of na and deficiency of ca 2 in groundwater the positive values indicate the opposite effect 3 8 gibbs diagram gibbs diagram is a way to assess the source of ions in the groundwater by focusing on the correlation among the level of cations and anions and tds gibbs ratio was calculated using the below formula gibbs ratio i for anion cl cl hco3 gibbs ratio ii for cation na k na k ca2 the distribution of cations na ca2 k and anions cl hco3 and tds results were used in the gibbs diagram to estimate precipitation evaporation dominance and rock dominance fig 8 a displays the gibbs diagram which is based on tds and results of anions the 60 0 samples showed rock dominance 40 0 samples showed evaporation crystallization dominance and no sample indicated precipitation dominance this characteristic showed that geochemistry of rock was a main source of groundwater in the study area figure 8b displays the gibbs diagram which is based on tds and results of cations it also indicates that the majority of cations in groundwater have rock dominance 56 67 43 33 of samples indicated evaporation crystallization dominance and no sample showed precipitation dominance the clarification for this phenomenon may be that some minerals calcite clays and rock forming silicates and alkali and alkaline earth salts and sulfates are present in the study area 3 9 hydrochemical faces the anions and cations characteristics in groundwater are due to groundwater interaction with rock and soil in the aquifer the chemical compositions of the aquifer are very important for groundwater s hydrochemical quality the hydrochemical composition is affected by the rocks aquifer and the groundwater flow hydrochemical facies of water may be assessed by plotting the major anions and cations such as co3 2 hco3 so4 2 cl mg2 ca2 na and k piper 1953 the piper s trilinear diagram showed the hydrochemical properties of groundwater the left triangle indicated 83 33 groundwater samples exposed at zone b which showed mixed type water and no dominancy of particular parameter and 16 67 found in zone d which showed dominancy of the na and k but no sample was found in zone a magnesium type and c calcium type the right triangle 73 33 samples were found in zone b which indicated mixed type water and no dominancy of any parameters and 26 67 samples were found in zone e which showed dominancy of hco3 the zone e showed that groundwater was not influenced by the dissolution of the gypsum and evaporation processes fig 9 3 10 the diamond shaped may be classified into six basic types i mixed type ii sodium chloride type iii calcium bicarbonate type iv calcium chloride type v mixed type vi sodium bicarbonate type the diamond shaped plot showed 56 67 samples mixed type water and no dominancy of particular parameter 26 67 samples showed calcium bicarbonate type and 16 67 samples indicated sodium chloride type water in all samples n 30 of the groundwater hco3 exceeded all other parameters chloride cl was second highest parameter than others it may be that the following species are present in water in order nahco3 nacl cahco3 3 11 chadha diagram in order to better expose the hydrogeochemical facies the chadha diagram was applied in the current work the groundwater was divided into 8 groups in the chart fig 10 fig 10 indicated that 23 76 67 samples were within zone 6 which indicated leaching of soluble salts in the unsaturated zone and may increase the level of na and cl during the formation of soil and usually arises in the top layer of the study area the 4 13 33 samples fell within zone 1 which showed that alkaline earth metals exceeded alkali metals the 3 10 samples fell within zone 4 which showed the strong acidic anion exceeded to weak acidic anions li et al 2018a b c 3 12 statistical analysis 3 12 1 correlation

evaluated on spss 22 statistical software table 5 the values found are based on the mean values and measure the relationship among 2 variables the 1 variable shows the other s prediction lanjwani and channa 2019 the obtained results showed that ec and tds were strongly positively correlated to the cl th alk na so4 ca k mg and cd 0 811 may be due to the dissolution of salts due to a similar geological origin li et al 2017 and addition of these ions along the groundwater flow path wu et al 2014 the ph total phosphate orthophosphate nitrite and nitrate showed less positive and negative correlation with all parameters similarly cl has a strongly correlation with th alk na so4 ca k and mg 0 789 0 927 and moderately correlated with metals 0 5 but negative correlated with nitrate 0 156 and nitrite 0 143 na is significantly associated with cl 0 855 representing that halite dissolution may be the main reaction to manipulating groundwater chemistry however the dissolution of silicates was also possible li et al 2017 alkalinity was good correlated with na so4 ca mg k th ca and mg which suggested that dolomite and calcite s dissolution was possible similarly ca was good correlated to mg and cd 0 823 0 952 mg was good correlated to cd 0 911 zn was less correlated with all other metals cd was well correlated to cr and mn 0 785 808 cr was well correlated with ni mn and co 0 781 0 832 the results indicated that significant elements were well correlated with each other and may have a similar origin geological still some parameters orthophosphate total phosphate nitrate and nitrite may have anthropogenic effects also 3 13 principal components analysis principal components pca analysis is a powerful tool to describe the variance of the huge dataset of inter associated variables with the lesser set of the independent variables the pca was drawn out of eigenvalues greater than one wu et al 2014 from the original variables covariance matrix and were weighted in a linear grouping of original variables the 24 physicochemical parameters of groundwater samples of taluka larkana were used in the rotated components matrix and are shown in table 6 fig 11 these comprise loading components for rotated matrix eigenvalues cumulative and variance percent explained by each component it displayed the principal components account composed for 82 293 of the whole variance of dataset with eigenvalues greater than one about 17 7 were not composed in pca because their eigenvalues were less than one the first component contained a high load of 54 977 for parameters ec tds sulfate chloride alkalinity total hardness potassium sodium magnesium calcium copper cadmium chromium nickel manganese and cobalt with strong positive loading 0 756 0 962 which characterized the ion exchange and weathering of silicate calcite dolomite and minerals as suggested by correlation analysis the second component load was 11 053 which indicated high positive loading of total phosphate and orthophosphate 0 867 900 the third component load was 6 273 with high positive loading of no2 0 816 the fourth component load was 5 740 with high positive loading of no3 0 806 and the fifth component load was 4 348 with high positive loading of fe 0 915 of the total variance the first component eigenvalue 13 195 was higher than other components second 2 653 third 1 506 fourth 1 378 and fifth 1 044 respectively 3 14 cluster analysis ca the cluster analysis is applied for an alliance of groundwater samples by the similar locations and their chemical arrangement the samples with higher similarity are joined in the first group and then groups of the samples are combined with the linkage rule the steps are repeated till all explanations have been categorized banoeng yakubo et al 2009 the dendrogram was gained from ward s method to combine the 30 sampling locations with four clusters fig 12 based on cluster analysis cluster i comprised 15 samples 2 3 8 9 11 13 14 15 16 20 22 25 26 27 and 29 cluster ii with six samples 4 10 12 17 19 and 28 cluster iii with eight samples 5 7 11 1 6 18 21 and 24 and cluster iv with one sample 23 ca1 and ca2 were connected with lesser linkage distance and indicated that they had more similarity than with ca3 and ca4 the geochemistry of ca1 with ca2 and ca3 and ca4 samples had similarities because ca3 and ca4 were also connected at a less distance the diagram showed that four clusters were geochemically independent groups samples from ca1 and ca2 were of hco3 cl or hco3 ca type and the concentrations of all ions were lower than those of samples ca3 and ca4 samples from ca3 and ca4 were hco3 cl type they had more hco3 and cl indicated by the dendrogram the average value of clusters was increasing in order ca1 ca2 ca3 ca4 table 7 3 15 water

samples were present in this category high salinity ec 1000 2250 μs cm can be used on soils with controlled drainage special regulation of the salinity and selection of crops are required for the soils with suitable drainage the 12 40 samples were present in this category very high salinity ec 3000 μs cm is not fit for crops under usual conditions nevertheless it may be used under very special conditions no sample was present in this category the sar values were between 0 35 and 2 15 all analyzed samples were found within the permissible range for irrigation and no sample crossed the limit

between 88 98 and 153 78 according to the study 100 of samples were in very high permissibility pi 75 class i which was good for the irrigation uses the water quality for irrigation showed that about 90 of groundwater samples were suitable for agricultural purposes table 8 3 16 wilcox diagrams wilcox diagram is applied to evaluate the potential of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes the chart is based on two parameters electrical conductivity versus sodium adsorption ratio in the wilcox diagram s represents sar value and c represents the salinity fig 13 the results showed that no sample was present in low salinity and low sar water category c1 s1 which is suitable for irrigation for most purposes eleven samples 36 67 were present in medium salinity low sar water c2 s1 which can be used if a medium amount of leaching occurs the 18 samples 60 were present in high salinity low sar water category c3 s1 which required drainage and salinity control only 1 sample was present in very high salinity water category c4 s1 which was unsuitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions and very special management is required before uses qishlaqi et al 2017 mirabbasi et al 2008 the diagram showed that more samples were present in the high salinity and lowered sar category but these can be used for irrigation purposes with required drainage 4 conclusion the work examined the

larkana sindh 1 introduction groundwater is essential for human survival agriculture industrial development and ecosystem conservation the groundwater is necessary for the arid and semi arid areas where surface water and precipitation are generally rare the groundwater is also being used to supplement the surface water for irrigation wu et al 2017 there has been an increase in the demand for groundwater in the last few decades due to the rapid population growth and industrialization many diseases are caused in the human by drinking water of poor quality kavitha and elangovan 2010 the more significant portion of the groundwater soluble components come from dissolved minerals in sedimentary and soil rock the soluble features include sodium calcium sulfate and bicarbonate ions the chloride ions mostly come from seawater and sewage wastes the groundwater in pakistan contributes about one third of whole water sources and is a source for water supplies in several cities pakistan

chandka during british rule the larkana was given the status of the district the larkana has the honor of being the seat of one of the world s oldest civilizations the indus valley civilization moen jo daro is located 25 km away from larkana city the taluka larkana is situated on the right bank of river indus and is located at 27 33 north latitude 68 13 east longitude the total area of taluka larkana is 7423 square km with a population of 738 069 based on 2017 senses the rural and urban populations are 247 561 and 490 508 respectively larkana district is divided into four talukas and 48 union councils the larkana is hot in the summer and cold in winter and the temperature varies from 3 to 49 c with rainfall about 245 mm annually kori et al 2018 district larkana comprises plain grounds and many muddy fields for cultivation mainly rice and wheat 2 1 2 geography of the area this district larkana is within the lower indus plain of sindh it is bordered in the west by qambar shahdadkot in the south by dadu khairpure is on the south and shikarpur and jacobabad districts are in the east and north east 2 1 3 geology and hydrogeology sedimentary rocks mainly cover the study area the area s surface is covered by the quaternary deposits of extinct streams and older terrace deposits stream deposits are dominated by the streambed and meander belt deposits the old terrace deposits consist of loess and flood plain deposits of the middle terrace the sindh province geology comprises tertiary and cretaceous formations which are based on limestone chalky limestone dolomite marl marly limestone and chert interaction shah 2009 the geology of sindh is distributed into three chief regions the ranges of kirthar mountain and pab are comprising a chain of the minor hills in the west in the north sindh larkana kamber shahdahkot and dadu contain rocks of laki spreading to suleiman range the rocks sub surface are approximately 20 000 feet thick and belong to the pre cretaceous and cretaceous periods generally rocks are the sedimentary origin of clastic and non clastic and belong to the marine and fluvial depositional environments the rich irrigation structure mostly from the indus river is the chief source of recharge it contains about 5 million cubic kilometers of generally shallow groundwater in the sindh particularly in irrigated areas ali et al 2019 the river indus flow on the east of the study area at a distance of 20 km from larkana town the soil is commonly sandy clay the soils are usually calcareous with calcium carbonate caco3 content ranging up to 21 5 and the soil s features are moderate saline about 30 area is salt affected by waterlogging and salinity 2 1 4 water resources the rich irrigation system is mainly from the pakistan s biggest indus river and is the primary source of recharge in the study area indus water flow data into reservoirs of pakistan 2007 the two unlined canals rice canal and dadu canal also flow from the study area and recharge to the aquifer mostly rice canal which flows from the middle of larkana fig 1 the extensive rice cultivation helps to recharge freshwater with practical effects on the groundwater of larkana and is suitable primarily for drinking and irrigation the high demand for irrigation water with low utilization efficiency is a cause of soil salinization in the study area 2 1 5 sampling the 30 groundwater samples were collected randomly from taluka larkana locations in 2019 most of the samples were collected from larkana town to examine the quality of drinking water a few samples were also collected from villagers to explore the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater quality groundwater was collected from hand pumps at 50 80 feet and contained in 1 5 l polythene bottles fig 2 two sampling bottles were collected from each sampling station one for physicochemical examination and the other for metal analysis the water samples were collected after allowing the pump to drain for at least 5 min the samples for metals analyses were acidified immediately with 1 5 ml nitric acid in a 1 5 l bottle lanjwani et al 2020b 2 1 6 laboratory analysis the electrical conductivity ph and tds were measured using orion star 5 electrical conductivity meter orion inc boston usa nitrate nitrite sulfate total phosphate and orthophosphate were determined by hitachi model 220 hitachi pvt ltd tokyo japan double beam spectrophotometer using 1 cm dual quartz cuvettes the titration methods determined alkalinity chloride and hardness apha 1992 the calcium magnesium sodium potassium iron copper zinc lead cadmium cobalt chromium manganese and nickel were determined using air acetylene flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer model aa 800 perkinelmer flame aas singhapur using standard burner head sodium potassium calcium and magnesium were analyzed after appropriate dilution of the samples with deionized distilled water and fe cu zn pb cd cr co mn and ni were analyzed after preconcentration of at least ten times by evaporation of solvent below the boiling point 90 c the analysis was carried out at the condition recommended by the manufacturer at least in triplicate and average values are reported 2 2 the geographical information system gis the geographical information system gis method was used to examine the spatial variation in groundwater levels the arc map software version 10 5 was used to draw the parameters gis map the groundwater level variations were interpolated spatially using inverse distance weighted idw method the idw method highlighted the values of near locations and examined the study area s specific distance kumar et al 2018 the wqi was calculated to examine the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation the water quality parameters were applied for computing the wqi and weight was given for each parameter depending upon the human life effect the parameters were given weight wi from 1 to 5 where a maximum weight of 5 was assigned to those parameters which have a high impact on human life such as fluoride lead arsenic and cadmium ketata rokbani et al 2001 the wqi was calculated by the following formula ketata rokbani et al 2011 eq 1 w i w i i 1 n w i wi is weight of each parameter wi is the relative weight and n is a number of parameters in the second steps the quality rating scale qi of each water quality parameter was measured using eq 2 2 qi ci si 100 where qi is quality rating ci is the value of each parameter and si is the who standard limit of each parameter then wqi was calculated by eq 3 3 w q i w i q i 2 2 1 data analysis different multivariate statistical techniques principal components analysis pca cluster analysis and coefficient of correlation r were calculated using spss version 22 statistical software hydrochemical faces piper diagram were drawn by aquachem software the gibbs chadha minimum maximum mean and standard deviation were determined by microsoft excel 2013 these techniques helped achieve a relationship between groundwater parameters and sampling stations the groundwater samples were also analyzed for water quality for the irrigation including salinity hazards sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium and permeability index pi the concentrations are expressed as meq l for sar na and pi the salinity hazard of water is categorized into four classes on the basis of the electrical conductivity using the reported method chandel 2008 the following formula determined the sar value alam et al 2012 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 the na is used to examine the quality of water for irrigation the results of na of water are divided into three categories 20 40 na good 40 60 na permissible and 60 80 na doubtful lanjwani et al 2020c the na was calculated following na na k ca2 mg2 na k 100 the pi of water is affected by constant use for irrigation the water is affected by hco3 and na ca2 mg2 substances present in water the water s permeability for irrigation is based on the permeability index pi bashir et al 2017 the following formula calculated the pi pi na hco3 ca 2 mg 2 na 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical analysis the physico chemical analysis was carried out to evaluate the study area s groundwater quality the ph ranged from 7 24 to 7 98 ph of all groundwater samples was within the who limits for drinking 6 5 8 5 the conductivity ranged from 326 to 2565 μs cm while tds ranged from 209 to 1642 mg l ec and tds of 7 samples were higher than permissible limits 1500 μs cm and 1000 mg l the ec and tds maximum value were observed at sample number 14 and the lowest value was observed at samples number 23 total hardness was observed from 60 to 320 mg l as caco3 nitrate nitrite total phosphate and orthophosphate are nutrients and were present in range 0 72 1 89 mg l 0 1 1 88 μg l 0 27 1 46 mg l and 0 11 0 98 mg l respectively table 1 and are indicators of contamination due to human action however observed results were within the allowable limits for guidelines for drinking 3 2 anions and cations alkalinity and chloride results were observed between 80 and 360 mg l as caco3 and 21 291 mg l chloride respectively the alkalinity and cl results showed that most of the samples were within the who limit for drinking purposes the sulfate so4 was also present as a major anion in the groundwater within the range from 20 to 206 mg l the anions were present in decreasing order hco3 cl so4 the concentration of essential metals plays an important role in groundwater quality the na k ca and mg were present in the range 15 202 mg l na 1 38 23 68 mg l k 19 124 mg l ca and 15 113 mg l mg table 2 the essential cations were present in decreasing order na ca mg k and were present within permissible limits 3 3 heavy metals heavy metals occur in groundwater at low concentrations commonly at the microgram per liter in recent times pollutants especially metals have developed higher in natural water levels this condition has arisen due to the rapid growth of the population exploitation exploration of natural resources expansion of industrial activities increased urbanization and the extension of the agriculture and non enforcement of environmental principles biney et al 1994 the major routes of heavy metal uptake by humans are drinking water food and air for instance heavy metals iron copper and zinc are necessary for the human body to maintain metabolism at higher levels they may have poisoning effects the elements lead pb arsenic as and cadmium cd are frequently considered toxic the chromium is required by the body in low levels but may be harmful in higher amounts biney et al 1994 ni fe cr cd co zn pb and cu were examined at all sampling locations trace elements are usually considered those with values less than one mg l they may enter the groundwater from the weathering of rocks drainage and human activities the concentrations of zn mn fe cu and co were lower than permissible limits 500 μg l zn 300 μg l fe 500 μg l mn 100 μg l co and 200 μg l cu and results were in range 36 460 μg l zn 20 3 205 3 μg l fe 10 6 71 3 μg l mn 5 2 56 7 μg l co and 10 3 101 3 μg l cu the pb was observed below the limit of detection bld to 21 9 μg l and 9 samples exceeded the who s limit 10 μg l cd was observed bld 25 2 μg l and eight samples crossed the allowable limit for drinking 3 0 μg l cd cr ranged from 10 4 to 47 1 μg l and five samples exceeded the who limit 30 μg l cr ni was observed from 10 4 to 41 3 μg l and six samples crossed the limit 30 μg l ni table 2 the metal s obtained levels may be from geological origin and minerals present in the area the trace elements were present in the following decreasing order zn fe cu mn co pb cd there are some reported values of essential and heavy metals in sindh province pakistan such as lanjwani et al 2019 indicated results of taluka kamber which ranged na 25 1186 mg l k 6 117 mg l ca 27 590 mg l mg 18 557 mg l cr 9 2 138 μg l cd bld to 29 4 μg l pb bld to 60 μg l and ni bld to 158 μg l the taluka larkana is less affected by essential and heavy metals than taluka kamber sindh pakistan because of the better quality of groundwater of larkana taluka than kamber because of nearer to river indus and rice canal which helped to recharge groundwater of larkana taluka with fresh water 3 4 arsenic and fluoride results the observed range of arsenic was from 0 to 25 μg l with a mean value of 6 0 μg l and one sample 19 exceeded the permissible limit 10 μg l table 2 the result agrees with the reported values for arsenic 0 01 17 μg l by kori et al 2018 however the observed values did not concur with reported values of ali et al 2019 for arsenic ranged from 2 to 275 μg l the groundwater of larkana is better and safer than other areas of sindh province in terms of arsenic contents jakhrani et al 2011 reported 0 01 126 μg l from gambat kandhro et al 2016 reported 10 200 μg l from nawabshah memon et al 2016 reported 8 67 μg l from dadu baig et al 2009 13 106 μg l from jamshoro lanjwani et al 2019 from 0 to 25 μg l from kamber the fluoride f is naturally present in the earth s crust f in groundwater has been challenged worldwide because of its significant impact on human physiology kundu et al 2001 a little fluoride is necessary for the normal mineralization and development of dental enamel and bones but at higher concentrations it has toxic effects including dental and skeletal fluorosis who 2004 the primary fluoride source in the human body is drinking water zohouri et al 2000 fluoride results varied from bdl to 5 27 mg l table 2 the fluoride result of 7 samples crossed the who guideline 1 5 mg l and 23 samples were under the limits it was observed that the concentration of fluoride was directly proportional to the concentration of tds and it was considered that the concentration of fluoride in the water was of geological sources 3 5 spatial analysis of groundwater quality parameters gis map geographic information system gis is applied as a powerful tool for analyzing presenting and storing spatial data the spatial variations in groundwater quality are plans for sustainable water resources management geospatial is an important method for managing groundwater anand et al 2020 the spatial method in the gis was used to study the spatial changes in groundwater levels the inverse distance weighted idw method was applied to highlight neighboring sample locations values with a definite distance of the research area kumar et al 2018 the gis is a very capable tool to describe the sampling data spatially and is widely used by many researchers for plotting the physical and chemical parameters taloor et al 2020 the 25 groundwater sampling locations of larkana city were used in arc map to interpolate the results fig 3 showed gis map of the anions and cations a ca 2 b cl c mg 2 d hco3 e na and f so4 respectively the gis map showed the majority of groundwater samples of the study area were suitable for drinking purposes based on anions and cations and were found under the desirable limits hco3 mg 2 and na in a few locations crossed the permissible limits cl in six locations were above the permissible limits based on gis map fig 4 showed spatial distribution gis map of toxic heavy metals a pb b cd c cr and d ni parameters and results showed a majority of samples were within the who limits but some samples which were collected from the centre of the larkana city crossed the who guideline especially for pb and cd and showed health risk for peoples which were drinking contaminated groundwater fig 5 a as and 5b f map also showed most of the samples were within who guidelines and were suitable for drinking purposes as at one sample being above the limit and f in a few locations crossed the who limit 3 6 water quality index wqi for drinking and irrigation wqi tool was computed using groundwater quality parameters and were related to who guidelines the wqi was applied to know the suitability of groundwater for drinking the weight wi of parameters from 1 to 5 was given the maximum weight of 5 was given for those parameters which have a higher effect on human life table 3 the wqi is classified in 5 groups excellent less than 50 good between 50 and 100 poor between 100 and 200 very poor between 200 and 300 and unfit for drinking uses 300 shabbir and ahmad 2015 ketata rokbani et al 2011 the wqi in groundwater samples ranged from 27 02 to 120 02 the results of wqi of groundwater of taluka larkana indicated that samples 18 60 0 were in the excellent category 6 20 0 samples were good and 6 20 0 samples were in poor and no any sample was found in very poor category table 4 the wqi results showed that most of the taluka larkana groundwater was suitable for drinking purposes but 20 0 were classified as poor in water quality the wqi for irrigation was also examined to know groundwater s suitability for crops the wqi results for irrigation varied from 14 87 to 45 57 and showed 12 40 samples were found in the excellent category and 18 60 samples were in the good water category the results showed all samples were fit for irrigation based on wqi the gis map was also drawn to define the wqi for drinking and irrigation purposes the results showed that most samples were found excellent and good water category for drinking but five locations showed poor water quality for drinking fig 6 a the irrigation map s water quality index showed that all samples were found in excellent and good water quality for irrigation fig 6b 3 7 classifications and estimation of hydrochemistry of study area 3 7 1 weathering and ion exchange process the weathering and ion exchange are the main processes controlling the study area s geochemistry the scatter diagram in fig 7 a hco3 versus na is drawn to know the study area s weathering process if sample dots are gathered left side of the trend line it shows carbonate weathering if dots gather right side of the trendline it shows silicate weathering mgbenu and egbueri 2019 fig 7a showed that most of the sample dots gathered on both sides of the diagram and indicated that carbonate weathering and silicate weathering were the main characters in releasing hco3 and na ions fig 7b ca versus hco3 showed that sample dots gathered on both sides of the diagram and indicated that carbonate mineral calcite dissolution and carbonic acid weathering were the main characters in the release of ca ions from the waters the sample dots gathered on the left side of the trend line showed carbonic acid silicate weathering and dots gattered on the right side of the trendline indicated carbonate minerals weathering sample dots gathered along with the trendline showed calcite dissolution egbueri 2019 fig 7c showed that most samples were in reverse ion exchange and forward ion exchange process the na cl ratio equal to 1 shows the dissolution of halite however silicate weathering is responsible for na production if na cl ratio is 1 egbueri et al 2019 na cl ratio 1 shows forward exchange process fig 7d ca versus so4 showed both gypsum dissolution and also silicate weathering are predominant processes managed by the chemistry of major ions and hydrogeochemical progress of the selected study area the samples dots were gathered on both the side of the trend line the scatter plot also shows the correlation of parameters to each other the plot of ca2 mg2 against so4 2 hco3 was used to examine the effects of sulfate and carbonate minerals distribution in system the sample points along the 1 1 line are recognized to weathering of sulfate and carbonate minerals reverse ion exchange processes cause the points above the 1 1 line the data points below the aquiline are considered because of sulfates and carbonates dissolution the fig 7e showed that a few points fall around the 1 1 line some points were above the aquiline indicating the impacts of cation exchange and weathering of silicate minerals the 43 points dropped below the line and indicated the impact of the dissolution of sulfate and carbonate minerals garrels and mckenzie 1967 the evaporation may raise the level of species in water if evaporation dominates na cl ratio may be unchanged jankowski and acworth 1997 the plot na cl against ec could be a horizontal line the na cl molar ratio will be almost equal to one na is usually considered released from the silicate weathering meyback 1987 the molar ratio of na cl of groundwater samples in larkana was observed from 0 44 to 2 20 fig 7f more than half of samples of larkana had na cl molar ratio less than one 60 indicating the dissolution of halite as a primary process which was replaced due to the weathering of silicates in the area and 40 locations indicated na cl ratio greater than one the scatter diagram of ec versus na cl of groundwater samples displays that the trend line is inclined which showed that evaporation couldn t be a significant geochemical process based on monitoring groundwater geochemistry another factor affecting the groundwater is ion exchange and it regulates the transport of chemicals in aquifers and soil appelo and postma 2005 the ion exchange is studied in terms of chloro alkaline indices ca1 1 when ca 2 or mg 2 exchange takes place with na or k the values of ca1 1 was calculated using the following formula ca1 1 cl na k cl the results in indicate that 14 samples have negative values and 16 samples positive the negative values indicate an abundance of na and deficiency of ca 2 in groundwater the positive values indicate the opposite effect 3 8 gibbs diagram gibbs diagram is a way to assess the source of ions in the groundwater by focusing on the correlation among the level of cations and anions and tds gibbs ratio was calculated using the below formula gibbs ratio i for anion cl cl hco3 gibbs ratio ii for cation na k na k ca2 the distribution of cations na ca2 k and anions cl hco3 and tds results were used in the gibbs diagram to estimate precipitation evaporation dominance and rock dominance fig 8 a displays the gibbs diagram which is based on tds and results of anions the 60 0 samples showed rock dominance 40 0 samples showed evaporation crystallization dominance and no sample indicated precipitation dominance this characteristic showed that geochemistry of rock was a main source of groundwater in the study area figure 8b displays the gibbs diagram which is based on tds and results of cations it also indicates that the majority of cations in groundwater have rock dominance 56 67 43 33 of samples indicated evaporation crystallization dominance and no sample showed precipitation dominance the clarification for this phenomenon may be that some minerals calcite clays and rock forming silicates and alkali and alkaline earth salts and sulfates are present in the study area 3 9 hydrochemical faces the anions and cations characteristics in groundwater are due to groundwater interaction with rock and soil in the aquifer the chemical compositions of the aquifer are very important for groundwater s hydrochemical quality the hydrochemical composition is affected by the rocks aquifer and the groundwater flow hydrochemical facies of water may be assessed by plotting the major anions and cations such as co3 2 hco3 so4 2 cl mg2 ca2 na and k piper 1953 the piper s trilinear diagram showed the hydrochemical properties of groundwater the left triangle indicated 83 33 groundwater samples exposed at zone b which showed mixed type water and no dominancy

in zone b which indicated mixed type water and no dominancy of any parameters and 26 67 samples were found in zone e which showed dominancy of hco3 the zone e showed that groundwater was not influenced by the dissolution of the gypsum and evaporation processes fig 9 3 10 the diamond shaped may be classified into six basic types i mixed type ii sodium chloride type iii calcium bicarbonate

others it may be that the following species are present in water in order nahco3 nacl cahco3 3 11 chadha diagram in order to better expose the hydrogeochemical facies the chadha diagram was applied in the current work the groundwater was divided into 8 groups in the chart fig 10 fig 10 indicated that 23 76 67 samples were within zone 6 which indicated leaching of soluble salts in the unsaturated zone and may increase the level of na and cl during the formation of soil and usually arises in the top layer of the study area the 4 13 33 samples fell within zone 1 which showed that alkaline earth

respectively 3 14 cluster analysis ca the cluster analysis is applied for an alliance of groundwater samples by the similar locations and their chemical arrangement the samples with higher similarity are joined in the first group and then groups of the samples are combined with the linkage rule the steps are repeated till all explanations have been categorized banoeng yakubo et al 2009 the dendrogram was gained from ward s method to combine the 30 sampling locations with four clusters fig 12 based on cluster analysis cluster i comprised 15 samples 2 3 8 9 11 13 14 15 16 20 22 25 26 27

11926,water pollution has become one of the key global environmental problems heavy metal ions are major pollutants of water therefore this research is focused on fabrication of high efficient heavy metal adsorbing filter for water purification using low cost materials the filtering material has been fabricated by incorporating co precipitated magnetite nanoparticles into the micro porous kaolin granules the porosity of the magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin granules npikg is obtained by burning well ground rice husk at 6500 c for 3 h the synthesized npikg adsorbent efficiently adsorb heavy metal cations of lead and cadmium the adsorption for pb2 and cd2 ions are evaluated according to a series of initial metal ion concentrations from 10 00 ppm to 100 00 ppm and contact time ranges from 2 h to 24 h for bare kaolin granules kg and npikg characterization of samples involved ftir xrd aas sem and tem analytical techniques both types of adsorbents fitted well with freundlich adsorption isotherm model than langmuir isotherm adsorption capacity ranges of pb2 and cd2 for npikg according to langmuir isotherm are 294 909 and 1111 3333 mg kg respectively similarly adsorption capacity ranges of pb2 and cd2 for kg are 256 555 909 2500 mg kg respectively iron leaching of the fresh npikg is zero and already used npikg is less than 2 mg kg desorption of pb2 and cd2 ions is very low in npikg compared to kg adsorbent therefore both types of kaolin adsorbents are suitable for heavy metal adsorption from polluted water for the purification of water graphical abstract image 1 keywords porous kaolin magnetite nanoparticles heavy metal ion adsorption water purification 1 background water pollution has become one of the key global environmental problems andrejkovičová et al 2016 cai et al 2010 sis and uysal 2014 freshwater is an essential need for all species however freshwater in the world is very limited and due to human activities most of freshwater bodies have been contaminated andrejkovičová et al 2016 wang et al 2016 heavy metal ions are major pollutants of water andrejkovičová et al 2016 even lower concentrations of heavy metal ions in environment are harmful to organisms abdel halim et al 2013 kovacs and szemmelveisz 2017 shahid et al 2017 therefore enormous attempts have been made to treat and remove heavy metal ions from polluted water franco et al 2016 turgut et al 2020 kalkan et al 2012 nadaroglu et al 2010 celebi et al 2012 such methods include adsorption solvent extraction precipitation reverse osmosis ion exchange flotation and filtration however most of techniques used to remove heavy metal ions from polluted water are inefficient tedious and expensive wang et al 2016 therefore low cost simple and efficient methods are timely needed to remove heavy metal ions from contaminated water clayey materials such as silica fume r2 red mud r3 erzurum clay soil r4 and chitosan r1 are such low cost readily available materials with proved results for efficient removal of different heavy metal ions in recent literature similarly kaolin is a naturally occurring clay material which is extensively found in many countries in the world with large minable quantities dill 2016 obada et al 2016 fu and yang 2017 it is a lightweight soft sedimentary material that is known as china clay as well it is a natural adsorbent of metal ions kaolin contains about 85 amount of kaolinite which is a hydrous alumino silicate rest of kaolin composition contains mainly water and very low amounts of other metal oxides such as fe3o4 tio2 cao mgo na2o and k2o the amount of these minor constituents in kaolin varies according to the geographic region they exist however most of kaolin contains about 39 40 of alumina al2o3 45 47 of silica sio2 and 14 of water furthermore kaolin has a hexagon shaped crystal structure formed by 1 1 layered sheets layered structure consists of tetrahedral silica sheets linked to octahedral alumina sheets through hydrogen bondings so the chemical formula according to the structure of kaolin could be denoted as al2o3 2sio2 2h2o or al2si2o5oh porous kaolin has widely been used to treat colloidal particles in wastewater fu and yang 2017 hedfi et al 2016 sen et al 2002 yang et al 2016 herein while transportation of such colloids through porous kaolin materials colloidal particles are trapped in voids also while transportation toxic metal ions of such colloidal waste materials are adsorbed into the surface of kaolin as a result kaolin is widely used in wastewater treatment and as a water purifier liu et al 2016 zaki et al 2017 nanomaterials are very attractive in water purification applications due to their great surface area to volume ratio and exceptional properties pouran et al 2016 among nanomaterials iron oxide nanoparticles have become popular due to their broad range of advanced applications including catalysis information storage adsorbents medicine nano tagging ferrofluids and wastewater treatment pouran et al 2016 bagbi et al 2016 belachew and devibasavaiah 2016 siddiqi et al 2016 wu et al 2008 nanometer sized magnetite fe3o4 is one of major types of iron oxides nanoparticles wu et al 2008 iconaru et al 2016 magnetite nanoparticles efficiently adsorb toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions sen et al 2002 bagbi et al 2016 furthermore magnetite nanoparticles have other properties including magnetic photocatalytic sonocatalytic antibacterial and antifungal properties which are very useful in water purification belachew and devibasavaiah 2016 nguyen and kim 2016 bao et al 2013 makarchuk et al 2016 moreover they have a wide range of applications such as bioseparation biodetection bioconjugation biosensing as target carriers as magnetic record and magnetic ink materials as magnetically recyclable catalysts in organic as well as inorganic chemical synthesis as optical and electrical functionalized material like photo killing agents for pathogenic bacteria in addition magnetite is among the proven biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles which is highly reactive than any other that it is easily oxidized in air losing magnetism as well as dispersibility hence coating is essential for magnetite that makes it a promising cooperative agent for porous kaolin with high reactivity in comparison to all other iron oxide nanoparticles discovered so far moreover such nanoparticles can be synthesized with low cost methods and readily available cheap starting materials wu et al 2008 iconaru et al 2016 bao et al 2013 magnetite is a commonly available naturally occurring iron bearing mineral which can be converted into their nanoparticles by grinding techniques however the most common method to synthesize magnetite is precipitation using aqueous ferric and ferrous salts siddiqi et al 2016 iconaru et al 2016 nguyen and kim 2016 suppiah and hamid 2016 on contrary magnetite nanoparticles are discovered to be a chronic and pernicious neurotoxicant in recent literature but in co operation of magnetite nanoparticles with coating material as well as their high reactivity that they easily oxidize in air if leached gives promising hope that magnetite nanocomposites could not be hazardous in this study we have developed a novel simple low cost and efficient heavy metal adsorbing porous filter for water purification the novel filtering material has been fabricated by incorporating magnetite nanoparticles into the porous kaolin granules due to the use of highly heavy metal ion adsorbing magnetite nanoparticles and porous kaolin the final composite adsorbent showed a high efficiency in water purification the prepared filter efficiently adsorbs lead cadmium and zinc ions even in their lower concentrations 2

stirred for 1 h to synthesize fe3o4 nanoparticles the synthesized nanoparticles were washed three times using degassed double distilled water and then allowed to dry in a desiccator dried fe3o4 nanoparticles were ground well to use for the filter 2 3 preparation of porous kaolin granules a paste of kaolin and rice husk was prepared by adding 20 ml of distilled water to a mixture of powders of kaolin and rice husk herein based on studies the optimum mass ratio between kaolin and rice husk was maintained at 15 2 ratio the particle size of well ground rice husk powder was less than 500 μm kaolin granules kg were prepared using this paste in this kg preparation process first a wire mesh 2 5 mm mesh size was placed on the porcelain tile the paste of kaolin and rice husk was applied on the mesh paste was bedaubed on the whole area of mesh using a rubber block the wire mesh was taken out and the resulted raw sample was dried at 120 c for 4 h the dried product was burnt at 650 c for 3 h to obtain porous kg plates 2 4 preparation of magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin filter in the typical fabrication of magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin filter synthesized magnetite nanoparticles kaolin and rice husk were mixed together with the help of distilled water 15 ml in order to produce a paste the same procedure described in preceding section was used to produce magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin granules npikg filter the optimum composition of the material was studied with the aid of lead ion adsorption of the npikg filters 2 5 characterization techniques fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy of synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles was performed using avatar 320 thermo nicolet in the wave number range between 500 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 the samples were prepared by the pellet kbr method with sample kbr mass ratios of 1 100 crystalline phases of products were studied with the help of x ray diffraction xrd using a bruker d8 focus x ray powder diffractrometer cukα λ 0 154 nm 2θ range of 1 70 step size of 0 02 and a step time of 1 s cations of solutions were studied with the aid of gbc 932 ab atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas morphologies and porous structures of nmk sample was observed using hitachi su6600 scanning electron microscope sem with acceleration voltage of 15 kv jeol jem 2100 transmission electron microscopy tem was used 2 6 adsorption isotherm studies of heavy metals adsorption studies were conducted for the composites kg and npikg in order to identify the best fit isotherm model among langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm models in addition to the adsorption capacity using adsorption isotherms a pb2 standard stock solution of 1000 ppm was prepared and serial dilution was done to obtain 10 00 100 00 ppm pb2 solutions 10 00 20 00 30 00 40 00 50 00 60 00 70 00 80 00 90 00 100 0 ppm the amount of the adsorbent 5 0 g and 7 5 g and the contact time 2 4 6 and 24 h was varied in experiments the volume of the heavy metal solution 50 0 ml and the temperature 298 k was kept constant while each experiment was triplicated with constant shaking the adsorption studies were carried out with the same set of experiments for cd2 ions as well the adsorbent was filtered and the amount of heavy metal ions in the filtrate was determined by aas after necessary dilutions the adsorption capacity for each cation was calculated using following equation 1 1 q e c 0 c t v m where qe is the amount of each cation adsorbed on the adsorbent mg kg co and ct are cation concentration in solution before and after the adsorption mg dm 3 respectively m is the amount of adsorbent in the reaction mixture kg and v is the volume of the medium dm3 2 7 leaching studies of heavy metals at the leaching studies the desorption of the adsorbed heavy metal ions in to pure water was considered composites which were used for pb2 and cd2 adsorption tests were used in leaching analysis as well both kgs and npikgs were tested for leaching of pb2 and cd2 ions the studies were carried out by keeping the amount of the composite 5 0 g and the amount of distilled water used constant while changing the contact time 2 4 6 24 and 48 h the solutions were filtered and the desorbed amount of the heavy metals were analyzed using aas 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of magnetite nanoparticles xrd pattern in fig 1 a of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles confirms the presence of magnetite as only crystalline form of iron oxides tem image of the iron oxide product shows that magnetite nanoparticles are in their spherical shape with the particle diameter range between 6 nm and 25 nm fig 1 b ft ir results shown in fig 1 c further confirms that the iron oxide product is comprised of magnetite ir absorption bands observed at 3500 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 are corresponded to stretching and bending vibrations of o h bonds of h2o molecules attached to the surface of magnetite nanoparticles iconaru et al 2016 bands appeared at 580 cm 1 reveals the presence of fe o bond bagbi et al 2016 there is another indication at the downstream of ft ir spectrum which may be due to the vibrations of tetrahedral and octahedral configurations of fe o bonds sen et al 2002 3 2 characterization of magnetite nanoparticles incorporated porous kaolin filter sem images of npikg are shown in fig 2 irregular shapes of micro pores can be observed in npikg material plates of clay particles are also observed in these sem images xrd patterns of kg and npikg are shown in fig 3 xrd peaks of npikg at 2θ values of 27 9ᴼ 33 1ᴼ 35 7ᴼ and 64 6ᴼ reveal the presence of magnetite peaks of xrd pattern kg are clearly identified in npikg which represent crystalline materials of kaolin clay edx results as shown in fig 4 reveal that the npikg contains elements of al si k na ca mg o and fe according to the edx mapping results fe has been distributed well throughout the matrix of kg therefore magnetite nanoparticles have been coated well on porous kaolin clay of npikg furthermore synthesis procedure for npikg embedded rice husk filter material is optimized for mixing ratios of raw material and the drying and burning conditions to obtain much efficient well dispersed high wettable capacity and a clear coloured filter material avoiding black patches that results in burning through a series of batch experiments even though kaolin dishes were prepared for testing the proper composition of the mixture smallest granules are the proper candidate at adsorption tests because of their high surface area however pores are caused as a result of increasing the adsorbing surface area of both kaolin dishes and granules 3 3 adsorption isotherms the linear forms of the freundlich isotherm and langmuir isotherm models are being used to determine the best fit model for the adsorption of heavy metals in to kg and npikg composites due to their reliability and frequent use in literature to better describe the adsorption desorption data sets through basic simple calculations leading to complex conclusions i e adsorption being monolayer or multilayer since npikg shows more heterogeneous surface characters and the adsorption study involves a series of initial metal ion concentrations freundlich adsorption isotherm can be selected as the most suitable to model adsorption in npikg while a similar logic suggests that langmuir model is the most suited for adsorption in kg due to homogenous surface characters in addition the correlation coefficient r2 values indicates the degrees of the linearity of the obtained relationships of the graphs 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 3 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 q m k l 4 q e k f c e 1 n 5 log q e 1 n log c e log k f linear form of langmuir relationship equation 2 is represented in equation 3 where qe is amount adsorbed mg kg qm is maximum amount adsorbed mg kg while kl is langmuir constant which is constant for a given adsorbent similarly kf is freundlich adsorption constant and n is a constant for a given adsorbent however the freundlich relationship is linearized by obtaining the log mode of equation 4 as stated in equation 5 linearity of the adsorption behaviour depends on 1 n value if 1 n 0 adsorption is a constant and it will be independent from initial or equilibrium concentration if 1 n 1 adsorption is directly proportional with initial or equilibrium concentration and the graph contains the maximum linearity also if 1 n 1 then the adsorbate is weakly bound to the adsorbent and if 1 n 1 then the adsorbate is strongly bound to the adsorbent sen et al 2002 according to the results none of the values are exceeding 1 most of the 1 n values show an increment with increasing contact time and eventually has reached 1 as recorded in table 1 and table 2 hence linear relationship becomes better at higher contact times another evidence that could be taken out from the freundlich isotherm is the adsorption capacity the kf value intercept of the graph is a good indication of adsorption capacity the order of adsorption capacities is pb2 cd2 this observation is strongly agreed with raw data in tables 3 6 so it could be decided that freundlich adsorption isotherm is the most relevant isotherm for expressing adsorption behaviours of both kgs and npikgs intercept of the linear langmuir equation is the reciprocal of the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent tables 3 and 4 indicate the capacities at particular contact times the adsorption isotherms were plotted for both langmuir and freundlich models for the 5 0 g of the composites for pb2 adsorption and the results are being illustrated in fig 5 below according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data correlates well with the langmuir isotherm model for the kg composite at the time periods mentioned in the experimental section and for npikg composite the adsorption data is in accordance with the freundlich isotherms model at the time intervals where the experiment was conducted the isotherm plots of langmuir and freundlich models for the 7 5 g of the composites for pb2 adsorption are shown in fig 6 according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data correlates with both langmuir isotherm model and freundlich isotherms model for the kg composite but among them equilibrium data corresponds well with the langmuir model the equilibrium adsorption data for npikg composite is in accordance with the freundlich isotherms model at the time intervals thus according to the adsorption isotherms in figs 5 and 6 it can be stated that the adsorption of pb2 ions to the kg composite is in accordance with the langmuir isotherm model where monolayer adsorption occurs at the surface of the kg composite and adsorption of pb2 ions to the npikg composite complies with the freundlich isotherms model where multilayer adsorption occurs at the heterogenous surface of the npikg composite at the given concentration range the adsorption isotherms were plotted for both langmuir and freundlich models for the 5 0 g of the composites for cd2 adsorption and the results are being illustrated in fig 7 below according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data correlates well with the freundlich isotherm model for both the kg composite and the npikg composite at the time periods mentioned in the experimental the isotherm plots of langmuir and freundlich models for the 7 5 g of the composites for cd2 adsorption are shown in fig 8 values calculated from langmuir and freundlich isotherms can be summarized as mentioned in tbl5tables 5 and 6 tbl6 for pb2 and cd2 respectively according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data is in accordance with the freundlich isotherms model for both the kg and npikg composites hence the adsorption of cd2 ions on to the surface of the kg and npikg composites occurs according to the freundlich isotherms model as multilayer adsorption adsorption kinetics can be used to optimize the time consumption of an adsorption process pseudo first order kinetic model suggests that the kinetics of the adsorption process depends on the adsorbate concentration rather than the adsorbent concentration equation 6 shows the equation of the pseudo first order kinetic model where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 qt is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent at time t mg g 1 t is the time elapsed min and k1 is rate constant of pseudo 1st order model g mg 1 min 1 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e pseudo second order kinetic model in equation 7 where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 qt is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent at time t mg g 1 t is the time elapsed min and k2 is rate constant of pseudo 2nd order model g mg 1 min 1 suggests that the kinetics of the adsorption process depends on the adsorbent concentration rather than the adsorbate concentration generally it considers about the adsorption site concentration desorption studies for pb2 and cd2 desorbed amounts of pb2 and cd2 by kgs and npikgs are being illustrated in fig 9 according to the graphs the desorbed amount of pb2 and cd2 is higher in kg than that of npikg according to the adsorption study adsorption of pb2 by npikgs is significantly greater than that of kg hence according to the pb2 leaching test it could be stated that npikg is the best adsorbent for the removal of pb2 in addition same can be expressed for the adsorption of cd2 ions furthermore the adsorption and desorption of cd2 ions by kg and npikg composites are higher when compared to the adsorption and desorption of pb2 ions hence it can be concluded that npikg composite can be used effectively in removal of both pb2 and cd2 ions owing to having a higher adsorption and a lower desorption ability than kg composite in addition since main focus of the study is on npikg the contact time for desorption study can be stated as appropriate as the desorption quantity is much lower in comparison to kg on contrary it can be stated that npikg shows a reduced desorption ability of pb2 and cd2 over increasing contact time while kg behaves the opposite therefore it can be concluded that kg shows possibility to be reused but npikg does not under tested experimental conditions i e temperature pressure contact time ph condition 3 4 leaching of iron results of iron leaching experiments are shown in fig 10 cations of iron has not been leached into the solutions after dipping the fresh npikg adsorbent in distilled water however less than 2 mg kg of fe3 has been leached when heavy metal cations adsorbed npikg are dipped in distilled water this may be due to the exchange of fe3 ions of the adsorbent by pb2 of the solution the amount of fe3 that leached exchanging pb2 can be treated as negligible compared to the adsorption capacity

11926,water pollution has become one of the key global environmental problems heavy metal ions are major pollutants of water therefore this research is focused on fabrication of high efficient heavy metal adsorbing filter for water purification using low cost materials the filtering material has been fabricated by incorporating co precipitated magnetite nanoparticles into the micro porous kaolin granules the porosity of the magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin granules npikg is obtained by burning well ground rice husk at 6500 c for 3 h the synthesized npikg adsorbent efficiently adsorb heavy metal cations of lead and cadmium the adsorption for pb2 and cd2 ions are evaluated according to a series of initial metal ion concentrations from 10 00 ppm to 100 00 ppm and contact time

2016 cai et al 2010 sis and uysal 2014 freshwater is an essential need for all species however freshwater in the world is very limited and due to human activities most of freshwater bodies have been contaminated andrejkovičová et al 2016 wang et al 2016 heavy metal ions are major pollutants of water andrejkovičová et al 2016 even lower concentrations of heavy metal ions in environment are harmful to organisms abdel halim et al 2013 kovacs and szemmelveisz 2017 shahid et al 2017 therefore enormous attempts have been made to treat and remove heavy metal ions from polluted water franco et al 2016 turgut et al 2020 kalkan et al 2012 nadaroglu et al 2010 celebi et al 2012 such methods include adsorption solvent extraction precipitation reverse osmosis ion exchange flotation and filtration however most of techniques used to remove heavy metal ions from polluted water are inefficient tedious and expensive wang et al 2016 therefore low cost simple and efficient methods are timely needed to remove heavy metal ions from contaminated water clayey materials such as silica fume r2 red mud r3 erzurum clay soil r4 and chitosan r1 are such low cost readily available materials with proved results for efficient removal of different heavy metal ions in recent literature similarly kaolin is a naturally occurring clay material which is extensively found in many countries in the world with large minable quantities dill 2016 obada et al 2016 fu and yang 2017 it is a lightweight soft sedimentary material that is known as china clay as well it is a natural adsorbent of metal ions kaolin contains about 85 amount of kaolinite which is a hydrous alumino silicate rest of kaolin composition contains mainly water and very low amounts of other metal oxides such as fe3o4 tio2 cao mgo na2o and k2o the amount of these minor constituents in kaolin varies according to the geographic region they exist however most of kaolin contains about 39 40 of alumina al2o3 45 47 of silica sio2 and 14 of water furthermore kaolin has a hexagon shaped crystal structure formed by 1 1 layered sheets layered structure consists of tetrahedral silica sheets linked to octahedral alumina sheets through hydrogen bondings so the chemical formula according to the structure of kaolin could be denoted as al2o3 2sio2 2h2o or al2si2o5oh porous kaolin has widely been used to treat colloidal particles in wastewater fu and yang 2017 hedfi et al 2016 sen et al 2002 yang et al 2016 herein while transportation of such colloids through porous kaolin materials colloidal particles are trapped in voids also while transportation toxic metal ions of such colloidal waste materials are adsorbed into the surface of kaolin as a result kaolin is widely used in wastewater treatment and as a water purifier liu et al 2016 zaki et al 2017 nanomaterials are very attractive in water purification applications due to their great surface area to volume ratio and exceptional properties pouran et al 2016 among nanomaterials iron oxide nanoparticles have become popular due to their broad range of advanced applications including catalysis information storage adsorbents medicine nano tagging ferrofluids and wastewater treatment pouran et al 2016 bagbi et al 2016 belachew and devibasavaiah 2016 siddiqi et al 2016 wu et al 2008 nanometer sized magnetite fe3o4 is one of major types of iron oxides nanoparticles wu et al 2008 iconaru et al 2016 magnetite nanoparticles efficiently adsorb toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions sen et al 2002 bagbi et al 2016 furthermore magnetite nanoparticles have other properties including magnetic photocatalytic sonocatalytic antibacterial and antifungal properties which are very useful in water purification belachew and devibasavaiah 2016 nguyen and kim 2016 bao et al 2013 makarchuk et al 2016 moreover they have a wide range of applications such as bioseparation biodetection bioconjugation biosensing as target carriers as magnetic record and magnetic ink materials as magnetically recyclable catalysts in organic as well as inorganic chemical synthesis as optical and electrical functionalized material like photo killing agents for pathogenic bacteria in addition magnetite is among the proven biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles which is highly reactive than any other that it is easily oxidized in air losing magnetism as well as dispersibility hence coating is essential for magnetite that makes it a promising cooperative agent for porous kaolin with high reactivity in comparison to all other iron oxide nanoparticles discovered so far moreover such nanoparticles can be synthesized with low cost methods and readily available cheap starting materials wu et al 2008 iconaru et al 2016 bao et al 2013 magnetite is a commonly available naturally occurring iron bearing mineral which can be converted into their nanoparticles by grinding techniques however the most common method to synthesize magnetite is precipitation using aqueous ferric and ferrous salts siddiqi et al 2016 iconaru et al 2016 nguyen and kim 2016 suppiah and hamid 2016 on contrary magnetite nanoparticles are discovered to be a chronic and pernicious neurotoxicant in recent literature but in co operation of magnetite nanoparticles with coating material as well as their high reactivity that they easily oxidize in air if leached gives promising hope that magnetite nanocomposites could not be hazardous in this study we have developed a novel simple low cost and efficient heavy metal adsorbing porous filter for water purification the novel filtering material has been fabricated by incorporating magnetite nanoparticles into the porous kaolin granules due to the use of highly heavy metal ion adsorbing magnetite nanoparticles and porous kaolin the final composite adsorbent showed a high efficiency in water purification the prepared filter efficiently adsorbs lead cadmium and zinc ions even in their lower concentrations 2

stirred for 1 h to synthesize fe3o4 nanoparticles the synthesized nanoparticles were washed three times using degassed double distilled water and then allowed to dry in a desiccator dried fe3o4 nanoparticles were ground well to use for the filter 2 3 preparation of porous kaolin granules a paste of kaolin and rice husk was prepared by adding 20 ml of distilled water to a mixture of powders of kaolin and rice husk herein based on studies the optimum mass ratio between kaolin and rice husk was maintained at 15 2 ratio the particle size of well ground rice husk powder was less than 500 μm kaolin granules kg were prepared using this paste in this kg preparation process first a wire mesh 2 5 mm mesh size was placed on the porcelain tile the paste of kaolin and rice husk was applied on the mesh paste was bedaubed on the whole area of mesh using a rubber block the wire mesh was taken out and the resulted raw sample was dried at 120 c for 4 h the dried product was burnt at 650 c for 3 h to obtain porous kg plates 2 4 preparation of magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin filter in the typical fabrication of magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin filter synthesized magnetite nanoparticles kaolin and rice husk were mixed together with the help of distilled water 15 ml in order to produce a paste the same procedure described in preceding section was used to produce magnetite nanoparticles incorporated kaolin granules npikg filter the optimum composition of the material was studied with the aid of lead ion adsorption of the npikg filters 2 5 characterization techniques fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy of synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles was performed using avatar 320 thermo nicolet in the wave number range between 500 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 the samples were prepared by the pellet kbr method with sample kbr mass ratios of 1 100 crystalline phases of products were studied with the help of x ray diffraction xrd using a bruker d8 focus x ray powder diffractrometer cukα λ 0 154 nm 2θ range of 1 70 step size of 0 02 and a step time of 1 s cations of solutions were studied with the aid of gbc 932 ab atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas morphologies and porous structures of nmk sample was observed using hitachi su6600 scanning electron microscope sem with acceleration voltage of 15 kv jeol jem 2100 transmission electron microscopy tem was used 2 6 adsorption isotherm studies of heavy metals adsorption studies were conducted for the composites kg and npikg in order to identify the best fit isotherm model among langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm models in addition to the adsorption capacity using adsorption isotherms a pb2 standard stock solution of 1000 ppm was prepared and serial dilution was done to obtain 10 00 100 00 ppm pb2 solutions 10 00 20 00 30 00 40 00 50 00 60 00 70 00 80 00 90 00 100 0 ppm the amount of the adsorbent 5 0 g and 7 5 g and the contact time 2 4 6 and 24 h was varied in experiments the volume of the heavy metal solution 50 0 ml and the temperature 298 k was kept constant while each experiment was triplicated with constant shaking the adsorption studies were carried out with the same set of experiments for cd2 ions as well the adsorbent was filtered and the amount of heavy metal ions in the filtrate was determined by aas after necessary dilutions the adsorption capacity for each cation was calculated using following equation 1 1 q e c 0 c t v m where qe is the amount of each cation adsorbed on the adsorbent mg kg co and ct are cation concentration in solution before and after the adsorption mg dm 3 respectively m is the amount of adsorbent in the reaction mixture kg and v is the volume of the medium dm3 2 7 leaching studies of heavy metals at the leaching studies the desorption of the adsorbed heavy metal ions in to pure water was considered composites which were used for pb2 and cd2 adsorption tests were used in leaching analysis as well both kgs and npikgs were tested for leaching of pb2 and cd2 ions the studies were carried out by keeping the amount of the composite 5 0 g and the amount of distilled water used constant while changing the contact time 2 4 6 24 and 48 h the solutions were filtered and the desorbed amount of the heavy metals were analyzed using aas 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of magnetite nanoparticles xrd pattern in fig 1 a of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles confirms the presence of magnetite as only crystalline form of iron oxides tem image of the iron oxide product shows that magnetite nanoparticles are in their spherical shape with the particle diameter range between 6 nm and 25 nm fig 1 b ft ir results shown in fig 1 c further confirms that the iron oxide product is comprised of magnetite ir absorption bands observed at 3500 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 are corresponded to stretching and bending vibrations of o h bonds of h2o molecules attached to the surface of magnetite nanoparticles iconaru et al 2016 bands appeared at 580 cm 1 reveals the presence of fe o bond bagbi et al 2016 there is another indication at the downstream of ft ir spectrum which may be due to the vibrations of tetrahedral and octahedral configurations of fe o bonds sen et al 2002 3 2 characterization of magnetite nanoparticles incorporated porous kaolin filter sem images of npikg are shown in fig 2 irregular shapes of micro pores can be observed in npikg material plates of clay particles are also observed in these sem images xrd patterns of kg and npikg are shown in fig 3 xrd peaks of npikg at 2θ values of 27 9ᴼ 33 1ᴼ 35 7ᴼ and 64 6ᴼ reveal the presence of magnetite peaks of xrd pattern kg are clearly identified in npikg which represent crystalline materials of kaolin clay edx results as shown in fig 4 reveal that the npikg contains elements of al si k na ca mg o and fe according to the edx mapping results fe has been distributed well throughout the matrix of kg therefore magnetite nanoparticles have been coated well on porous kaolin clay of npikg furthermore synthesis procedure for npikg embedded rice husk filter material is optimized for mixing ratios of raw material and the drying and burning conditions to obtain much efficient well dispersed high wettable capacity and a clear coloured filter material avoiding black patches that results in burning through a series of batch experiments even though kaolin dishes were prepared for testing the proper composition of the mixture smallest granules are the proper candidate at adsorption tests because of their high surface area however pores are caused as a result of increasing the adsorbing surface area of both kaolin dishes and granules 3 3 adsorption isotherms the linear forms of the freundlich isotherm and langmuir isotherm models are being used to determine the best fit model for the adsorption of heavy metals in to kg and npikg composites due to their reliability and frequent use in literature to better describe the adsorption desorption data sets through basic simple calculations leading to complex conclusions i e adsorption being monolayer or multilayer since npikg shows more heterogeneous surface characters and the adsorption study involves a series of initial metal ion concentrations freundlich adsorption isotherm can be selected as the most suitable to model adsorption in npikg while a similar logic suggests that langmuir model is the most suited for adsorption in kg due to homogenous surface characters in addition the correlation coefficient r2 values indicates the degrees of the linearity of the obtained relationships of the graphs 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 3 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 q m k l 4 q e k f c e 1 n 5 log q e 1 n log c e log k f linear form of langmuir relationship equation 2 is represented in equation 3 where qe is amount adsorbed mg kg qm is maximum amount adsorbed mg kg while kl is langmuir constant which is constant for a given adsorbent similarly kf is freundlich adsorption constant and n is a constant for a given adsorbent however the freundlich relationship is linearized by obtaining the log mode of equation 4 as stated in equation 5 linearity of the adsorption behaviour depends on 1 n value if 1 n 0 adsorption is a constant and it will be independent from initial or equilibrium concentration if 1 n 1 adsorption is directly proportional with initial or equilibrium concentration and the graph contains the maximum linearity also if 1 n 1 then the adsorbate is weakly bound to the adsorbent and if 1 n 1 then the adsorbate is strongly bound to the adsorbent sen et al 2002 according to the results none of the values are exceeding 1 most of the 1 n values show an increment with increasing contact time and eventually has reached 1 as recorded in table 1 and table 2 hence linear relationship becomes better at higher contact times another evidence that could be taken out from the freundlich isotherm is the adsorption capacity the kf value intercept of the graph is a good indication of adsorption capacity the order of adsorption capacities is pb2 cd2 this observation is strongly agreed with raw data in tables 3 6 so it could be decided that freundlich adsorption isotherm is the most relevant isotherm for expressing adsorption behaviours of both kgs and npikgs intercept of the linear langmuir equation is the reciprocal of the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent tables 3 and 4 indicate the capacities at particular contact times the adsorption isotherms were plotted for both langmuir and freundlich models for the 5 0 g of the composites for pb2 adsorption and the results are being illustrated in fig 5 below according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data correlates well with the langmuir isotherm model for the kg composite at the time periods mentioned in the experimental section and for npikg composite the adsorption data is in accordance with the freundlich isotherms model at the time intervals where the experiment was conducted the isotherm plots of langmuir and freundlich models for the 7 5 g of the composites for pb2 adsorption are shown in fig 6 according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data correlates with both langmuir isotherm model and freundlich isotherms model for the kg composite but among them equilibrium data corresponds well with the langmuir model the equilibrium adsorption data for npikg composite is in accordance with the freundlich isotherms model at the time intervals thus according to the adsorption isotherms in figs 5 and 6 it can be stated that the adsorption of pb2 ions to the kg composite is in accordance with the langmuir isotherm model where monolayer adsorption occurs at the surface of the kg composite and adsorption of pb2 ions to the npikg composite complies with the freundlich isotherms model where multilayer adsorption occurs at the heterogenous surface of the npikg composite at the given concentration range the adsorption isotherms were plotted for both langmuir and freundlich models for the 5 0 g of the composites for cd2 adsorption and the results are being illustrated in fig 7 below according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data correlates well with the freundlich isotherm model for both the kg composite and the npikg composite at the time periods mentioned in the experimental the isotherm plots of langmuir and freundlich models for the 7 5 g of the composites for cd2 adsorption are shown in fig 8 values calculated from langmuir and freundlich isotherms can be summarized as mentioned in tbl5tables 5 and 6 tbl6 for pb2 and cd2 respectively according to the adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption data is in accordance with the freundlich isotherms model for both the kg and npikg composites hence the adsorption of cd2 ions on to the surface of the kg and npikg composites occurs according to the freundlich isotherms model as multilayer adsorption adsorption kinetics can be used to optimize the time consumption of an adsorption process pseudo first order kinetic model suggests that the kinetics of the adsorption process depends on the adsorbate concentration rather than the adsorbent concentration equation 6 shows the equation of the pseudo first order kinetic model where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 qt is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent at time t mg g 1 t is the time elapsed min and k1 is rate constant of pseudo 1st order model g mg 1 min 1 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e pseudo second order kinetic model in equation 7 where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g 1 qt is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent at time t mg g 1 t is the time elapsed min and k2 is rate constant of pseudo 2nd order model g mg 1 min 1 suggests that the kinetics of the adsorption process depends on the adsorbent concentration rather than the adsorbate concentration generally it considers about the adsorption site concentration desorption studies for pb2 and cd2 desorbed amounts of pb2 and cd2 by kgs and npikgs are being illustrated in fig 9 according to the graphs the desorbed amount of pb2 and cd2 is higher in kg than that of npikg according to the adsorption study adsorption of pb2 by npikgs is significantly greater than that of kg hence according to the pb2 leaching test it could be stated that npikg is the best adsorbent for the removal of pb2 in addition same can be expressed for the adsorption of cd2 ions furthermore the adsorption and desorption of cd2 ions by kg and npikg composites are higher when compared to the adsorption and desorption of pb2 ions hence it can be concluded that npikg composite can be used effectively in removal of both pb2 and cd2 ions owing to having a higher adsorption and a lower desorption ability than kg composite in addition since main focus of the study is on npikg the contact time for desorption study can be stated as appropriate as the desorption quantity is much lower in comparison to kg on contrary it can be stated that npikg shows a reduced desorption ability of pb2 and cd2 over increasing contact time while kg behaves the opposite therefore it can be concluded that kg shows possibility to be reused but npikg does not under tested experimental conditions i e temperature pressure contact time ph condition 3 4 leaching of iron results of iron leaching experiments are shown in fig 10 cations of iron has not been leached into the solutions after dipping the fresh npikg adsorbent in distilled water however less than 2 mg kg of fe3 has been leached when heavy metal cations adsorbed npikg are dipped in distilled water this may be due to the exchange of fe3 ions of the adsorbent by pb2 of the solution the amount of fe3 that leached exchanging pb2 can be treated as negligible compared to the adsorption capacity therefore it can be concluded that npikg does not show any chemical behavioural changes over time 4 conclusions in this work simple novel and low cost method is developed to fabricate micro porous kg and npikg sorbents for the removal of pb2 and cd2 heavy metal ions from wastewater at ambient temperature in addition in co operation of magnetite npikg and burnt rice husk plates as a filter material proposes an economical efficient way in heavy metal ion removal from contaminated water this study reveals that npikg is the best adsorbent for the removal of pb2 and cd2 ions both types of adsorbents fitted well with freundlich adsorption isotherm model than langmuir isotherm adsorption capacity ranges of pb2 and cd2 for npikg according to langmuir isotherm are 294 909 and 1111 3333 mg kg respectively adsorption capacity ranges of pb2 and cd2 for kg according to langmuir isotherms are 256 555 909 2500 mg kg respectively iron leaching of the fresh npikg is zero and already used npikg is less than 2 mg kg desorption of pb2 and cd2 ions is very low in npikg compared to kg adsorbent therefore both types of kaolin adsorbents are suitable for heavy metal adsorption from polluted water for

11927,deterioration of groundwater quality is a matter of serious concern today in mandla region of central india fluorosis is common among the local people due to consumption of fluoride contaminated

global standard for drinking purpose however above 500 m msl groundwater is not contaminated with fluoride and is suitable for drinking and irrigation purpose fluoride concentration maps depict spatial and seasonal variation spatial variation of fluoride in groundwater is due to change in aquifer lithology varying degree of rock weathering and orientation of structural lineaments in fluoride concentration map of post monsoon season broadening of contour of uncontaminated zone indicates groundwater recharge which corroborates with water fluctuation map the fluoride contaminated water and low fluoride water are mainly na hco3 and ca hco3 type respectively the hydrochemical processes suggest pre dominance of rock water interaction contribution of na and k ions in groundwater is due to

cracks fissures joints and faults act as principal storehouse of groundwater overall yield range in basaltic aquifer is 10 50 m3day 1 cgwb 2017 weathered fractured and vesicular basaltic layers of traps form productive unconfined to semi confined shallow aquifers whereas deeper aquifers are confined in nature an integrated study of deccan basalt indicates low hydraulic conductivity with a high degree of inhomogeneity kulkarni et al 2000 although interflow spaces in between two successive flows are better source of water supply in deccan traps the transmissivity is found to vary in a wide range depending on the aquifer type according to deolankar 1981 transmissivity of weathered vesicular and fractured basalts of the deccan trap ranges from 90 200 m2day 1 50 100 m2day 1 and 20 40 m2day 1 respectively moreover storativity and hydraulic conductivity vary from 1 to 4 and 5 to 15 mday 1 respectively depending upon the fractures according to the groundwater fluctuation data of water resource department jabalpur wrd during pre monsoon may 2019 general depth to water level range from 1 55 to 11 35 m below ground level bgl with an average 6 17 m bgl on the other hand during august 2019 depth to water level ranges between 0 and 6 5 m with an average 1 75 m bgl it indicates that during pre monsoon water level drops but the variation in groundwater level as a whole is minimal fig 2 groundwater flow as indicated in the water fluctuation map fig 2 is towards the central and north western part of the study area 3 material and methods to evaluate the groundwater quality of mandla area and to identify different hydrochemical processes of both low fluoride and fluoride contaminated groundwater water samples were collected a total of 173 samples were collected from both shallow and deeper sources i e from dug wells tube wells borewells and a warm spring depth of the borewells and tube wells from where the water samples were collected are provided by public health and engineering department phed mandla however the water levels in dug wells were measured on site by measuring tape the depth to water level below ground surface bgl of each dug well tube well and borewell was subtracted from the ground elevation above mean sea level at that well location in order to take into consideration variation in ground surface elevation with change in well locations the water samples were collected in 1 litre high density polyethylene hdpe bottles after collection samples were sent to the chemical laboratory of geological survey of india bhopal for further detailed chemical analysis among 173 water samples 70 pre monsoon samples 16 shallow wells 54 deeper wells were collected in the month of may 2019 and the 103 post monsoon samples 28 shallow wells 75 deeper wells were collected during november 2019 the parameters which are prone to change with time such as temperature hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured on site by hanna combo ph and ec kit during sampling the parameters like ca2 mg2 na k f co3 2 hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and total hardness th as caco3 were analyzed for complete analysis of water samples these parameters were measured as described by the american public health association apha awwa wef 2012 na and k were determined by flame photometer method no3 and so4 2 were analyzed by spectrophotometer th as caco3 ca2 co3 2 hco3 and cl were analyzed by volumetric method fluoride f was measured by using orion make ion selective electrode model no orion stara214 with instrumental lld 0 02 mg l 1 to saturation charge balance error of all water samples are within 10 details of various physico chemical parameters are tabulated and compared with bis 2012 and who 2017 guidelines in

representation respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 physico chemical characteristics of groundwater the ranges and average of temperature ph ec tds th and all major ions of analyzed water samples are given in table 1 with respect to the maximum desirable and permissible limits recommended by who 2017 and bis 2012 the maximum temperature of 36 6 c was measured in a warm spring at babeha higher temperature of groundwater negatively impacts water quality as it causes microbial proliferation and reduces solubility of o2 co2 n2 and ch4 yilmaz and koc 2014 overall groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline with tds values within the recommended guideline by who 2017 for drinking water based on wilcox classification 1955 of ec 87 4 of water is good 11 5 of water is permissible and only 1 15 is excellent for consumption according to total hardness as caco3 classification 32 4 19 1 10 4 and 38 2 of the water samples are categorized as soft moderately hard hard and very hard water respectively the concentration ranges of ca2 mg2 na and k are 0 264 mg l 1 2 43 63 2 mg l 1 5 10 216 mg l 1 and 0 10 56 8 mg l 1 respectively it is well known that due to rock water interaction the concentration of ca2 ion in groundwater may be derived from calcium rich minerals like calcite dolomite feldspar amphibole and pyroxene mg2 ion is derived due to ion exchange of minerals between aquifer and groundwater whereas na ion is derived due to cation exchange process aghazadeh and mogaddam 2010 the concentration ranges of anions like hco3 co3 2 no3 so4 2 f and cl are 0 651 mg l 1 0 48 mg l 1 0 234 mg l 1 1 306 mg l 1 0 20 19 9 mg l 1 and 6 02 209 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of major cations and anions in pre monsoon and post monsoon samples are represented in box and whisker plot fig 3 however no such remarkable chemical compositional variation has been observed in pre and post monsoon samples the maximum fluoride concentration of 19 9 mg l 1 during pre monsoon was measured in the warm spring at babeha 4 2 hydrochemical process the diagnostic chemical species in groundwater is termed as hydrochemical facies which is controlled by the lithology of an aquifer solution kinetics and the flow pattern back 1960 interpretations of major ion chemistry help to describe the rock water interaction patterns of an aquifer system during interpretation all the 173 samples were grouped into two categories based on the fluoride permissible limit i groundwater having f 1 5 mg l 1 i e low fluoride and ii groundwater having f 1 5 mg l 1 i e fluoride contaminated water gibb s diagrams gibbs 1970 fig 4 a d reveal that groundwater samples collected during pre and post monsoon period had dominant rock water interaction activities both for fluoride contaminated and low fluoride water inter relationship amongst major ions is used to identify the chemical reactions in the rock water interaction process which are responsible for the groundwater composition the na cl vs ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 plots show negative correlation fig 4e and f indicating ion exchange process is mainly responsible for the major ions concentration in fluoride contaminated water f 1 5 mg l 1 however in low fluoride water f 1 5 mg l 1 samples spread both above and below the equiline indicating apart from ion exchange some other processes are also involved in ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 fig 4g and h fluoride contaminated water samples mostly plot above the equiline indicating that contributions of ca2 and mg2 ions in groundwater are mainly due to carbonate weathering the samples plotted along the equiline represent the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum singh et al 2012 the samples plotted towards the dominant concentration of hco3 so4 2 represent the ion exchange process and towards ca2 mg2 represent reverse ion exchange cerling et al 1989 fisher and mullican 1997 moreover in fig 5 h 11 5 fluoride contaminated water and 42 0 low fluoride water are plotted both along and below the equiline indicating that ca2 and mg2 ions are contributed by carbonate as well as silicate weathering the upper limit of contribution from carbonate weathering is demarcated by ca2 mg2 vs hco3 scatter plot fig 4i and j singh et al 2012 the fluoride contaminated f 1 5 mg l 1 water samples are plotted above the equiline at relatively lower concentration and at higher concentration bicarbonate is independent with respect to calcium and magnesium therefore maximum ca2 and mg2 ions are derived from carbonate source in contaminated water whereas low fluoride water has mixed source carbonate and non carbonate higher concentration of hco3 among the anions is mainly controlled by both carbonate and silicate weathering lakshmanan et al 2005 the scatter plots of na vs hco3 na vs cl and na k vs total cations fig 5a f indicate that the source of hco3 na and k in fluoride contaminated groundwater is due to silicate weathering fluoride contaminated water samples in the plots of ca2 mg2 vs total cations fig 5g and h deviated from the equiline whereas in na k vs total cations graph they approach the 1 1 equiline which signifies increasing contribution of na and k ions at higher concentration negative values of chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 fig 5i and j also support the ion exchange process for fluoride contaminated water whereas the positive value for low fluoride water indicates inverse or reverse ion exchange process schoeller 1965 1977bib schoeller 1977 bib schoeller 1965 the facies type of water samples is evaluated by piper s piper 1944 diagram piper s diagram fig 6 a and b for both pre and post monsoon samples shows that water is dominantly sodium bicarbonate na hco3 type calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 type and very few samples are sodium chloride na cl type fluoride contaminated water is na hco3 type whereas low fluoride water is ca hco3 type sodium chloride na cl type of water from pre monsoon to post monsoon decreases from 21 4 to 5 80 respectively fig 6a and b the relative increase of na cl type water during pre monsoon is due to firstly local effect of evapotranspiration process in near surface secondly during hot dry spell water level drops but water demand for irrigation and domestic use increases resulting in heavy pumping and extraction of deeper saline water below 25 m bgl which causes a shift towards na cl type 4 3 saturation index chemical equilibrium of water with respect to various mineral phases is determined by the rate of chemical reaction and composition of groundwater this equilibrium phase of water can be calculated by saturation index si of the minerals from the chemical data of water garrels and mackenzie 1967 it helps to identify the controlling geochemical reaction for groundwater quality drever 1997 si of any mineral is represented by s a t u r a t i o n i n d e x s i log i a p k t where iap is ion activity product of the dissociated chemical species in solution and kt is an equilibrium solubility product for the same chemical species considered at the sample temperature this parameter is calculated by using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 irrespective of fluoride concentration in groundwater halite sylvite anhydrite and gypsum are undersaturated fig 6c and d in fluoride contaminated water minerals like calcite dolomite and aragonite are supersaturated supersaturation of these minerals in fluoride contaminated water signifies huge removal of calcium due to precipitation kim and jeong 2005 saxena and ahmed 2001 wang et al 2009 overall the saturation index value of fluorite has positive correlation with fluoride concentration in water additionally the water samples having very high fluoride concentration above 8 mg l 1 are fluorite supersaturated however all the low fluoride water samples are undersaturated with respect to fluorite indicating chances of more dissolution of fluorite in water the precipitation of calcium from groundwater because of dissolution of fluorite caf2 prevents the precipitation of fluorine which increases fluoride concentration in groundwater on the other hand supersaturation of dolomite and aragonite in the fluoride contaminated water also support the precipitation of calcium 4 4 hydrogeochemistry and fluoride contaminated water the fluoride contamination of groundwater is the sole problem concerning community health in mandla area aquifer lithology in any area may act as the source of contaminant but its concentration in groundwater depends on various additional factors such as ph temperature availability of ions age of the groundwater residence time and availability of structural deformation kim and jeong 2005 saxena and ahmed 2001 in the study area fluoride concentration of groundwater has a positive correlation with ph table 2 the alkaline water ph 7 5 facilitates the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater the justification behind this mechanism could be two folds firstly bicarbonate enrichment in alkaline water could be responsible for dissociation and dissolution of f ion in groundwater from the weathered rocks rao et al 1993 subba rao 2006 secondly an alkaline condition of water ph 7 5 also facilitates the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater due to replacement of exchangeable f ion with oh ion in fluorine bearing mineral amphibole biotite etc li et al 2013 in addition to ph fluoride concentration also has a positive correlation with na and has a negative correlation with ca2 mg2 and total hardness as caco3 table 2 piper s diagram shows na hco3 type water is mainly fluoride contaminated fig 6a and b the correlation between f and cl ion is used to reveal the origin of f ion in groundwater olaka et al 2016 the f vs f cl plot fig 7 a and b shows that the ratio of f cl increases with increase in f concentration whereas cl concentration is relatively consistent on the other hand cl concentration is low at higher concentration of f from f vs f cl plot three processes can be possible to deduce such as the evaporation line increasing f constantly low f cl ratio geogenic enrichment f and f cl increase since cl does not change and the geothermally influenced system with low f and lowest cl below 1 mg l 1 olaka et al 2016 su et al 2015 in studied samples especially for fluorine contaminated groundwater relatively high f cl ratio indicates the geogenic origin of fluorine fig 7a and b additionally along with the geogenic factor ph of water and its residence time in the particular aquifer plays an important role a plot of elevation amsl of water level from where the water was drawn vs fluoride concentration fig 7c and d shows that water samples drawn from wells below 500 m amsl have higher fluoride concentration than water drawn from wells above 500 m amsl fig 7c and d during field investigation it was observed that fluoride contamination of groundwater is mostly limited to a depth range of 25 175 m bgl therefore to assess the role of depth to water level in fluoride contamination the samples plotted against fluoride concentration and elevation above msl are divided into four categories i e shallow water 0 25 m bgl with low ph 7 5 shallow water 0 25 m bgl with high ph 7 5 deep water 25 175 m bgl with low ph 7 5 and deep water 25 175 m bgl with high ph 7 5 fig 7c and d deep alkaline groundwater 25 175 m bgl drawn from wells present below 500 m amsl is highly contaminated with fluoride this contamination is strongly dependent on ph and is facilitated under alkaline condition only whereas water drawn from wells present above 500 m amsl is not contaminated with fluoride regardless of depth to water level 0 175 m bgl and ph condition of water therefore the surface at 500 m amsl here acts as a marker separating contaminated and uncontaminated aquifers since rock weathering is the dominant hydrochemical process operating here we infer that aquifer lithology contributes to fluoride contamination furthermore we correlate the two aquifers with two distinct stratigraphic layers corresponding to mandla basalt formation 350 500 m amsl and dhuma basalt formation 500 660 m amsl fig 1b the spatial and seasonal variation of fluoride concentration is given in the fluoride concentration map prepared for both pre and post monsoon periods fig 8 in comparison with pre monsoon fig 8a the post monsoon map fig 8b depicts slight contraction in contamination zone owing to recharge and water mixing to some extent due to monsoonal rain fluoride concentration maps fig 8 depict that aquifers in central and north western part are more contaminated and concentration of fluoride increased along the flow path as marked in fig 2 groundwater flow path in fig 2 signifies longer residence time of water downstream at relatively lower elevation which favours fluoride accumulation as indicated in fig 8 archean granite and gneiss and lameta limestone are exposed only in the southern part of the study area fig 1 where both shallow and deeper groundwater is not contaminated with fluoride which is reflected well in fluoride concentration maps fig 8 additionally it is also observed that fluoride contaminated zones mostly lie along structural lineaments fig 8 which indicates plausible control of lineaments in groundwater contamination therefore lithology structural lineaments groundwater residence time and groundwater chemistry play an important role in fluoride contamination in this region 4 5 water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes suitability of groundwater for drinking and agriculture purposes has been evaluated by analyzing the major ion composition all the values of hydrogeochemical parameters are compared with the permissible limit of who 2017 and indian standard for drinking water bis 2012 in table 1 ph of 53 2 samples analyzed is above or below the permissible limit range and only 46 8 is found within the limit 7 5 8 5 however tds value of all samples is found below 1000 mg l 1 the total hardness of only 34 1 of samples is above the permissible limit whereas rests of the samples are within the limit continuous consumption of the hard water causes urolithiasis cardio vascular disorder and parental mortality agarwal and jagetia 1997 amongst the cations calcium and magnesium concentrations are mostly within the permissible limit however in 17 3 and 11 0 of groundwater samples calcium and magnesium respectively exceed the permissible limit the excess consumption of calcium may increase the risk of kidney stone among anions 54 9 and 41 0 of the water has an excess concentration of bicarbonate and fluoride i e above the permissible limit as discussed in the previous section the fluoride contaminated water has a strong correlation with bicarbonate ions and the inhabitants consuming such groundwater are under high health risk although among 173 samples only 8 samples have no3 concentration and 1 sample have so4 2 concentration above the permissible limit excessive consumption of no3 results in serious health problem like gastric cancer birth malformations hypertension and methaemoglobinaemia in infants majumder and gupta 2000 sodium concentration and electrical conductivity of water are the most important factors for the assessment of irrigation quality excess concentration of sodium in the water affects plant growth and could disturb the soil structure as well the parameters like sodium adsorption ratio sar richard 1954 residual sodium carbonate rsc eaton 1950 lloyd and heathcote 1985 soluble sodium percentage ssp doneen 1954 kelly s ratio karanth 1987 and permeability index pi doneen 1962 are used to determine the water quality for irrigation purpose in mandla district groundwater is classified for irrigation purpose in relation with fluoride concentration f 1 5 mg l 1 and f 1 5 mg l 1 for both pre and post monsoon season table 3 the relative activity of na ion during exchange reaction with soil is expressed as sar hwang et al 2017 richard 1954 as per calculation shown in table 3 the low fluoride water f 1 5 mg l 1 is more suitable for irrigation purpose than the contaminated water based on sar value 47 1 and 66 0 of the low f groundwater are categorized as excellent for pre monsoon and post monsoon samples respectively richard 1954 rsc values in 14 3 and 27 2 of uncontaminated groundwater is good safe whereas 22 9 and 20 4 in medium marginal during pre monsoon and post monsoon for irrigation respectively eaton 1950 lloyd and heathcote 1985 ssp value in 20 0 and 38 8 of uncontaminated groundwater is categorized as excellent whereas 14 3 and 9 71 are classified as good quality for pre and post monsoon respectively the ratio of the concentration of na against ca2 and mg2 ions is expressed as kelly s ratio as per kelly s ratio value 37 1 pre monsoon and 52 4 post monsoon uncontaminated groundwater are good for irrigation purpose whereas only 1 43 pre monsoon and 3 88 post monsoon of fluoride contaminated water is good for irrigation purpose the dependable factors of permeability index pi are sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate contents as per the pi classification doneen 1954 32 9 and 46 7 of the uncontaminated groundwater is suitable for irrigation purpose whereas most of the fluoride contaminated water is unsuitable for irrigational uses table 3 5 conclusions groundwater of mandla district is slightly acidic to alkaline in nature dominated by ca2 na cations and hco3 and f anions two hydrochemical facies are prominent na hco3 for fluoride contaminated water and ca hco3 for low fluoride water concentration of fluoride varied within a wide range of 0 20 19 9 mg l 1 rock water interaction along with ion exchange and reverse ion exchange process is mainly responsible for hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in mandla district during the evolution process ca2 and mg2 ions are evolved from both carbonate and silicate weathering whereas na and k ions derived only from silicate weathering of rocks fluoride contaminated water is supersaturated with calcite aragonite and dolomite and undersaturated with gypsum anhydrite halite sylvite and fluorite this implies the removal of caco3 as precipitate with the simultaneous dissolution of fluorite the detailed study of hydrochemical processes of fluoride contaminated water shows positive correlation of fluoride concentration with ph and sodium ion alkaline condition and bicarbonate rich water helps to release f in groundwater moreover the correlation of fluoride with chloride suggests geogenic source and variation of fluoride concentration with elevation above mean sea level indicates source of geogenic contamination which is the basaltic aquifer below 500 m amsl this basaltic aquifer below 500 m amsl is correlated with mandla formation on the other hand the water drawn from wells in archean granite gneiss lameta limestone basalt above 500 m amsl is not contaminated with fluoride and these aquifers can be treated as safe water zones suitable for consumption and agricultural usage along with lithological control structural lineament groundwater residence time and groundwater chemistry plays a

11927,deterioration of groundwater quality is a matter of serious concern today in mandla region of central india fluorosis is common among the local people due to consumption of fluoride contaminated groundwater it is therefore important to understand the hydrochemical process of contamination and assess the groundwater quality of this region a total of 173 samples pre monsoon and post monsoon were collected from borewells and dug wells of different depths for major ions analysis k na ca2 mg2 cl co3 2 hco3 no3 so4 2 and f along with ph temperature th as caco3 tds and ec broadly three hydrogeologic units have been identified viz deccan lava flows infratrappean lameta and archean granite and gneiss in deccan two distinct hydrostratigraphic units are mandla and dhuma mandla is the most prominent and extensive aquifer having hydraulic conductivity 5 15 mday 1 and yield 10 50 m3day 1 water quality data vis à vis well depth data indicate that mandla aquifer lying at a lower elevation than 500 m amsl is fluoride contaminated and harmful for human health fluoride 41 0 of total samples and bicarbonate 54 9 of total samples concentrations in analyzed water are above the global standard for drinking purpose however above 500 m msl groundwater is not contaminated with fluoride and is suitable for drinking and irrigation purpose fluoride concentration maps depict spatial and seasonal variation spatial variation of fluoride in groundwater is due to change in aquifer lithology varying degree of rock weathering and orientation of structural lineaments in fluoride concentration map of post monsoon season broadening of contour of uncontaminated zone indicates groundwater recharge which corroborates with water fluctuation map the fluoride contaminated water and low fluoride water are mainly na hco3 and ca hco3 type respectively the hydrochemical processes suggest pre dominance of rock water interaction contribution of na and k ions in groundwater is due to silicate weathering whereas ca2 and mg2 ions are derived due to both silicate and carbonate weathering saturation index calculation point towards calcite dolomite supersaturation and consequent precipitation along with fluorite dissolution under alkaline condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fluoride contamination geogenic fluorosis saturation index central india 1 introduction groundwater is a renewable resource in recent time deterioration and contamination of groundwater is a major concern for civilization the continuous deterioration of groundwater level makes the condition of contamination worse groundwater contamination can be triggered either by natural or anthropogenic amini et al 2008 in india 80 of 1 35 billion residents depend on groundwater both for drinking and irrigation purpose among which 62 million people are at risk of increasing incidences of fluorosis jacks et al 2005 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 consumption of contaminated groundwater is harmful for human health as well as for irrigation ali et al 2021 2019 2018 ijumulana et al 2020 jacks et al 2005 kimambo et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 li 2020 maity et al 2021 2018

died due to consumption of contaminated water niti aayog 2018 in mandla district of central india during late nineties an unforeseen health problem was noticed which seemed to be endemic in nature from mandla chakma et al 1997 reported prevalence of genu valgum 51 1 and dental fluorosis 74 4 among the population of age range 10 20 years people of mandla area were highly affected due to consumption of fluoride contaminated water daily consumption of fluoride greater than 1 5 mg l 1 is responsible for dental and skeletal fluorosis bis 2012 who 2017 mandla area is situated within a loop of narmada river in spite of that in rural areas groundwater is extracted from shallow within 25 m from ground surface dug wells and tube wells for domestic use but the problem arises during dry season when the shallow wells are dried up to overcome the water crisis numerous public wells were constructed to draw water from the level below 25 m from ground surface by penetrating the deeper aquifers in deccan basalt constructions of these deeper wells enhance the problem of fluorosis among the villagers due to daily intake of water containing excessive amount of fluoride fluoride contamination of groundwater may be geogenic i e fluoride rich rocks minerals volcanic ash hydrogeothermal sources natural atmospheric i e fluorine in precipitation from marine aerosols volcanic gas emissions and air borne soil dusts and or anthropogenic sources i e industrial emission activities from brickworks aluminum smelters ceramic industries phosphate fertilizer plant burning of coal and fly ash deposition banerjee 2015 bonvicini et al 2006 cronin et al 2000 feng et al 2003 kimambo et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 maity et al 2018 2021 saether et al 1995 saxena and ahmed 2003 singh et al 2008 tavener and clark 2006 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 according to chae et al 2007 bedrock mineralogy is the primary and common factor for fluoride contamination of groundwater at subsurface to evaluate groundwater resources and causes of contamination a detailed understanding of hydrochemical processes of the aquifer is essential sethy et al 2016 umar et al 2001 but in mandla area detailed study on hydrochemical evolution of groundwater has hitherto not been attempted therefore to fulfill this gap present research work emphasizes on firstly identification of major hydrogeochemical processes and hydrochemical facies secondly understanding different hydrochemical processes operating in fluoride contaminated and low fluoride groundwater and finally an assessment of the water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes in the study area 2 geological and hydrogeological setting of the study area the study area is a part of the world s largest volcanic province the deccan trap it is a portion of eastern deccan trap bounded by north latitudes 22 30ˊ and 22 45ˊ and east longitudes of 80 15ˊ and 80 45ˊ falling in mandla district of madhya pradesh fig 1 the climate here is mild and warm according to köppen and geiger this climate is classified as csa the average temperature and annual rainfall are 24 c and 1413 mm respectively the area experiences hot dry summer april june and cool pleasant winter december february with monsoon rain during july september precipitation is the lowest in april with an average of 4 mm and highest in july with an average of 431 mm the major rivers flowing through the area are narmada banjar burhner and halon with typical dendritic drainage pattern the major portion of the study area is covered by agricultural land 56 7 and forest 34 1 areas in the study area approximate 400 m thick pile of basaltic flows of deccan trap rest over late cretaceous lameta formation and archean tirodi gneissic complex fig 1a deccan basalt is the dominant lithology of the study area which is classified into four formations viz mandla dhuma pipardahi and linga based on textural and mineralogical characteristics and nature of intertrappean beds fig 1b solanki 1991 apart from that within the mandla formation loose cross stratified tephra pockets of pyroclastic materials and bole beds are present in mandla district major hydrostratigraphic units are i basaltic lava flows ii intertrappean and infratrappean beds and iii archean granite and gneiss fig 1b granitic aquifers are mainly unconfined whereas aquifers of basalts are confined to semi confined in nature cgwb 2013 total 92 of the geographical area is occupied by basaltic lava flows of deccan trap as most significant aquifer of the region fig 1 amongst these basaltic flows mandla formation below 500 m elevation and dhuma formation within 500 660 m elevation are the two dominant hydrostratigraphic units though mandla formation is the major aquifer in the studied area basalt of this formation does not have any primary porosity groundwater circulates through the secondary openings the weathered residuum of the hard rock vesicles contact between two flows fractures cracks fissures joints and faults act as principal storehouse of groundwater overall yield range in basaltic aquifer is 10 50 m3day 1 cgwb 2017 weathered fractured and vesicular basaltic layers of traps form productive unconfined to semi confined shallow aquifers whereas deeper aquifers are confined in nature an integrated study of deccan basalt indicates low hydraulic conductivity with a high degree of inhomogeneity kulkarni et al 2000 although interflow spaces in between two successive flows are better source of water supply in deccan traps the transmissivity is found to vary in a wide range depending on the aquifer type according to deolankar 1981 transmissivity of weathered vesicular and fractured basalts of the deccan trap ranges from 90 200 m2day 1 50 100 m2day 1 and 20 40 m2day 1 respectively moreover storativity and hydraulic conductivity vary from 1 to 4 and 5 to 15 mday 1 respectively depending upon the fractures according to the groundwater fluctuation data of water resource department jabalpur wrd during pre monsoon may 2019 general depth to water level range from 1 55 to 11 35 m below ground level bgl with an average 6 17 m bgl on the other hand during august 2019 depth to water level ranges between 0 and 6 5 m with an average 1 75 m bgl it indicates that during pre monsoon water level drops but the variation in groundwater level as a whole is minimal fig 2 groundwater flow as indicated in the water fluctuation map fig 2 is towards the central and north western part of the study area 3 material and methods to evaluate the groundwater quality of mandla area and to identify different hydrochemical processes of both low fluoride and fluoride contaminated groundwater water samples were collected a total of 173 samples were collected from both shallow and deeper sources i e from dug wells tube wells borewells and a warm spring depth of the borewells and tube wells from where the water samples were collected are provided by public health and engineering department phed mandla however the water levels in dug wells were measured on site by measuring tape the depth to water level below ground surface bgl of each dug well tube well and borewell was subtracted from the ground elevation above mean sea level at that well location in order to take into consideration variation in ground surface elevation with change in well locations the water samples were collected in 1 litre high density polyethylene hdpe bottles after collection samples were sent to the chemical laboratory of geological survey of india bhopal for further detailed chemical analysis among 173 water samples 70 pre monsoon samples 16 shallow wells 54 deeper wells were collected in the month of may 2019 and the 103 post monsoon samples 28 shallow wells 75 deeper wells were collected during november 2019 the parameters which are prone to change with time such as temperature hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured on site by hanna combo ph and ec kit during sampling the parameters like ca2 mg2 na k f co3 2 hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and total hardness th as caco3 were analyzed for complete analysis of water samples these parameters were measured as described by the american public health association apha awwa wef 2012 na and k were determined by flame photometer method no3 and so4 2 were analyzed by spectrophotometer th as caco3 ca2 co3 2 hco3 and cl were analyzed by volumetric method fluoride f was measured by using orion make ion selective electrode model no orion stara214 with instrumental

representation respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 physico chemical characteristics of groundwater the ranges and average of temperature ph ec tds th and all major ions of analyzed water samples are given in table 1 with respect to the maximum desirable and permissible limits recommended by who 2017 and bis 2012 the maximum temperature of 36 6 c was measured in a warm spring at babeha higher temperature of groundwater negatively impacts water quality as it causes microbial proliferation and reduces solubility of o2 co2 n2 and ch4 yilmaz and koc 2014 overall groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline with tds values within the recommended guideline by who 2017 for drinking water based on wilcox classification 1955 of ec 87 4 of water is good 11 5 of water is permissible and only 1 15 is excellent for consumption according to total hardness as caco3 classification 32 4 19 1 10 4 and 38 2 of the water samples are categorized as soft moderately hard hard and very hard water respectively the concentration ranges of ca2 mg2 na and k are 0 264 mg l 1 2 43 63 2 mg l 1 5 10 216 mg l 1 and 0 10 56 8 mg l 1 respectively it is well known that due to rock water interaction the concentration of ca2 ion in groundwater may be derived from calcium rich minerals like calcite dolomite feldspar amphibole and pyroxene mg2 ion is derived due to ion exchange of minerals between aquifer and groundwater whereas na ion is derived due to cation exchange process aghazadeh and mogaddam 2010 the concentration ranges of anions like hco3 co3 2 no3 so4 2 f and cl are 0 651 mg l 1 0 48 mg l 1 0 234 mg l 1 1 306 mg l 1 0 20 19 9 mg l 1 and 6 02 209 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of major cations and anions in pre monsoon and post monsoon samples are represented in box and whisker plot fig 3 however no such remarkable chemical compositional variation has been observed in pre and post monsoon samples the maximum fluoride concentration of 19 9 mg l 1 during pre monsoon was measured in the warm spring at babeha 4 2 hydrochemical process the diagnostic chemical species in groundwater is termed as hydrochemical facies which is controlled by the lithology of an aquifer solution kinetics and the flow pattern back 1960 interpretations of major ion chemistry help to describe the rock water interaction patterns of an aquifer system during interpretation all the 173 samples were grouped into two categories based on the fluoride permissible limit i groundwater having f 1 5 mg l 1 i e low fluoride and ii groundwater having f 1 5 mg l 1 i e fluoride contaminated water gibb s diagrams gibbs 1970 fig 4 a d reveal that groundwater samples collected during pre and post monsoon period had dominant rock water interaction activities both for fluoride contaminated and low fluoride water inter relationship amongst major ions is used to identify the chemical reactions in the rock water interaction process which are responsible for the groundwater composition the na cl vs ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 plots show negative correlation fig 4e and f indicating ion exchange process is mainly responsible for the major ions concentration in fluoride contaminated water f 1 5 mg l 1 however in low fluoride water f 1 5 mg l 1 samples spread both above and below the equiline indicating apart from ion exchange some other processes are also involved in ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 fig 4g and h fluoride contaminated water samples mostly plot above the equiline indicating that contributions of ca2 and mg2 ions in groundwater are mainly due to carbonate weathering the samples plotted along the equiline represent the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum singh et al 2012 the samples plotted towards the dominant concentration of hco3 so4 2 represent the ion exchange process and towards ca2 mg2 represent reverse ion exchange cerling et al 1989 fisher and mullican 1997 moreover in fig 5 h 11 5 fluoride contaminated water and 42 0 low fluoride water are plotted both along and below the equiline indicating that ca2 and mg2 ions are contributed by carbonate as well as silicate weathering the upper limit of contribution from carbonate weathering is demarcated by ca2 mg2 vs hco3 scatter plot fig 4i and j singh et al 2012 the fluoride contaminated f 1 5 mg l 1 water samples are plotted above the equiline at relatively lower concentration and at higher concentration bicarbonate is independent with respect to calcium and magnesium therefore maximum ca2 and mg2 ions are derived from carbonate source in contaminated water whereas low fluoride water has mixed source carbonate and non carbonate higher concentration of hco3 among the anions is mainly controlled by both carbonate and silicate weathering lakshmanan et al 2005 the scatter plots of na vs hco3 na vs cl and na k vs total cations fig 5a f indicate that the source of hco3 na and k in fluoride contaminated groundwater is due to silicate weathering fluoride contaminated water samples in the plots of ca2 mg2 vs total cations fig 5g and h deviated from the equiline whereas in na k vs total cations graph they approach the 1 1 equiline which signifies increasing contribution of na and k ions at higher concentration negative values of chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 fig 5i and j also support the ion exchange process for fluoride contaminated water whereas the positive value for low fluoride water indicates inverse or reverse ion exchange process schoeller 1965 1977bib schoeller 1977 bib schoeller 1965 the facies type of water samples is evaluated by piper s piper 1944 diagram piper s diagram fig 6 a and b for both pre and post monsoon samples shows that water is dominantly sodium bicarbonate na hco3 type calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 type and very few samples are sodium chloride na cl type fluoride contaminated water is na hco3 type whereas low fluoride water is ca hco3 type sodium chloride na cl type of water from pre monsoon to post monsoon decreases from 21 4 to 5 80 respectively fig 6a and b the relative increase of na cl type water during pre monsoon is due to firstly local effect of evapotranspiration process in near surface secondly during hot dry spell water level drops but water demand for irrigation and domestic use increases resulting in heavy pumping and extraction of deeper saline water below 25 m bgl which causes a shift towards na cl type 4 3 saturation index chemical equilibrium of water with respect to various mineral phases is determined by the rate of chemical reaction and composition of groundwater this equilibrium phase of water can be calculated by saturation index si of the minerals from the chemical data of water garrels and mackenzie 1967 it helps to identify the controlling geochemical reaction for groundwater quality drever 1997 si of any mineral is represented by s a t u r a t i o n i n d e x s i log i a p k t where iap is ion activity product of the dissociated chemical species in solution and kt is an equilibrium solubility product for the same chemical species considered at the sample temperature this parameter is calculated by using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 irrespective of fluoride concentration in groundwater halite sylvite anhydrite and gypsum are undersaturated fig 6c and d in fluoride contaminated water minerals like calcite dolomite and aragonite are supersaturated supersaturation of these minerals in fluoride contaminated water signifies huge removal of calcium due to precipitation kim and jeong 2005 saxena and ahmed 2001 wang et al 2009 overall the saturation index value of fluorite has positive correlation with fluoride concentration in water additionally the water samples having very high fluoride concentration above 8 mg l 1 are fluorite supersaturated however all the low fluoride water samples are undersaturated with respect to fluorite indicating chances of more dissolution of fluorite in water the precipitation of calcium from groundwater because of dissolution of fluorite caf2 prevents the precipitation of fluorine which increases fluoride concentration in groundwater on the other hand supersaturation of dolomite and aragonite in the fluoride contaminated water also support the precipitation of calcium 4 4 hydrogeochemistry and fluoride contaminated water the fluoride contamination of groundwater is the sole problem concerning community health in mandla area aquifer lithology in any area may act as the source of contaminant but its concentration in groundwater depends on various additional factors such as ph temperature availability of ions age of the groundwater residence time and availability of structural deformation kim and jeong 2005 saxena and ahmed 2001 in the study area fluoride concentration of groundwater has a positive correlation with ph table 2 the alkaline water ph 7 5 facilitates the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater the justification behind this mechanism could be two folds firstly bicarbonate enrichment in alkaline water could be responsible for dissociation and dissolution of f ion in groundwater from the weathered rocks rao et al 1993 subba rao 2006 secondly an alkaline condition of water ph 7 5 also facilitates the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater due to replacement of exchangeable f ion with oh ion in fluorine bearing mineral amphibole biotite etc li et al 2013 in addition to ph fluoride concentration also has a positive correlation with na and has a negative correlation with ca2 mg2 and total hardness as caco3 table 2 piper s diagram shows na hco3 type water is mainly fluoride contaminated fig 6a and b the correlation between f and cl ion is used to reveal the origin of f ion in groundwater olaka et al 2016 the f vs f cl plot fig 7 a and b shows that the ratio of f cl increases with increase in f concentration whereas cl concentration is relatively consistent on the other hand cl concentration is low at higher concentration of f from f vs f cl plot three processes can be possible to deduce such as the evaporation line increasing f constantly low f cl ratio geogenic enrichment f and f cl increase since cl does not change and the geothermally influenced system with low f and lowest cl below 1 mg l 1 olaka et al 2016 su et al 2015 in studied samples especially for fluorine contaminated groundwater relatively high f cl ratio indicates the geogenic origin of fluorine fig 7a and b additionally along with the geogenic factor ph of water and its residence time in the particular aquifer plays an important role a plot of elevation amsl of water level from where the water was drawn vs fluoride concentration fig 7c and d shows that water samples drawn from wells below 500 m amsl have higher fluoride concentration than water drawn from wells above 500 m amsl fig 7c and d during field investigation it was observed that fluoride contamination of groundwater is mostly limited to a depth range of 25 175 m bgl therefore to assess the role of depth to water level in fluoride contamination the samples plotted against fluoride concentration and elevation above msl are divided into four categories i e shallow water 0 25 m bgl with low ph 7 5 shallow water 0 25 m bgl with high ph 7 5 deep water 25 175 m bgl with low ph 7 5 and deep water 25 175 m bgl with high ph 7 5 fig 7c and d deep alkaline groundwater 25 175 m bgl drawn from wells present below 500 m amsl is highly contaminated with fluoride this contamination is strongly dependent on ph and is facilitated under alkaline condition only whereas water drawn from wells present above 500 m amsl is not contaminated with fluoride regardless of depth to water level 0 175 m bgl and ph condition of water therefore the surface at 500 m amsl here acts as a marker separating contaminated and uncontaminated aquifers since rock weathering is the dominant hydrochemical process operating here we infer that aquifer lithology contributes to fluoride contamination furthermore we correlate the two aquifers with two distinct stratigraphic layers corresponding to mandla basalt formation 350 500 m amsl and dhuma basalt formation 500 660 m amsl fig 1b the spatial and seasonal variation of fluoride concentration is given in the fluoride concentration map prepared for both pre and post monsoon periods fig 8 in comparison with pre monsoon fig 8a the post monsoon map fig 8b depicts slight contraction in contamination zone owing to recharge and water mixing to some extent due to monsoonal rain fluoride concentration maps fig 8 depict that aquifers in central and north western part are more contaminated and concentration of fluoride increased along the flow path as marked in fig 2 groundwater flow path in fig 2 signifies longer residence time of water downstream at relatively lower elevation which favours fluoride accumulation as indicated in fig 8 archean granite and gneiss and lameta limestone are exposed only in the southern part of the study area fig 1 where both shallow and deeper groundwater is not contaminated with fluoride which is reflected well in fluoride concentration maps fig 8 additionally it is also observed that fluoride contaminated zones mostly lie along structural lineaments fig 8 which indicates plausible control of lineaments in groundwater contamination therefore lithology structural lineaments groundwater residence time and groundwater chemistry play an important role in fluoride contamination in this region 4 5 water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes suitability of groundwater for drinking and agriculture purposes has been evaluated by analyzing the major ion composition all the values of hydrogeochemical parameters are compared with the permissible limit of who 2017 and indian standard for drinking water bis 2012 in table 1 ph of 53 2 samples analyzed is above or below the permissible limit range and only 46 8 is found within the limit 7 5 8 5 however tds value of all samples is found below 1000 mg l 1 the total hardness of only 34 1 of samples is above the permissible limit whereas rests of the samples are within the limit continuous consumption of the hard water causes urolithiasis cardio vascular disorder and parental mortality agarwal and jagetia 1997 amongst the cations calcium and magnesium concentrations are mostly within the permissible limit however in 17 3 and 11 0 of groundwater samples calcium and magnesium respectively exceed the permissible limit the excess consumption of calcium may increase the risk of kidney stone among anions 54 9 and 41 0 of the water has an excess concentration of bicarbonate and fluoride i e above the permissible limit as discussed in the previous section the fluoride contaminated water has a strong correlation with bicarbonate ions and the inhabitants consuming such groundwater are under high health risk although among 173 samples only 8 samples have no3 concentration and 1 sample have so4 2 concentration above the permissible limit excessive consumption of no3 results in serious health problem like gastric cancer birth malformations hypertension and methaemoglobinaemia in infants majumder and gupta 2000 sodium concentration and electrical conductivity of water are the most important factors for the assessment of irrigation quality excess concentration of sodium in the water affects plant growth and could disturb the soil structure as well the parameters like sodium adsorption ratio sar richard 1954 residual sodium carbonate rsc eaton 1950 lloyd and heathcote 1985 soluble sodium percentage ssp doneen 1954 kelly s ratio karanth 1987 and permeability index pi doneen 1962 are used to determine the water quality for irrigation purpose in mandla district groundwater is classified for irrigation purpose in relation with fluoride concentration f 1 5 mg l 1 and f 1 5 mg l 1 for both pre and post monsoon season table 3 the relative activity of na ion during exchange reaction with soil is expressed as sar hwang et al 2017 richard 1954 as per calculation shown in table 3 the low fluoride water f 1 5 mg l 1 is more suitable for irrigation purpose than the contaminated water based on sar value 47 1 and 66 0 of the low f groundwater are categorized as excellent for pre monsoon and post monsoon samples respectively richard 1954 rsc values in 14 3 and 27 2 of uncontaminated groundwater is good safe whereas 22 9 and 20 4 in medium marginal during pre monsoon and post monsoon for irrigation respectively eaton 1950 lloyd and heathcote 1985 ssp value in 20 0 and 38 8 of uncontaminated groundwater is categorized as excellent whereas 14 3 and 9 71 are classified as good quality for pre and post monsoon respectively the ratio of the concentration of na against ca2 and mg2 ions is expressed as kelly s ratio as per kelly s ratio value 37 1 pre monsoon and 52 4 post monsoon uncontaminated groundwater are good for irrigation purpose whereas only 1 43 pre monsoon and 3 88 post monsoon of fluoride contaminated water is good for irrigation purpose the dependable factors of permeability index pi are sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate contents as per the pi classification doneen 1954 32 9 and 46 7 of the uncontaminated groundwater is suitable for irrigation purpose whereas most of the fluoride contaminated water is unsuitable for irrigational uses table 3 5 conclusions groundwater of mandla district is slightly acidic to alkaline in nature dominated by ca2 na cations and hco3 and f anions two hydrochemical facies are prominent na hco3 for fluoride contaminated water and ca hco3 for low fluoride water concentration of fluoride varied within a wide range of 0 20 19 9 mg l 1 rock water interaction along with ion exchange and reverse ion exchange process is mainly responsible for hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in mandla district during the evolution process ca2 and mg2 ions are evolved from both carbonate and silicate weathering whereas na and k ions derived only from silicate weathering of rocks fluoride contaminated water is supersaturated with calcite aragonite and dolomite and undersaturated with gypsum anhydrite halite sylvite and fluorite this implies the removal of caco3 as precipitate with the simultaneous dissolution of fluorite the detailed study of hydrochemical processes of fluoride contaminated water shows positive correlation of fluoride concentration with ph and sodium ion alkaline condition and bicarbonate rich water helps to release f in groundwater moreover the correlation of fluoride with chloride suggests geogenic source and variation of fluoride concentration with elevation above mean sea level indicates source of geogenic contamination which is the basaltic aquifer below 500 m amsl this basaltic aquifer below 500 m amsl is correlated with mandla formation on the other hand the water drawn from wells in archean granite gneiss lameta limestone basalt above 500 m amsl is not contaminated with fluoride and these aquifers can be treated as safe water zones suitable for consumption and agricultural usage along with lithological control structural lineament groundwater residence time and groundwater chemistry plays a

11928,the recurrent drought in the rif region northern morocco and specifically the bokoya massif has led to significant exploitation of groundwater to meet human and socio economic objectives in this context a hydrochemical geochemical and isotopic tools has been carried out to determine the origin of dissolved elements and the processes contributing to the increase in salinization of groundwater to achieve this objective physico chemical analyses of the water were carried out on 96 samples 81 wells and 15 springs taken april 2018 the results show that the groundwater samples studied are characterized by a medium to high salinity which can exceed 8000 μs cm spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters are consistent with the distribution of the rocks from triassic formations our results also show that the salinization is probably due to the dissolution of evaporate rocks and ion exchange with precipitation of carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite the stable isotope contents vary from 6 69 to 4 84 for δ18o and 42 6 to 30 1 for δ2h indicating an altitude of recharge for most of the springs between 350 and 750masl exceptions to this are likely to have recharged from the flysch of tizirene at altitudes higher than 1000masl and following an altitudinal gradient of 0 27 per 100 m graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater salinization stable isotopes rif bokoya morocco 1 introduction increased global industrialization and population growth have increased the demand of freshwater ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 in arid and semi arid regions groundwater exploitation remains the main source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses li et al 2013 unfortunately there is a worldwide deterioration in the quality of these resources due to salinization and or contamination problems which impact many aquifers de montety et al 2008 kumar et al 2014 ouhamdouch et al 2016 including those in the mediterranean regions farid et al 2015 eissa et al 2016 bahir et al 2018 2021 rafik et al 2021 and especially karstic areas which are characterized by groundwater resources vulnerable to contamination due to the easy penetration of chemical and microbial pollutants into the subsoil and their rapid spread in the conduit network without sufficient attenuation in addition karst systems are often connected over large areas which requires transboundary water resources management concepts goldscheider and drew 2007 these reasons make karst aquifers particularly difficult to exploit explore protect and to manage sustainably in terms of water quality and availability groundwater quality degradation can be attributed mainly to natural and anthropogenic factors such as seawater intrusion impact of adjacent aquifers hydrodynamic conditions dissolution of evaporitic rocks upwelling of deep saline water levels and uncontrolled use of fertilizers milnes 2011 elgettafi et al 2012 giambastiani et al 2013 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 ouhamdouch et al 2021 however knowledge of the sources and understanding of salinization processes remains a requirement to prevent further deterioration of groundwater quality the bokoya massif is a part of the province of al hoceima which is a growing urban area this growing urbanization will undoubtedly have consequences for surface and groundwater needs in 2010 water resource needs were estimated at 263 l s in the area of the bokoya massif this volume of water is likely to increase significantly in the coming years especially since in 2015 the total resources available were exceeded following the silting of the mohamed ben abdelkarim el khattabi dam which is a major source of drinking water to the province however desalinating seawater was the solution adopted by the moroccan government to reinforce the drinking water situation in the city of al hoceima the local population maintains tradition of supplying water especially for consumption from undeveloped and unprotected springs and wells and is therefore reluctant to use water from the sea the objective of this study is to identify the main origins of the elements controlling groundwater salinity in the bokoya massif by combining the hydrochemical and isotopic tools to achieve this we develop a phreeqc geochemical equilibrium model map the spatial distribution of elements of concern and through stable isotope analyses of the water 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the bokoya massif is a mountainous chain which is part of the rif mountain range resulting from the alpine orogenesis influencing the north of morocco it stretches about 40 km in length located in the middle of al hoceima city and the village of torres and about 10 km in width with maximum altitudes ranging from 500 to 700masl fig 1 azzouz et al 2002 the bokoya massif is characterized by a semi arid climate that represents the driest part of the rifain coastline it has an average annual rainfall of no more than 400 mm and an average annual temperature between 13 and 24 c this mountain range is characterized by two distinct seasons a dry season may to october and the other wet november to april potential evapotranspiration etp calculations show an insignificant variation during the studied period with an annual average maximum of 899 mm recorded during the year 1989 1990 and an annual average minimum of 834 mm recorded during the hydrological year 2006 2007 however the annual average etp equal to 871 mm on a monthly scale potential evapotranspiration is considerable ranging from 135 mm recorded in july to 28 mm recorded in january fig 2 geologically and structurally the bokoya massif belongs to the internal domain that outcrops in the north central part of the rif mountains it consists of tectonic units forming the crystalline basement overlying paleozoic and mesocenozoic layers it is represented mainly by the inner limestone ridge and the outer limestone ridge which supports tectonic klips of paleozoic triasic terrains belonging to the sebtides units and ghomarides nappes andrieux 1971 mourier 1982 morocco geological service 1973 fig 3 the paleozoic of the bokoya massif outcrops in elongated bands oriented ene wsw and most often occupies topographic depressions thus forming five tectonic klipes distributed throughout the massif these klipes are delimited by highly straightened anomalous contacts azzouz 1992 the entire massif rests on the tizirene flysch sheets via a series of formations in the tertiary footing characterized by a yellowish marnogrescent facies mourier 1982 facing the bokoya massif there is a narrow corridor from the pliocene quaternary towards the sub equatorial direction which may result from the filling of major synsedimentary faults with vertical displacement azzouz et al 2002 the translation of the ghomarides triassic limestone dolomitic series on the triassic dolomites of the outer limestone ridge is facilitated by the presence of the triassic gypsitic red clay rocks azzouz et al 2002 the bokoya massif aquifer is a heterogeneous coastal karst limestone aquifer that is mainly divided by matrix including a porous or finely fissured matrix cut by karst conduits that are created by tectonics and carbonate dissolution evaporates mostly gypsum and triassic shales are mixed with upper cretaceous marls and locally called gypsum marls these sediments have a breccia like character and includes metamorphic and plutonic rock boulders called gypsum breccia matrix gharibi et al 2017 the hydrogeology of bokoya massif is complex and no hydrodynamic studies have so far been published the flow within the small scale fractured system between the geological formations is not known but on a regional scale the general direction of flow is from south to north towards the sea only the southern hydrogeological limit red line in figure 1 delimited by the tizirene nappes belonging to the outer zone of the rif lower albian cretaceous is known bouaissa et al 2021 indeed the abundant horizontal and vertical fracturing in the limestone ridge induces a rapid surface recharge and deep circulation azzouz et al 2002 2 2 sampling and analytical techniques due to the complexity of the study area and the large number of samples we divided the study area into three sub areas urban zone coastal zone and inland zone each sub area is sampled on a separate day the samples were sent in the same day to the laboratory to be analyzed a sum of 96 samples were collected from the three subzones covering the entire study area 81 wells and 15 sources in order to avoid the collection of stagnant groundwater samples were taken after a period of pumping the measurement of temperature t hydrogen potential ph and electrical conductivity ec is made in situ using a conductivity meter hi9033 and a ph meter hi98115 while for the major elements such as na ca2 mg2 k cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 were analyzed at the solid mineral chemistry laboratory in the faculty of sciences oujda the chemical analyses were carried out in accordance with the standard methods of rodier et al 2009 chloride concentrations were determined by titration with silver nitrate agno3 bicarbonates by titration with hydrochloric acid hcl sulphates and nitrates with uv spectrophotometer rayleigh uv 9200 precision 1 nm sodium and potassium by flame photometry scherwood model 420 and elico cl 361 and calcium magnesium ions by titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta the reliability of the results found is evaluated by the ionic balance method however the accepted results are those that do not exceed the acceptable limit of 10 the stable isotope analyses δ18o and δ2h were performed at hydrosciences lama montpellier france on an isoprime elementar spectrometer with aquaprep automaton by equilibrium with co2 by dual inlet for oxygen 18 error 0 05 the deuterium analysis δ2h is performed by the pyrolysis technique in the presence of chromium under helium flow by continuous flow pyroh automaton 0 8 2 3 hydrochemical processes and geochemical modelling investigation of the hydrochemical processes controlling groundwater mineralization in the bokoya massif was carried out using graphical diagrams such as box plot and piper diagram mapping the spatial distribution of elements using a geographic information system and correlation curves between the different major elements in order to establish the relationship between these elements controlling the salinization of groundwater sources in the massif in order to determine the equilibrium reactions between water and rock concerning the main mineral phases present in the bokoya massif aquifer the geochemical modeling computational program phreeqc appelo and postma 1993 was used to evaluate the saturation index for each mineral in order to identify the mode of reaction precipitation or dissolution the saturation index of a given mineral is calculated using equation 1 1 s i l o g i a p k t with iap as the ionic activity produced and kt as the solubility constant at equilibrium when the saturation index is equal to zero it means that the water sample is in equilibrium with the mineral positive values of the saturation index show a state of oversaturation of the solution causing the mineral to precipitate and negative values of the saturation index indicate a state of under saturation and the mineral in the rock tends to dissolve typical mineral weathering reactions are described by the reactions in table 1 appelo and postma 1993 risacher and fritz 2009 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater quality the studied samples temperature varies from 15 to 19 5 c with an average of 16 78 c the ph of these waters varies from 6 9 to 8 96 with an average of 7 55 which indicates that the groundwater studied is slightly alkaline the total dissolved solids tds of the groundwater of the bokoya massif varies from 573 4 to 4867 3 mg l with an average of 1958 9 mg l therefore 77 of the sources studied exceed the standard recommended by who 1000 mg l illustrating highly mineralized waters overall with the exception of some water points that have a low mineralization less than 700 mg l bouaissa et al 2021a the variation in the concentrations of major ions in the groundwater in the study area is presented as a box plot fig 4 the ions contributing most to the total concentrations of the water samples are cl na so4 2 ca2 and mg2 it should be noted that sodium and calcium are the most dominant cations and chlorides and sulphates are the most dominant anions to determine the chemical facies associated with each water sample we used the piper triangular diagram fig 5 figure 5 shows three facies associated with the groundwater in the study area the first facies corresponds to chlorinated water of which there are two families sodium chlorinated the most frequent at 73 of the water points studied first facies and calcium chlorinated and sulphated second facies at 22 the third facies is represented by sodium bicarbonate waters at 5 this observed transition from one facies to another highlights the complexity of hydrogeochemical processes that can contribute to the mineralization of groundwater in this massif table 2 displays the correlation coefficient matrix between the main elements and tds this comparison shows that groundwater mineralization at the bokoya massif is mainly controlled by cl na so4 2 and mg2 and is corroborated by maps of the spatial distribution of these elements showing similar concentration variability to that of tds fig 6 the spatial distribution of higher concentrations of nitrates no3 indicates an influence of anthropogenic pollution high nitrate concentrations are observed in the area of the wastewater treatment plant in al hoceima and in urban centers such as rouadi ait kamra and izemmouren bouaissa et al 2021a this pollution is likely a result of the absence of sewerage networks and the use of septic tanks bouaissa et al 2021b in fact 36 of the sources studied exceed the standard for nitrates as established by the world health organization who 50 mg l 3 2 groundwater salinization process 3 2 1 water rock interaction both halite and gypsum or anhydrite are evaporitic minerals that are associated with the triassic formations that outcrop in the bokoya massif as three entities azzouz et al 2002 metamorphic detrital triassic federico unit red detrital triassic ghomarides unit and internal limestone ridge and dolomitic triassic external limestone ridge fig 7 the correlation diagram between the cl and na ions fig 8 a shows that the groundwater samples from all of the geological formations are aligned along the 1 1 line which reflects the

below the halite dissolution line and indicates a deficit of na and an excess of cl the excess of cl compared to the na ion in the pre dorsal formation characterized by the existence of clays could be explained by the phenomenon of reverse ion exchange with na absorbed and ca2 released theoretically the correlation between hco3 so4 2 and ca2 mg2 for groundwater is linear if the dissolution of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum strongly controls the mineralization of these waters the direct ion exchange phenomenon can cause an excess of hco3 so4 2 and move points to the right of the 1 1

shows that most of the samples follow the 1 1 line indicating that the dissolution of these minerals is one of the processes strongly affecting the groundwater mineralization of the bokoya massif however the graph also shows that the waters of the pre dorsal formation are located below the 1 1 line which indicates that these waters are influenced by the phenomenon of reverse exchange correlated with a deficit in na as seen in fig 8a howard and lloyd 1983 comments that the process of reverse ion exchange takes place usually in areas of low permeability and pre dorsal formation is mainly composed of marls characterized by low permeability the results of the two binary correlation diagrams between ca2 and ca2 mg2 compared to hco3 fig 8c and d show a weak correlation however the samples of group a from the limestone formation are aligned on the dolomite dissolution line showing a good match between chemical water and dolomite formations for the other formation the

evaporate minerals has not reached equilibrium however all water samples are supersaturated or close to the saturation state of calcite and 79 of the samples are supersaturated in dolomite thus providing favorable conditions for re precipitation precipitation of calcite and dolomite occurs generally during the dissolution of anhydrite and gypsum or while of ion exchange garcía et al 2001 yermani et al 2003 the chemical composition of the bokoya massif groundwater is probably controlled by the dissolution processes of gypsum and halite with simultaneous precipitation of dolomite and

most of the points are located on lmwl or between gmwl and lmwl probably reflecting a direct recharge of these water points by rainfall of mixed mediterranean and atlantic origin a few points which correspond to surface emergences are offset slightly below the gmwl line suggesting that these waters have undergone evaporation during their course or mixing with seawater the source e29 is the farthest from these two lines 3 3 2 correlation between altitude and δ18o the isotopy of water is a function of the temperature and therefore of the altitude in mountainous zones we can determine an altitude function respectively to the isotope content when one has chronicled the rains according to the zones of altitude in the case where there is no chronicle of rains one can use staged sources whose impluvium is locale to determine this straight line the global average depletion of the heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen with altitude due to lower temperatures occurring at higher altitudes is 0 15 to 0 5 for δ18o and 1 to 4 for δ2h for every 100 m of altitude clark and fritz 1997 at the scale of morocco the regional isotopic altitude gradient at the city of fez is 0 27 per 100 m elevation el ouali et al 1999 sefrioui et al 2010 for the rif the altimetric gradient is 0 25 per 100 m winckel et al 2002 at the mediterranean scale the isotopic gradient found in the betic cordillera spain is 0 28 per 100 m altitude cruz san julián et al 1990 recharge altitudes of the studied sources following the regional isotopic altitude gradient of the city of fez can be inferred from projecting δ18o concentrations for each of the analyzed sources all points show an altitude of infiltration higher with an isotope date more depleted than the local altitude fig 12 the majority of the sources are recharged at altitudes below 750m which shows that all these sources are recharged at the level of the bokoya massif however sources e9 e22 e23 e45 e56 and e89 show recharging altitudes higher than 750m corresponding to an infiltration in the flysch of tizirène whose altitudes exceed 1000m 3 3 3 correlation between ec and δ18o the relationship between δ18o and electrical conductivity ec is used to determine the contribution of evaporation enrichment of δ18o and lower d excess or dissolution of minerals in groundwater mineralization no effect on water isotope composition al charideh and abou zakhem 2010 hamed and dhahri 2013 boukhari et al 2015 the electrical conductivity of the groundwater studied shows average to high variations without any or few effect on the content of δ18o fig 13 evaporation of surface water before infiltration does not appear to be a predominant recharge mode this hypothesis is also supported by d excess values with an error measurement 1 5 implies the evaporation mark concerns samples with values under 8 5 all samples 9 lower than 1500 μs cm show d excess values between 9 0 and 11 9 for the samples higher than 1500 μs cm 8 samples show values between 8 0 and 13 1 among them the highest ec e58 7 others show a very slightly evaporation mark d excess between 7 3 and 8 2 and only one shows clearly an evaporation process with a d excess of 4 7 and ec of 3030 μs cm e29 this finding confirms the dominance discussed ahead of the dissolution of evaporate deposits in the determination of the chemistry of the waters studied only few samples under a d excess values lower than 8 e1 e5 e12 e29 and e32 seem to have undergone slight to moderate evaporation shown also in fig 11 in other studies carried out on semi arid climates the researchers found that the salinization of groundwater is attributed to the dissolution of minerals moreover this mineralization is also increased due to evaporation then with an enrichment of water isotope content krishan et al 2020b 2021 krishan et al 2020 in our case evaporation has few effect on mineralization because of the rapid infiltration of rainwater linked to the karstic character of the study area the use of the isotopic analysis of the groundwater of the bokoya massif has demonstrated that the main driver of salinization is the dissolution of minerals this confirms the results previously obtained by the hydrochemical and geochemical study 4 conclusions the socio economic development of the al hoceima region is highly dependent on groundwater resources the hydrochemical geochemical and isotopic analyses completed in this study aim at determining the processes of salinization and groundwater recharge in the bokoya massif because of its strategic importance in managing scarce water resources the hydrochemical study shows that the salinity of the water varies over a wide range from 608 to 8690 μs cm and that the study area is characterized by three types of water that is dominated by sodium chloride at 73 of the sources studied thus the mineralization of these springs is controlled by local geological conditions and anthropogenic conditions this is corroborated by the maps showing the distribution of high salinity waters along saline triassic formations and high nitrate concentrations mapped with large villages the geochemical study shows that all the water samples studied are supersaturated in calcite and almost supersaturated in dolomite facilitating local re precipitation whereas halite and gypsum remain unsaturated with respect to ionic content furthermore the ion exchange diagram shows both direct and reverse ion exchange this supports the hypothesis of salinization by dissolution of evaporate rocks such as halite and gypsum with simultaneous precipitation of calcite and dolomite in combination with direct and reverse ion exchange of clay minerals this mineralization is therefore strongly related to the geological context marked by the presence of evaporates and dolomite in the triassic formations the results obtained in the isotopic study showed that the recharge of most of the springs is carried out by direct infiltration of rainfall of mixed mediterranean and atlantic origin and that most of the groundwater of the bokoya massif is locally recharged at altitudes between 350 and 750 m with the exception of a few springs which are recharged at the level of the tizirene flysch water table according to the correlation of deuterium and oxygen 18 the water penetrates rapidly into the subsoil

11928,the recurrent drought in the rif region northern morocco and specifically the bokoya massif has led to significant exploitation of groundwater to meet human and socio economic objectives in this context a hydrochemical geochemical and isotopic tools has been carried out to determine the origin of dissolved elements and the processes contributing to the increase in salinization of groundwater to achieve this objective physico chemical analyses of the water were carried out on 96 samples 81 wells and 15 springs taken april 2018 the results show that the groundwater samples studied are characterized by a medium to high salinity which can exceed 8000 μs cm spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters are consistent with the distribution of the rocks from triassic formations our results also show that the salinization is probably due to the dissolution of evaporate rocks and ion exchange with precipitation of carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite the stable isotope contents vary from 6 69 to 4 84 for δ18o and 42 6 to 30 1 for δ2h indicating an altitude of recharge for most of the springs between 350 and 750masl exceptions to this are likely to have recharged from the flysch of tizirene at altitudes higher than 1000masl and following an altitudinal gradient of 0 27 per 100 m graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater salinization stable isotopes rif bokoya morocco 1 introduction increased global industrialization and population growth have increased the demand of freshwater ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 in arid and semi arid regions groundwater exploitation remains the main source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses li et al 2013 unfortunately there is a worldwide deterioration in the quality of these resources due to salinization and or contamination problems which impact many aquifers de montety et al 2008 kumar et al 2014 ouhamdouch et al 2016 including those in the mediterranean regions farid et al 2015 eissa et al 2016 bahir et al 2018 2021 rafik et al 2021 and especially karstic areas which are characterized by groundwater resources vulnerable to contamination due to the easy penetration of chemical and microbial pollutants into the subsoil and their rapid spread in the conduit network without sufficient attenuation in addition karst systems are often connected over large areas which requires transboundary water resources management concepts goldscheider and drew 2007 these reasons make karst aquifers particularly difficult to exploit explore protect and to manage sustainably in terms of water quality and availability groundwater quality degradation can be attributed mainly to natural and anthropogenic factors such as seawater intrusion impact of adjacent aquifers hydrodynamic conditions dissolution of evaporitic rocks upwelling of deep saline water levels and uncontrolled use of fertilizers milnes 2011 elgettafi et al 2012 giambastiani et al 2013 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 ouhamdouch et al 2021 however knowledge of the sources and understanding of salinization processes remains a requirement to prevent further deterioration of groundwater quality the bokoya massif is a part of the province of al hoceima which is a growing urban area this growing urbanization will undoubtedly have consequences for surface and groundwater needs in 2010 water resource needs were estimated at 263 l s in the area of the bokoya massif this volume of water is likely to increase significantly in the coming years especially since in 2015 the total resources available were exceeded following the silting of the mohamed ben abdelkarim el khattabi dam which is a major source of drinking water to the province however desalinating seawater was the solution adopted by the moroccan government to reinforce the drinking water situation in the city of al hoceima the local population maintains tradition of supplying water especially for consumption from undeveloped and unprotected springs and wells and is therefore reluctant to use water from the sea the objective of this study is to identify the main origins of the elements controlling groundwater salinity in the bokoya massif by combining the hydrochemical and isotopic tools to achieve this we develop a phreeqc geochemical equilibrium model map the spatial distribution of elements of concern and through stable isotope analyses of the water 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the bokoya massif is a mountainous chain which is part of the rif mountain range resulting from the alpine orogenesis influencing the north of morocco it stretches about 40 km in length located in the middle of al hoceima city and the village of torres and about 10 km in width with maximum altitudes ranging from 500 to 700masl fig 1 azzouz et al 2002 the bokoya massif is characterized by a semi arid climate that represents the driest part of the rifain coastline it has an average annual rainfall of no more than 400 mm and an average annual temperature between 13 and 24 c this mountain range is characterized by two distinct seasons a dry season may to october and the other wet november to april potential evapotranspiration etp calculations show an insignificant variation during the studied period with an annual average maximum of 899 mm recorded during the year 1989 1990 and an annual average minimum of 834 mm recorded during the hydrological year 2006 2007 however the annual average etp equal to 871 mm on a monthly scale potential evapotranspiration is considerable ranging from 135 mm recorded in july to 28 mm recorded in january fig 2 geologically and structurally the bokoya massif belongs to the internal domain that outcrops in the north central part of the rif mountains it consists of tectonic units forming the crystalline basement overlying paleozoic and mesocenozoic layers it is represented mainly by the inner limestone ridge and the outer limestone ridge which supports tectonic klips of paleozoic triasic terrains belonging to the sebtides units and ghomarides nappes andrieux 1971 mourier 1982 morocco geological service 1973 fig 3 the paleozoic of the bokoya massif outcrops in elongated bands oriented ene wsw and most often occupies topographic depressions thus forming five tectonic klipes distributed throughout the massif these klipes are delimited by highly straightened anomalous contacts azzouz 1992 the entire massif rests on the tizirene flysch sheets via a series of formations in the tertiary footing characterized by a yellowish marnogrescent facies mourier 1982 facing the bokoya massif there is a narrow corridor from the pliocene quaternary towards the sub equatorial direction which may result from the filling of major synsedimentary faults with vertical displacement azzouz et al 2002 the translation of the ghomarides triassic limestone dolomitic series on the triassic dolomites of the outer limestone ridge is facilitated by the presence of the triassic gypsitic red clay rocks azzouz et al 2002 the bokoya massif aquifer is a heterogeneous coastal karst limestone aquifer that is mainly divided by matrix including a porous or finely fissured matrix cut by karst conduits that are created by tectonics and carbonate dissolution evaporates mostly gypsum and triassic shales are mixed with upper cretaceous marls and locally called gypsum marls these sediments have a breccia like character and includes metamorphic and plutonic rock boulders called gypsum breccia matrix gharibi et al 2017 the hydrogeology of bokoya massif is complex and no hydrodynamic studies have so far been published the flow within the small scale fractured system between the geological formations is not known but on a regional scale the general direction of flow is from south to north towards the sea only the southern hydrogeological limit red line in figure 1 delimited by the tizirene nappes belonging to the outer zone of the rif lower albian cretaceous is known bouaissa et al 2021 indeed the abundant horizontal and vertical fracturing in the limestone ridge induces a rapid surface recharge and deep circulation azzouz et al 2002 2 2 sampling and analytical techniques due to the complexity of the study area and the large number of samples we divided the study area into three sub areas urban zone coastal zone and inland zone each sub area is sampled on a separate day the samples were sent in the same day to the laboratory to be analyzed a sum of 96 samples were collected from the three subzones covering the entire study area 81 wells and 15 sources in order to avoid the collection of stagnant groundwater samples were taken after a period of pumping the measurement of temperature t hydrogen potential ph and electrical conductivity ec is made in situ using a conductivity meter hi9033 and a ph meter hi98115 while for the major elements such as na ca2 mg2 k cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 were analyzed at the solid mineral chemistry laboratory in the faculty of sciences oujda the chemical analyses were carried out in accordance with the standard methods of rodier et al 2009 chloride concentrations were determined by titration with silver nitrate agno3 bicarbonates by titration with hydrochloric acid hcl sulphates and nitrates with uv spectrophotometer rayleigh uv 9200 precision 1 nm sodium and potassium by flame photometry scherwood model 420 and elico cl 361 and calcium magnesium ions by titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta the reliability of the results found is evaluated by the ionic balance method however the accepted results are those that do not exceed the acceptable limit of 10 the stable isotope analyses δ18o and δ2h were performed at hydrosciences lama montpellier france on an isoprime elementar spectrometer with aquaprep automaton by equilibrium with co2 by dual inlet for oxygen 18 error 0 05 the deuterium analysis δ2h is performed by the pyrolysis technique in the presence of chromium under helium flow by continuous flow pyroh automaton 0 8 2 3 hydrochemical processes and geochemical modelling investigation of the hydrochemical processes controlling groundwater mineralization in the bokoya massif was carried out using graphical diagrams such as box plot and piper diagram mapping the spatial distribution of elements using a geographic information system and correlation curves between the different major elements in order to establish the relationship between these elements controlling the salinization of groundwater sources in the massif in order to determine the equilibrium reactions between water and rock concerning the main mineral phases present in the bokoya massif aquifer the geochemical modeling computational program phreeqc appelo and postma 1993 was used to evaluate the saturation index for each mineral in order to identify the mode of reaction precipitation or dissolution the saturation index of a given mineral is calculated using equation 1 1 s i l o g i a p k t with iap as the ionic activity produced and kt as the solubility constant at equilibrium when the saturation index is equal to zero it means that the water sample is in equilibrium with the mineral positive values of the saturation index show a state of oversaturation of the solution causing the mineral to precipitate and negative values of the saturation index indicate a state of under saturation and the mineral in the rock tends to dissolve typical mineral weathering reactions are described by the reactions in table 1 appelo and postma 1993 risacher and fritz 2009 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater quality the studied samples temperature varies from 15 to 19 5 c with an average of 16 78 c the ph of these waters varies from 6 9 to 8 96 with an average of 7 55 which indicates that the groundwater studied is slightly alkaline the total dissolved solids tds of the groundwater of the bokoya massif varies from 573 4 to 4867 3 mg l with an average of 1958 9 mg l therefore 77 of the sources studied exceed the standard recommended by who 1000 mg l illustrating highly mineralized waters overall with the exception of some water points that have a low mineralization less than 700 mg l bouaissa et al 2021a the variation in the concentrations of major ions in the groundwater in the study area is presented as a box plot fig 4 the ions contributing most to the total concentrations of the water samples are cl na so4 2 ca2 and mg2 it should be noted that sodium and calcium are the most dominant cations and chlorides and sulphates are the most dominant anions to determine the chemical facies associated with each water sample we used the piper triangular diagram fig 5 figure 5 shows three facies associated with the groundwater in the study area the first facies corresponds to chlorinated water of which there are two families sodium chlorinated the most frequent at 73 of the water points studied first facies and calcium chlorinated and sulphated second facies at 22 the third facies is represented by sodium bicarbonate waters at 5 this observed transition from one facies to another highlights the complexity of hydrogeochemical processes that can contribute to the mineralization of groundwater in this massif table 2 displays the correlation coefficient matrix between the main elements and tds this comparison shows that groundwater mineralization at the bokoya massif is mainly controlled by cl na so4 2 and mg2 and is corroborated by maps of the spatial distribution of these elements showing similar concentration variability to that of tds fig 6 the spatial distribution of higher concentrations of nitrates no3 indicates an influence of anthropogenic pollution high nitrate concentrations are observed in the area of the wastewater treatment plant in al hoceima and in urban centers such as rouadi ait kamra and izemmouren bouaissa et al 2021a this pollution is likely a result of the absence of sewerage networks and the use of septic tanks bouaissa et al 2021b in fact 36 of the sources studied exceed the standard for nitrates as established by the world health organization who 50 mg l 3 2

measurement 1 5 implies the evaporation mark concerns samples with values under 8 5 all samples 9 lower than 1500 μs cm show d excess values between 9 0 and 11 9 for the samples higher than 1500 μs cm 8 samples show values between 8 0 and 13 1 among them the highest ec e58 7 others show a very slightly evaporation mark d excess between 7 3 and 8 2 and only one shows clearly an evaporation process with a d excess of 4 7 and ec of 3030 μs cm e29 this finding confirms the dominance discussed ahead of the dissolution of evaporate deposits in the determination of the chemistry of the waters studied only few samples under a d excess values lower than 8 e1 e5 e12 e29 and e32 seem to have undergone slight to moderate evaporation shown also in fig 11 in other studies carried out on semi arid climates the researchers found that the salinization of groundwater is attributed to the dissolution of minerals moreover this mineralization is also increased due to evaporation then with an enrichment of water isotope content krishan et al 2020b 2021 krishan et al 2020 in our case evaporation has few effect on mineralization because of the rapid infiltration of rainwater linked to the karstic character of the study area the use of the isotopic analysis of the groundwater of the bokoya massif has demonstrated that the main driver of salinization is the dissolution of minerals this confirms the results previously obtained by the hydrochemical and geochemical study 4 conclusions the socio economic development of the al hoceima region is highly dependent on groundwater resources the hydrochemical geochemical and isotopic analyses completed in this study aim at determining the processes of salinization and groundwater recharge in the bokoya massif because of its strategic importance in managing scarce water resources the hydrochemical study shows that the salinity of the water varies over a wide range from 608 to 8690 μs cm and that the study area is characterized by three types of water that is dominated by sodium chloride at 73 of the sources studied thus the mineralization of these springs is controlled by local geological conditions and anthropogenic conditions this is corroborated by the maps showing the distribution of high salinity waters along saline triassic formations and high nitrate concentrations mapped with large villages the geochemical study shows that all the water samples studied are supersaturated in calcite and almost supersaturated in dolomite facilitating local re precipitation whereas halite and gypsum remain unsaturated with respect to ionic content furthermore the ion exchange diagram shows both direct and reverse ion exchange this supports the hypothesis of salinization by dissolution of evaporate rocks such as halite and gypsum with simultaneous precipitation of calcite and dolomite in combination with direct and reverse ion exchange of clay minerals this mineralization is therefore strongly related to the geological context marked by the presence of evaporates and dolomite in the triassic formations the results obtained in the isotopic study showed that the recharge of most of the springs is carried out by direct infiltration of rainfall of mixed mediterranean and atlantic origin and that most of the groundwater of the bokoya massif is locally recharged at altitudes between 350 and 750 m with the exception of a few springs which are recharged at the level of the tizirene flysch water table according to the correlation of deuterium and oxygen 18 the water penetrates rapidly into the subsoil without any major change in the relative abundances of these two elements due to the phenomenon of evaporation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11929,climate change and extensive groundwater extraction threaten the sustainability of groundwater resources in myanmar especially in the ayeyarwaddy delta region due to the lack of public water supply an increasing population with extensive agricultural and industrial development has raised the importance of groundwater in many areas of the ayeyarwaddy delta this study revealed the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes and the selection of piping materials in the htantabin township of the delta region which belongs to the highest group of water consumption from unimproved sources seasonal quality changes in groundwater and the influencing factors were also studied the findings showed that groundwater in some locations in the study area was contaminated by saltwater areas within 100 m of the irrigation canal were more likely to experience seawater intrusion the majority of groundwater samples were not suitable for drinking as the examined parameters exceeded the who guideline values in the summer only 37 5 of groundwater samples were fitted into categories that were suitable for irrigation however a higher percentage 62 5 became suitable during the rainy season with a reduction in salinity contrary to groundwater salinity the corrosion risk for metal pipes increased during the rainy season graphical abstract image 1 keywords chloride corrosivity electrical conductivity irrigation canal ph salinity 1 introduction global climate change has impacted groundwater worldwide through the consequences of rising sea levels saltwater intrusion increasing temperature changes in precipitation and recharge to groundwater viossanges et al 2017 freshwater sources such as rivers and streams in many coastal regions are affected by the inflow of seawater which increases the impact of groundwater on domestic agricultural and industrial needs vijay et al 2011 however intensive groundwater extraction from coastal aquifers could aggravate seawater intrusion by lowering the freshwater table and allowing seawater to migrate inland barlow and reichard 2010 around half of the world s population lives in coastal areas because of the abundance of highly vegetated lands and rich biological resources such as fisheries and seafood prusty et al 2018 seawater intrusion can affect the sustainable development of the coastal region by negatively affecting human health and ecosystems agricultural productivity and industrial growth oude essink 2001 demirel 2004 hussain et al 2015 myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change according to the global climate risk index kreft et al 2014 climate change related impacts on water resources in the ayeyarwaddy delta of myanmar were studied by the international water management institute iwmi and their findings are highlighted below viossanges et al 2017 myanmar s climate is influenced by tropical southwest and northeast monsoons receiving approximately 5000 mm of annual rainfall the frequency of cyclones and accompanying strong winds storm surges floods or inundation heavy rains extreme temperatures droughts and sea level rise were evidence of climate change related impacts in the delta the mean temperature increased from 26 6 c to 27 7 c between 1972 and 2014 and the annual average temperature of myanmar was predicted to increase by 1 3 c 2 7 c above the historical level by the middle of the 21st century it could be that the dry seasons have become longer with shorter rainy seasons changes in climatic variables can significantly alter groundwater recharge rates as groundwater aquifers are recharged mainly by rainfall the groundwater recharge process is also controlled by temperature reducing the amount of surface water available for groundwater recharge sea level rose in myanmar s coastline from 5 cm to 13 cm in 2020 and it was estimated to increase up to 41 cm by the 2050s rising sea levels lead to saltwater intrusion into the groundwater system especially in summer when water volumes in river systems become low and it is one of the most pressing concerns for the coastal area particularly the ayeyarwaddy delta region being the largest country in mainland southeast asia myanmar has a long continuous coastline of almost 3000 km extending along the bay of bengal and andaman sea zockler et al 2013 population pressure is high in coastal areas especially in the fertile ayeyarwaddy delta groundwater plays a vital role in myanmar and 60 of households use groundwater for drinking and domestic water supplies in the ayeyarwaddy delta viossanges et al 2017 although there are no reliable official data for groundwater use the number of authorized or unauthorized tube wells tapping into groundwater is increasing in the delta area jue et al 2020 the ayeyarwaddy delta is famous for its fertile land and paddy rice is cultivated across much of the delta monsoon crops are dominantly rainfed however dry season cropping relies on irrigation canals and groundwater and it seems that the volume of groundwater withdrawn for irrigation approach surpasses the volume for domestic needs viossanges et al 2017 moreover the groundwater use in the delta region is expected to soon increase substantially for the urbanization and development of industrial work the number of industrial or economic zones increased to 89 zones for the entire country and most of them were located in the delta region mimu 2019 with high population density extensive agricultural land and increasing industrial development groundwater will likely be increasingly important for the ayeyarwaddy delta region in the future because groundwater is an essential source for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors in the ayeyarwaddy delta it is critical to assess its suitability for safe water use consuming water with high salt content in the long term could cause undesirable health problems such as toxicity hypertension and edema who 2017 the injudicious use of saline irrigation water could result in not only low crop yield but also soil structure degradation zaman et al 2018 the quality demands of groundwater for domestic and irrigation purposes could vary greatly depending on the type and quantity of dissolved salts sarath et al 2012 in addition the possibility of metal corrosion in water pipelines depends on the quality of water rawat et al 2018 thus this study was conducted in the ayeyarwaddy delta region of myanmar to 1 assess groundwater quality with respect to salinity and trace elements to determine suitability for drinking and irrigation and for the selection of piping material 2 determine how the distribution of water quality parameters varies both spatially and seasonally and 3 identify the factors controlling the quality of groundwater in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yangon the most populated region in myanmar sits on the wider ayeyarwaddy delta resting on the andaman sea to the south it is administratively divided into 45 townships the yangon city development committee ycdc is responsible for public services including water supply however the ycdc could only provide their services to 34 townships ycdc 2019 consequently most suburban townships have no public water supply and htantabin township is one of them according to the census data the htantabin township belonged to the highest group that used water from unimproved sources 68 1 compared to other townships in the yangon region it has a total land area of 606 9 km2 and a population of 145 792 the population density of htantabin township was 240 persons per km2 the majority of the people in the township live in rural areas with only 6 2 living in urban areas according to township administration data dop 2015 there is plenty of agricultural land in htantabin and 45 4 of the population is employed in the agriculture and fishing industry it is surrounded by industrial zones htantabin industrial zone in the north shwe pyi thar industrial zone in the east and hlaingtharyar industrial zone in the south due to the absence of public water supply factories in the htantabin industrial zone have to rely on groundwater only therefore the htantabin township was selected as the study area considering the importance of groundwater for high demands in agricultural and industrial sectors in addition to domestic needs the study area lies between 16 02 17 50 e longitudes and 95 06 96 48 n latitudes fig 1 2 2 sample collection and measurements groundwater samples were collected from 16 different locations in the htantabin township during the summer and rainy seasons sample collection was carried out with the help of researchers from the department of geology of yangon university groundwater samples were directly taken from the outlet pipes of the barholes or tubewells using sterile plastic bags 1 l the examined parameters were ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds alkalinity chloride cl sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sulfate so4 2 ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and total iron ph ec and tds were measured using a portable ph ec tds meter hi99300d hanna alkalinity and total iron were measured using an alkalinity test kit hach and a total iron test kit hach on the day of sampling samples were then filtered and kept inside the fridge and brought to the water and environmental engineering laboratory at tokyo metropolitan university for analysis other parameters were measured by ion chromatography cbm 20a shimadzu japan 2 3 assessment of groundwater quality 2 3 1 types of groundwater back and hanshaw 1965 recommended the use of piper diagrams for the characterization of groundwater major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 are plotted in the two basal triangles of the diagram where all of the major cations and anions are expressed as percent of meq l the central portion of the diamond shaped diagram describes the classification of water piper 1944 piper trilinear diagrams were plotted using diagrammes software version 6 73 2 3 2 suitability for drinking who guideline values for drinking water 2017 were used as a reference for the interpretation of groundwater quality 2 3 3 suitability for irrigation the groundwater suitability for irrigation was revealed through fao guidelines for the interpretation of water quality for irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 as follows 1 salinity affects crop water availability evaluate using ec or tds 2 infiltration affects the infiltration rate of water into soil evaluation using ec and sar sar can be calculated through the following formula us salinity laboratory 1954 s a r n a 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 where all ions are in meq l 3 specific ion toxicity affects sensitive crops for example chloride toxicity 4 miscellaneous effects affects sensitive crops for example ph the suitability of groundwater for irrigation can also be justified using the wilcox diagram wilcox 1948 this elucidates the sodium percentage and electrical conductivity to classify groundwater in this study a wilcox diagram was produced using diagrammes software version 6 73 2 3 4 corrosivity of groundwater the quality of groundwater was evaluated using the corrosivity ratio cr and probability of corrosion of the metal w0 for the selection of suitable piping material 2 3 4 1 corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio provides information on the suitable type of piping material for water supply if cr value is 1 any kind of pipes can be used for water transport however if cr value is 1 metal pipe should not be used as a transportation material shankar et al 2011 cr could be estimated through the following formula c r c l 35 2 s o 4 2 96 c o 3 2 h c o 3 100 all ions are in ppm 2 3 4 2 corrosion of metal w0 according to the german national standard din 50929 3 the corrosion probability of metal contact with water w0 can be calculated from the concentration of chloride cl sulfate so4 2 calcium ca2 and ph din 2018 the w0 of groundwater was evaluated for unalloyed iron and galvanized steel using a specific rating 3 results and discussion 3 1 types of groundwater the piper trilinear diagram is an important tool for interpreting the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater rao 1998 it can reveal the differences among water samples based on the dominant cation and anion groups placing those with similarities in the same group piper 1944 na is the dominant major cation for the majority of the samples apart from 2 non dominant samples in the summer and 3 non dominant samples in the rainy season fig 2 in contrast cl is the major anion representing two thirds of the samples in both seasons followed by hco3 piper s plot revealed that the majority of groundwater samples fell into the na cl type 62 5 during summer and 56 25 during rainy season followed by the mixed type approximately 25 in both seasons table 1 other observed types in the study area are mg2 hco3 6 25 during summer and 18 75 during rainy season and na hco3 types the results are similar to the findings in bangladesh where high sodium concentration in groundwater resulted from saline water intrusion in the bengal basin afroza et al 2009 saha et al 2019 contamination from agricultural by products might be the other sources of sodium content considering the presence of plenty of paddy fields in the study area 3 2 suitability for drinking the quality of groundwater was interpreted using who guidelines for drinking water first addendum to the fourth edition who 2017 the quality of groundwater during the summer and rainy seasons are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively to avoid overlapping seasonal variations in groundwater quality will not be discussed in detail in this section this will be discussed together with the potential driving factors in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 1 ph the reaction of minerals in rocks with water and organic matter such as humic acid and fulvic acid can change the ph of water raj and jayashekhar 2007 groundwater in the study area had ph values ranging from 7 5 to 8 8 mean value 8 1 and 6 2 8 4 mean value 7 1 during the summer and rainy seasons respectively the noticeable decline in ph value might be due to the mixing effect of low ph rainwater during the rainy season the average rainwater ph value during the rainy season was around 6 5 according to the yangon meteorological and hydrology station dmh 2020 most of the groundwater samples had ph values within the acceptable range 6 5 8 5 of the who guideline value for drinking water 3 2 2 electrical conductivity the electrical conductivity of water depends on the concentration of ions as the amount of dissolved solids in water can determine electrical conductivity meride and ayenew 2016 the ec value should not exceed 400 μs cm according to the who guidelines who 2017 ec values were observed in the range of 117 5900 μs cm mean value 1252 μs cm and 105 3052 μs cm mean value 846 μs cm in summer and rainy seasons respectively most of the groundwater samples exceeded the permissible ec value for drinking purposes seawater had higher ec values and the occurrence of high ec values in groundwater suggested possible seawater intrusion in the study area percolation of agricultural and industrial wastes could also enhance the ec values of groundwater 3 2 3 total dissolved solids discharges from agricultural and industrial wastes can result in high tds in water viswanathan and meenakshi 2008 according to who guidelines a tds value of 500 mg l is highly desirable and up to 1000 mg l is permissible for drinking who 2017 the tds values of groundwater were found to be within the range of 59 2950 mg l mean value 627 mg l and 51 1537 mg l mean value 424 mg l in summer and rainy seasons respectively only two stations in summer and one station in the rainy season had tds values higher than the permissible limit for drinking the high tds value of water may be aesthetically unsatisfactory for people 3 2 4 bicarbonate mineral decomposition can lead to an increase in hco3 concentration in groundwater stumm and morgan 1996 the hco3 concentration of groundwater varied within the range of 58 537 mg l mean value 250 mg l and 37 512 mg l mean value 239 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively most of the stations in the study area had high hco3 concentrations in groundwater exceeding the permissible limit 150 mg l of the who guideline values a high hco3 concentration indicated the presence of minerals in water which could yield toxicity and undesired health problems in excess amounts 3 2 5 chloride chloride contamination in groundwater could originate from a variety of sources such as seawater intrusion leaching of sedimentary rocks landfill leachates and discharges from agricultural and industrial waste karanth 1987 the chloride concentration in drinking water should not exceed 250 mg l according to the who guidelines who 2017 groundwater in our study area contained chloride concentrations of 2 2 1773 mg l mean value 356 mg l and 1 8 1765 mg l mean value 309 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively almost half of the stations had higher chloride concentrations than the permissible limit for drinking which might cause a detectable taste in water higher chloride concentration could be due to contamination from seawater intrusion or massive application of fertilizers or industrial discharges 3 2 6 sodium high na concentrations in groundwater could be a consequence of weathering of rocks and minerals udayalaxmi et al 2010 according to the who guidelines drinking water should have a na concentration lower than 250 mg l who 2017 the na concentration in groundwater was found to be within the range of 10 896 mg l mean value 234 mg l and 9 883 mg l mean value 211 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively one third of the stations exceeded the permissible limit of na concentration for drinking water which may cause health problems such as hypertension arteriosclerosis edema and loose motion 3 2 7 potassium a high k concentration could result from the presence of geochemical strata in the soil layers mohamed and zahir 2017 a lower concentration of k compared to na could be due to the higher resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering sarath et al 2012 the k concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 5 to 44 mg l and 0 47 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively with the same mean value of 10 mg l only three stations exceeded the permissible concentration of 12 mg l according to the who guideline values 3 2 8 ammonia nh4 concentration was found to be low in most of the groundwater samples within the range of 0 30 mg l mean value 5 3 mg l and 0 20 mg l mean value 2 58 mg l during the summer and rainy seasons respectively although no health based guideline value was recommended by the who nh4 could cause taste and odor problems at concentrations above 35 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively who 2017 no stations exceeded 35 mg l of nh4 in groundwater however half of the stations had nh4 concentrations above 1 5 mg l which could lead to an unpleasant odor station 16 had a high nh4 concentration in both seasons this station is close to a meandering river and its oxbow lake although no water quality data are available for this oxbow lake it is possible that this closed water body made its sediment environment anaerobic which might have impacted station no 16 resulting in high ammonia concentration regardless of the season 3 2 9 total iron no health based guideline value for iron has been proposed and iron concentrations of 1 3 mg l can be acceptable for people drinking anaerobic well water who 2017 apart from station no 6 the total iron concentration of groundwater in almost all locations in the htantabin township were less than 1 mg l with mean values of 2 mg l and 1 3 mg l during the summer and rainy seasons respectively station 6 had a very high total iron concentration in both seasons and this contamination could be due to the metal pipe corrosion 3 2 10 calcium magnesium sulfate and nitrate the concentrations of calcium magnesium sulfate and nitrate were fit into the who guideline values for drinking water in all locations although there were some fluctuations among seasons based on the measured parameters the majority of groundwater samples were not suitable for drinking according to the who guideline values ec hco3 and cl were the most commonly unsuitable parameters in the summer only station no 2 was suitable for drinking however four stations stations n2 8 10 and 15 showed acceptable quality during the rainy season 3 3 suitability for irrigation the data set for the interpretation of groundwater quality for irrigation is provided in the appendices table a1 a4 3 3 1 salinity hazard electrical conductivity ec the most important water quality parameter from the salinity standpoint is the total concentration of dissolved salts the total salt concentration of irrigation water was measured by determining its electrical conductivity ec in μs cm zaman et al 2018 according to the ussl water salinity classification 1954 most of the groundwater samples of the study area fell into c3 class which posed a high salinity hazard fig 3 salinity class was downgraded in stations 3 4 6 8 9 12 and 15 during the rainy season due to the potential dilution effect of rainwater although there were no changes in salinity class according to the grading criteria a noticeable decline in salinity was observed at station no 14 from 1210 to 778 μs cm contrary to the majority of stations the salinity of groundwater station no 16 significantly increased from c2 to c4 in the rainy season it was located close to the river but upstream of the sea this contamination may have been due to the application of fertilizers in nearby paddy fields we may also expect the impact of the river and its oxbow lake on salinity total dissolved solids tds suitability of irrigation water could be classified based on tds concentration class 1 preferred for irrigation class 2 slight to moderate unsuitable and class 3 unsuitable for agricultural purposes fao 2006 tds is composed of dissolved minerals nutrients and major ions such as ca2 mg2 na k co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 and po4 3 when water evaporates the accumulation of salt in the root zone creates obstacles and plants are not capable of absorbing water from the soil resulting in moisture stress modi 2000 according to the tds concentration the majority of groundwater samples had preferable concentrations of tds fig 3 for irrigation purposes with the potential dilution effect of rainwater downgraded changes of tds class were found at station no 6 11 14 and 15 during the rainy season similar to the ec value tds also increased from class 1 to class 2 at station no 16 during the rainy season 3 3 2 infiltration hazard sodium adsorption ratio sar the sodium hazard of irrigation water is expressed as the sar the main problem of high sodium concentration is its effect on the physical properties of soil soil structure degradation and it may also be toxic to sensitive crops continued use of water with a high sar value leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil this breakdown in the soil physical structure results in the dispersion of soil clay which causes the soil to become hard and compact when dry and increasingly impervious to water penetration when wet most of the groundwater samples in the study area belonged to the s4 class according to the ussl classification fig 4 the long term application of groundwater for irrigation purposes in the htantabin township could lead to soil structure degradation the sar grading of groundwater remained unchanged for most of the stations during the summer and rainy seasons with the potential dilution impact of rainwater declination in sar grading was found at stations 14 and 15 during the rainy season 3 3 3 toxicity to plants chloride toxicity the most common crop toxicity is caused by chlorides in irrigation water chlorides are necessary for plant growth although at high concentrations they can inhibit plant growth and can be highly toxic to some plant species ayers and westcot 1985 reported that cl toxicity on plants first appeared at the leaf tips and progressed along the edges excessive necrosis is often accompanied by early leaf drop or even total plant defoliation four toxicity classes were categorized according to cl concentration safe 2 slight to moderate sensitive plant 2 4 slight to moderate moderately tolerant plant 4 10 severe 10 ludwick et al 1990 bauder et al 2011 most of the groundwater samples from the study area fall into the class which can yield slight to moderate toxic effects for crops fig 4 with the potential dilution effect of rainwater a reduction in cl toxicity class was found at stations no 5 8 9 14 and 15 during the rainy season 3 3 4 miscellaneous effects ph the preferable range of ph for irrigation is 6 5 8 4 which is similar to 6 5 to 8 5 for drinking purposes ayers and westcot 1985 most of the stations had preferable ph values for irrigation with the dilution effect of rainwater the ph values of most of the stations reduced significantly from a mean value of 8 1 in the summer to 7 1 in the rainy season in the summer three stations no 1 11 and 15 had ph values higher than 8 4 while station no 13 had a ph value lower than 6 5 during the rainy season 3 3 5 wilcox diagram based on the sodium percentage and electrical conductivity groundwater samples can be categorized into five divisions for irrigation purposes using the wilcox diagram excellent to good good to permissible permissible to doubtful doubtful to unsuitable and unsuitable fig 5 only 37 5 of the groundwater samples fit into the upper two categories which could be considered suitable for irrigation during the summer however the percentage of groundwater in the first category increased to 62 5 during the rainy season table 4 this finding highlights the importance of the rainwater s impact on the groundwater quality in the study area 3 3 6 significant seasonal variations in groundwater quality the quality of groundwater was improved with a decrease in the concentration of contaminants tds ec sar and cl in most of the stations during the rainy season among them an evident decline in the grading of tds ec sar and cl was found in two adjacent stations no 14 and 15 fig 6 probably their locations might have a better permeability soil type which allowed rainwater infiltration to the ground in higher amounts compared to other locations in the study area in contrast the concentration of contaminants tds ec sar and cl at station 16 increased significantly during the rainy season this could be the potential consequence of the recent application of fertilizers in nearby paddy fields 3 4 corrosivity of water 3 4 1 corrosivity ratio cr cr is a useful index for the selection of pipes in agricultural and industrial sectors based on the cr values pvc plastic low cost pipes or metallic costly pipes were chosen for irrigation water supply rawat et al 2018 according to the findings non metal pipes were preferred for most of the groundwater samples in the study area fig 7 groundwater quality was found to be suitable for any pipe at stations 1 and 2 for both seasons in the rainy season stations 8 and 14 were suitable for any pipe a decrease in cr could be a consequence of comparatively lower salinity during the rainy season however station no 13 was no longer fit for any pipes during the rainy season as salinity did not decrease and a decline in alkalinity could have led to this situation the rest of the stations remained unchanged as non metal pipe preferable areas 3 4 2 probability of corrosion of metal w0 the probability of metal corrosion w0 was revealed through the german national standard din 50929 3 din 2018 w0 was categorized into four classes very low small medium and high risks for unalloyed iron and galvanized steel according to the findings groundwater in the study area had no risk of corrosion for galvanized steel in either season however some of the groundwater samples posed a small risk for the probability of corrosion of unalloyed iron the proportion of samples in the low risk group increased from 37 in the summer to 69 in the rainy season fig 8 this could be a potential consequence of the combination of low ph rainwater with groundwater a similar situation to cr was observed for w0 at station no 13 where w0 increased from very low to low risk during the rainy season with a decrease in ph and alkalinity but the salinity remained unchanged during the rainy season there may be another source of cl contamination at station no 13 such as fertilizer application 3 4 3 correlations between cr and w0 in the summer a small risk for metal corrosion w0 was detected at six stations no 5 6 8 11 14 and 16 which were also regarded as non metal pipe preference areas according to the cr value moreover all the pipe preference areas stations no 1 2 and 13 posed a very low risk for metal corrosion with lower w0 therefore cr and w0 were observed to be supportive of each other in corrosivity risk prediction during summer however the pattern of estimation was no longer supportive of each other during the rainy season as any pipes preferable area stations no 1 2 and 8 fell into the small risk group with comparatively higher w0 myanmar is a tropical country with high rainfall particularly in the delta area according to data from yangon weather station the average monthly rainfall in the yangon region during the rainy season was approximately 400 mm in 2019 dmh 2020 during the rainy season a noticeable reduction in ph was observed at almost all stations with a mean value of 7 1 however changes in alkalinity were independent of ph with similar mean values around 3200 mgcaco3 l for both seasons this might be the reason for the different outcomes in risk prediction between cr and w0 during the rainy season 3 5 seawater intrusion highly permeable alluvial deposits cover two thirds of the yangon region and can be categorized into valley fill alluvial deposits marine alluvial deposits and flat plain alluvial deposits hlaingtharyar and htantabin are neighboring townships and are both located on marine alluvial deposits consisting of marine clay and silty clay with high organic content from decaying vegetation although there is no specific information regarding the geotechnical characteristics of the htantabin township the geotechnical characteristics of the hlaingtharyar township was revealed in a recent study by the department of engineering geology of yangon technological university khin 2019 two water aquifers were observed in the hlaingtharyar 1 shallow aquifer which yielded 200 gph to 3000 gph at a depth between 24 m and 42 m and 2 a water bearing horizon with a thickness of 12 m yielding 1000 gph at a depth of 75 m their study stated that saltwater intrusion was observed in hlaingtharyar along the hlaing and panhlaing rivers but detailed information was not provided the ec level and cl concentration are the simplest indicators of seawater intrusion or salinization mercado 1985 according to alfarrah and walraevens 2018 groundwater samples exceeding the ec value of 1000 μs cm and cl concentration of 200 mg l were likely to be influenced by seawater intrusion the locations of potential seawater intrusion in the study area stations 5 6 11 12 14 15 and 16 are shown in fig 9 the majority of the land area in htantabin was covered by agricultural lands and irrigation canals were used to drain water from the river to the farms considering this situation the pattern of seawater intrusion was revealed based on the distance to the nearest sources river or irrigation canal according to the findings table 5 no statistically significant association was observed between seawater intrusion and the distance from the river or irrigation canal however locations with high salinity samples no 11 12 14 15 and 16 were found close to the irrigation canal within 100 m which could be the source of high salinity contamination the remaining locations with high salinity samples no 5 and 6 could be the consequence of leakage of industrial wastes to the ground as they were located close to the industrial area the correlation between the well depths and salinity was also studied fig 10 the well depths varied between 9 m and 60 m and no significant impact on the pattern of seawater intrusion was observed 4 conclusions the groundwater quality parameters in most of the stations exceeded the who guideline values for drinking and ec hco3 and cl were the most common unsuitable parameters the local population requires an improved source of drinking water because high salinity in groundwater makes it unsuitable for drinking although quality improvement was observed in the rainy season groundwater was not suitable for irrigation in many locations in the study area with high sodium concentration and salinity according to the salinity values ec and cl almost half of the examined locations suffered seawater intrusion to some extent areas within 100 m of the irrigation canal were more likely to be contaminated by seawater intrusion the concentration of contaminants in most of the stations was reduced during the rainy season a significant decline in the concentrations of tds ec sar and cl was found in some locations during the rainy season however the level of quality improvement differed among the stations the permeability of the soil was supposed to play a major role in the rainwater infiltration process which led to the variation in quality improvement two different prediction models cr and w0 for the corrosivity of piping material were applied in this study and their estimations supported each other in the summer but not in the rainy season the metal corrosion probability w0 increased during the rainy season with a decline in the ph value researchers should apply the risk prediction model for the corrosivity inclusive of ph as a factor considering

11929,climate change and extensive groundwater extraction threaten the sustainability of groundwater resources in myanmar especially in the ayeyarwaddy delta region due to the lack of public water supply an increasing population with extensive agricultural and industrial development has raised the importance of groundwater in many areas of the ayeyarwaddy delta this study revealed the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes and the selection of piping materials in the htantabin township of the delta region which belongs to the highest group of water consumption from unimproved sources seasonal quality changes in groundwater and the influencing factors were also studied the findings showed that groundwater in some locations in the study area was contaminated by saltwater areas within 100 m of the irrigation canal were more likely to experience seawater intrusion the majority of groundwater samples were not suitable for drinking as the examined parameters exceeded the who guideline values in the summer only 37 5 of groundwater samples were fitted into categories that were suitable for irrigation however a higher percentage 62 5 became suitable during the rainy season with a reduction in salinity contrary to groundwater salinity the corrosion risk for metal pipes increased during the rainy season graphical abstract image 1 keywords chloride corrosivity electrical conductivity irrigation canal ph salinity 1 introduction global climate change has impacted groundwater worldwide through the consequences of rising sea levels saltwater intrusion increasing temperature changes in precipitation and recharge to groundwater viossanges et al 2017 freshwater sources such as rivers and streams in many coastal regions are affected by the inflow of seawater which increases the impact of groundwater on domestic agricultural and industrial needs vijay et al 2011 however intensive groundwater extraction from coastal aquifers could aggravate seawater intrusion by lowering the freshwater table and allowing seawater to migrate inland barlow and reichard 2010 around half of the world s population lives in coastal areas because of the abundance of highly vegetated lands and rich biological resources such as fisheries and seafood prusty et al 2018 seawater intrusion can affect the sustainable development of the coastal region by negatively affecting human health and ecosystems agricultural productivity and industrial growth oude essink 2001 demirel 2004 hussain et al 2015 myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change according to the global climate risk index kreft et al 2014 climate change related impacts on water resources in the ayeyarwaddy delta of myanmar were studied by the international water management institute iwmi and their findings are highlighted below viossanges et al 2017 myanmar s climate is influenced by tropical southwest and northeast monsoons receiving approximately 5000 mm of annual rainfall the frequency of cyclones and accompanying strong winds storm surges floods or inundation heavy rains extreme temperatures droughts and sea level rise were evidence of climate change related impacts in the delta the mean temperature increased from 26 6 c to 27 7 c between 1972 and 2014 and the annual average temperature of myanmar was predicted to increase by 1 3 c 2 7 c above the historical level by the middle of the 21st century it could be that the dry seasons have become longer with shorter rainy seasons changes in climatic variables can significantly alter groundwater recharge rates as groundwater aquifers are recharged mainly by rainfall the groundwater recharge process is also controlled by temperature reducing the amount of surface water available for groundwater recharge sea level rose in myanmar s coastline from 5 cm to 13 cm in 2020 and it was estimated to increase up to 41 cm by the 2050s rising sea levels lead to saltwater intrusion into the groundwater system especially in summer when water volumes in river systems become low and it is one of the most pressing concerns for the coastal area particularly the ayeyarwaddy delta region being the largest country in mainland southeast asia myanmar has a long continuous coastline of almost 3000 km extending along the bay of bengal and andaman sea zockler et al 2013 population pressure is high in coastal areas especially in the fertile ayeyarwaddy delta groundwater plays a vital role in myanmar and 60 of households use groundwater for drinking and domestic water supplies in the ayeyarwaddy delta viossanges et al 2017 although there are no reliable official data for groundwater use the number of authorized or unauthorized tube wells tapping into groundwater is increasing in the delta area jue et al 2020 the ayeyarwaddy delta is famous for its fertile land and paddy rice is cultivated across much of the delta monsoon crops are dominantly rainfed however dry season cropping relies on irrigation canals and groundwater and it seems that the volume of groundwater withdrawn for irrigation approach surpasses the volume for domestic needs viossanges et al 2017 moreover the groundwater use in the delta region is expected to soon increase substantially for the urbanization and development of industrial work the number of industrial or economic zones increased to 89 zones for the entire country and most of them were located in the delta region mimu 2019 with high population density extensive agricultural land and increasing industrial development groundwater will likely be increasingly important for the ayeyarwaddy delta region in the future because groundwater is an essential source for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors in the ayeyarwaddy delta it is critical to assess its suitability for safe water use consuming water with high salt content in the long term could cause undesirable health problems such as toxicity hypertension and edema who 2017 the injudicious use of saline irrigation water could result in not only low crop yield but also soil structure degradation zaman et al 2018 the quality demands of groundwater for domestic and irrigation purposes could vary greatly depending on the type and quantity of dissolved salts sarath et al 2012 in addition the possibility of metal corrosion in water pipelines depends on the quality of water rawat et al 2018 thus this study was conducted in the ayeyarwaddy delta region of myanmar to 1 assess groundwater quality with respect to salinity and trace elements to determine suitability for drinking and irrigation and for the selection of piping material 2 determine how the distribution of water quality parameters varies both spatially and seasonally and 3 identify the factors controlling the quality of groundwater in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yangon the most populated region in myanmar sits on the wider ayeyarwaddy delta resting on the andaman sea to the south it is administratively divided into 45 townships the yangon city development committee ycdc is responsible for public services including water supply however the ycdc could only provide their services to 34 townships ycdc 2019 consequently most suburban townships have no public water supply and htantabin township is one of them according to the census data the htantabin township belonged to the highest group that used water from unimproved sources 68 1 compared to other townships in the yangon region it has a total land area of 606 9 km2 and a population of 145 792 the population density of htantabin township was 240 persons per km2 the majority of the people in the township live in rural areas with only 6 2 living in urban areas according to township administration data dop 2015 there is plenty of agricultural land in htantabin and 45 4 of the population is employed in the agriculture and fishing industry it is surrounded by industrial zones htantabin industrial zone in the north shwe pyi thar industrial zone in the east and hlaingtharyar industrial zone in the south due to the absence of public water supply factories in the htantabin industrial zone have to rely on groundwater only therefore the htantabin township was selected as the study area considering the importance of groundwater for high demands in agricultural and industrial sectors in addition to domestic needs the study area lies between 16 02 17 50 e longitudes and 95 06 96 48 n latitudes fig 1 2 2 sample collection and measurements groundwater samples were collected from 16 different locations in the htantabin township during the summer and rainy seasons sample collection was carried out with the help of researchers from the department of geology of yangon university groundwater samples were directly taken from the outlet pipes of the barholes or tubewells using sterile plastic bags 1 l the examined parameters were ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds alkalinity chloride cl sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sulfate so4 2 ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and total iron ph ec and tds were measured using a portable ph ec tds meter hi99300d hanna alkalinity and total iron were measured using an alkalinity test kit hach and a total iron test kit hach on the day of sampling samples were then filtered and kept inside the fridge and brought to the water and environmental engineering laboratory at tokyo metropolitan university for analysis other parameters were measured by ion chromatography cbm 20a shimadzu japan 2 3 assessment of groundwater quality 2 3 1 types of groundwater back and hanshaw 1965 recommended the use of piper diagrams for the characterization of groundwater major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 are plotted in the two basal triangles of the diagram where all of the major cations and anions are expressed as percent of meq l the central portion of the diamond shaped diagram describes the classification of water piper 1944 piper trilinear diagrams were plotted using diagrammes software version 6 73 2 3 2 suitability for drinking who guideline values for drinking water 2017 were used as a reference for the interpretation of groundwater quality 2 3 3 suitability for irrigation the groundwater suitability for irrigation was revealed through fao guidelines for the interpretation of water quality for irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 as follows 1 salinity affects crop water availability evaluate using ec or tds 2 infiltration affects the infiltration rate of water into soil evaluation using ec and sar sar can be calculated through the following formula us salinity laboratory 1954 s a r n a 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 where all ions are in meq l 3 specific ion toxicity affects sensitive crops for example chloride toxicity 4 miscellaneous effects affects sensitive crops for example ph the suitability of groundwater for irrigation can also be justified using the wilcox diagram wilcox 1948 this elucidates the sodium percentage and electrical conductivity to classify groundwater in this study a wilcox diagram was produced using diagrammes software version 6 73 2 3 4 corrosivity of groundwater the quality of groundwater was evaluated using the corrosivity ratio cr and probability of corrosion of the metal w0 for the selection of suitable piping material 2 3 4 1 corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio provides information on the suitable type of piping material for water supply if cr value is 1 any kind of pipes can be used for water transport however if cr value is 1 metal pipe should not be used as a transportation material shankar et al 2011 cr could be estimated through the following formula c r c l 35 2 s o 4 2 96 c o 3 2 h c o 3 100 all ions are in ppm 2 3 4 2 corrosion of metal w0 according to the german national standard din 50929 3 the corrosion probability of metal contact with water w0 can be calculated from the concentration of chloride cl sulfate so4 2 calcium ca2 and ph din 2018 the w0 of groundwater was evaluated for unalloyed iron and galvanized steel using a specific rating 3 results and discussion 3 1 types of groundwater the piper trilinear diagram is an important tool for interpreting the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater rao 1998 it can reveal the differences among water samples based on the dominant cation and anion groups placing those with similarities in the same group piper 1944 na is the dominant major cation for the majority of the samples apart from 2 non dominant samples in the summer and 3 non dominant samples in the rainy season fig 2 in contrast cl is the major anion representing two thirds of the samples in both seasons followed by hco3 piper s plot revealed that the majority of groundwater samples fell into the na cl type 62 5 during summer and 56 25 during rainy season followed by the mixed type approximately 25 in both seasons table 1 other observed types in the study area are mg2 hco3 6 25 during summer and 18 75 during rainy season and na hco3 types the results are similar to the findings in bangladesh where high sodium concentration in groundwater resulted from saline water intrusion in the bengal basin afroza et al 2009 saha et al 2019 contamination from agricultural by products might be the other sources of sodium content considering the presence of plenty of paddy fields in the study area 3 2 suitability for drinking the quality of groundwater was interpreted using who guidelines for drinking water first addendum to the fourth edition who 2017 the quality of groundwater during the summer and rainy seasons are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively to avoid overlapping seasonal variations in groundwater quality will not be discussed in detail in this section this will be discussed together with the potential driving factors in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 1 ph the reaction of minerals in rocks with water and organic matter such as humic acid and fulvic acid can change the ph of water raj and jayashekhar 2007 groundwater in the study area had ph values ranging from 7 5 to 8 8 mean value 8 1 and 6 2 8 4 mean value 7 1 during the summer and rainy seasons respectively the noticeable decline in ph value might be due to the mixing effect of low ph rainwater during the rainy season the average rainwater ph value during the rainy season was around 6 5 according to the yangon meteorological and hydrology station dmh 2020 most of the groundwater samples had ph values within the acceptable range 6 5 8 5 of the who guideline value for drinking water 3 2 2 electrical conductivity the electrical conductivity of water depends on the concentration of ions as the amount of dissolved solids in water can determine electrical conductivity meride and ayenew 2016 the ec value should not exceed 400 μs cm according to the who guidelines who 2017 ec values were observed in the range of 117 5900 μs cm mean value 1252 μs cm and 105 3052 μs cm mean value 846 μs cm in summer and rainy seasons respectively most of the groundwater samples exceeded the permissible ec value for drinking purposes seawater had higher ec values and the occurrence of high ec values in groundwater suggested possible seawater intrusion in the study area percolation of agricultural and industrial wastes could also enhance the ec values of groundwater 3 2 3 total dissolved solids discharges from agricultural and industrial wastes can result in high tds in water viswanathan and meenakshi 2008 according to who guidelines a tds value of 500 mg l is highly desirable and up to 1000 mg l is permissible for drinking who 2017 the tds values of groundwater were found to be within the range of 59 2950 mg l mean value 627 mg l and 51 1537 mg l mean value 424 mg l in summer and rainy seasons respectively only two stations in summer and one station in the rainy season had tds values higher than the permissible limit for drinking the high tds value of water may be aesthetically unsatisfactory for people 3 2 4 bicarbonate mineral decomposition can lead to an increase in hco3 concentration in groundwater stumm and morgan 1996 the hco3 concentration of groundwater varied within the range of 58 537 mg l mean value 250 mg l and 37 512 mg l mean value 239 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively most of the stations in the study area had high hco3 concentrations in groundwater exceeding the permissible limit 150 mg l of the who guideline values a high hco3 concentration indicated the presence of minerals in water which could yield toxicity and undesired health problems in excess amounts 3 2 5 chloride chloride contamination in groundwater could originate from a variety of sources such as seawater intrusion leaching of sedimentary rocks landfill leachates and discharges from agricultural and industrial waste karanth 1987 the chloride concentration in drinking water should not exceed 250 mg l according to the who guidelines who 2017 groundwater in our study area contained chloride concentrations of 2 2 1773 mg l mean value 356 mg l and 1 8 1765 mg l mean value 309 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively almost half of the stations had higher chloride concentrations than the permissible limit for drinking which might cause a detectable taste in water higher chloride concentration could be due to contamination from seawater intrusion or massive application of fertilizers or industrial discharges 3 2 6 sodium high na concentrations in groundwater could be a consequence of weathering of rocks and minerals udayalaxmi et al 2010 according to the who guidelines drinking water should have a na concentration lower than 250 mg l who 2017 the na concentration in groundwater was found to be within the range of 10 896 mg l mean value 234 mg l and 9 883 mg l mean value 211 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively one third of the stations exceeded the permissible limit of na concentration for drinking water which may cause health problems such as hypertension arteriosclerosis edema and loose motion 3 2 7 potassium a high k concentration could result from the presence of geochemical strata in the soil layers mohamed and zahir 2017 a lower concentration of k compared to na could be due to the higher resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering sarath et al 2012 the k concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 5 to 44 mg l and 0 47 mg l in the summer and rainy seasons respectively with the same mean value of 10 mg l only three stations exceeded the permissible concentration of 12 mg l according to the who guideline values 3 2 8 ammonia nh4 concentration was found to be low in most of the groundwater samples within the range of 0 30 mg l mean value 5 3 mg l and 0 20 mg l mean value 2 58 mg l during the summer and rainy seasons respectively although no health based guideline value was recommended by the who nh4 could cause taste and odor problems at concentrations above 35 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively who 2017 no stations exceeded 35 mg l of nh4 in groundwater however half of the stations had nh4 concentrations above 1 5 mg l which could lead to an unpleasant odor station 16 had a high nh4 concentration in both seasons this station is close to a meandering river and its oxbow lake although no water quality data are available for this oxbow lake it is possible that this closed water body made its sediment environment anaerobic which might have impacted station no 16 resulting in high ammonia concentration regardless of the season 3 2 9 total iron no health based guideline value for iron has been proposed and iron concentrations of 1 3 mg l can be acceptable for people drinking anaerobic well water who 2017 apart from station no 6 the total iron concentration of groundwater in almost all locations in the htantabin township were less than 1 mg l with mean values of 2 mg l and 1 3 mg l during the summer and rainy seasons respectively station 6 had a very high total iron concentration in both seasons and this contamination could be due to the metal pipe corrosion 3 2 10 calcium magnesium sulfate and nitrate the concentrations of calcium magnesium sulfate and nitrate were fit into the who guideline values for drinking water in all locations although there were some fluctuations among seasons based on the measured parameters the majority of groundwater samples were not suitable for drinking according to the who guideline values ec hco3 and cl were the most commonly unsuitable parameters in the summer only station no 2 was suitable for drinking however four stations stations n2 8 10 and 15 showed acceptable quality during the rainy season 3 3 suitability for irrigation the data set for the interpretation of groundwater quality for irrigation is provided in the appendices table a1 a4 3 3 1 salinity hazard electrical conductivity ec the most important water quality parameter from the salinity standpoint is the total concentration of dissolved salts the total salt concentration of irrigation water was measured by determining its electrical conductivity ec in μs cm zaman et al 2018 according to the ussl water salinity classification 1954 most of the groundwater samples of the study area fell into c3 class which posed a high salinity hazard fig 3 salinity class was downgraded in stations 3 4 6 8 9 12 and 15 during the rainy season due to the potential dilution effect of rainwater although there were no changes in salinity class according to the grading criteria a noticeable decline in salinity was observed at station no 14 from 1210 to 778 μs cm contrary to the majority of stations the salinity of groundwater station no 16 significantly increased from c2 to c4 in the rainy season it was located close to the river but upstream of the sea this contamination may have been due to the application of fertilizers in nearby paddy fields we may also expect the impact of the river and its oxbow lake on salinity total dissolved solids tds suitability of irrigation water could be classified based on tds concentration class 1 preferred for irrigation class 2 slight to moderate unsuitable and class 3 unsuitable for agricultural purposes fao 2006 tds is composed of dissolved minerals nutrients and major ions such as ca2 mg2 na k co3 2 hco3 cl so4 2 and po4 3 when water evaporates the accumulation of salt in the root zone creates obstacles and plants are not capable of absorbing water from the soil resulting in moisture stress modi 2000 according to the tds concentration the majority of groundwater samples had preferable concentrations of tds fig 3 for irrigation purposes with the potential dilution effect of rainwater downgraded changes of tds class were found at station no 6 11 14 and 15 during the rainy season similar to the ec value tds also increased from class 1 to class 2 at station no 16 during the rainy season 3 3 2 infiltration hazard sodium adsorption ratio sar the sodium hazard of irrigation water is expressed as the sar the main problem of high sodium concentration is its effect on the physical properties of soil soil structure degradation and it may also be toxic to sensitive crops continued use of water with a high sar value leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil this breakdown in the soil physical structure results in the dispersion of soil clay which causes the soil to become hard and compact when dry and increasingly impervious to water penetration when wet most of the groundwater samples in the study area belonged to the s4 class according to the ussl classification fig 4 the long term application of groundwater for irrigation purposes in the htantabin township could lead to soil structure degradation the sar grading of groundwater remained unchanged for most of the stations during the summer and rainy seasons with the potential dilution impact of rainwater declination in sar grading was found at stations 14 and 15 during the rainy season 3 3 3 toxicity to plants chloride toxicity the most common crop toxicity is caused by chlorides in irrigation water chlorides are necessary for plant growth although at high concentrations they can inhibit plant growth and can be highly toxic to some plant species ayers and westcot 1985 reported that cl toxicity on plants first appeared at the leaf tips and progressed along the edges excessive necrosis is often accompanied by early leaf drop or even total plant defoliation four toxicity classes were categorized according to cl concentration safe 2 slight to moderate sensitive plant 2 4 slight to moderate moderately tolerant plant 4 10 severe 10 ludwick et al 1990 bauder et al 2011 most of the groundwater samples from the study area fall into the class which can yield slight to moderate toxic effects for crops fig 4 with the potential dilution effect of rainwater a reduction in cl toxicity class was found at stations no 5 8 9 14 and 15 during the rainy season 3 3 4 miscellaneous effects ph the preferable range of ph for irrigation is 6 5 8 4 which is similar to 6 5 to 8 5 for drinking purposes ayers and westcot 1985 most of the stations had preferable ph values for irrigation with the dilution effect of rainwater the ph values of most of the stations reduced significantly from a mean value of 8 1 in the summer to 7 1 in the rainy season in the summer three stations no 1 11 and 15 had ph values higher than 8 4 while station no 13 had a ph value lower than 6 5 during the rainy season 3 3 5 wilcox diagram based on the sodium percentage and electrical conductivity groundwater samples can be categorized into five divisions for irrigation purposes using the wilcox diagram excellent to good good to permissible permissible to doubtful doubtful to unsuitable and unsuitable fig 5 only 37 5 of the groundwater samples fit into the upper two categories which could be considered suitable for irrigation during the summer however the percentage of groundwater in the first category increased to 62 5 during the rainy season table 4 this finding highlights the importance of the rainwater s impact on the groundwater quality in the study area 3 3 6 significant seasonal variations in groundwater quality the quality of groundwater was improved with a decrease in the concentration of contaminants tds ec sar and cl in most of the stations during the rainy season among them an evident decline in the grading of tds ec sar and cl was found in two adjacent stations no 14 and 15 fig 6 probably their locations might have a better permeability soil type which allowed rainwater infiltration to the ground in higher amounts compared to other locations in the study area in contrast the concentration of contaminants tds ec sar and cl at station 16 increased significantly during the rainy season this could be the potential consequence of the recent application of fertilizers in nearby paddy fields 3 4 corrosivity of water 3 4 1 corrosivity ratio cr cr is a useful index for the selection of pipes in agricultural and industrial sectors based on the cr values pvc plastic low cost pipes or metallic costly pipes were chosen for irrigation water supply rawat et al 2018 according to the findings non metal pipes were preferred for most of the groundwater samples in the study area fig 7 groundwater quality was found to be suitable for any pipe at stations 1 and 2 for both seasons in the rainy season stations 8 and 14 were suitable for any pipe a decrease in cr could be a consequence of comparatively lower salinity during the rainy season however station no 13 was no longer fit for any pipes during the rainy season as salinity did not decrease and a decline in alkalinity could have led to this situation the rest of the stations remained unchanged as non metal pipe preferable areas 3 4 2 probability of corrosion of metal w0 the probability of metal corrosion w0 was revealed through the german national standard din 50929 3 din 2018 w0 was categorized into four classes very low small medium and high risks for unalloyed iron and galvanized steel according to the findings groundwater in the study area had no risk of corrosion for galvanized steel in either season however some of the groundwater samples posed a small risk for the probability of corrosion of unalloyed iron the proportion of samples in the low risk group increased from 37 in the summer to 69 in the rainy season fig 8 this could be a potential consequence of the combination of low ph rainwater with groundwater a similar situation to cr was observed for w0 at station no 13 where w0 increased from very low to low risk during the rainy season with a decrease in ph and alkalinity but the salinity remained unchanged during the rainy season there may be another source of cl contamination at station no 13 such as fertilizer application 3 4 3 correlations between cr and w0 in the summer a small risk for metal corrosion w0 was detected at six stations no 5 6 8 11 14 and 16 which were also regarded as non metal pipe preference areas according to the cr value moreover all the pipe preference areas stations no 1 2 and 13 posed a very low risk for metal corrosion with lower w0 therefore cr and w0 were observed to be supportive of each other in corrosivity risk prediction during summer however the pattern of estimation was no longer supportive of each other during the rainy season as any pipes preferable area stations no 1 2 and 8 fell into the small risk group with comparatively higher w0 myanmar is a tropical country with high rainfall particularly in the delta area according to data from yangon weather station the average monthly rainfall in the yangon region during the rainy season was approximately 400 mm in 2019 dmh 2020 during the rainy season a noticeable reduction in ph was observed at almost all stations with a mean value of 7 1 however changes in alkalinity were independent of ph with similar mean values around 3200 mgcaco3 l for both seasons this might be the reason for the different outcomes in risk prediction between cr and w0 during the rainy season 3 5 seawater intrusion highly permeable alluvial deposits cover two thirds of the yangon region and can be categorized into valley fill alluvial deposits marine alluvial deposits and flat plain alluvial deposits hlaingtharyar and htantabin are neighboring townships and are both located on marine alluvial deposits consisting of marine clay and silty clay with high organic content from decaying vegetation although there is no specific information regarding the geotechnical characteristics of the htantabin township the geotechnical characteristics of the hlaingtharyar township was revealed in a recent study by the department of engineering geology of yangon technological university khin 2019 two water aquifers were observed in the hlaingtharyar 1 shallow aquifer which yielded 200 gph to 3000 gph at a depth between 24 m and 42 m and 2 a water bearing horizon with a thickness of 12 m yielding 1000 gph at a depth of 75 m their study stated that saltwater intrusion was observed in hlaingtharyar along the hlaing and panhlaing rivers but detailed information was not provided the ec level and cl concentration are the simplest indicators of seawater intrusion or salinization mercado 1985 according to alfarrah and walraevens 2018 groundwater samples exceeding the ec value of 1000 μs cm and cl concentration of 200 mg l were likely to be influenced by seawater intrusion the locations of potential seawater intrusion in the study area stations 5 6 11 12 14 15 and 16 are shown in fig 9 the majority of the land area in htantabin was covered by agricultural lands and irrigation canals were used to drain water from the river to the farms considering this situation the pattern of seawater intrusion was revealed based on the distance to the nearest sources river or irrigation canal according to the findings table 5 no statistically significant association was observed between seawater intrusion and the distance from the river or irrigation canal however locations with high salinity samples no 11 12 14 15 and 16 were found close to the irrigation canal within 100 m which could be the source of high salinity contamination the remaining locations with high salinity samples no 5 and 6 could be the consequence of leakage of industrial wastes to the ground as they were located close to the industrial area the correlation between the well depths and salinity was also studied fig 10 the well depths varied between 9 m and 60 m and no significant impact on the pattern of seawater intrusion was observed 4 conclusions the groundwater quality parameters in most of the stations exceeded the who guideline values for drinking and ec hco3 and cl were the most common unsuitable parameters the local population requires an improved source of drinking water because high salinity in groundwater makes it unsuitable for drinking although quality improvement was observed in the rainy season groundwater was not suitable for irrigation in many locations in the study area with high sodium concentration and salinity according to the salinity values ec and cl almost half of the examined locations suffered seawater intrusion to some extent areas within 100 m of the irrigation canal were more likely to be contaminated by seawater intrusion the concentration of contaminants in most of the stations was reduced during the rainy season a significant decline in the concentrations of tds ec sar and cl was found in some locations during the rainy season however the level of quality improvement differed among the stations the permeability of the soil was supposed to play a major role in the rainwater infiltration process which led to the variation in quality improvement two different prediction models cr and w0 for the corrosivity of piping material were applied in this study and their estimations supported each other in the summer but not in the rainy season the metal corrosion probability w0 increased during the rainy season with a decline in the ph value researchers should apply the risk prediction model for the corrosivity inclusive of ph as a factor considering
