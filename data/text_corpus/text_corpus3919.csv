19595,the general consensus is that the abundance of tap water bacteria is greatly influenced by water purification and distribution those bacteria that are released from biofilm in the distribution system are especially considered as the major potential risk for drinking water bio safety for the first time this full scale study has captured and identified the proportional contribution of the source water treated water and distribution system in shaping the tap water bacterial community based on their microbial community fingerprints using the bayesian sourcetracker method the bacterial community profiles and diversity analyses illustrated that the water purification process shaped the community of planktonic and suspended particle associated bacteria in treated water the bacterial communities associated with suspended particles loose deposits and biofilm were similar to each other while the community of tap water planktonic bacteria varied across different locations in distribution system the microbial source tracking results showed that there was not a detectable contribution of source water to bacterial community in the tap water and distribution system the planktonic bacteria in the treated water was the major contributor to planktonic bacteria in the tap water 17 7 54 1 the particle associated bacterial community in the treated water seeded the bacterial community associated with loose deposits 24 9 32 7 and biofilm 37 8 43 8 in the distribution system in return the loose deposits and biofilm showed a significant influence on tap water planktonic and particle associated bacteria which were location dependent and influenced by hydraulic changes this was revealed by the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water planktonic bacteria from 2 5 to 38 0 and an increased contribution of biofilm to tap water particle associated bacteria from 5 9 to 19 7 caused by possible hydraulic disturbance from proximal to distal regions therefore our findings indicate that the tap water bacteria could possibly be managed by selecting and operating the purification process properly and cleaning the distribution system effectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water distribution system microbial community fingerprints sourcetracker next generation sequencing source to tap 1 introduction the presence and growth of microbes in treated drinking water and at the customers taps is undesirable both for biosafety reasons wang et al 2013 and because of process related microbial problems during distribution berry et al 2006 such as nitrification zhang et al 2009 bio corrosion emde et al 1992 and persistence of pathogens emtiazi et al 2004 however the omnipresence of microbes in drinking water systems has been proven and acknowledged proctor and hammes 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 liu et al 2017b such as their presence and multiplication in tap water 103 106 cells ml 1 hammes et al 2010 liu et al 2013c

water and to develop efficient biological water quality management strategies it is critical to explore where these bacteria come from potentially tap water bacteria may come from source water eichler et al 2006 vaz moreira et al 2013 from treatment steps and treated water pinto et al 2012 and from the distribution network through biofilm detachment and or loose resuspension lautenschlager et al 2010 liu et al 2014 however the source of bacteria in tap water and the contribution of distribution system biofilm and loose deposits to tap water microbiological water quality still lacking systematic study the drinking water bacteria source apportionment can be done by microbial source tracking mst an approach that emerged at the end of the 20th century this tracking is based on the assumption that by using an appropriate method and appropriate indicator bacteria sources of the microorganisms can be found and characterized harwood et al 2014 however the use of these methods can be problematic especially when the markers are not entirely source specific and when multiple sources within a system have similar marker concentrations cao et al 2013 mccarthy et al 2017 the historical mst has been significantly advanced by the development and employment of high throughput sequencing hts technologies that make the characterization of entire microbial communities of environmental samples feasible and increasingly commonplace unno et al 2010 henry et al 2016 meanwhile computational tools have been developed that utilise hts data to track microbes according to source such as sourcetracker which applies a bayesian framework to estimate the proportion of each source contributing to a designated sink knights et al 2011 sourcetracker can estimate directly the source proportions and model the uncertainty about known and unknown source environments in aquatic systems it has been previously applied to identify water source contributions of microbial contamination faecal contamination in coastal waters recreational beaches urban estuaries lakes and rivers cao et al 2013 newton et al 2013 neave et al 2014 henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 in contrast to single marker mst methods the hts based mst method e g sourcetracker can characterize hundreds or even thousands of markers simultaneously unno et al 2010 lee et al 2011 therefore it may be used to identify any relevant source and it is particularly useful for the sources that currently do not have and may never have a source specific single marker gene knights et al 2011 cao et al 2013 recently the hts based sourcetracker has been evaluated and compared with a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model for identifying the primary sources of microorganisms mccarthy et al 2017 in aquatic environments mccarthy et al demonstrated that the hts based sourcetracker can identify the sources that contribute to the bacterial community in aquatic environments to understand the origin of the microorganisms and to protect environmental values and public health based on hts and sourcetracker the objective of this study is to track the source of microbial communities at consumers taps back to the water distribution and treatments to track the source of bacteria in tap water and bacteria in the loose deposits and biofilm that accumulated and developed in the distribution system this study characterized bacterial communities in bulk water pb and the bacteria associated with suspended particles pab from source to tap together with bacteria harboured in the loose deposits and biofilm in an operational distribution system for the first time the bacteria harboured in the loose deposits and biofilm in a distribution system has been incorporated into a drinking water microbial ecology study by tracking their origin from source water and purification processes upstream tracking and quantifying their proportional contribution to the bacteria detected in the tap water downstream tracking the results from this study will be valuable to water utilities in achieving a better understanding of the origin of bacteria in tap water and the development of biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system based on which treatments and management strategies can be developed guaranteeing the safeguard of public health and biological water quality at the drinking water taps 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water purification processes the study was conducted in one of the drinking water supply system of dunea the netherlands the source water after pre treatment is transported over 30 km to a dune area of natural lakes where it recharges the groundwater after an average residence time of two months the water is abstracted from the dunes this abstracted artificial recharge and recovery water is post treated by softening powdered activated carbon filtration aeration rapid sand filtration and slow sand filtration before being pumped into the distribution system chlorination and disinfectant residuals are avoided in the netherlands 2 2 sample collection as illustrated in fig 1 samples were taken after dune filtration sampling point sw after rapid sand filtration sampling point rsf after slow sand filtration before pumping into the distribution system sampling point ssf tw and from three locations in the distribution system sampling point dn1 dn2 and dn3 in the treatment plant both planktonic bacteria bulk water samples pb and suspended particle associated bacteria filtered particle samples by 1 2 μm whatman glass fiber filters pab were taken at sw rsw and ssf tw duplicate samples from the treatment plant were taken before and after the scheduled sampling events in the distribution system in the distribution system three locations were selected which were at proximal central and distal parts of the distribution system with a distance of 6 km dn1 13 km dn2 and 23 km dn3 respectively away from the treatment plant illustrated in fig 1 at each location an integral sampling was performed as described by liu et al 2014 briefly bulk water samples were collected after a flushing until the water temperature was constant at customers taps connected directly to the main supply pipe and close to the hydrants the loose deposits were collected at the fire hydrants by flushing the distribution pipe with a velocity of 1 5 m s vreeburg et al 2008 subsequently two sections of the flushed pipe pvc u d 110 mm length 30 cm were cut out to sample the biofilm in duplicate the pipe section was closed by pre disinfected caps and filled with 1 l dna free water to keep the inner surface wet during transportation the order of sampling began by obtaining the water samples then filtering suspended particles on site flushing the distribution pipe in the street for loose deposits sampling and finally cutting out parts of the distribution pipe all samples were kept at 0 c as soon as they were taken and subsequently transported at 0 c to the lab to detach bacteria from the associated surface of the suspended particles loose deposits and pipe the samples were pretreated by ultrasonification for three time periods of two minutes each at 42 khz magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the obtained suspensions were used for further microbiological analysis all samples were processed within 24 h after they were taken 2

phylogenetic tree built by a fasttree algorithm and used to conduct a principal coordinate analysis pcoa liu et al 2014 the dominant otus are defined as the otus with a defined cut off of relative abundance 0 5 within each phase pipe ling et al 2016 shared and the unique core otus in the source water treated water distribution system and tap water were shown by the venn diagram 2 5 mst by sourcetracker the otu tables derived from quality filtering and otu picking were used as input file for source tracking using sourcetracker as described by knights et al 2011 sourcetracker compares the community profiles in the source to those of the sink using bayesian methods to identify the extent of contribution of each source to the sink it was used to identify the percentage contribution of each potential source to the defined sinks as illustrated in fig 2 in the present study when identifying the sources of tap water bacteria defined as sinks the samples collected from the source water the purification steps and the distribution systems were all defined as potential sources independent contributors while for identifying the sources of biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system defined as sinks the samples collected from the source water and purification steps were considered as potential sources independent contributors sourcetracker analysis was performed using default settings with a rarefaction depth of 1000 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 and beta 0 01 dirichlet hyper parameter were applied the analysis was performed three times and the average was calculated as previously described henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 3 results bacterial community profiles were generated for the 25 collected samples 10 water samples 6 suspended solids samples 3 loose deposits samples and 6 biofilm samples in total 1 216 897 sequences were obtained which were assigned to 13 489 otus the rarefaction curves reached a plateau after 30 000

dominant otus associated with pab in the source water rsf water treated water and tap water respectively fig s3a between the community of pab in the source water and in the rsf water there were 9 shared otus 4 of which were assigned to the genus of crenothix that is related to methane and iron oxidation 3 otus were the same as in the pb community which were assigned to the family of

the otu level there were 32 dominant otus detected in the bacterial communities of loose deposits 15 32 and biofilm 22 32 5 of which were shared by the two niches denovo745756 and denovo1285130 not identified denovo1854419 assigned to genus hyphomicrobium denovo1382108 assigned to genus nitrospira related to nitrite oxidation denovo345586 assigned to genus pedomicrobium related to manganese oxidation comparing loose deposits and biofilm with the pab entering the distribution system there were 6 shared dominant otus between the loose deposits and pab in the treated water 6 15 and 3 shared otus between the biofilm and pab in the treated water 3 22 the number of shared otus increased to 9 between the loose deposits and pab in the tap water 9 15 and 5 between the biofilm and pab in the tap water 5 22 it was revealed that 11 out of 14 dominant otus in the tap water pab are shared with loose deposits and biofilm in the distribution system a full list of these shared otus ids and taxonomy information is given in fig s4 3 2 beta diversity comparing bacterial community similarity the beta diversity results are represented in a pcoa plot fig 5 the high similarity of replicate samples revealed the quality of the sampling conducted in this study and the reproducibility of subsequent 16s rrna gene sequencing and obtained results for the community of both pb and pab clear differences were observed for source water rsf water treated water and tap water the community of pb and pab were similar in the source water while the differences became greater when going further into the purification steps in the distribution system the community of suspended particle associated bacteria bacteria harboured in loose deposits and biofilm bacteria clustered closely together indicate their high similarity to each other they are also clustered closely together with the pab in treated water entering distribution system whereas the community of pb in the tap waters collected at three locations in the distribution system showed clear differences especially at dn3 the pb is more similar to the cluster of suspended solids loose deposits and biofilm than to the pb at dn1 and dn2 there were clear overlaps between the bacterial communities of suspended solids and loose deposits 3 3 source apportionment estimates using sourcetracker 3 3 1 source tracking of planktonic and particle associated bacteria in tap water as illustrated in fig 2 bacteria in the source water rsf water treated water biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system can be potential sources of tap water bacteria according to the source apportionments by the microbial community mst there was a variability in the source of pb and pab across the three selected locations in the distribution system table 1 for both pb and pab in the tap water there was no detectable contribution from source water for the pb in tap water the major contribution was from the pb in the treated water when going further into the distribution system the contribution of pb in the treated water decreased from 54 1 dn1 to 41 0 dn2 and further decreased to 11 7 at dn3 correspondingly the contributions of loose deposits ld increased from 2 5 at dn1 to 10 5 at dn2 and further increased to 38 at dn3 there was some minor contribution from pab treated water 2 2 9 9 pb in rsf water 0 8 6 6 and biofilm in the distribution system 0 5 2 6 the unknown contributions ranged from 32 9 to 39 7 by contrast the pab in tap water only originated from the pab in the treated water and distribution system of which the major contributions were from pab in treated water and loose deposits in distribution system when going further into the distribution system the contributions of pab in treated water decreased from 38 0 at dn1 to 26 1 at dn2 and further decreased to 6 4 at dn3 correspondingly the contributions of loose deposits in the distribution system increased from 34 2 at dn1 to 42 7 at dn2 and further increased to 45 2 at dn3 at dn3 the contributions of biofilm increased sharply from 0 5 and 5 9 19 7 the unknown contributions ranged from 21 3 to 29 8 3 3 2 source tracking of biofilm and loose deposits bacteria developed in the dwds the sourcetracker results showed that biofilm and loose deposits that developed in the distribution system have similar source contributions the major known contributions were from pb and pab in the treated water the contributions of pb ranged from 5 9 to 13 5 while the contributions of pab ranged from 23 0 to 43 8 on average the contributions of pab to biofilm 39 9 are higher than their contributions to loose deposits 26 6 there were minor contributions from the pab in rsf water which was less than 2 8 the unknown contributions ranged from 40 5 to 65 7 which was higher than the unknown proportion for pb and pab source tracking 4 discussion 4 1 source of planktonic and particle associated bacteria in tap water 4 1 1 effects of water purification the present study shows that the water purification processes have significant effects on the community of both planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab which is consistent with previous findings about the influences of water purification on the microbial community of treated water hijnen et al 2004 vaz moreira et al 2013 liao et al 2015 li et al 2017 ma et al 2017 comparing the two sand filtration processes slow sand filtration imposed a greater alteration in the bacterial community composition than rapid sand filtration which introduced different dominant otus in the treated water fig 4 figs s2 and s3 this may be because slow sand filters have higher removal efficiency of bacteria compared to rapid sand filtration and the higher biomass in its filter bed maybe detached and released into the effluent which can be attributed to its smaller interstices and lower filtration velocity huisman and wood 1974 bauer et al 2011 in a step beyond the reported studies this study quantified the proportional contribution of pb and pab in source water rsf water and treated water to tap water bacteria the results show that the biggest contributor to tap water bacteria is treated water 35 6 for pb and 23 5 for pab this observation was doubly confirmed by the community profiles that show a high proportion of shared dominant otus for pb 33 3 and pab 20 8 between treated water and tap water while there was no shared dominant otus either between source water and tap water nor between rsf water and tap water this finding suggests the importance of filtration process e g rsf and ssf on shaping the microbial community not only in treated water but also in tap water which agrees with the reported governing role of the filtration process in shaping the tap water bacterial community pinto et al 2012 besides sand filtration another recent study found changes of bacterial community structure after each drinking water treatment step of coagulation and flocculation sedimentation media filtration and disinfection ma et al 2017 it should be noted that although there was no detectable contribution from source water to tap water bacteria by sourcetracker some of the dominant otus in treated water 3 4 pb 3 14 pab and tap water 5 8 pb 3 13 pab were already present in the source water which had gone through treatment and remained stable during distribution the zero contribution of source water given in table 1 may indicate that the contribution was too low to be reliably detected e g 0 1 4 1 2 contributions of a distribution system it has been a wide consensus that most bacteria in a distribution system are harbored by biofilms 95 lechevallier et al 1987 flemming 2002 and loose deposits up to 98 liu et al 2014 the release of which can contribute greatly to the microbiological water quality deterioration at customers taps liu et al 2017b and change the water bacterial community liu et al 2017a however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the influence and contribution of loose deposits and biofilm on tap water bacteria has been captured and quantified at the proximal location dn1 the community of pb was highly similar to pb in treated water which was hardly influenced by loose deposits 2 5 and biofilm 1 7 during transit to the central location dn2 the contribution of bacteria from loose deposits increased to 10 5 but the contribution of biofilm was still limited this may due to the better mobility of loose deposits compared to biofilm makes it easier for the loose deposits to be resuspended and release the associated bacteria into water gauthier et al 1999 lehtola et al 2004 liu et al 2014 pinto et al 2014 it is likely that detachment of microbial cells from biofilms into the bulk water required greater turbulence due to inherit structural integrity of biofilms flemming and wingender 2010 fish et al 2016 therefore the contributions of biofilm to pb in tap water were relative low at all locations 0 5 2 6 this study demonstrated that with increasing distance in a distribution system the contributions of both pb and pab in treated water decreased considerably by 31 6 and 42 4 at dn3 indicating a weaker contribution of treated water to tap water bacteria in the distal distribution regions this is because bacterial community in the tap water in distal regions may also be strongly influenced by the loose deposits re suspension and or biofilm detachment during distribution which is indicated by the corresponding increase of the contribution of loose deposits 35 5 pb and biofilm 13 8 pab while approaching the distal location at dn3 the further increase in the contribution of loose deposits indicates either a positive correlation of distance travel time water age and loose deposits contribution or that a bigger hydraulic disturbance occurred at dn3 the sharp increase in the biofilm s contribution by 19 7 to tap water pab suggested the occurrence of biofilm detachment which suggests that the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water pb is caused by a bigger hydraulic disturbance rather than only the distance travelled this captured hydraulic disturbance was still a regular operational event most likely morning peak however the detached biofilm with 19 7 contribution to tap water pab was reflected by only slightly increase of biofilm s contribution to tap water pb which was not significant this is likely because that pab accounted for less than 2 of the total bacteria in drinking water liu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the differences observed in the biofilm s contribution to pb and pab indicates that monitoring the pab will be a good approach to study biofilm detachment even before they significantly influence the water bacteria liu et al 2017b this will be especially useful as an early warning methodology when biofilm based opportunistic pathogens pose potential risks such as the releasing of legionella from biofilm during the switching of the supply water schwake et al 2016 in the distribution system with chlorination the situation may be significantly different due to the presence of disinfectant residuals although there is no quantifiable bacteria source tracking study can be compared to the present study the contribution of pab in treated water and the bacteria associated with biofilm and the loose deposits will be higher than un chlorinated system because of the their protection effects against disinfectant residuals liu et al 2013a 4 2 source tracking of loose deposits and biofilm in a distribution system the bacterial communities of pab biofilm and loose deposits were highly similar across the proximal central and distal locations which concurs with previous findings in both a pilot distribution system martiny et al 2003 and an operational full scale distribution system liu et al 2014 both of which contained no disinfectants regardless of the locations the bacterial community of pab loose deposits and biofilm were similar with each other we have discussed in previous study that it might be the process that the suspended particles is originated from biofilm detachment and become loose deposits after settled in distribution pipes liu et al 2014 in this study the high similarity between the pab in distribution system and in treated water revealed that the pab in distribution system are likely originated from treated water rather than biofilm detachment which has also been confirmed by the sourcetracker analysis results as discussed above moreover it suggests that pab in the treated water might have seeded the loose deposits and biofilm developed in the distribution system as revealed and proven by sourcetracker for both loose deposits and biofilm the major source was the pab in the treated water 23 0 43 8 for biofilm it can be explained by the common characteristics of bacteria attaching to the surface of suspended particles pab in treated water and taking advantage of their capability to attach to the pipe surface and form biofilm liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017a the formation of loose deposits may have been started from sedimentation of suspended particles in treated water gauthier et al 2001 vreeburg and boxall 2007 vreeburg et al 2008 liu et al 2014 which was confirmed by the decreased contribution of pab in treated water to the tap water pab from proximal to distal locations in the present study the pb contributed around 10 to the bacteria in the loose deposits and biofilm this contribution from pb may be caused by selection of seed bacteria from bulk water that attach and multiply on the surfaces offered by pipe wall and loose deposits henne et al 2012 fish et al 2016 alternatively it may be caused by the capture of planktonic bacteria on the surfaces of suspended particles and then subsequent trapping into the biofilm matrix on the pipe surface during hydraulic peaks or settling of bio aggregates settled in the pipe as loose deposits during stagnant periods liu et al 2016 4 3 practical implications for tap water bacteria management 4 3 1 managing tap water bacteria through purification to sum up from the integral perspective of source to taps our study showed that source water has no detectable contribution neither to tap water bacteria nor to the distribution system s harboured bacteria in loose deposits and biofilm on the other hand the pb and pab in the treated water contributed 28 7 56 3 to tap water bacteria 34 3 38 6 to loose deposits and 46 8 54 0 to biofilm in return as the indirect contribution from treated water the bacteria in loose deposits and biofilm that originated from treated water also contributed to tap water bacteria e g partial contribution from the 48 5 at dn3 in other words the treated water seeded a large proportion of bacteria developed in the distribution system and were present in the tap water therefore the tap water bacteria could be managed through proper water purification previously researchers proposed that as a quantitative managing strategy removing nutrients during purification can limit the bacterial regrowth during distribution both for planktonic bacteria and biofilm formation van der kooij 2000 liu et al 2013b and that removing particles will limit the formation of loose deposits vreeburg et al 2008 liu et al 2013b beyond the quantity the purification process is also shaping the community of tap water bacteria through changing the bacterial community of pb and pab in the treated water seed bacteria potentially pinto et al 2012 have proposed that it could be possible to populate the bacterial community in treated water with desired innocuous bacteria by altering water quality and process operation parameters at the drinking water treatment plant according to the ecological niche theory the drinking water supply system could thus be pre colonized via selection from source water or inoculated with microbial community which represents a desirable microbial consortia that can effectively compete in the niches of undesirable micro organisms associated with nitrification bio corrosion and or opportunistic pathogens and can inhibit the growth of those undesirable micro organisms so as to take and defend their own ecological niches wang et al 2013 4 3 2 monitoring and managing tap water bacteria during distribution the variations across three locations dn1 2 3 showed that the specific contribution of the distribution system loose deposits and biofilm to tap water bacteria is highly location and hydraulics dependent at dn3 the distribution system s contribution 40 6 to tap water pb and 64 9 to tap water pab led to significant changes in the bacterial community of tap water fig 5 pcoa which concurred with a previous hypothetical evaluation that the release of 20 loose deposits or biofilm will change water bacterial community significantly liu et al 2017a flushing the distribution system has proven to be an efficient strategy that improved drinking water quality lehtola et al 2004 and the routine cleaning of the distribution system has been widely employed by water utilities as a strategy to manage tap water quality kjellberg et al 2009 the main challenge of distribution system cleaning is deciding whether when where and how to clean the distribution network as such the resuspension potential method rpm has been developed and is widely used in the netherlands as a way of estimating the rate of sediment accumulation determining the necessary cleaning frequency and monitoring the effectiveness of distribution pipe cleaning which measures the turbidity response to an induced hydraulic turbulence vreeburg and boxall 2007 however the method is mainly based on the particle load consideration and turbidity measurements the release of bacteria from loose deposits and biofilm into the bulk water and the associated influence on the quantity and community of tap water bacteria might be undetectable because of the dilution effects in the water column we demonstrated that an integral sampling of pb pab loose deposits and biofilm in the distribution system makes it possible to observe and quantify the water quality deterioration potential and the changes of contribution from loose deposits and biofilm to tap water bacteria liu et al 2017a based on regular monitoring results once the contribution of biofilm and loose deposits to tap water bacteria exceed pre set quantitative e g cell number and qualitative e g bacterial community threshold the decision for pipe cleaning can be made at an early stage before the distribution system harbored material can lead to water quality deterioration problems 4 4 unknown sources and outlook it was noted that a considerable portion of contributions to tap water bacteria remain unknown firstly this is because there were other potential sources not included in the sampling program for this study which may harbor different bacteria and make considerable contributions for example the filter material used for water purification pinto et al 2012 the distribution pipes of other materials broo et al 2001 wang et al 2014 ji et al 2015 rożej et al 2015 and the household pipes liu et al 2017a and premise plumbing system proctor and hammes 2015 zlatanović van der hoek et al 2017 it is highly recommended that a complete sampling and evaluation of the contributions of each component in the drinking water system from source to tap be conducted especially including the potential influences of the premise plumbing system the knowledge gained will be essential for distributing available labor and financial resources for the most efficient bio safety and bio quality management secondly the present study is only a snapshot sampling that does not include temporal variations and seasonal dynamics yet both of which have significant contributions to particle load and the bacterial community in tap water matsui et al 2007 pinto et al 2014 if the pb and pab at the customer s tap can be continuously monitored online the changes and dynamics of tap water bacteria and the regular ranges of loose deposits and biofilm contributions in the distribution system can be investigated and quantified a long term microbial observation that collects high resolutions uses multiple locations and yearly data sets from source to tap will enable a better assessment of the origin and development of tap water bacteria moreover the sourcetracker method has the potential to be used to identify the sources of bio contamination such as waste water ingress surrounding soil contamination during repairing events and to quantify the bacteria being released during the loose deposits and biofilm destabilization during the operational parameters or when the water quality changes 5 conclusion the water purification process shaped the community of pb and pab in treated water the tap water bacterial community is location and hydraulics dependent which varies across different locations there was no detectable contribution from the source water to the bacteria developed in the loose deposits and biofilm in the distribution system and the bacteria present in the tap water the pb in the treated water is the major contributor to the pb in tap water 17 7 54 1 and the pab in the treated water seeded the bacteria associated with loose deposits 24 9 32 7 and biofilm 37 8 43 8 in the distribution system the loose deposits and biofilm showed significant influence on tap water pb and pab revealed by the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water pb from 2 5 to 38 0 and the increased contribution of biofilm to tap water pab from 5 9 to 19 7 caused by disturbance the tap water bacteria could possibly be managed by selecting and operating proper purification processes and regularly cleaning the distribution system acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the support from the national

19595,the general consensus is that the abundance of tap water bacteria is greatly influenced by water purification and distribution those bacteria that are released from biofilm in the distribution system are especially considered as the major potential risk for drinking water bio safety for the first time this full scale study has captured and identified the proportional contribution of the source water treated water and distribution system in shaping the tap water bacterial community based on their microbial community fingerprints using the bayesian sourcetracker method the bacterial community profiles and diversity analyses illustrated that the water purification process shaped the community of planktonic and suspended particle associated bacteria in treated water the bacterial communities associated with suspended particles loose deposits and biofilm were similar to each other while the community of tap water planktonic bacteria varied across different locations in distribution system the microbial source tracking results showed that there was not a detectable contribution of source water to bacterial community in the tap water and distribution system the planktonic bacteria in the treated water was the major contributor to planktonic bacteria in the tap water 17 7 54 1 the particle associated bacterial community in the treated water seeded the bacterial community associated with loose deposits 24 9 32 7 and biofilm 37 8 43 8 in the distribution system in return the loose deposits and biofilm showed a significant influence on tap water planktonic and particle associated bacteria which were location dependent and influenced by hydraulic changes this was revealed by the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water planktonic bacteria from 2 5 to 38 0 and an increased contribution of biofilm to tap water particle associated bacteria from 5 9 to 19 7 caused by possible hydraulic disturbance from proximal to distal regions therefore our findings indicate that the tap water bacteria could possibly be managed by selecting and operating the purification process properly and cleaning the distribution system effectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water distribution system microbial community fingerprints sourcetracker next generation sequencing source to tap 1 introduction the presence and growth of microbes in treated drinking water and at the customers taps is undesirable both for biosafety reasons wang et al 2013 and because of process related microbial problems during distribution berry et al 2006 such as nitrification zhang et al 2009 bio corrosion emde et al 1992 and persistence of pathogens emtiazi et al 2004 however the omnipresence of microbes in drinking water systems has been proven and acknowledged proctor and hammes 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 liu et al 2017b such as their presence and multiplication in tap water 103 106 cells ml 1 hammes et al 2010 liu et al 2013c prest et al 2014 and in distribution systems biofilm 106 108 cfu cm 2 loose deposits 108 cfu g 1 liu et al 2013d prest et al 2016 to help address public health concerns associated with bacteria in tap water and to develop efficient biological water quality management strategies it is critical to explore where these bacteria come from potentially tap water bacteria may come from source water eichler et al 2006 vaz moreira et al 2013 from treatment steps and treated water pinto et al 2012 and from the distribution network through biofilm detachment and or loose resuspension lautenschlager et al 2010 liu et al 2014 however the source of bacteria in tap water and the contribution of distribution system biofilm and loose deposits to tap water microbiological water quality still lacking systematic study the drinking water bacteria source apportionment can be done by microbial source tracking mst an approach that emerged at the end of the 20th century this tracking is based on the assumption that by using an appropriate method and appropriate indicator bacteria sources of the microorganisms can be found and characterized harwood et al 2014 however the use of these methods can be problematic especially when the markers are not entirely source specific and when multiple sources within a system have similar marker concentrations cao et al 2013 mccarthy et al 2017 the historical mst has been significantly advanced by the development and employment of high throughput sequencing hts technologies that make the characterization of entire microbial communities of environmental samples feasible and increasingly commonplace unno et al 2010 henry et al 2016 meanwhile computational tools have been developed that utilise hts data to track microbes according to source such as sourcetracker which applies a bayesian framework to estimate the proportion of each source contributing to a designated sink knights et al 2011 sourcetracker can estimate directly the source proportions and model the uncertainty about known and unknown source environments in aquatic systems it has been previously applied to identify water source contributions of microbial contamination faecal contamination in coastal waters recreational beaches urban estuaries lakes and rivers cao et al 2013 newton et al 2013 neave et al 2014 henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 in contrast to single marker mst methods the hts based mst method e g sourcetracker can characterize hundreds or even thousands of markers simultaneously unno et al 2010 lee et al 2011 therefore it may be used to identify any relevant source and it is particularly useful for the sources that currently do not have and may never have a source specific single marker gene knights et al 2011 cao et al 2013 recently the hts based sourcetracker has been evaluated and compared with a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic model for identifying the primary sources of microorganisms mccarthy et al 2017 in aquatic environments mccarthy et al demonstrated that the hts based sourcetracker can identify the sources that contribute to the bacterial community in aquatic environments to understand the origin of the microorganisms and to protect environmental values and public health based on hts and sourcetracker the objective of this study is to track the source of microbial communities at consumers taps back to the water distribution and treatments to track the source of bacteria in tap water and bacteria in the loose deposits and biofilm that accumulated and developed in the distribution system this study characterized bacterial communities in bulk water pb and the bacteria associated with suspended particles pab from source to tap together with bacteria harboured in the loose deposits and biofilm in an operational distribution system for the first time the bacteria harboured in the loose deposits and biofilm in a distribution system has been incorporated into a drinking water microbial ecology study by tracking their origin from source water and purification processes upstream tracking and quantifying their proportional contribution to the bacteria detected in the tap water downstream tracking the results from this study will be valuable to water utilities in achieving a better understanding of the origin of bacteria in tap water and the development of biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system based on which treatments and management strategies can be developed guaranteeing the safeguard of public health and biological water quality at the drinking water taps 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water purification processes the study was conducted in one of the drinking water supply system of dunea the netherlands the source water after pre treatment is transported over 30 km to a dune area of natural lakes where it recharges the groundwater after an average residence time of two months the water is abstracted from the dunes this abstracted artificial recharge and recovery water is post treated by softening powdered activated carbon filtration aeration rapid sand filtration and slow sand filtration before being pumped into the distribution system chlorination and disinfectant residuals are avoided in the netherlands 2 2 sample collection as illustrated in fig 1 samples were taken after dune filtration sampling point sw after rapid sand filtration sampling point rsf after slow sand filtration before pumping into the distribution system sampling point ssf tw and from three locations in the distribution system sampling point dn1 dn2 and dn3 in the treatment plant both planktonic bacteria bulk water samples pb and suspended particle associated bacteria filtered particle samples by 1 2 μm whatman glass fiber filters pab were taken at sw rsw and ssf tw duplicate samples from the treatment plant were taken before and after the scheduled sampling events in the distribution system in the distribution system three locations were selected which were at proximal central and distal parts of the distribution system with a distance of 6 km dn1 13 km dn2 and 23 km dn3 respectively away from the treatment plant illustrated in fig 1 at each location an integral sampling was performed as described by liu et al 2014 briefly bulk water samples were collected after a flushing until the water temperature was constant at customers taps connected directly to the main supply pipe and close to the hydrants the loose deposits were collected at the fire hydrants by flushing the distribution pipe with a velocity of 1 5 m s vreeburg et al 2008 subsequently two sections of the flushed pipe pvc u d 110 mm length 30 cm were cut out to sample the biofilm in duplicate the pipe section was closed by pre disinfected caps and filled with 1 l dna free water to keep the inner surface wet during transportation the order of sampling began by obtaining the water samples then filtering suspended particles on site flushing the distribution pipe in the street for loose deposits sampling and finally cutting out parts of the distribution pipe all samples were kept at 0 c as soon as they were taken and subsequently transported at 0 c to the lab to detach bacteria from the associated surface of the suspended particles loose deposits and pipe the samples were pretreated by ultrasonification for three time periods of two minutes each at 42 khz magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the obtained suspensions were used for further microbiological analysis all samples were processed within 24 h after they were taken 2

abundance 0 5 within each phase pipe ling et al 2016 shared and the unique core otus in the source water treated water distribution system and tap water were shown by the venn diagram 2 5 mst by sourcetracker the otu tables derived from quality filtering and otu picking were used as input file for source tracking using sourcetracker as described by knights et al 2011 sourcetracker compares the community profiles in the source to those of the sink using bayesian methods to identify the extent of contribution of each source to the sink it was used to identify the percentage contribution of each potential source to the defined sinks as illustrated in fig 2 in the present study when identifying the sources of tap water bacteria defined as sinks the samples collected from the source water the purification steps and the distribution systems were all defined as potential sources independent contributors while for identifying the sources of biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system defined as sinks the samples collected from the source water and purification steps were considered as potential sources independent contributors sourcetracker analysis was performed using default settings with a rarefaction depth of 1000 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 and beta 0 01 dirichlet hyper parameter were applied the analysis was performed three times and the average was calculated as previously described henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 3 results bacterial community profiles were generated for the 25 collected samples 10 water samples 6 suspended

tap water 5 22 it was revealed that 11 out of 14 dominant otus in the tap water pab are shared with loose deposits and biofilm in the distribution system a full list of these shared otus ids and taxonomy information is given in fig s4 3 2 beta diversity comparing bacterial community similarity the beta diversity results are represented in a pcoa plot fig 5 the high similarity of replicate samples revealed the quality of the sampling conducted in this study and the reproducibility of subsequent 16s rrna gene sequencing and obtained results for the community of both pb and pab clear differences were observed for source water rsf water treated water and tap water the community of pb and pab were similar in the source water while the differences became greater when going further into the purification steps in the distribution system the community of suspended particle associated bacteria bacteria harboured in loose deposits and biofilm bacteria clustered closely together indicate their high similarity to each other they are also clustered closely together with the pab in treated water entering distribution system whereas the community of pb in the tap waters collected at three locations in the distribution system showed clear differences especially at dn3 the pb is more similar to the cluster of suspended solids loose deposits and biofilm than to the pb at dn1 and dn2 there were clear overlaps between the bacterial communities of suspended solids and loose deposits 3 3 source apportionment estimates using sourcetracker 3 3 1 source tracking of planktonic and particle associated bacteria in tap water as illustrated in fig 2 bacteria in the source water rsf water treated water biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system can be potential sources of tap water bacteria according to the source apportionments by the microbial community mst there was a variability in the source of pb and pab across the three selected locations in the distribution system table 1 for both pb and pab in the tap water there was no detectable contribution from source water for the pb in tap water the major contribution was from the pb in the treated water when going further into the distribution system the contribution of pb in the treated water decreased from 54 1 dn1 to 41 0 dn2 and further decreased to 11 7 at dn3 correspondingly the contributions of loose deposits ld increased from 2 5 at dn1 to 10 5 at dn2 and further increased to 38 at dn3 there was some minor contribution from pab treated water 2 2 9 9 pb in rsf water 0 8 6 6 and biofilm in the distribution system 0 5 2 6 the unknown contributions ranged from 32 9 to 39 7 by contrast the pab in tap water only originated from the pab in the treated water and distribution system of which the major contributions were from pab in treated water and loose deposits in distribution system when going further into the distribution system the contributions of pab in treated water decreased from 38 0 at dn1 to 26 1 at dn2 and further decreased to 6 4 at dn3 correspondingly the contributions of loose deposits in the distribution system increased from 34 2 at dn1 to 42 7 at dn2 and further increased to 45 2 at dn3 at dn3 the contributions of biofilm increased sharply from 0 5 and 5 9 19 7 the unknown contributions ranged from 21 3 to 29 8 3 3 2 source tracking of biofilm and loose deposits bacteria developed in the dwds the sourcetracker results showed that biofilm and loose deposits that developed in the distribution system have similar source contributions the major known contributions were from pb and pab in the treated water the contributions of pb ranged from 5 9 to 13 5 while the contributions of pab ranged from 23 0 to 43 8 on average the contributions of pab to biofilm 39 9 are higher than their contributions to loose deposits 26 6 there were minor contributions from the pab in rsf water which was less than 2 8 the unknown contributions ranged from 40 5 to 65 7 which was higher than the unknown proportion for pb and pab source tracking 4 discussion 4 1 source of planktonic and particle associated bacteria in tap water 4 1 1 effects of water purification the present study shows that the water purification processes have significant effects on the community of both planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab which is consistent with previous findings about the influences of water purification on the microbial community of treated water hijnen et al 2004 vaz moreira et al 2013 liao et al 2015 li et al 2017 ma et al 2017 comparing the two sand filtration processes slow sand filtration imposed a greater alteration in the bacterial community composition than rapid sand filtration which introduced different dominant otus in the treated water fig 4 figs s2 and s3 this may be because slow sand filters have higher removal efficiency of bacteria compared to rapid sand filtration and the higher biomass in its filter bed maybe detached and released into the effluent which can be attributed to its smaller interstices and lower filtration velocity huisman and wood 1974 bauer et al 2011 in a step beyond the reported studies this study quantified the proportional contribution of pb and pab in source water rsf water and treated water to tap water bacteria the results show that the biggest contributor to tap water bacteria is treated water 35 6 for pb and 23 5 for pab this observation was doubly confirmed by the community profiles that show a high proportion of shared dominant otus for pb 33 3 and pab 20 8 between treated water and tap water while there was no shared dominant otus either between source water and tap water nor between rsf water and tap water this finding suggests the importance of filtration process e g rsf and ssf on shaping the microbial community not only in treated water but also in tap water which agrees with the reported governing role of the filtration process in shaping the tap water bacterial community pinto et al 2012 besides sand filtration another recent study found changes of bacterial community structure after each drinking water treatment step of coagulation and flocculation sedimentation media filtration and disinfection ma et al 2017 it should be noted that although there was no detectable contribution from source water to tap water bacteria by sourcetracker some of the dominant otus in treated water 3 4 pb 3 14 pab and tap water 5 8 pb 3 13 pab were already present in the source water which had gone through treatment and remained stable during distribution the zero contribution of source water given in table 1 may indicate that the contribution was too low to be reliably detected e g 0 1 4 1 2 contributions of a distribution system it has been a wide consensus that most bacteria in a distribution system are harbored by biofilms 95 lechevallier et al 1987 flemming 2002 and loose deposits up to 98 liu et al 2014 the release of which can contribute greatly to the microbiological water quality deterioration at customers taps liu et al 2017b and change the water bacterial community liu et al 2017a however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the influence and contribution of loose deposits and biofilm on tap water bacteria has been captured and quantified at the proximal location dn1 the community of pb was highly similar to pb in treated water which was hardly influenced by loose deposits 2 5 and biofilm 1 7 during transit to the central location dn2 the contribution of bacteria from loose deposits increased to 10 5 but the contribution of biofilm was still limited this may due to the better mobility of loose deposits compared to biofilm makes it easier for the loose deposits to be resuspended and release the associated bacteria into water gauthier et al 1999 lehtola et al 2004 liu et al 2014 pinto et al 2014 it is likely that detachment of microbial cells from biofilms into the bulk water required greater turbulence due to inherit structural integrity of biofilms flemming and wingender 2010 fish et al 2016 therefore the contributions of biofilm to pb in tap water were relative low at all locations 0 5 2 6 this study demonstrated that with increasing distance in a distribution system the contributions of both pb and pab in treated water decreased considerably by 31 6 and 42 4 at dn3 indicating a weaker contribution of treated water to tap water bacteria in the distal distribution regions this is because bacterial community in the tap water in distal regions may also be strongly influenced by the loose deposits re suspension and or biofilm detachment during distribution which is indicated by the corresponding increase of the contribution of loose deposits 35 5 pb and biofilm 13 8 pab while approaching the distal location at dn3 the further increase in the contribution of loose deposits indicates either a positive correlation of distance travel time water age and loose deposits contribution or that a bigger hydraulic disturbance occurred at dn3 the sharp increase in the biofilm s contribution by 19 7 to tap water pab suggested the occurrence of biofilm detachment which suggests that the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water pb is caused by a bigger hydraulic disturbance rather than only the distance travelled this captured hydraulic disturbance was still a regular operational event most likely morning peak however the detached biofilm with 19 7 contribution to tap water pab was reflected by only slightly increase of biofilm s contribution to tap water pb which was not significant this is likely because that pab accounted for less than 2 of the total bacteria in drinking water liu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the differences observed in the biofilm s contribution to pb and pab indicates that monitoring the pab will be a good approach to study biofilm detachment even before they significantly influence the water bacteria liu et al 2017b this will be especially useful as an early warning methodology when biofilm based opportunistic pathogens pose potential risks such as the releasing of legionella from biofilm during the switching of the supply water schwake et al 2016 in the distribution system with chlorination the situation may be significantly different due to the presence of disinfectant residuals although there is no quantifiable bacteria source tracking study can be compared to the present study the contribution of pab in treated water and the bacteria associated with biofilm and the loose deposits will be higher than un chlorinated system because of the their protection effects against disinfectant residuals liu et al 2013a 4 2 source tracking of loose deposits and biofilm in a distribution system the bacterial communities of pab biofilm and loose deposits were highly similar across the proximal central and distal locations which concurs with previous findings in both a pilot distribution system martiny et al 2003 and an operational full scale distribution system liu et al 2014 both of which contained no disinfectants regardless of the locations the bacterial community of pab loose deposits and biofilm were similar with each other we have discussed in previous study that it might be the process that the suspended particles is originated from biofilm detachment and become loose deposits after settled in distribution pipes liu et al 2014 in this study the high similarity between the pab in distribution system and in treated water revealed that the pab in distribution system are likely originated from treated water rather than biofilm detachment which has also been confirmed by the sourcetracker analysis results as discussed above moreover it suggests that pab in the treated water might have seeded the loose deposits and biofilm developed in the distribution system as revealed and proven by sourcetracker for both loose deposits and biofilm the major source was the pab in the treated water 23 0 43 8 for biofilm it can be explained by the common characteristics of bacteria attaching to the surface of suspended particles pab in treated water and taking advantage of their capability to attach to the pipe surface and form biofilm liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017a the formation of loose deposits may have been started from sedimentation of suspended particles in treated water gauthier et al 2001 vreeburg and boxall 2007 vreeburg et al 2008 liu et al 2014 which was confirmed by the decreased contribution of pab in treated water to the tap water pab from proximal to distal locations in the present study the pb contributed around 10 to the bacteria in the loose deposits and biofilm this contribution from pb may be caused by selection of seed bacteria from bulk water that attach and multiply on the surfaces offered by pipe wall and loose deposits henne et al 2012 fish et al 2016 alternatively it may be caused by the capture of planktonic bacteria on the surfaces of suspended particles and then subsequent trapping into the biofilm matrix on the pipe surface during hydraulic peaks or settling of bio aggregates settled in the pipe as loose deposits during stagnant periods liu et al 2016 4 3 practical implications for tap water bacteria management 4 3 1 managing tap water bacteria through purification to sum up from the integral perspective of source to taps our study showed that source water has no detectable contribution neither to tap water bacteria nor to the distribution system s harboured bacteria in loose deposits and biofilm on the other hand the pb and pab in the treated water contributed 28 7 56 3 to tap water bacteria 34 3 38 6 to loose deposits and 46 8 54 0 to biofilm in return as the indirect contribution from treated water the bacteria in loose deposits and biofilm that originated from treated water also contributed to tap water bacteria e g partial contribution from the 48 5 at dn3 in other words the treated water seeded a large proportion of bacteria developed in the distribution system and were present in the tap water therefore the tap water bacteria could be managed through proper water purification previously researchers proposed that as a quantitative managing strategy removing nutrients during purification can limit the bacterial regrowth during distribution both for planktonic bacteria and biofilm formation van der kooij 2000 liu et al 2013b and that removing particles will limit the formation of loose deposits vreeburg et al 2008 liu et al 2013b beyond the quantity the purification process is also shaping the community of tap water bacteria through changing the bacterial community of pb and pab in the treated water seed bacteria potentially pinto et al 2012 have proposed that it could be possible to populate the bacterial community in treated water with desired innocuous bacteria by altering water quality and process operation parameters at the drinking water treatment plant according to the ecological niche theory the drinking water supply system could thus be pre colonized via selection from source water or inoculated with microbial community which represents a desirable microbial consortia that can effectively compete in the niches of undesirable micro organisms associated with nitrification bio corrosion and or opportunistic pathogens and can inhibit the growth of those undesirable micro organisms so as to take and defend their own ecological niches wang et al 2013 4 3 2 monitoring and managing tap water bacteria during distribution the variations across three locations dn1 2 3 showed that the specific contribution of the distribution system loose deposits and biofilm to tap water bacteria is highly location and hydraulics dependent at dn3 the distribution system s contribution 40 6 to tap water pb and 64 9 to tap water pab led to significant changes in the bacterial community of tap water fig 5 pcoa which concurred with a previous hypothetical evaluation that the release of 20 loose deposits or biofilm will change water bacterial community significantly liu et al 2017a flushing the distribution system has proven to be an efficient strategy that improved drinking water quality lehtola et al 2004 and the routine cleaning of the distribution system has been widely employed by water utilities as a strategy to manage tap water quality kjellberg et al 2009 the main challenge of distribution system cleaning is deciding whether when where and how to clean the distribution network as such the resuspension potential method rpm has been developed and is widely used in the netherlands as a way of estimating the rate of sediment accumulation determining the necessary cleaning frequency and monitoring the effectiveness of distribution pipe cleaning which measures the turbidity response to an induced hydraulic turbulence vreeburg and boxall 2007 however the method is mainly based on the particle load consideration and turbidity measurements the release of bacteria from loose deposits and biofilm into the bulk water and the associated influence on the quantity and community of tap water bacteria might be undetectable because of the dilution effects in the water column we demonstrated that an integral sampling of pb pab loose deposits and biofilm in the distribution system makes it possible to observe and quantify the water quality deterioration potential and the changes of contribution from loose deposits and biofilm to tap water bacteria liu et al 2017a based on regular monitoring results once the contribution of biofilm and loose deposits to tap water bacteria exceed pre set quantitative e g cell number and qualitative e g bacterial community threshold the decision for pipe cleaning can be made at an early stage before the distribution system harbored material can lead to water quality deterioration problems 4 4 unknown sources and outlook it was noted that a considerable portion of contributions to tap water bacteria remain unknown firstly this is because there were other potential sources not included in the sampling program for this study which may harbor different bacteria and make considerable contributions for example the filter material used for water purification pinto et al 2012 the distribution pipes of other materials broo et al 2001 wang et al 2014 ji et al 2015 rożej et al 2015 and the household pipes liu et al 2017a and premise plumbing system proctor and hammes 2015 zlatanović van der hoek et al 2017 it is highly recommended that a complete sampling and evaluation of the contributions of each component in the drinking water system from source to tap be conducted especially including the potential influences of the premise plumbing system the knowledge gained will be essential for distributing available labor and financial resources for the most efficient bio safety and bio quality management secondly the present study is only a snapshot sampling that does not include temporal variations and seasonal dynamics yet both of which have significant contributions to particle load and the bacterial community in tap water matsui et al 2007 pinto et al 2014 if the pb and pab at the customer s tap can be continuously monitored online the changes and dynamics of tap water bacteria and the regular ranges of loose deposits and biofilm contributions in the distribution system can be investigated and quantified a long term microbial observation that collects high resolutions uses multiple locations and yearly data sets from source to tap will enable a better assessment of the origin and development of tap water bacteria moreover the sourcetracker method has the potential to be used to identify the sources of bio contamination such as waste water ingress surrounding soil contamination during repairing events and to quantify the bacteria being released during the loose deposits and biofilm destabilization during the operational parameters or when the water quality changes 5 conclusion the water purification process shaped the community of pb and pab in treated water the tap water bacterial community is location and hydraulics dependent which varies across different locations there was no detectable contribution from the source water to the bacteria developed in the loose deposits and biofilm in the distribution system and the bacteria present in the tap water the pb in the treated water is the major contributor to the pb in tap water 17 7 54 1 and the pab in the treated water seeded the bacteria associated with loose deposits 24 9 32 7 and biofilm 37 8 43 8 in the distribution system the loose deposits and biofilm showed significant influence on tap water pb and pab revealed by the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water pb from 2 5 to 38 0 and the increased contribution of biofilm to tap water pab from 5 9 to 19 7 caused by disturbance the tap water bacteria could possibly be managed by selecting and operating proper purification processes and regularly cleaning the distribution system acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the support from the national

19596,individual treatment processes like biological treatment or ozonation have their limitations for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents with high organic matter concentrations i e 17 mg toc l these limitations can be overcome by combining these two processes for a cost effective pharmaceutical removal a three step biological ozone biological bo3b treatment process was therefore designed for the enhanced pharmaceutical removal from wastewater effluent the first biological step removed 38 of ozone scavenging toc thus proportionally reducing the absolute ozone input for the subsequent ozonation complementariness between biological and ozone treatment i e targeting different pharmaceuticals resulted in cost effective pharmaceutical removal by the overall bo3b process at a low ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h in the biological reactors the removal of 8 out of 9 pharmaceuticals exceeded 85 except for metoprolol 60 testing various ozone doses and hrts revealed that pharmaceuticals were ineffectively removed at 0 1 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 0 3 h at hrts of 0 47 and 1 46 h easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were over 95 removed by biological treatment the biorecalcitrant carbamazepine was completely ozonated at a dose of 0 4 g o3 g toc ozonation products are likely biodegraded in the last biological reactor as a 17 toc removal was found no appreciable acute toxicity towards d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual bo3b reactors the bo3b process is estimated to increase the yearly wastewater treatment tariff per population equivalent in the netherlands by less than 10 overall the bo3b process is a cost effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation ozonation combined treatment pharmaceuticals wastewater toxicity 1 introduction human consumption of pharmaceuticals has increased in the past years and is expected to rise even more due to the growing world population and increased average age van der aa et al 2011 after administration pharmaceuticals are excreted and disposed into the sewer fent et al 2006 this results in elevated pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater as is illustrated by measurements of numerous studies over the past decades mompelat et al 2009 sacher et al 2008 many pharmaceuticals are persistent in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps rivera utrilla et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 pharmaceutical levels in wwtp effluents jeopardize the aquatic environment escher et al 2011 fent et al 2006 küster et al 2010 zhao et al 2007 and reach drinking water resources mompelat et al 2009 as a result they end up in the water cycle and this stresses the need for their removal from wwtp effluents ozone treatment has been studied for pharmaceutical removal luo et al 2014 ozonation is an effective technique to oxidize pharmaceuticals huber et al 2003 ozone targets electrophilic compounds that contain double bonds aromatic structures or amine groups which are often found in the chemical structure of pharmaceuticals nakada et al 2007 ozonation leads to shorter and more oxidized products which are not further broken down by ozone but are more susceptible to biodegradation snyder et al 2006 high removal rates can be obtained by ozonation but process efficiency reduces when other compounds than the pollutants of interest are present mohapatra et al 2014 wwtp effluents contain orders of magnitudes more harmless organic matter than residual pharmaceutical concentrations both being oxidized by ozone resulting in degradation processes competition for ozone the biodegradability of recalcitrant compounds typically increases after ozonation alvares et al 2001 however toxic by products can be formed during ozonation illés et al 2014 resulting in the need of a subsequent treatment step after ozonation rivera utrilla et al 2013 activated carbon ac is a commonly proposed post ozone treatment step as it effectively removes organic compounds from water through adsorption and does not generate toxic by products knopp et al 2016 a costly downside of ac is the regeneration or replacement of ac when saturated an alternative or addition to physical chemical techniques is biological treatment i e employing microorganisms to degrade pharmaceuticals and ozonation by products in general biological treatment requires low energy and chemical inputs however complex molecules like pharmaceuticals present at low concentrations are challenging to biodegrade luo et al 2014 for many pharmaceuticals insufficient degradation rates result in incomplete removal in biological processes applied at wwtps joss et al 2006 moreover specific micropollutant degrading microorganisms are easily outcompeted by other microorganisms that depend on easily degradable substrates present at higher concentrations li et al 2014 nonetheless biological treatment was found suitable to remove toxic by products that were formed during ozonation thus lowering the toxicity de souza et al 2010 li et al 2015 combining biological and ozone treatment can be an alternative set of processes for enhanced pharmaceutical removal combinations of biological processes with advanced oxidation processes including ozonation are known to have beneficial effects over single process technologies scott and ollis 1995 and have been suggested as the most promising option to prepare wastewater for reclamation gadipelly et al 2014 gomes et al 2017 effective degradation and mineralisation of the degradation products was achieved in a combined ozone biological process for the widely prescribed antibiotic tetracycline gómez pacheco et al 2011 in the study presented here the capacities of biological and ozone treatment processes are combined for pharmaceutical removal in a post treatment process at the wwtp a three step biological ozone biological bo3b treatment process is designed for the cost effective removal of pharmaceuticals the first biological treatment step aims at organic matter removal thereby lowering the ozone dose required for oxidation of biorecalcitrant pharmaceuticals in the subsequent ozone treatment the second biological treatment aims at the removal of potentially toxic by products formed during ozonation applied ozone dose and the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactors are the studied key parameters to adjust the process performance the objective of this study is therefore to test the influence of the applied ozone dose and hrt on the bo3b process performance both chemical and toxicological parameters are used to assess the bo3b process efficiency an optimal combination of biological and ozone treatment is hypothesized to result in a cost effective bo3b process to remove pharmaceuticals and the toxicity they impose at minimal energy input 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed solution and inoculum secondary clarified effluent was obtained from wwtp bennekom bennekom the netherlands as feed solution for the experimental work wwtp bennekom is a conventional activated sludge cas system with different redox conditions for biological nitrogen and phosphate removal and has a capacity to treat 20 000 population equivalents two batches of effluent were taken during the experiment the effluent had an average total organic carbon toc concentration of 17 3 3 3 mg l and a ph of 7 6 0 2 other effluent characteristics are given in tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary information si inocula from three locations were taken and mixed the inoculum mixture consisted of mbr sludge from a hospital wastewater treatment facility pharmafilter reinier de graafziekenhuis delft the netherlands primary and secondary sludge of wwtp bath bath the netherlands treating a mixture of industrial and domestic wastewater and biomass from the biogac polishing step of wwtp horstermeer one step filter nederhorst den berg the netherlands 2 2 chemicals the pharmaceutical stock solution was prepared in hplc grade methanol and consisted of caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac gemfibrozil ibuprofen metoprolol naproxen sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim pharmaceuticals were selected based on consumption patterns occurrence in the environment physico chemical properties and whether they can be analysed de voogt et al 2009 to avoid the influence of methanol on the experiments spikes of the stock solution were evaporated till dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream whereafter secondary clarified effluent was added to obtain the feed solution with a pharmaceutical concentration of approximately 200 μg l for experimental and analytical reasons the spiking concentration is above the environmental relevant concentrations as also done in other research de wilt et al 2018 jewell et al 2016 2 3 experimental setup bo3b process the experimental setup consisting of a biological reactor br1 an ozone reactor o3r and a second biological reactor br2 were operated in series fig 1 an adaptation period of 5 months was applied for the physical and biological stabilization of the bo3b process before various process parameters were tested thereafter different ozone doses in o3r and different hrts of the bioreactors were studied during a 5 month experimental period hrts of respectively 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h were tested by changing the flow rate four ozone doses were tested by varying the ozone concentration in the injected gas mixture 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 5 g o3 g toc each time a parameter was changed the bo3b process was operated for 4 7 days before samples were taken and new settings were applied 2 3 1 biological reactors br1 and br2 two identical lab scale reactors br1 and br2 were operated in continuous mode sand with a diameter of 1 2 1 6 mm was obtained from a drinking water treatment plant sandfilter vitens de meern the netherlands and functioned as the carrier material in the reactors sand and the inoculum mixture were mixed and formed the filter bed of the reactors br1 and br2 were inoculated with 2 8 and 3 3 kg of filter bed material respectively the effective reactor volume was approximately 1 4 l the initial dry matter dm and organic matter om content of the filter bed was 749 5 g dm kg and 38 0 g om kg respectively after wash out of surplus filter bed material during the adaptation period these contents decreased to 734 9 g dm kg and 30 8 g om kg at 23 weeks of operation reactors were fed from the top by continuous dripping the influent was dispersed evenly over the filter bed surface by a fine porous plate placed on top of the filter bed effluent was discharged at the bottom of the reactors a net with marbles on the bottom retained the filter bed br1 was operated with a subsequent 1 5 l settler preventing washed out biomass to enter the o3r br1 was fed with the feed solution as described in section 2 1 br2 with the effluent of the o3r in both reactors aerobic conditions were obtained by a counter current air flow fluorescein was used in a conservative tracer pulse test to determine the hrt fluorescein concentrations in the effluent were analysed at a frequency of 10 s 2 3 2 ozone reactor o3r a glass column ozone reactor inner ø 3 6 cm height 216 cm with an effective liquid volume of 1 6 l operated in a counter current mode was continuously fed with effluent of br1 a gaseous ozone air mixture was injected at the bottom of the column though a diffuser to create fine bubbles an air flow of 1 l h was used to generate ozone ozon netech nt bt 2g and continuously analysed ozone analyser bmt 964 before injection into the reactor ozone in the reactor off gas was measured by a spectrophotometer kratos spectroflow 783 uv vis absorbance detector model 9000 7831 path length 6 mm λ 254 and residual ozone in the liquid effluent by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 in both streams ozone was not detected during the experiment the applied ozone dose was expressed as g o3 g toc 2 4 nutrient limitation experiments batch experiments were performed to investigate whether the bo3b process was nutrient limited two series of duplicate serum bottles 250 ml were fed with 150 ml feed solution and inoculated with 3 7 g of br1 filter bed material the filter bed material was taken after 25 weeks of reactor operation one series of batches was amended with a mixture of macro nutrients and trace elements de wilt et al 2018 the aerobic batches were closed with cotton wool stoppers incubated at 20 c on a shaker plate and sampled at 0 46 53 69 77 and 94 h 2 5 analytical methods liquid samples for pharmaceutical and toc analysis were taken from the influents and effluents of the reactors 30 ml and batch experiments 7 5 ml samples for pharmaceutical analysis were directly centrifuged at 3620 g after which the supernatant was frozen and stored at 10 c prior to extraction pharmaceuticals were extracted by spe and analysed by lc dad according to the procedure described by de wilt et al 2018 samples for toc determination were analysed on a shimadzu tnm l rohs toc l further details on the analytical method are given in the si text s1 2 6 toxicity assays standardized bioassays on three trophic levels involving daphnia magna pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and vibrio fischeri were conducted as they have been widely used for determining toxic effects of pharmaceuticals in wastewater emmanuel et al 2005 escher et al 2005 foekema et al 2012 the aquatic bioassays to test for acute toxicity were conducted on the feed solution and effluents of each bo3b treatment step operated at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h d magna immobilization was determined with the daphtoxkit f magna tests microbiotests inc according to the iso standard 6341 d magna immobilization was studied after 48 h exposure p subcapitata growth inhibition and toxicity towards v fischeri were tested according to the methods described by he et al 2016 but using k2cr2o7 as positive control to validate the protocol for the p subcapitata assay 3 results and discussion 3 1 general performance nutrient removal ph changes and wash out of the filter bed were investigated to assess the general performance of the biological reactors consistent with the prevailing aerobic conditions in br1 ammonium and nitrite were completely nitrified to nitrate no further conversion of nitrate was found over o3r and br2 phosphate concentrations were halved over the bo3b process which mainly occurred in br1 no remarkable changes in ph were found as the ph in the effluents of br1 o3r and br2 was 7 7 8 1 and 7 7 respectively because of nutrient and trace element limitation concerns in the feed solution the effect of nutrient and trace element addition was studied in batch experiments toc and pharmaceutical removal was identical between batches with or without the additional nutrients and trace elements data not shown this demonstrated that the feed solution i e the secondary clarified effluent contained sufficient nutrients and trace elements to support biological toc and pharmaceutical removal during the adaptation period of 5 months inclination of the filter bed by several centimetres and wash out of surplus particulate om was observed initially the om content of br1 was 50 7 g om kg dm whereas this was reduced to 41 8 g om kg dm after the adaptation period thereafter no appreciable wash out was observed during the 5 month experimental period no major changes in the toc and pharmaceutical removal efficiency of br1 were observed during the adaptation period this implies that the biomass was well adapted to pharmaceuticals and no noticeable further adaptation occurred incidental clogging of major flow paths affecting the reactor hydraulics was observed throughout the entire 10 months of operation in most cases the clogging was overcome by the reactor itself by water build up after which new flow paths were formed 3 2 the bo3b process we designed the bo3b process as a cost effective alternative to direct ozonation for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wwtp effluents as implementation of ozone treatment is often associated with high operational costs the bo3b process aims at reducing ozone inputs a key parameter determining the cost effectiveness of ozonation is the om concentration i e toc or dissolved organic carbon doc as it reacts with ozone and oh radicals and thereby decreases the removal efficiency of target compounds von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence lee et al 2013 found that the removal of pharmaceuticals by ozonation was consistent when the ozone dose was normalized to the om concentration in the liquid i e g o3 g doc for various wwtp effluents with different origins direct ozonation of the feed solution used in this study containing a moderately high om concentration of 17 3 3 3 mg toc l would require relatively high absolute ozone doses therefore we aimed at toc removal in the first biological treatment step br1 at the most intensively studied hrt of 1 46 h a toc elimination of 38 4 was observed over br1 thus by applying a toc normalized ozone dose the absolute ozone dose in the subsequent o3r could be proportionally reduced thereby increasing the cost effectiveness of o3r to remove the present pharmaceuticals in comparison studies on post treatment by ozonation of swiss japanese and u s wastewaters used feed solutions with lower om concentrations 7 0 7 7 huber et al 2005 2 9 4 2 nakada et al 2007 4 2 6 0 hollender et al 2009 2 4 4 8 zimmermann et al 2011 and 4 7 7 1 mg doc l lee et al 2013 however for other wastewaters originating from the u s australia and germany moderate to high om concentrations are found 6 6 10 3 mg toc l wert et al 2009 and 15 26 4 lee et al 2013 and 23 0 mg doc l ternes et al 2003 this demonstrates the high variety in wastewater matrices and indicates that the benefit of biological om removal prior to ozonation is not limited to this study only the toc removal over o3r was 6 however the average toc removal at ozone doses ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 g o3 g toc was 13 6 and did not correlated with the ozone dose this low and unsteady toc removal during ozonation is also found by others bahr et al 2007 the average toc removal over br2 was 17 3 which is a result of the increased biodegradability after ozonation snyder et al 2006 literature has shown that ozone oxidises both pharmaceuticals and biorecalcitrant om hollender et al 2009 simpson 2008 therefore we postulate that most likely ozonation products originating from both pharmaceuticals and biorecalcitrant om attributed to the observed toc removal over br2 3 3 pharmaceutical removal in the bo3b process pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process operated at an ozone dose and hrt of respectively 0 2 g o3 g toc and 1 46 h is depicted in fig 2 in general pharmaceuticals were effectively removed over the three step process displaying removal efficiencies of 60 to complete removal compounds known to be susceptible towards biodegradation such as caffeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen and naproxen were well removed 95 in the first bioreactor br1 of the moderately biodegradable compounds sulfamethoxazole was efficiently removed 99 whereas metoprolol and trimethoprim were only partially removed during biological treatment respectively 32 and 42 unsurprisingly the recalcitrant compounds carbamazepine and diclofenac showed limited removal in br1 14 carbamazepine diclofenac and trimethoprim were targeted by ozonation in the subsequent o3r demonstrating removal efficiencies of 77 80 and 49 respectively the other compounds were removed by 10 the small remaining fractions of diclofenac and trimethoprim after ozonation were completely removed during the second biological treatment step br2 whereas metoprolol was poorly removed 21 in addition a slight increase 4 in the carbamazepine concentration was found after br2 which could indicate carbamazepine production this concentration increase was also observed in other test campaigns of this study back transformation of conjugated metabolites to the parent compound is found for carbamazepine during biological treatment radjenović et al 2009 vieno et al 2007 back transformation of ozonation products is to our knowledge not described in the literature thus no firm explanation other than an analytical deviation could be found for this slightly increased carbamazepine concentration the pharmaceutical removal patterns of this study were compared to the literature on biological treatment and ozonation br1 and br2 were qualitatively compared to cas systems as they were inoculated with biomass derived from cas systems taking into account that there is a high variance in reported removal efficiencies of individual compounds among various studies removal efficiencies of caffeine ibuprofen and naproxen in cas processes are generally above 75 deblonde et al 2011 luo et al 2014 sipma et al 2010 verlicchi et al 2012 this corresponds well with the fate of these pharmaceuticals in br1 of this work similar to the moderate removal of metoprolol and the low removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac in br1 reported removal efficiencies are typically around 40 and below 35 respectively in contrast gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are relatively well removed in this work compared to their reported removal efficiencies in the literature of approximately 60 50 and 30 respectively deblonde et al 2011 luo et al 2014 sipma et al 2010 verlicchi et al 2012 especially the removal of gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole in br1 was high 99 biodegradation is the predominant removal mechanisms in biological treatment alvarino et al 2014 therefore the biodegradation rates in our study were higher compared to cas systems since we employed a lower hrt a lower amount of biomass and higher pharmaceutical concentrations for other biological treatment systems e g sand filters elevated removal efficiencies for individual pharmaceuticals have been observed compared to cas systems göbel et al 2007 reungoat et al 2011 a better removal in a sand filter than in cas systems was found by reungoat et al 2011 for i a trimethoprim nevertheless in that sand filter the removal efficiencies of caffeine gemfibrozil metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole were low 30 50 10 no removal respectively compared to cas systems and br1 of this work correspondingly göbel et al 2007 found a high 74 trimethoprim removal during sand filtration however no effective elimination was found for sulfamethoxazole and other antibiotics in sand filtration and activated sludge treatment aerobic conditions were found to correlate positively to pharmaceutical removal alvarino et al 2014 göbel et al 2007 matamoros et al 2007 surprisingly the compounds for which better anaerobic removal is reported such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were well removed in br1 hence the observed pharmaceutical removal suggested that br1 was an effective barrier to biodegradable compounds the effective oxidation of diclofenac carbamazepine and trimethoprim during ozone treatment at 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h is in good agreement with their high reported ozonation rate constants k o3 of 6 8 3 and 2 7 105 m 1 s 1 respectively zimmermann et al 2011 the limited metoprolol removal during ozonation corresponds well with its moderate k o3 of 2 103 m 1 s 1 the results of this work are in accordance with the work on ozonation of secondary clarified effluent by hollender et al 2009 similarly this can be attributed to the high ozonation rate constants the neutral ph and the absence of ozone scavengers like nitrite 0 05 mg l although the removal efficiency decreased at lower ozone doses for most of their tested compounds diclofenac carbamazepine and trimethoprim were well removed 95 at 0 40 g o3 g doc at this dose metoprolol removal was approximately 60 whereas it was effectively removed 95 at 1 16 g o3 g doc the observed removal by ozonation is typically a result of the breakdown of pharmaceuticals into smaller oxidized products rather than mineralisation snyder et al 2006 for example the formation of different quinazoline containing products during carbamazepine ozonation mcdowell et al 2005 therefore considerable amounts of ozonation products will enter br2 3 4 effect of ozone dose pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process at ozone doses varying from 0 1 to 0 5 g o3 g toc at an hrt of 1 46 h is depicted in fig 3 the recalcitrance of carbamazepine towards biodegradation and its high ozonation rate constant 105 m 1 s 1 allows this compound to be used as indicator for the o3r performance at different ozone doses at ozone doses of 0 4 and 0 5 g o3 g toc carbamazepine was completely removed over the bob process which was mainly contributed to ozonation incomplete removal of 90 and 75 was found for ozone doses of 0 2 and 0 1 g o3 g toc respectively these results are in good accordance with lee et al 2013 who reported a carbamazepine removal by ozonation of 55 55 90 and 99 at ozone doses of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 g o3 g doc respectively for the other pharmaceuticals a complete removal was obtained even at the lowest ozone doses except for trimethoprim even though br1 performed poorly in that testing campaign thus ozonation effectively contributed to the pharmaceutical removal in the bo3b process at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc e g 99 diclofenac and 40 carbamazepine removal this is better than the 30 pharmaceutical removal at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g doc reported by reungoat et al 2010 which can possibly be explained by the difference in using doc or toc to normalize the ozone dose as the amount of doc is smaller than the amount of toc in general the removal of diclofenac metoprolol and trimethoprim was unsteady over br1 and o3r in the different test campaigns although their biodegradability is typically reported as moderate or low deblonde et al 2011 luo et al 2014 sipma et al 2010 verlicchi et al 2012 these compounds were effectively biodegraded during some of our test campaigns in all cases the combination of br1 and o3r effectively removed diclofenac independently of the applied ozone dose metoprolol is less susceptible to ozonation and unsteadily removed in o3r when br1 showed low removal i e at 0 1 and 0 2 g o3 g toc the low metoprolol removal by ozonation is similar to the findings of hollender et al 2009 who found 90 and 60 metoprolol removal at 0 62 and 0 40 g o3 g doc respectively trimethoprim removal did not correlate well with the applied ozone dose at the intermediate ozone doses it was removed by ozonation whereas it was not removed at highest and lowest ozone doses regarding the reported high trimethoprim ozonation rate constant 105 m 1 s 1 removal at 0 5 g o3 g toc was expected no other explanation than a possible analytical error at the highest ozone dose could be found to explain this finding ozonation of bromide containing water can lead to the formation of bromate which is suspected to be carcinogenic to humans von gunten and hoigne 1994 in our study bromide was not found above the detection limit 5 μg l in any of the samples hence no toxic effects of bromate is expected as drinking water standards are 10 μg l these findings are in good accordance with the low bromide concentrations detected in drinking water intake of typically 25 μg l von gunten and salhi 2003 3 5 effect of hrt pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process at varying hrts from 0 3 to 1 46 h at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc is depicted in fig 4 the easily biodegradable pharmaceuticals caffeine ibuprofen and naproxen were used to assess the influence of hrt on the bo3b process pharmaceutical removal at hrts of 0 47 and 1 46 h the removal of these and most other compounds is highly similar resulting in an efficient removal only metoprolol behaved different as it was better removed at an hrt of 0 47 h this agrees well with the results of the ozone dose tests fig 3 in which the biological removal of metoprolol was unsteady over the different test campaigns similarly trimethoprim removal over br1 also fluctuated in contrast to metoprolol trimethoprim was effectively removed in o3r and br2 the limited biological removal of caffeine ibuprofen and naproxen at an hrt of 0 3 h compared to the longer hrts suggests that 0 3 h is too short for an effective biological treatment matamoros et al 2007 reported a similar trend of decreasing pharmaceutical removal efficiencies at increasing hydraulic loading rates for a sand filter at a loading rate of 70 mm day 1 corresponding to an hrt of 4 6 h caffeine diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen were removed at 98 76 90 and 80 respectively however at a loading rate of 160 mm day 1 the removal efficiencies decreased to approximately 66 58 50 and 54 respectively assuming a linear relation for the sand filter between hydraulic loading rate and hrt whereby these results can be quantitatively compared to those at the hrt of 1 46 h of this study this suggest that the pharmaceutical removal of br1 was relatively high escolà casas and bester 2015 studied and reviewed diclofenac removal in various sand filters i e slow and fast filtration and found hrt related reaction rate constants k ln c o u t c i n k h r t of 0 004 0 04 0 37 and 1 92 h 1 at hrts of 5 7 9 01 0 108 and 0 13 h respectively the hrt related reaction rate constants of diclofenac in this study are 0 10 0 96 and 0 59 h 1 at hrts of 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h respectively and thereby at the higher end compared to the reported rate constants by escolà casas and bester 2015 an hrt based rate constant calculation is a simplification of reality neglecting heterogeneity aspects of filter beds such as redox substrate and biomass gradients however the high variety among reported rates suggests that the difference between studies e g inoculation of the sand filter type of wastewater and operational conditions justifies the comparison of hrt based rate constants in the literature oxygen or biomass levels are reported to be rate limiting in sand filters escolà casas and bester 2015 matamoros et al 2007 in this study an overdose of oxygen was supplied and a surplus of well adapted biomass was present at inoculation resulting in the wash out of biomass therefore it is hypothesized that the contact time between biomass and pharmaceuticals is the rate limiting factor even though the pharmaceutical removal over br1 was limited at an hrt of 0 3 h the removal over the entire bo3b process was similar at the three hrts remaining fractions of pharmaceuticals were effectively ozonated in o3r resulting in a complete removal of most pharmaceuticals except for carbamazepine 80 and trimethoprim 50 toc removal over br1 reduced from 38 to 31 19 at hrts of 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h respectively similarly matamoros et al 2007 found a decrease in tss and bod5 at decreasing hrts 3 6 lowest ozone dose and lowest hrt the pharmaceutical removal at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 0 3 h is depicted in fig 5 a complete pharmaceutical removal is achieved except for carbamazepine and trimethoprim the pharmaceutical removal over br1 in this campaign is higher compared to the hrt of 0 3 h at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc fig 4 this can be explained by the incidental changes in the outflow regime due to clogging of the br1 filter bed especially at short hrts this hydraulic behaviour can locally strongly influence the pharmaceutical removal in the reactor therefore an hrt longer than 0 3 h is recommended to achieve a continuous and high pharmaceutical removal at an hrt of 0 3 h the pharmaceutical removal over o3r was low the low removal of carbamazepine is in the same range as its low removal over o3r at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc at an hrt of 1 46 h fig 3 the ineffective ozonation of pharmaceuticals that are recalcitrant towards biological treatment such as carbamazepine indicates that an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc is too low for the effective removal of a broad pallet of pharmaceuticals and therefore higher doses are recommended for full scale implementation 3 7 toxicity the pharmaceutical removal during the campaign in which toxicity was tested is depicted in fig s1 of the si although the pharmaceutical concentrations in the bo3b influent in this study were above environmental relevant concentrations no significant inhibition was found for d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri in the toxicity bioassays figs s2 s4 of the si the bioassays with p subcapitata and v fischeri demonstrated the highest toxicity however inhibition did not exceed 25 and showed no significant difference between effluent samples of the individual steps of the bo3b process this is contrary to the increased toxicity towards d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri found after ozonation of other pharmaceuticals such as ketoprofen illés et al 2014 however this can be explained by the high concentrations mg l applied in that study compared to this study kaiser et al 2014 found that transformation products after biological treatment of carbamazepine can be more toxic for v fischeri than carbamazepine as carbamazepine persisted in br1 it is unlikely that many transformation products were formed resulting in low observed toxicities in this study the three applied bioassays test for acute toxicity towards the test organisms this limits an in depth toxicological evaluation as chronic toxicity such as genotoxic effects are not studied in these bioassays for instance bio transformation products of carbamazepine were found to have a higher genotoxicity potential than carbamazepine however these products were effectively removed during ozonation brezina et al 2017 although the low observed acute toxic effects hampered the evaluation of individual bo3b process steps in toxicity reduction the combination of ozonation with a subsequent biological treatment i e sand filtration was found to effectively reduce toxicity stalter et al 2010 nevertheless further ecotoxicological investigations are recommended as pharmaceuticals and their transformation products formed during biological and ozone treatment can pose diverse ecotoxicological risks luo et al 2014 3 8 costs and energy demand production costs of ozone represent 20 40 of the total costs for large scale ozonation installations and range depending on the energy price and the system requirements between 1 4 and 2 5 kg o3 xylem water solutions netherlands b v 2018 the bo3b process operated at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and hrt of 1 46 h effectively removed pharmaceuticals in this study moreover 38 toc removal was achieved during biological treatment prior to ozonation i e br1 therefore the costs for ozone production in the bo3b process are 0 005 m3 considering a secondary clarified effluent with an average toc concentration of 17 3 mg l thereby the total costs for ozonation investment and operational costs are estimated to be 0 03 m3 the investment and operational costs for biological pre and post treatment i e br1 and br2 respectively are hypothesized to be smaller or equal to the costs for ozonation as the operational costs of sand filters is known to be low the total costs for additional treatment by the bo3b process are therefore estimated to be 0 06 m3 these costs are on the lower end of the costs estimated by joss et al 2008 who reported the additional investment and operational costs for ozonation and post filtration to be 0 05 0 15 m3 depending on the wwtp size and doc concentration according to the dutch water authorities the investment and operational costs for conventional wastewater treatment excluding sewer transport costs in the netherlands are 0 45 m3 unie van waterschappen 2015 thus the additional costs for bo3b treatment are less than 15 of the total treatment costs in addition the yearly average wastewater treatment tariff is 55 69 per population equivalent unie van waterschappen 2015 based on the 0 06 m3 for bo3b treatment the yearly additional costs are estimated to be 5 per population equivalent which corresponds to a less than 10 tariff increase the energy requirements for ozone production are approximately 15 and 35 kwh kg o3 when manufactured from oxygen and air respectively fridman 2008 hence the energy demand is about 0 03 0 07 kwh m3 together with the energy demand of pumps and other equipment the total demand is estimated to be 0 1 0 15 kwh m3 which corresponds well with literature estimations of 0 1 0 3 kwh m3 joss et al 2008 the energy demand for conventional wastewater treatment in the netherlands is about 0 39 kwh m3 of which 0 17 kwh m3 is needed for aeration unie van waterschappen 2015 post treatment by a bo3b process would therefore increase the energy consumption by approximately 25 38 overall this study demonstrates that even for secondary clarified effluents with high toc levels ozonation can be a cost effective treatment process when combined with biological pre and post treatment steps i e the bo3b process therefore bo3b treatment is found an effective process for the reduction of emission of potentially harmful compounds into the aquatic environment 4 conclusions the combination of biological treatment and ozonation in the designed three step bo3b process is found an effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluent with high toc concentrations ozonation and biological treatment are complementary processes targeting different pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process exceeded 85 except for metoprolol 60 at a low ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h in the biological reactors carbamazepine that persisted during biological treatment was completely ozonated at increased ozone doses of 0 4 g o3 g toc whereas at a dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc it showed low removal 40 easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were 95 removed by biological treatment at hrts of 0 47 and 1 46 h at the lowest tested hrt of 0 3 h these pharmaceuticals were incompletely removed 35 95 the input of absolute amounts of ozone was effectively reduced by the elimination of toc over the first biological step i e br1 at hrts of 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h a decrease in toc concentration was found over br1of respectively 38 31 and 19 resulting in a proportional reduction of ozone in the subsequent ozone reactor i e o3r no appreciable acute toxicity towards d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual bo3b reactors however further ecotoxicological investigations are suggested the secondary clarified effluent contains sufficient nutrients and trace elements to support biological pharmaceutical removal costs associated to bo3b treatment are estimated to increase the current treatment costs for conventional wastewater treatment by 15 the yearly tariff per population equivalent for wastewater treatment in a country like the netherlands is estimated to increase by less than 10 the energy demand for wastewater treatment is expected to increase by 25 38 overall the bo3b process is a cost effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents

19596,individual treatment processes like biological treatment or ozonation have their limitations for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents with high organic matter concentrations i e 17 mg toc l these limitations can be overcome by combining these two processes for a cost effective pharmaceutical removal a three step biological ozone biological bo3b treatment process was therefore designed for the enhanced pharmaceutical removal from wastewater effluent the first biological step removed 38 of ozone scavenging toc thus proportionally reducing the absolute ozone input for the subsequent ozonation complementariness between biological and ozone treatment i e targeting different pharmaceuticals resulted in cost effective pharmaceutical removal by the overall bo3b process at a low ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h in the biological reactors the removal of 8 out of 9 pharmaceuticals exceeded 85 except for metoprolol 60 testing various ozone doses and hrts revealed that pharmaceuticals were ineffectively removed at 0 1 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 0 3 h at hrts of 0 47 and 1 46 h easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were over 95 removed by biological treatment the biorecalcitrant carbamazepine was completely ozonated at a dose of 0 4 g o3 g toc ozonation products are likely biodegraded in the last biological reactor as a 17 toc removal was found no appreciable acute toxicity towards d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual bo3b reactors the bo3b process is estimated to increase the yearly wastewater treatment tariff per population equivalent in the netherlands by less than 10 overall the bo3b process is a cost effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation ozonation combined treatment pharmaceuticals wastewater toxicity 1 introduction human consumption of pharmaceuticals has increased in the past years and is expected to rise even more due to the growing world population and increased average age van der aa et al 2011 after administration pharmaceuticals are excreted and disposed into the sewer fent et al 2006 this results in elevated pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater as is illustrated by measurements of numerous studies over the past decades mompelat et al 2009 sacher et al 2008 many pharmaceuticals are persistent in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps rivera utrilla et al 2013 verlicchi et al 2012 pharmaceutical levels in wwtp effluents jeopardize the aquatic environment escher et al 2011 fent et al 2006 küster et al 2010 zhao et al 2007 and reach drinking water resources mompelat et al 2009 as a result they end up in the water cycle and this stresses the need for their removal from wwtp effluents ozone treatment has been studied for pharmaceutical removal luo et al 2014 ozonation is an effective technique to oxidize pharmaceuticals huber et al 2003 ozone targets electrophilic compounds that contain double bonds aromatic structures or amine groups which are often found in the chemical structure of pharmaceuticals nakada et al 2007 ozonation leads to shorter and more oxidized products which are not further broken down by ozone but are more susceptible to biodegradation snyder et al 2006 high removal rates can be obtained by ozonation but process efficiency reduces when other compounds than the pollutants of interest are present mohapatra et al 2014 wwtp effluents contain orders of magnitudes more harmless organic matter than residual pharmaceutical concentrations both being oxidized by ozone resulting in degradation processes competition for ozone the biodegradability of recalcitrant compounds typically increases after ozonation alvares et al 2001 however toxic by products can be formed during ozonation illés et al 2014 resulting in the need of a subsequent treatment step after ozonation rivera utrilla et al 2013 activated carbon ac is a commonly proposed post ozone treatment step as it effectively removes organic compounds from water through adsorption and does not generate toxic by products knopp et al 2016 a costly downside of ac is the regeneration or replacement of ac when saturated an alternative or addition to physical chemical techniques is biological treatment i e employing microorganisms to degrade pharmaceuticals and ozonation by products in general biological treatment requires low energy and chemical inputs however complex molecules like pharmaceuticals present at low concentrations are challenging to biodegrade luo et al 2014 for many pharmaceuticals insufficient degradation rates result in incomplete removal in biological processes applied at wwtps joss et al 2006 moreover specific micropollutant degrading microorganisms are easily outcompeted by other microorganisms that depend on easily degradable substrates present at higher concentrations li et al 2014 nonetheless biological treatment was found suitable to remove toxic by products that were formed during ozonation thus lowering the toxicity de souza et al 2010 li et al 2015 combining biological and ozone treatment can be an alternative set of processes for enhanced pharmaceutical removal combinations of biological processes with advanced oxidation processes including ozonation are known to have beneficial effects over single process technologies scott and ollis 1995 and have been suggested as the most promising option to prepare wastewater for reclamation gadipelly et al 2014 gomes et al 2017 effective degradation and mineralisation of the degradation products was achieved in a combined ozone biological process for the widely prescribed antibiotic tetracycline gómez pacheco et al 2011 in the study presented here the capacities of biological and ozone treatment processes are combined for pharmaceutical removal in a post treatment process at the wwtp a three step biological ozone biological bo3b treatment process is designed for the cost effective removal of pharmaceuticals the first biological treatment step aims at organic matter removal thereby lowering the ozone dose required for oxidation of biorecalcitrant pharmaceuticals in the subsequent ozone treatment the second biological treatment aims at the removal of potentially toxic by products formed during ozonation applied ozone dose and the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactors are the studied key parameters to adjust the process performance the objective of this study is therefore to test the influence of the applied ozone dose and hrt on the bo3b process performance both chemical and toxicological parameters are used to assess the bo3b process efficiency an optimal combination of biological and ozone treatment is hypothesized to result in a cost effective bo3b process to remove pharmaceuticals and the toxicity they impose at minimal energy input 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed solution and inoculum secondary clarified effluent was obtained from wwtp bennekom bennekom the netherlands as feed solution for the experimental work wwtp bennekom is a conventional activated sludge cas system with different redox conditions for biological nitrogen and phosphate removal and has a capacity to treat 20 000 population equivalents two batches of effluent were taken during the experiment the effluent had an average total organic carbon toc concentration of 17 3 3 3 mg l and a ph of 7 6 0 2 other effluent characteristics are given in tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary information si inocula from three locations were taken and mixed the inoculum mixture consisted of mbr sludge from a hospital wastewater treatment facility pharmafilter reinier de graafziekenhuis delft the netherlands primary and secondary sludge of wwtp bath bath the netherlands treating a mixture of industrial and domestic wastewater and biomass from the biogac polishing step of wwtp horstermeer one step filter nederhorst den berg the netherlands 2 2 chemicals the pharmaceutical stock solution was prepared in hplc grade methanol and consisted of caffeine carbamazepine diclofenac gemfibrozil ibuprofen metoprolol naproxen sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim pharmaceuticals were selected based on consumption patterns occurrence in the environment physico chemical properties and whether they can be analysed de voogt et al 2009 to avoid the influence of methanol on the experiments spikes of the stock solution were evaporated till dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream whereafter secondary clarified effluent was added to obtain the feed solution with a pharmaceutical concentration of approximately 200 μg l for experimental and analytical reasons the spiking concentration is above the environmental relevant concentrations as also done in other research de wilt et al 2018 jewell et al 2016 2 3 experimental setup bo3b process the experimental setup consisting of a biological reactor br1 an ozone reactor o3r and a second biological reactor br2 were operated in series fig 1 an adaptation period of 5 months was applied for the physical and biological stabilization of the bo3b process before various process parameters were tested thereafter different ozone doses in o3r and different hrts of the bioreactors were studied during a 5 month experimental period hrts of respectively 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h were tested by changing the flow rate four ozone doses were tested by varying the ozone concentration in the injected gas mixture 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 5 g o3 g toc each time a parameter was changed the bo3b process was operated for 4 7 days before samples were taken and new settings were applied 2 3 1 biological reactors br1 and br2 two identical lab scale reactors br1 and br2 were operated in continuous mode sand with a diameter of 1 2 1 6 mm was obtained from a drinking water treatment plant sandfilter vitens de meern the netherlands and functioned as the carrier material in the reactors sand and the inoculum mixture were mixed and formed the filter bed of the reactors br1 and br2 were inoculated with 2 8 and 3 3 kg of filter bed material respectively the effective reactor volume was approximately 1 4 l the initial dry matter dm and organic matter om content of the filter bed was 749 5 g dm kg and 38 0 g om kg respectively after wash out of surplus filter bed material during the adaptation period these contents decreased to 734 9 g dm kg and 30 8 g om kg at 23 weeks of operation reactors were fed from the top by continuous dripping the influent was dispersed evenly over the filter bed surface by a fine porous plate placed on top of the filter bed effluent was discharged at the bottom of the reactors a net with marbles on the bottom retained the filter bed br1 was operated with a subsequent 1 5 l settler preventing washed out biomass to enter the o3r br1 was fed with the feed solution as described in section 2 1 br2 with the effluent of the o3r in both reactors aerobic conditions were obtained by a counter current air flow fluorescein was used in a conservative tracer pulse test to determine the hrt fluorescein concentrations in the effluent were analysed at a frequency of 10 s 2 3 2 ozone reactor o3r a glass column ozone reactor inner ø 3 6 cm height 216 cm with an effective liquid volume of 1 6 l operated in a counter current mode was continuously fed with effluent of br1 a gaseous ozone air mixture was injected at the bottom of the column though a diffuser to create fine bubbles an air flow of 1 l h was used to generate ozone ozon netech nt bt 2g and continuously analysed ozone analyser bmt 964 before injection into the reactor ozone in the reactor off gas was measured by a spectrophotometer kratos spectroflow 783 uv vis absorbance detector model 9000 7831 path length 6 mm λ 254 and residual ozone in the liquid effluent by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 in both streams ozone was not detected during the experiment the applied ozone dose was expressed as g o3 g toc 2 4 nutrient limitation experiments batch experiments were performed to investigate whether the bo3b process was nutrient limited two series of duplicate serum bottles 250 ml were fed with 150 ml feed solution and inoculated with 3 7 g of br1 filter bed material the filter bed material was taken after 25 weeks of reactor operation one series of batches was amended with a mixture of macro nutrients and trace elements de wilt et al 2018 the aerobic batches were closed with cotton wool stoppers incubated at 20 c on a shaker plate and sampled at 0 46 53 69 77 and 94 h 2 5 analytical methods liquid samples for pharmaceutical and toc analysis were taken from the influents and effluents of the reactors 30 ml and batch experiments 7 5 ml samples for pharmaceutical analysis were directly centrifuged at 3620 g after which the supernatant was frozen and stored at 10 c prior to extraction pharmaceuticals were extracted by spe and analysed by lc dad according to the procedure described by de wilt et al 2018 samples for toc determination were analysed on a shimadzu tnm l rohs toc l further details on the analytical method are given in the si text s1 2 6 toxicity assays standardized bioassays on three trophic levels involving daphnia magna pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and vibrio fischeri were conducted as they have been widely used for determining toxic effects of pharmaceuticals in wastewater emmanuel et al 2005 escher et al 2005 foekema et al 2012 the aquatic bioassays to test for acute toxicity were conducted on the feed solution and effluents of each bo3b treatment step operated at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h d magna immobilization was determined with the daphtoxkit f magna tests microbiotests inc according to the iso standard 6341 d magna immobilization was studied after 48 h exposure p subcapitata growth inhibition and toxicity towards v fischeri were tested according to the methods described by he et al 2016 but using k2cr2o7 as positive control to validate the protocol for the p subcapitata assay 3 results and discussion 3 1 general performance nutrient removal ph changes and wash out of the filter bed were investigated to assess the general performance of the biological reactors consistent with the prevailing aerobic conditions in br1 ammonium and nitrite were completely nitrified to nitrate no further conversion of nitrate was found over o3r and br2 phosphate concentrations were halved over the bo3b process which mainly occurred in br1 no remarkable changes in ph were found as the ph in the effluents of br1 o3r and br2 was 7 7 8 1 and 7 7 respectively because of nutrient and trace element limitation concerns in the feed solution the effect of nutrient and trace element addition was studied in batch experiments toc and pharmaceutical removal was identical between batches with or without the additional nutrients and trace elements data not shown this demonstrated that the feed solution i e the secondary clarified effluent contained sufficient nutrients and trace elements to support biological toc and pharmaceutical removal during the adaptation period of 5 months inclination of the filter bed by several centimetres and wash out of surplus particulate om was observed initially the om content of br1 was 50 7 g om kg dm whereas this was reduced to 41 8 g om kg dm after the adaptation period thereafter no appreciable wash out was observed during the 5 month experimental period no major changes in the toc and pharmaceutical removal efficiency of br1 were observed during the adaptation period this implies that the biomass was well adapted to pharmaceuticals and no noticeable further adaptation occurred incidental clogging of major flow paths affecting the reactor hydraulics was observed throughout the entire 10 months of operation in most cases the clogging was overcome by the reactor itself by water build up after which new flow paths were formed 3 2 the bo3b process we designed the bo3b process as a cost effective alternative to direct ozonation for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wwtp effluents as implementation of ozone treatment is often associated with high operational costs the bo3b process aims at reducing ozone inputs a key parameter determining the cost effectiveness of ozonation is the om concentration i e toc or dissolved organic carbon doc as it reacts with ozone and oh radicals and thereby decreases the removal efficiency of target compounds von sonntag and von gunten 2012 hence lee et al 2013 found that the removal of pharmaceuticals by ozonation was consistent when the ozone dose was normalized to the om concentration in the liquid i e g o3 g doc for various wwtp effluents with different origins direct ozonation of the feed solution used in this study containing a moderately high om concentration of 17 3 3 3 mg toc l would require relatively high absolute ozone doses therefore we aimed at toc removal in the first biological treatment step br1 at the most intensively studied hrt of 1 46 h a toc elimination of 38 4 was observed over br1 thus by applying a toc normalized ozone dose the absolute ozone dose in the subsequent o3r could be proportionally reduced thereby increasing the cost effectiveness of o3r to remove the present pharmaceuticals in comparison studies on post treatment by ozonation of swiss japanese and u s wastewaters used feed solutions with lower om concentrations 7 0 7 7 huber et al 2005 2 9 4 2 nakada et al 2007 4 2 6 0 hollender et al 2009 2 4 4 8 zimmermann et al 2011 and 4 7 7 1 mg doc l lee et al 2013 however for other wastewaters originating from the u s australia and germany moderate to high om concentrations are found 6 6 10 3 mg toc l wert et al 2009 and 15 26 4 lee et al 2013 and 23 0 mg doc l ternes et al 2003 this demonstrates the high variety in wastewater matrices and indicates that the benefit of biological om removal prior to ozonation is not limited to this study only the toc removal over o3r was 6 however the average toc removal at ozone doses ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 g o3 g toc was 13 6 and did not correlated with the ozone dose this low and unsteady toc removal during ozonation is also found by others bahr et al 2007 the average toc removal over br2 was 17 3 which is a result of the increased biodegradability after ozonation snyder et al 2006 literature has shown that ozone oxidises both pharmaceuticals and biorecalcitrant om hollender et al 2009 simpson 2008 therefore we postulate that most likely ozonation products originating from both pharmaceuticals and biorecalcitrant om attributed to the observed toc removal over br2 3 3 pharmaceutical removal in the bo3b process pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process operated at an ozone dose and hrt of respectively 0 2 g o3 g toc and 1 46 h is depicted in fig 2 in general pharmaceuticals were effectively removed over the three step process displaying removal efficiencies of 60 to complete removal compounds known to be susceptible towards biodegradation such as caffeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen and naproxen were well removed 95 in the first bioreactor br1 of the moderately biodegradable compounds sulfamethoxazole was efficiently removed 99 whereas metoprolol and trimethoprim were only partially removed during biological treatment respectively 32 and 42 unsurprisingly the recalcitrant compounds carbamazepine and diclofenac showed limited removal in br1 14 carbamazepine diclofenac and trimethoprim were targeted by ozonation in the subsequent o3r demonstrating removal efficiencies of 77 80 and 49 respectively the other compounds were removed by 10 the small remaining fractions of diclofenac and trimethoprim after ozonation were completely removed during the second biological treatment step br2 whereas metoprolol was poorly removed 21 in addition a slight increase 4 in the carbamazepine concentration was found after br2 which could indicate carbamazepine production this concentration increase was also observed in other test campaigns of this study back transformation of conjugated metabolites to the parent compound is found for carbamazepine during biological treatment radjenović et al 2009 vieno et al 2007 back transformation of ozonation products is to our knowledge not described in the literature thus no firm explanation other than an analytical deviation could be found for this slightly increased carbamazepine concentration the pharmaceutical removal patterns of this study were compared to the literature on biological treatment and ozonation br1 and br2 were qualitatively compared to cas systems as they were inoculated with biomass derived from cas systems taking into account that there is a high variance in reported removal efficiencies of individual compounds among various studies removal efficiencies of caffeine ibuprofen and naproxen in cas processes are generally above 75 deblonde et al 2011 luo et al 2014 sipma et al 2010 verlicchi et al 2012 this corresponds well with the fate of these pharmaceuticals in br1 of this work similar to the moderate removal of metoprolol and the low removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac in br1 reported removal efficiencies are typically around 40 and below 35 respectively in contrast gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are relatively well removed in this work compared to their reported removal efficiencies in the literature of approximately 60 50 and 30 respectively deblonde et al 2011 luo et al 2014 sipma et al 2010 verlicchi et al 2012 especially the removal of gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole in br1 was high 99 biodegradation is the predominant removal mechanisms in biological treatment alvarino et al 2014 therefore the biodegradation rates in our study were higher compared to cas systems since we employed a lower hrt a lower amount of biomass and higher pharmaceutical concentrations for other biological treatment systems e g sand filters elevated removal efficiencies for individual pharmaceuticals have been observed compared to cas systems göbel et al 2007 reungoat et al 2011 a better removal in a sand filter than in cas systems was found by reungoat et al 2011 for i a trimethoprim nevertheless in that sand filter the removal efficiencies of caffeine gemfibrozil metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole were low 30 50 10 no removal respectively compared to cas systems and br1 of this work correspondingly göbel et al 2007 found a high 74 trimethoprim removal during sand filtration however no effective elimination was found for sulfamethoxazole and other antibiotics in sand filtration and activated sludge treatment aerobic conditions were found to correlate positively to pharmaceutical removal alvarino et al 2014 göbel et al 2007 matamoros et al 2007 surprisingly the compounds for which better anaerobic removal is reported such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were well removed in br1 hence the observed pharmaceutical removal suggested that br1 was an effective barrier to biodegradable compounds the effective oxidation of diclofenac carbamazepine and trimethoprim during ozone treatment at 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h is in good agreement with their high reported ozonation rate constants k o3 of 6 8 3 and 2 7 105 m 1 s 1 respectively zimmermann et al 2011 the limited metoprolol removal during ozonation corresponds well with its moderate k o3 of 2 103 m 1 s 1 the results of this work are in accordance with the work on ozonation of secondary clarified effluent by hollender et al 2009 similarly this can be attributed to the high ozonation rate constants the neutral ph and the absence of ozone scavengers like nitrite 0 05 mg l although the removal efficiency decreased at lower ozone doses for most of their tested compounds diclofenac carbamazepine and trimethoprim were well removed 95 at 0 40 g o3 g doc at this dose metoprolol removal was approximately 60 whereas it was effectively removed 95 at 1 16 g o3 g doc the observed removal by ozonation is typically a result of the breakdown of pharmaceuticals into smaller oxidized products rather than mineralisation snyder et al 2006 for example the formation of different quinazoline containing products during carbamazepine ozonation mcdowell et al 2005 therefore considerable amounts of ozonation products will enter br2 3 4 effect of ozone dose pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process at ozone doses varying from 0 1 to 0 5 g o3 g toc at an hrt of 1 46 h is depicted in fig 3 the recalcitrance of carbamazepine towards biodegradation and its high ozonation rate constant 105 m 1 s 1 allows this compound to be used as indicator for the o3r performance at different ozone doses at ozone doses of 0 4 and 0 5 g o3 g toc carbamazepine was completely removed over the bob process which was mainly contributed to ozonation incomplete removal of 90 and 75 was found for ozone doses of 0 2 and 0 1 g o3 g toc respectively these results are in good accordance with lee et al 2013 who reported a carbamazepine removal by ozonation of 55 55 90 and 99 at ozone doses of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 g o3 g doc respectively for the other pharmaceuticals a complete removal was obtained even at the lowest ozone doses except for trimethoprim even though br1 performed poorly in that testing campaign thus ozonation effectively contributed to the pharmaceutical removal in the bo3b process at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc e g 99 diclofenac and 40 carbamazepine removal this is better than the 30 pharmaceutical removal at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g doc reported by reungoat et al 2010 which can possibly be explained by the difference in using doc or toc to normalize the ozone dose as the amount of doc is smaller than the amount of toc in general the removal of diclofenac metoprolol and trimethoprim was unsteady over br1 and o3r in the different test campaigns although their biodegradability is typically reported as moderate or low deblonde et al 2011 luo et al 2014 sipma et al 2010 verlicchi et al 2012 these compounds were effectively biodegraded during some of our test campaigns in all cases the combination of br1 and o3r effectively removed diclofenac independently of the applied ozone dose metoprolol is less susceptible to ozonation and unsteadily removed in o3r when br1 showed low removal i e at 0 1 and 0 2 g o3 g toc the low metoprolol removal by ozonation is similar to the findings of hollender et al 2009 who found 90 and 60 metoprolol removal at 0 62 and 0 40 g o3 g doc respectively trimethoprim removal did not correlate well with the applied ozone dose at the intermediate ozone doses it was removed by ozonation whereas it was not removed at highest and lowest ozone doses regarding the reported high trimethoprim ozonation rate constant 105 m 1 s 1 removal at 0 5 g o3 g toc was expected no other explanation than a possible analytical error at the highest ozone dose could be found to explain this finding ozonation of bromide containing water can lead to the formation of bromate which is suspected to be carcinogenic to humans von gunten and hoigne 1994 in our study bromide was not found above the detection limit 5 μg l in any of the samples hence no toxic effects of bromate is expected as drinking water standards are 10 μg l these findings are in good accordance with the low bromide concentrations detected in drinking water intake of typically 25 μg l von gunten and salhi 2003 3 5 effect of hrt pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process at varying hrts from 0 3 to 1 46 h at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc is depicted in fig 4 the easily biodegradable pharmaceuticals caffeine ibuprofen and naproxen were used to assess the influence of hrt on the bo3b process pharmaceutical removal at hrts of 0 47 and 1 46 h the removal of these and most other compounds is highly similar resulting in an efficient removal only metoprolol behaved different as it was better removed at an hrt of 0 47 h this agrees well with the results of the ozone dose tests fig 3 in which the biological removal of metoprolol was unsteady over the different test campaigns similarly trimethoprim removal over br1 also fluctuated in contrast to metoprolol trimethoprim was effectively removed in o3r and br2 the limited biological removal of caffeine ibuprofen and naproxen at an hrt of 0 3 h compared to the longer hrts suggests that 0 3 h is too short for an effective biological treatment matamoros et al 2007 reported a similar trend of decreasing pharmaceutical removal efficiencies at increasing hydraulic loading rates for a sand filter at a loading rate of 70 mm day 1 corresponding to an hrt of 4 6 h caffeine diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen were removed at 98 76 90 and 80 respectively however at a loading rate of 160 mm day 1 the removal efficiencies decreased to approximately 66 58 50 and 54 respectively assuming a linear relation for the sand filter between hydraulic loading rate and hrt whereby these results can be quantitatively compared to those at the hrt of 1 46 h of this study this suggest that the pharmaceutical removal of br1 was relatively high escolà casas and bester 2015 studied and reviewed diclofenac removal in various sand filters i e slow and fast filtration and found hrt related reaction rate constants k ln c o u t c i n k h r t of 0 004 0 04 0 37 and 1 92 h 1 at hrts of 5 7 9 01 0 108 and 0 13 h respectively the hrt related reaction rate constants of diclofenac in this study are 0 10 0 96 and 0 59 h 1 at hrts of 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h respectively and thereby at the higher end compared to the reported rate constants by escolà casas and bester 2015 an hrt based rate constant calculation is a simplification of reality neglecting heterogeneity aspects of filter beds such as redox substrate and biomass gradients however the high variety among reported rates suggests that the difference between studies e g inoculation of the sand filter type of wastewater and operational conditions justifies the comparison of hrt based rate constants in the literature oxygen or biomass levels are reported to be rate limiting in sand filters escolà casas and bester 2015 matamoros et al 2007 in this study an overdose of oxygen was supplied and a surplus of well adapted biomass was present at inoculation resulting in the wash out of biomass therefore it is hypothesized that the contact time between biomass and pharmaceuticals is the rate limiting factor even though the pharmaceutical removal over br1 was limited at an hrt of 0 3 h the removal over the entire bo3b process was similar at the three hrts remaining fractions of pharmaceuticals were effectively ozonated in o3r resulting in a complete removal of most pharmaceuticals except for carbamazepine 80 and trimethoprim 50 toc removal over br1 reduced from 38 to 31 19 at hrts of 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h respectively similarly matamoros et al 2007 found a decrease in tss and bod5 at decreasing hrts 3 6 lowest ozone dose and lowest hrt the pharmaceutical removal at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 0 3 h is depicted in fig 5 a complete pharmaceutical removal is achieved except for carbamazepine and trimethoprim the pharmaceutical removal over br1 in this campaign is higher compared to the hrt of 0 3 h at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc fig 4 this can be explained by the incidental changes in the outflow regime due to clogging of the br1 filter bed especially at short hrts this hydraulic behaviour can locally strongly influence the pharmaceutical removal in the reactor therefore an hrt longer than 0 3 h is recommended to achieve a continuous and high pharmaceutical removal at an hrt of 0 3 h the pharmaceutical removal over o3r was low the low removal of carbamazepine is in the same range as its low removal over o3r at an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc at an hrt of 1 46 h fig 3 the ineffective ozonation of pharmaceuticals that are recalcitrant towards biological treatment such as carbamazepine indicates that an ozone dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc is too low for the effective removal of a broad pallet of pharmaceuticals and therefore higher doses are recommended for full scale implementation 3 7 toxicity the pharmaceutical removal during the campaign in which toxicity was tested is depicted in fig s1 of the si although the pharmaceutical concentrations in the bo3b influent in this study were above environmental relevant concentrations no significant inhibition was found for d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri in the toxicity bioassays figs s2 s4 of the si the bioassays with p subcapitata and v fischeri demonstrated the highest toxicity however inhibition did not exceed 25 and showed no significant difference between effluent samples of the individual steps of the bo3b process this is contrary to the increased toxicity towards d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri found after ozonation of other pharmaceuticals such as ketoprofen illés et al 2014 however this can be explained by the high concentrations mg l applied in that study compared to this study kaiser et al 2014 found that transformation products after biological treatment of carbamazepine can be more toxic for v fischeri than carbamazepine as carbamazepine persisted in br1 it is unlikely that many transformation products were formed resulting in low observed toxicities in this study the three applied bioassays test for acute toxicity towards the test organisms this limits an in depth toxicological evaluation as chronic toxicity such as genotoxic effects are not studied in these bioassays for instance bio transformation products of carbamazepine were found to have a higher genotoxicity potential than carbamazepine however these products were effectively removed during ozonation brezina et al 2017 although the low observed acute toxic effects hampered the evaluation of individual bo3b process steps in toxicity reduction the combination of ozonation with a subsequent biological treatment i e sand filtration was found to effectively reduce toxicity stalter et al 2010 nevertheless further ecotoxicological investigations are recommended as pharmaceuticals and their transformation products formed during biological and ozone treatment can pose diverse ecotoxicological risks luo et al 2014 3 8 costs and energy demand production costs of ozone represent 20 40 of the total costs for large scale ozonation installations and range depending on the energy price and the system requirements between 1 4 and 2 5 kg o3 xylem water solutions netherlands b v 2018 the bo3b process operated at an ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and hrt of 1 46 h effectively removed pharmaceuticals in this study moreover 38 toc removal was achieved during biological treatment prior to ozonation i e br1 therefore the costs for ozone production in the bo3b process are 0 005 m3 considering a secondary clarified effluent with an average toc concentration of 17 3 mg l thereby the total costs for ozonation investment and operational costs are estimated to be 0 03 m3 the investment and operational costs for biological pre and post treatment i e br1 and br2 respectively are hypothesized to be smaller or equal to the costs for ozonation as the operational costs of sand filters is known to be low the total costs for additional treatment by the bo3b process are therefore estimated to be 0 06 m3 these costs are on the lower end of the costs estimated by joss et al 2008 who reported the additional investment and operational costs for ozonation and post filtration to be 0 05 0 15 m3 depending on the wwtp size and doc concentration according to the dutch water authorities the investment and operational costs for conventional wastewater treatment excluding sewer transport costs in the netherlands are 0 45 m3 unie van waterschappen 2015 thus the additional costs for bo3b treatment are less than 15 of the total treatment costs in addition the yearly average wastewater treatment tariff is 55 69 per population equivalent unie van waterschappen 2015 based on the 0 06 m3 for bo3b treatment the yearly additional costs are estimated to be 5 per population equivalent which corresponds to a less than 10 tariff increase the energy requirements for ozone production are approximately 15 and 35 kwh kg o3 when manufactured from oxygen and air respectively fridman 2008 hence the energy demand is about 0 03 0 07 kwh m3 together with the energy demand of pumps and other equipment the total demand is estimated to be 0 1 0 15 kwh m3 which corresponds well with literature estimations of 0 1 0 3 kwh m3 joss et al 2008 the energy demand for conventional wastewater treatment in the netherlands is about 0 39 kwh m3 of which 0 17 kwh m3 is needed for aeration unie van waterschappen 2015 post treatment by a bo3b process would therefore increase the energy consumption by approximately 25 38 overall this study demonstrates that even for secondary clarified effluents with high toc levels ozonation can be a cost effective treatment process when combined with biological pre and post treatment steps i e the bo3b process therefore bo3b treatment is found an effective process for the reduction of emission of potentially harmful compounds into the aquatic environment 4 conclusions the combination of biological treatment and ozonation in the designed three step bo3b process is found an effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluent with high toc concentrations ozonation and biological treatment are complementary processes targeting different pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical removal over the bo3b process exceeded 85 except for metoprolol 60 at a low ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc and an hrt of 1 46 h in the biological reactors carbamazepine that persisted during biological treatment was completely ozonated at increased ozone doses of 0 4 g o3 g toc whereas at a dose of 0 1 g o3 g toc it showed low removal 40 easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine gemfibrozil ibuprofen naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were 95 removed by biological treatment at hrts of 0 47 and 1 46 h at the lowest tested hrt of 0 3 h these pharmaceuticals were incompletely removed 35 95 the input of absolute amounts of ozone was effectively reduced by the elimination of toc over the first biological step i e br1 at hrts of 1 46 0 47 and 0 3 h a decrease in toc concentration was found over br1of respectively 38 31 and 19 resulting in a proportional reduction of ozone in the subsequent ozone reactor i e o3r no appreciable acute toxicity towards d magna p subcapitata and v fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual bo3b reactors however further ecotoxicological investigations are suggested the secondary clarified effluent contains sufficient nutrients and trace elements to support biological pharmaceutical removal costs associated to bo3b treatment are estimated to increase the current treatment costs for conventional wastewater treatment by 15 the yearly tariff per population equivalent for wastewater treatment in a country like the netherlands is estimated to increase by less than 10 the energy demand for wastewater treatment is expected to increase by 25 38 overall the bo3b process is a cost effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents

19597,the electro peroxone e peroxone process is an emerging ozone based advanced oxidation process aop that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement in water treatment to evaluate its

micropollutants ibuprofen clofibric acid and chloramphenicol were abated only by 32 68 68 91 and 73 90 during conventional ozonation of the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively by electro generating h2o2 or applying uv irradiation to enhance o3 transformation to oh during ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes similarly enhanced the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants by 15 43 5 15 and 5 10 in the groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively in addition the e peroxone and uv o3 processes significantly reduced bromate formation during the treatment of the three waters compared to conventional ozonation due to its higher efficiency the e peroxone process reduced 10 53 of the energy consumption required to abate the concentration of chloramphenicol the most ozone resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters by 1 order of magnitude in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation in contrast the uv o3 process consumed approximately 4 10 times higher energy than conventional ozonation this pilot scale study demonstrates that the e peroxone process can provide a

von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation is a well established technology in drinking water treatment and has been increasingly used in wastewater treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 historically ozonation is mainly used for disinfection purposes in drinking water and wastewater treatment however recent studies have shown that ozonation can also substantially abate a broad range of micropollutants in waters at sufficient cost effectiveness eggen et al 2014 hollender et al 2009 katsoyiannis et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 pisarenko et al 2012 santiago morales et al 2013 therefore there are growing interests in applying ozonation for micropollutant mitigation in drinking water and wastewater treatment for instance ozonation as well as powered activated carbon pac adsorption have been recommended as two feasible advanced treatment options for upgrading wastewater treatment plants to reduce the discharge of micropollutants in the aquatic environment by the swiss authorities eggen et al 2014 soltermann et al 2016 ozone o3 is a highly selective oxidant and reacts quickly with organics with activated double bonds such as activated aromatic rings deprotonated amines and reduced sulfur groups von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore micropollutants with such moieties can usually be efficiently abated in a variety of water matrices e g

reactivity ko3 ranging from 0 1 m 1 s 1 to 6 8 105 m 1 s 1 were selected as model micropollutants and spiked in the selected water matrices the effects of o3 doses applied currents and hydraulic residence times on micropollutant abatement bromate formation and energy efficiency were evaluated for these processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents diclofenac naproxen gemfibrozil bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid chloramphenicol and p chlorobenzoic acid p cba with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich the properties of these compounds are listed in table 1 bromide solutions were purchased from the fluka company usa all other chemicals e g sodium thiosulfate were analytical grade and from modern eastern fine chemical beijing china all solutions e g stock solutions of micropollutants and electrolyte solutions were prepared with milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω 2 2 sample collection and preparation the groundwater used in this study was obtained in the northwest suburb of beijing the surface water was collected from a reservoir in the north suburb of beijing both the groundwater and surface water are used as potable water sources for drinking water treatment plants in beijing the secondary wastewater effluent was collected from the outlet of secondary clarifiers of a wwtp in beijing which employed conventional activated sludge process to treat municipal wastewater the main water quality parameters are summarized in table 2 all water samples were tested within one week after collection for the pilot scale treatment note that the background concentrations of model micropollutants in these selected water matrices were very low 1 μg l in addition the background bromide concentrations were also low 46 μg l 13 μg l and 24 μg l in the groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively to better quantitatively evaluate micropollutant abatement and bromate formation appropriate volumes of micropollutant and bromide stock solutions were spiked into the three waters to achieve an initial concentration of 150 μg l for each micropollutant and 150 180 μg l for bromide before they were tested for the pilot scale treatments 2 3 conventional ozonation e peroxone and uv o3 treatment the pilot system developed in this study had three identical parallel column reactors r1 r2 and r3 which were used for conventional ozonation e peroxone and uv o3 treatment respectively see fig 1 the effective volume of each column was 9 4 l 10 cm i d 120 cm height the selected water was continuously fed into the bottom of the reactors and discharged at the top to evaluate the effects of hydraulic residence time hrt the flow rate was adjusted between 28 l h and 113 l h during the experiments which correspond to a hrt of 5 and 20 min in the reactor ozone containing oxygen o2 o3 gas was produced from a pure oxygen feed gas 99 9 using an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada and then continuously sparged into the reactor bottom at a constant flow rate of 0 2 l min using a fine bubble diffuser the ozone concentration in the sparged gas could be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power and flow rate to enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants relatively high specific ozone doses 1 0 2 0 mg o3 mg doc applied ozone dose relative to the background doc of the water matrices without including the doc of spiked micropollutants were applied during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the various waters during conventional ozonation only o2 o3 gas sparging was applied in the reactor r1 for the e peroxone treatment a pair of electrodes were vertically installed at 2 cm above the gas diffuser in the reactor r2 the anode was a ruo2 iro2 coated ti plate 6 cm 6 cm 0 2 cm and the cathode was a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon ptfe electrode 6 6 cm2 prepared according to wang et al 2012 the distance between the anode and cathode was 1 cm during the e peroxone treatment a constant current 50 200 ma was applied to electrochemically produce h2o2 at the cathode while the o2 o3 gas was sparged in the same way as in conventional ozonation for the uv o3 process a low pressure mercury arc lamp heraeus noblelight model g36t5l 4 emitting primarily 254 nm uv was installed axially inside the reactor r3 and turned on simultaneously with o2 o3 gas sparging duplicates were conducted for each experiments the relative standard deviations were shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 analytical methods during experiments the gas phase o3 concentrations at the gas inlet and outlet of the reactors were monitored using ozone analyzers bmt 964 ozone systems technology international inc germany the transfer efficiency of ozone was calculated according to the difference between ozone gas concentrations at the gas inlet and outlet of the reactor during the treatment and found to be 90 for all experiments see si fig s1 for more information therefore the applied ozone dose was approximately equal to the transferred ozone dose solution samples were taken at the outlet of the reactor aqueous ozone in the solutions was analyzed with the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 bromide and bromate concentrations were measured using an ion chromatograph metrohm 761 compact ic yao et al 2017 micropollutants in the samples were analyzed with an ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent lc1290 qqq6460 agilent according to the protocol described elsewhere yao et al 2016 oh exposures during the treatment of various waters by the three processes were back calculated from the abatement efficiencies of p cba eq 4 elovitz and von gunten 1999 note that p cba has a very low reactivity with o3 and does not absorb uv light at 254 nm and therefore is abated almost exclusively by oh oxidation during the three processes elovitz and von gunten 1999 frangos et al 2016 however o3 exposures were not measured in this study due to the difficulty to follow o3 evolutions in continuous flow ozone reactors hollender et al 2009 zucker et al 2016 4 o h d t l n p c b a p c b a 0 k o h 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment of groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent 3 1 1 micropollutant abatement the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by conventional ozonation the e peroxone with varying currents of 50 200 ma and uv o3 treatment of the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent are shown in fig 2 the three waters had an initial ph of 8 0 8 2 which stayed constants 0 1 fluctuation during the three processes as the pka of all spiked micropollutants are well below 6 or above 9 table 1 their apparent rate constants with o3 ko3 will not change considerably in the typical ph range 7 8 5 of drinking water and wastewater treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for simplicity micropollutants are classified into three groups according to their apparent second order rate constants for the reaction with o3 at ph 8 see table 1 i ozone reactive k o3 104 m 1 s 1 ii ozone moderately reactive 50 m 1 s 1 k o3 104 m 1 s 1 and iii ozone resistant k o3 50 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2013 with a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac naproxen and gemfibrozil were almost completely abated in the various water matrices by all three processes fig 2 this finding is consistent with the general observations that ozone reactive can usually be sufficiently abated via direct oxidation with o3 during conventional ozonation and ozone based aops with even lower specific o3 doses e g 0 5 mg o3 mg doc hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2003 lee et al 2013 pisarenko et al 2012 rosal et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition due to the relatively high specific ozone dose applied in this study ozone moderately reactive micropollutant bezafibrate was also effectively abated 90 abatement in all experiments in contrast ozone resistant micropollutants ibuprofen clofibric acid p cba and chloramphenicol were less effectively abated by the three processes fig 2 due to their low reactivity with o3 ozone resistant micropollutants are abated almost exclusively by oh oxidation during ozonation lee et al 2013 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2018 with the applied specific ozone dose 1 5 mg o3 mg doc conventional ozonation abated the concentrations of the ozone resistant micropollutants by 32 68 68 91 and 73 90 in the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively these results suggest that the quantity of oh generated in the three waters are very different during conventional ozonation for a given water matrix the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants decreased generally in the same order of their oh rate constant ibuprofen clofibric acid p cba chloramphenicol see table 1 which highlights the important role of oh for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement by applying a current 50 200 ma to electro generate h2o2 or incorporating uv irradiation during ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes enhanced the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants to various extent in the three water matrices the most significant enhancement was observed in the groundwater where the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants were increased by approximately 22 43 during the e peroxone current 100 200 ma and uv o3 processes compared to conventional ozonation fig 2a nevertheless the abatement efficiencies were increased only moderately by 10 15 in the surface water fig 2b and marginally generally 10 in the secondary wastewater effluent fig 2c during the e peroxone 100 200 ma and uv o3 processes compared to conventional ozonation the results shown in fig 2 indicate that the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone or uv o3 processes does not considerably influence the abatements of ozone reactive and moderately ozone reactive micropollutants but can enhance the abatements of ozone resistant micropollutants to various extent in the three waters groundwater surface water secondary wastewater effluent these observations can be mainly attributed to the fact that the electro generation of h2o2 or uv irradiation enhanced o3 transformation to oh more significantly in the groundwater and surface water than in the secondary wastewater effluent see fig 3 as shown in fig 3 for the same applied specific ozone dose 1 5 mg o3 mg doc which corresponds to an ozone dose of approximately 2 4 mg l 4 6 mg l and 9 3 mg l for the groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively significantly lower residual o3 concentrations were detected at the reactor outlet during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the three waters than during conventional ozonation for the groundwater and surface water which had a low dom content and thus relatively high ozone stability only 66 and 72 of the applied ozone dose were transformed i e consumed in the reactor during conventional ozonation hrt 20 min see fig 3a and b inset in comparison due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by electro generated h2o2 or uv irradiation the degree of ozone transformation was increased to 95 during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the groundwater and surface water with the exception of the e peroxone process at the smallest current of 50 ma in contrast to the groundwater and surface water the secondary wastewater effluent had a much higher dom content table 2 moreover the specific ultraviolet absorbance of the secondary wastewater effluent 2 04 l mg m was significantly higher than that of the groundwater and surface water 0 86 and 1 24 l mg m respectively this difference indicates that the dom in the secondary wastewater effluent had a considerably higher fraction of uv absorbing moieties e g aromatics and olefins which are usually also ozone reactive moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the high dom content and its high ozone reactivity almost complete transformation of the applied ozone dose 96 transformation could be achieved during conventional ozonation of the secondary wastewater effluent fig 3c inset therefore the application of h2o2 electro generation and uv irradiation would not further substantially enhance o3 transformation during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent besides enhancing the degree of ozone transformation the reaction of h2o2 with o3 or uv photolysis of o3 can produce oh with a theoretical yield i e mole of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed of approximately 50 and 67 according to the stoichiometry of eqs 2 and 5 respectively fischbacher et al 2013 legrini et al 1993 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 these values are generally higher than those from o3 decomposition with oh generating water matrix constituents e g 24 43 for phenols 8 17 for alkoxybenzenes and 15 for tertiary amines flyunt et al 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the higher degrees of o3 transformation as well as the higher oh yields from o3 decomposition with h2o2 or uv photolysis oh exposures were considerably increased by 155 206 in the groundwater and 65 74 in the surface water during the e peroxone and uv o3 process compared to conventional ozonation fig 4 correspondingly the abatements of ozone resistant micropollutants were evidently enhanced during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the groundwater and surface water compared to conventional ozonation fig 2a and b 5 3 o 3 h v 2 o h however due to the fast decomposition of o3 with the dom in the secondary wastewater effluent the electro generation of h2o2 or uv irradiation enhanced the oh exposures only by 11 40 during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the wastewater compared to conventional ozonation fig 4 consequently the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants were only marginally enhanced generally 10 this is with the exception of chloramphenicol whose abatement efficiencies was increased by 15 during the uv o3 process due to its high uv reactivity fig 2c the overall results shown above indicate that the e peroxone and uv o3 processes can more significantly enhance o3 transformation to oh and thus improve the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants during the treatment of water matrices that have relatively high ozone stability than that have low ozone stability these results agree well with the general findings of previous studies on conventional ozonation and ozone based aops such as the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process acero and von gunten 2001 lee et al 2013 nothe et al 2009 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von gunten et al 1996 wang et al 2018 for instance a full scale study in drinking water treatment plants showed that for the same applied ozone dose 1 6 mg l the addition of h2o2 resulted in much lower o3 residual concentration at the reactor outlet during the conventional o3 h2o2 treatment of a surface water than during conventional ozonation 0 1 mg l vs 0 65 mg l von gunten et al 1996 due to the higher degree of ozone transformation 94 vs 59 the conventional o3 h2o2 process considerably increased the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant pesticide atrazine compared to conventional ozonation 75 vs 42 von gunten et al 1996 in contrast the addition of h2o2 or uv irradiation usually does not significantly enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants during wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2011 hubner et al 2015 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 3 1 2 energy efficiency for micropollutant abatement electrical energy per order eeo i e the electrical energy demand to abate a pollutant concentration by 1 order in 1 m3 of water is a useful figure of merit for comparing the energy efficiency of different treatment systems bolton et al 2001 the eeo values for the abatement of diclofenac bezafibrate and chloramphenicol as a model for ozone reactive moderately reactive and resistant micropollutant respectively in the three waters by conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes are calculated according to eqs 6 8 respectively and compared in fig 5 see si table s2 for the eeo values for all micropollutants 6 e e o o 3 0 06 r c o 3 q o 3 q l o g c i c e 7 e e o e p 0 06 r c o 3 q o 3 i u q l o g c i c e 8 e e o u v o 3 0 06

41 w note that eqs 6 8 implicitly assume first order kinetics for micropollutant abatement bolton et al 2001 for micropollutants whose abatement efficiency was below 90 during the treatments eeo value is based on extrapolation pisarenko et al 2012 compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 process resulted in higher eeo values for the abatement of diclofenac and bezafibrate in the three water matrices fig 5 these increases can be attributed to the fact that high abatement efficiencies of diclofenac and bezafibrate generally 95 could already be obtained during conventional ozonation of the three waters fig 2 therefore the e peroxone or uv o3 processes cannot further substantially enhance their abatement efficiencies but cost extra energy for h2o2 electro generation or uv irradiation fig 5 in contrast due to the enhanced abatements of ozone resistant micropollutants the e peroxone process reduced the eeo values for their abatements compared to conventional ozonation fig 5 for the tested current range 50 200 ma the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement were reduced by 30 53 and 10 16 during the e peroxone treatment of the groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent respectively compared to conventional ozonation fig 5a and c in addition when a current of 50 100 ma was applied during the e peroxone treatment of the surface water the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement was also 10 lower than that of conventional ozonation fig 5b however due to the low conductivity of the surface water 299 μs cm the cell voltage and thus energy consumption for h2o2 electro generation increased considerably as the currents were increased beyond 100 ma see si table s1 which resulted in a considerable increase in the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement by the e peroxone process similar to the e peroxone process the uv o3 process also enhanced the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants compared to conventional ozonation fig 2 however the eeo values for the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants were approximately 4 10 times higher for the uv o3 process than for conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process see fig 5 and si table s2 these data are consistent with the general conclusions of many previous studies that due to the high energy demand for uv irradiation uv based technologies e g uv photolysis and uv h2o2 process usually are less energy efficient than ozone based processes e g ozonation and o3 h2o2 in terms of micropollutant abatements katsoyiannis et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 santiago morales et al 2013 notably increasing the applied currents beyond 100 ma resulted in an evident increase in the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement especially during the e peroxone treatment of the groundwater and surface water fig 5 these trends can be possibly attributed to the fact that with an applied current of 100 ma the applied o3 doses were already completely transformed during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters fig 3a c therefore further increasing the applied currents above 100 ma could not further substantially enhance the degree of o3 transformation to oh fig 4 and thus the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants fig 2 but cost more energy for h2o2 electro generation moreover fig 6 shows that when a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc was applied in the three water matrices bromate formation could be effectively inhibited to below detectable concentrations by applying 100 ma during the e peroxone process these results suggest that there is a marginal benefit associated with the production of higher h2o2 concentrations in the e peroxone system taking into account all aspects micropollutant abatement energy consumption and bromate control 100 ma appears to be an optimal current to be applied in the e peroxone process with a specific o3 dose of 1 5 mg l see si for more discussion on optimal current at varying applied o3 doses the overall results shown above indicate that larger amounts of energy are required to abate ozone resistant micropollutants than ozone reactive ones in a water matrix by conventional ozonation and ozone based aops therefore if the objective of water treatment is to effectively abate most micropollutants rather than only ozone reactive ones in a water matrix the energy demand for the water treatment will be determined by the most resistant ones si fig s2 shows that despite the extra energy consumption for h2o2 electro generation the e peroxone process 100 ma actually consumed less energy for the abatement of micropollutants with k o3 100 m 1 s 1 i e ozone resistant micropollutants in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation in particular eeo for the abatement of chloramphenicol the most ozone resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters was reduced by 10 53 during the e peroxone 100 ma treatment of the three water matrices compared to conventional ozonation see fig 5 it is noted that the eeo values reported above are calculated based on the applied ozone doses due to the relatively high ozone stability of the groundwater and surface water the applied ozone doses were not completely consumed in the reactor during conventional ozonation of the two water matrices with a hrt of 20 min fig 3 theoretically higher hrt can be used to ensure that all transferred ozone is consumed in the reactor during water and wastewater treatments to compare the energy efficiency of the three processes under such hypothetical hrt conditions eeo values for micropollutant abatements are calculated based on the consumed ozone dose i e the applied ozone dose minus the residual ozone measured in the effluent of the reactor according to eqs s3 s4 and s5 and reported in si table s3 when conventional ozonation was changed to the e peroxone process 100 ma the eeo value for chloramphenicol abatement in the groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent was decreased by 34 0 197 vs 0 135 kwh m3 log and 14 0 317 vs 0 273 kwh m3 log respectively see si fig s3 however the eeo for chloramphenicol abatement in the surface water was slightly increased from 0 135 kwh m3 log for conventional ozonation to 0 147 kwh m3 log for the e peroxone process 50 ma this increase can be mainly attributed to the low conductivity of the selected surface water which results in high energy demand for h2o2 electro generation see si table s1 overall the results presented above clearly show that the e peroxone process can considerably reduce the energy consumption for the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants in the selected groundwater compared to conventional ozonation nevertheless the two processes seem to be comparably efficient in the selected surface water and secondary wastewater effluent when considering all uncertainty inherent in the eeo calculations bolton et al 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 3 1 3 bromate formation fig 6 shows the concentrations of br and bro3 detected at the reactor outlets during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the three water matrices for the applied specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc a considerable fraction 18 34 of the spiked br was transformed to bro3 during conventional ozonation of the three waters consequently the bromate concentrations in the ozonation effluents were much higher than the drinking water standard for bromate 10 μg l equivalent to 0 078 μm in contrast bromate formation was not observed during most experiments of the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the three waters except for the uv o3 treatment of the surface water and the e peroxone treatment of the surface water and secondary wastewater effluent with the lowest current 50 ma these observations are consistent with the previous findings that for an equivalent ozone dose significantly less bromate will be formed during the treatment of bromide containing water by the e peroxone and uv o3 processes compared to conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 this improvement can be mainly attributed to a combined result of a the h2o2 or uv induced low o3 residual concentrations see fig 3a c and b the quenching of hobr by h2o2 in situ generated during the e peroxone and uv o3 processes as discussed below as shown in fig 3d f h2o2 residual concentrations detected at the reactor outlet increased progressively with increasing the applied currents during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters this trend can be attributed to the acceleration of h2o2 electro generation at higher currents li et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the increase of h2o2 concentrations can in turn enhance both the decomposition of o3 eq 2 and the quenching of hobr eq 3 which is an important intermediate in bromate formation during ozone based processes li et al 2015 von gunten and oliveras 1997 yao et al 2017 consequently bromate formation could be more effectively inhibited as the applied currents were increased during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters fig 6 similar to the e peroxone process the uv o3 process can also produce h2o2 in situ from uv photolysis of o3 legrini et al 1993 under the tested conditions 0 17 0 47 mg l of h2o2 was detected at the reactor outlet during the uv o3 treatment of the three waters fig 3d f these concentrations are slightly lower than those detected during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters with the smallest current of 50 ma see fig 3d f it seems that such low h2o2 concentrations cannot sufficiently inhibit bromate formation during the uv o3 treatment of the surface water therefore 0 28 μm 35 8 μg l bromate was detected in its effluent fig 6b ozone doses have a significant effect on bromate formation as shown in si fig s14 bromate concentration at the reactor outlet increased significantly from 0 119 μm 15 2 μg l to 0 864 μm 110 6 μg l as the specific ozone was increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mg o3 mg doc during conventional ozonation of the selected surface water moreover although bromate was not detected in the reactor effluent when a specific ozone of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc was applied in the uv o3 process its concentration increased to 0 28 0 47 μm 35 8 60 1 μg l with increasing the specific ozone dose to 1 5 2 0 mg o3 mg doc in contrast by adjusting applied currents 50 200 ma during the e peroxone process bromate formation could be effectively suppressed below the drinking water standard for all specific ozone doses tested in this study 1 0 2 0 mg o3 mg doc in routine drinking water or wastewater treatment specific ozone doses are typically in the order of 0 5 1 0 mg o3 mg doc von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 zucker et al 2016 previous studies have suggested that bromate formation is usually not a major concern when specific ozone doses of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc are applied in conventional ozonation pisarenko et al 2012 von gunten 2003b zimmermann et al 2011 however bromate formation may become a problem when high specific ozone doses e g 1 5 mg o3 mg doc are required in conventional ozonation to enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants bourgin et al 2017 soltermann et al 2017 yao et al 2017 the results of this pilot scale study confirm that by in situ generating h2o2 the e peroxone process can offer a simple and convenient way to mitigate bromate formation during the treatment of bromide containing water in agreement with the previous finding from bench scale studies yao et al 2017 3 2 effect of hydraulic residence time on groundwater treatment 3 2 1 micropollutant abatement the effect of hydraulic residence time hrt on micropollutant abatement in the selected groundwater was shown in fig 7 for ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac naproxen and gemfibrozil varying the hrts between 5 min and 20 min did not considerably change their abatement efficiencies during the three processes fig 7 this observation can be attributed to the fact that ozone reactive micropollutants can be sufficiently abated within short contact time with o3 huber et al 2003 pisarenko et al 2012 rosal et al 2010 yao et al 2016 therefore a short hrt of 5 min is sufficient for their elimination in contrast hrt had distinctly different effects on the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes during conventional ozonation the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen clofibric acid and chloramphenicol increased generally with increasing the hrts especially from 5 min to 10 min see fig 7a however similar abatement efficiencies were obtained for these micropollutants at the varying hrts during the e peroxone process fig 7b for the uv o3 process the abatement efficiencies of uv reactive clofibric acid and chloramphenicol increased with increasing the hrts while the abatement of uv resistant ibuprofen and p cba did not change considerably with the hrts fig 7c during conventional ozonation o3 residual concentrations detected at the reactor outlet decreased from 1 19 mg l to 0 95 mg l with increasing the hrts from 5 min to 10 min si fig s4a due to the increased degree of ozone transformation 51 at 5 min and 61 at 10 min oh exposure increased from 0 07 10 9 to 0 11 10 9 m s as the hrts were increased from 5 min to 10 min however further increasing the hrts to 20 min only marginally increased the degree of o3 transformation 65 and thus the oh exposures 0 13 10 9 m s si fig s5 consequently the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants increased evidently as the hrts were increased from 5 min to 10 min but then did not change significantly on account of the experimental and analytical errors with further increasing the hrt to 20 min during conventional ozonation these observations indicate that due to the high ozone stability in the groundwater hrt of 5 20 min is too low to efficiently utilize the applied ozone dose for micropollutant abatement during conventional ozonation with increasing the hrt more transferred ozone could be consumed in the reactor which in turn increased the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants during conventional ozonation see si fig s6 for the abatement efficiency of micropollutants as a function of consumed specific ozone doses in the presence of electro generated h2o2 or uv irradiation o3 transformation was significantly accelerated during the e peroxone and uv o3 processes as shown in si fig s4 90 of the applied ozone dose could be transformed within 5 min of the e peroxone and uv o3 processes therefore extending hrts beyond 5 min would not further substantially enhance the degree of o3 transformation to oh and thus the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants this is with the exception of uv reactive micropollutants clofibric acid and chloramphenicol during the uv o3 process due to the enhanced direct photolysis at higher hrts their abatement efficiencies were increased by 10 with increasing the hrts from 5 min to 20 min during the uv o3 process fig 7c in general the above results indicate that due to the h2o2 or uv induced enhancement of o3 transformation to oh higher abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants can be obtained in shorter hrts during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the selected groundwater compared to conventional ozonation this feature may be of importance for water utilities under certain conditions e g during storm periods or emergency episodes when shorter hrts than those for routine operations are required to deal with the increased flow rates hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 3 2 2 energy efficiency for micropollutant abatements as the hrts were increased from 5 min to 20 min the energy demand required to abate the concentrations of chloramphenicol the most ozone resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters by 1 order of magnitude decreased for conventional ozonation but increased for the e peroxone and uv o3 processes see fig 8 and si fig s7 for eeo values calculated based on the applied and consumed ozone doses respectively this difference suggests that hrt has different effects on the energy efficiency of micropollutant abatement by the three processes the decrease in the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement during conventional ozonation can be explained by the increased abatement efficiencies of chloramphenicol at higher hrts fig 7c in contrast extending the hrts beyond 5 min did not considerably increase the abatement efficiencies of chloramphenicol during the e peroxone and uv o3 processes but cost more energy for h2o2 electro generation and uv irradiation therefore the energy demand for micropollutant abatements increased with increasing the hrts during the two aops overall the data shown in fig 8 indicate that under the tested conditions a minimum energy demand of 0 300 0 135 and 0 917 kwh m3 were required to achieve 90 abatement of the concentration of chloramphenicol in the groundwater by conventional ozonation hrt 20 min the e peroxone hrt 5 min and uv o3 hrt 5 min processes respectively these data indicate that among the three processes tested in this study the e peroxone process is the most energy efficient for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement in the groundwater 3 3 implications of the e peroxone process for water and wastewater treatment the results presented here demonstrate that by installing electrodes in an ozone reactor to electrochemically produce h2o2 during ozonation the e peroxone process can improve the performance of water and wastewater treatment in many aspects compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone process can enhance the efficiencies and reduce the energy consumption for ozone resistant micropollutant abatements especially during the treatment of water matrices that have relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater with low dom and high carbonate contents in addition hrts required for micropollutant abatements can be considerably shortened during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation furthermore bromate formation can be effectively inhibited during the treatment of bromide containing water by the e peroxone process although some results reported in this study e g the exact values of abatement efficiency and eeo would be strictly related to the system configurations e g the volume type and geometry of the reacting system used in this study the general findings of this pilot scale study e g enhanced abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants and reduced bromate formation agree well with the results of previous bench scale studies wang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 2017 this agreement confirms that the beneficial effects reported previously in the bench scale studies could also be achieved in real ozone reactors and thus verify the applicability of the e peroxone process for practical applications based on the promising results a kinetic analysis will be performed in a further step to better guide the designing and operation of the e peroxone system for micropollutant abatement in general the results observed herein for the e peroxone process are similar to the previous findings reported for the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process acero and von gunten 2001 hubner et al 2015 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 rosal et al 2008 von gunten et al 1996 wang et al 2018 however unlike the conventional peroxone process which requires the addition of h2o2 stocks the e peroxone process can produce h2o2 in situ using o2 that would otherwise be wasted during conventional ozonation the market price for h2o2 stocks is 1 0 2 0 usd kg barazesh et al 2015 campos martin et al 2006 which is equivalent to 15 2 30 3 kwh kg h2o2 based on the electricity cost of 0 066 usd kwh useia 2016 in comparison h2o2 can be in situ produced with an energy consumption of 5 62 18 18 kwh kg h2o2 when a current of 50 100 ma was applied during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters see si table s1 therefore the e peroxone process can not only avoid the risks associated with the transportation storage and handling of concentrated h2o2 stocks for the conventional peroxone process but also reduce the energy cost compared with the more traditional peroxone process the e peroxone process can thus offer a more convenient energy efficient and safer alternative for water and wastewater treatment however it should be noted that due to the shortened lifetime of o3 by electro generated h2o2 disinfection efficiency might be reduced in the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation as has been reported for the conventional peroxone process von gunten 2003b this is undesired for drinking water treatment especially in the areas where disinfection is mainly achieved with ozonation other than with chlorination or uv rosario ortiz et al 2016 a possible solution to this problem is to initiate the electro generation of h2o2 at a later stage of conventional ozonation after sufficient disinfection has been obtained i e conventional ozonation followed by the e peroxone process this strategy has been successfully applied in the conventional peroxone process to maintain sufficient disinfection efficiency and reduce bromate formation during drinking water treatment katsoyiannis et al 2011 4 conclusions the results of this pilot scale study demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of the e peroxone process for micropollutant abatements and bromate control in water treatment by electro generating h2o2 during ozonation the e peroxone process considerably enhanced o3 transformation to oh within typical hrts of ozone reactor during the treatment of the selected groundwater and surface water therefore for the same applied ozone doses substantially higher abatement efficiencies could be obtained for ozone resistant micropollutants within shorter hrts during the e peroxone treatment of the groundwater and surface water than during conventional ozonation however due to the fast decomposition of o3 in wastewater the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process only marginally enhanced the degree of o3 transformation and thus the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants during the treatment of secondary wastewater effluent besides enhancing micropollutant abatements the e peroxone process significantly reduced bromate formation to below the bromate drinking water standard during the treatment of the various water matrices compared conventional ozonation furthermore due to the enhanced oh production the e peroxone process reduced the energy required to abate ozone resistant micropollutants in the various water matrices compared to conventional ozonation in contrast while the uv o3 process could also similarly enhance ozone resistant micropollutants and reduce bromate formation compared to conventional ozonation it consumed significantly higher energy than conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process overall this pilot scale study indicates that the e peroxone process can provide an effective and energy efficient option for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in drinking water and wastewater treatment

19597,the electro peroxone e peroxone process is an emerging ozone based advanced oxidation process aop that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement in water treatment to evaluate its performance under more realistic conditions of water treatment a continuous flow pilot e peroxone system was developed and compared with conventional ozonation and a uv o3 process for micropollutant abatements in various water matrices groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent in this study with a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with ozone o3 diclofenac naproxen gemfibrozil and bezafibrate could be sufficiently abated 90 abatement in the various waters by all three processes however ozone resistant micropollutants ibuprofen clofibric acid and chloramphenicol were abated only by 32 68 68 91 and 73 90 during conventional ozonation of the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively by electro generating h2o2 or applying uv irradiation to enhance o3 transformation to oh during ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes similarly enhanced the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants by 15 43 5 15 and 5 10 in the groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively in addition the e peroxone and uv o3 processes significantly reduced bromate formation during the treatment of the three waters compared to conventional ozonation due to its higher efficiency the e peroxone process reduced 10 53 of the energy consumption required to abate the concentration of chloramphenicol the most ozone resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters by 1 order of magnitude in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation in contrast the uv o3 process consumed approximately 4 10 times higher energy than conventional ozonation this pilot scale study demonstrates that the e peroxone process can provide a

von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation is a well established technology in drinking water treatment and has been increasingly used in wastewater treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 historically ozonation is mainly used for disinfection purposes in drinking water and wastewater treatment however recent studies have shown that ozonation can also substantially abate a broad range of micropollutants in waters at sufficient cost effectiveness eggen et al 2014 hollender et al 2009 katsoyiannis et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 pisarenko et al 2012 santiago morales et al 2013 therefore there are growing interests in applying ozonation for micropollutant mitigation in drinking water and wastewater treatment for instance ozonation as well as powered activated carbon pac adsorption have been recommended as two feasible advanced treatment options for upgrading wastewater treatment plants to reduce the discharge of micropollutants in the aquatic environment by the swiss authorities eggen et al 2014 soltermann et al 2016 ozone o3 is a highly selective oxidant and reacts quickly with organics with activated double bonds such as activated aromatic rings deprotonated amines and reduced sulfur groups von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore micropollutants with such moieties can usually be efficiently abated in a variety of water matrices e g

reactivity ko3 ranging from 0 1 m 1 s 1 to 6 8 105 m 1 s 1 were selected as model micropollutants and spiked in the selected water matrices the effects of o3 doses applied currents and hydraulic residence times on micropollutant abatement bromate formation and energy efficiency were evaluated for these processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents diclofenac naproxen gemfibrozil bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid chloramphenicol and p chlorobenzoic acid p cba with purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich the properties of these compounds are listed in table 1 bromide solutions were purchased from the fluka company usa all other chemicals e g sodium thiosulfate were analytical grade and from modern eastern fine chemical beijing china all solutions e g stock solutions of micropollutants and electrolyte solutions were prepared with milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω 2 2 sample collection and preparation the groundwater used in this study was obtained in the northwest suburb of beijing the surface water was collected from a reservoir in the north suburb of beijing both the groundwater and surface water are used as potable water sources for drinking water treatment plants in beijing the secondary wastewater effluent was collected from the outlet of secondary clarifiers of a wwtp in beijing which employed conventional activated sludge process to treat municipal wastewater the main water quality parameters are summarized in table 2 all water samples were tested within one week after collection for the pilot scale treatment note that the background concentrations of model micropollutants in these selected water matrices were very low 1 μg l in addition the background bromide concentrations were also low 46 μg l 13 μg l and 24 μg l in the groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively to better quantitatively evaluate micropollutant abatement and bromate formation appropriate volumes of micropollutant and bromide stock solutions were spiked into the three waters to achieve an initial concentration of 150 μg l for each micropollutant and 150 180 μg l for bromide before they were tested for the pilot scale treatments 2 3 conventional ozonation e peroxone and uv o3 treatment the pilot system developed in this study had three identical parallel column reactors r1 r2 and r3 which were used for conventional ozonation e peroxone and uv o3 treatment respectively see fig 1 the effective volume of each column was 9 4 l 10 cm i d 120 cm height the selected water was continuously fed into the bottom of the reactors and discharged at the top to evaluate the effects of hydraulic residence time hrt the flow rate was adjusted between 28 l h and 113 l h during the experiments which correspond to a hrt of 5 and 20 min in the reactor ozone containing oxygen o2 o3 gas was produced from a pure oxygen feed gas 99 9 using an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada and then continuously sparged into the reactor bottom at a constant flow rate of 0 2 l min using a fine bubble diffuser the ozone concentration in the sparged gas could be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power and flow rate to enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants relatively high specific ozone doses 1 0 2 0 mg o3 mg doc applied ozone dose relative to the background doc of the water matrices without including the doc of spiked micropollutants were applied during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the various waters during conventional ozonation only o2 o3 gas sparging was applied in the reactor r1 for the e peroxone treatment a pair of electrodes were vertically installed at 2 cm above the gas diffuser in the reactor r2 the anode was a ruo2 iro2 coated ti plate 6 cm 6 cm 0 2 cm and the cathode was a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon ptfe electrode 6 6 cm2 prepared according to wang et al 2012 the distance between the anode and cathode was 1 cm during the e peroxone treatment a constant current 50 200 ma was applied to electrochemically produce h2o2 at the cathode while the o2 o3 gas was sparged in the same way as in conventional ozonation for the uv o3 process a low pressure mercury arc lamp heraeus noblelight model g36t5l 4 emitting primarily 254 nm uv was installed axially inside the reactor r3 and turned on simultaneously with o2 o3 gas sparging duplicates were conducted for each experiments the relative standard deviations were shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 analytical methods during experiments the gas phase o3 concentrations at the gas inlet and outlet of the reactors were monitored using ozone analyzers bmt 964 ozone systems technology international inc germany the transfer efficiency of ozone was calculated according to the difference between ozone gas concentrations at the gas inlet and outlet of the reactor during the treatment and found to be 90 for all experiments see si fig s1 for more information therefore the applied ozone dose was approximately equal to the transferred ozone dose solution samples were taken at the outlet of the reactor aqueous ozone in the solutions was analyzed with the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 bromide and bromate concentrations were measured using an ion chromatograph metrohm 761 compact ic yao et al 2017 micropollutants in the samples were analyzed with an ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent lc1290 qqq6460 agilent according to the protocol described elsewhere yao et al 2016 oh exposures during the treatment of various waters by the three processes were back calculated from the abatement efficiencies of p cba eq 4 elovitz and von gunten 1999 note that p cba has a very low reactivity with o3 and does not absorb uv light at 254 nm and therefore is abated almost exclusively by oh oxidation during the three processes elovitz and von gunten 1999 frangos et al 2016 however o3 exposures were not measured in this study due to the difficulty to follow o3 evolutions in continuous flow ozone reactors hollender et al 2009 zucker et al 2016 4 o h d t l n p c b a p c b a 0 k o h 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment of groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent 3 1 1 micropollutant abatement the abatement efficiencies of micropollutants by conventional ozonation the e peroxone with varying currents of 50 200 ma and uv o3 treatment of the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent are shown in fig 2 the three waters had an initial ph of 8 0 8 2 which stayed constants 0 1 fluctuation during the three processes as the pka of all spiked micropollutants are well below 6 or above 9 table 1 their apparent rate constants with o3 ko3 will not change considerably in the typical ph range 7 8 5 of drinking water and wastewater treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for simplicity micropollutants are classified into three groups according to their apparent second order rate constants for the reaction with o3 at ph 8 see table 1 i ozone reactive k o3 104 m 1 s 1 ii ozone moderately reactive 50 m 1 s 1 k o3 104 m 1 s 1 and iii ozone resistant k o3 50 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2013 with a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac naproxen and gemfibrozil were almost completely abated in the various water matrices by all three processes fig 2 this finding is consistent with the general observations that ozone reactive can usually be sufficiently abated via direct oxidation with o3 during conventional ozonation and ozone based aops with even lower specific o3 doses e g 0 5 mg o3 mg doc hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2003 lee et al 2013 pisarenko et al 2012 rosal et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in addition due to the relatively high specific ozone dose applied in this study ozone moderately reactive micropollutant bezafibrate was also effectively abated 90 abatement in all experiments in contrast ozone resistant micropollutants ibuprofen clofibric acid p cba and chloramphenicol were less effectively abated by the three processes fig 2 due to their low reactivity with o3 ozone resistant micropollutants are abated almost exclusively by oh oxidation during ozonation lee et al 2013 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2018 with the applied specific ozone dose 1 5 mg o3 mg doc conventional ozonation abated the concentrations of the ozone resistant micropollutants by 32 68 68 91 and 73 90 in the selected groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively these results suggest that the quantity of oh generated in the three waters are very different during conventional ozonation for a given water matrix the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants decreased generally in the same order of their oh rate constant ibuprofen clofibric acid p cba chloramphenicol see table 1 which highlights the important role of oh for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement by applying a current 50 200 ma to electro generate h2o2 or incorporating uv irradiation during ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes enhanced the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants to various extent in the three water matrices the most significant enhancement was observed in the groundwater where the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants were increased by approximately 22 43 during the e peroxone current 100 200 ma and uv o3 processes compared to conventional ozonation fig 2a nevertheless the abatement efficiencies were increased only moderately by 10 15 in the surface water fig 2b and marginally generally 10 in the secondary wastewater effluent fig 2c during the e peroxone 100 200 ma and uv o3 processes compared to conventional ozonation the results shown in fig 2 indicate that the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone or uv o3 processes does not considerably influence the abatements of ozone reactive and moderately ozone reactive micropollutants but can enhance the abatements of ozone resistant micropollutants to various extent in the three waters groundwater surface water secondary wastewater effluent these observations can be mainly attributed to the fact that the electro generation of h2o2 or uv irradiation enhanced o3 transformation to oh more significantly in the groundwater and surface water than in the secondary wastewater effluent see fig 3 as shown in fig 3 for the same applied specific ozone dose 1 5 mg o3 mg doc which corresponds to an ozone dose of approximately 2 4 mg l 4 6 mg l and 9 3 mg l for the groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent respectively significantly lower residual o3 concentrations were detected at the reactor outlet during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the three waters than during conventional ozonation for the groundwater and surface water which had a low dom content and thus relatively high ozone stability only 66 and 72 of the applied ozone dose were transformed i e consumed in the reactor during conventional ozonation hrt 20 min see fig 3a and b inset in comparison due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by electro generated h2o2 or uv irradiation the degree of ozone transformation was increased to 95 during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the groundwater and surface water with the exception of the e peroxone process at the smallest current of 50 ma in contrast to the groundwater and surface water the secondary wastewater effluent had a much higher dom content table 2 moreover the specific ultraviolet absorbance of the secondary wastewater effluent 2 04 l mg m was significantly higher than that of the groundwater and surface water 0 86 and 1 24 l mg m respectively this difference indicates that the dom in the secondary wastewater effluent had a considerably higher fraction of uv absorbing moieties e g aromatics and olefins which are usually also ozone reactive moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the high dom content and its high ozone reactivity almost complete transformation of the applied ozone dose 96 transformation could be achieved during conventional ozonation of the secondary wastewater effluent fig 3c inset therefore the application of h2o2 electro generation and uv irradiation would not further substantially enhance o3 transformation during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent besides enhancing the degree of ozone transformation the reaction of h2o2 with o3 or uv photolysis of o3 can produce oh with a theoretical yield i e mole of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed of approximately 50 and 67 according to the stoichiometry of eqs 2 and 5 respectively fischbacher et al 2013 legrini et al 1993 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 these values are generally higher than those from o3 decomposition with oh generating water matrix constituents e g 24 43 for phenols 8 17 for alkoxybenzenes and 15 for tertiary amines flyunt et al 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 due to the higher degrees of o3 transformation as well as the higher oh yields from o3 decomposition with h2o2 or uv photolysis oh exposures were considerably increased by 155 206 in the groundwater and 65 74 in the surface water during the e peroxone and uv o3 process compared to conventional ozonation fig 4 correspondingly the abatements of ozone resistant micropollutants were evidently enhanced during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the groundwater and surface water compared to conventional ozonation fig 2a and b 5 3 o 3 h v 2 o h however due to the fast decomposition of o3 with the dom in the secondary wastewater effluent the electro generation of h2o2 or uv irradiation enhanced the oh exposures only by 11 40 during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the wastewater compared to conventional ozonation fig 4 consequently the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants were only marginally enhanced generally 10 this is with the exception of chloramphenicol whose abatement efficiencies was increased by 15 during the uv o3 process due to its high uv reactivity fig 2c the overall results shown above indicate that the e peroxone and uv o3 processes can more significantly enhance o3 transformation to oh and thus improve the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants during the treatment of water matrices that have relatively high ozone stability than that have low ozone stability these results agree well with the general findings of previous studies on conventional ozonation and ozone based aops such as the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process acero and von gunten 2001 lee et al 2013 nothe et al 2009 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von gunten et al 1996 wang et al 2018 for instance a full scale study in drinking water treatment plants showed that for the same applied ozone dose 1 6 mg l the addition of h2o2 resulted in much lower o3 residual concentration at the reactor outlet during the conventional o3 h2o2 treatment of a surface water than during conventional ozonation 0 1 mg l vs 0 65 mg l von gunten et al 1996 due to the higher degree of ozone transformation 94 vs 59 the conventional o3 h2o2 process considerably increased the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant pesticide atrazine compared to conventional ozonation 75 vs 42 von gunten et al 1996 in contrast the addition of h2o2 or uv irradiation usually does not significantly enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants during wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2011 hubner et al 2015 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 3 1 2 energy efficiency for micropollutant abatement electrical energy per order eeo i e the electrical energy demand to abate a pollutant concentration by 1 order in 1 m3 of water is a useful figure of merit for comparing the energy efficiency of different treatment systems bolton et al 2001 the eeo values for the abatement of diclofenac bezafibrate and chloramphenicol as a model for ozone reactive moderately reactive and resistant micropollutant respectively in the three waters by conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes are calculated according to eqs 6 8 respectively

41 w note that eqs 6 8 implicitly assume first order kinetics for micropollutant abatement bolton et al 2001 for micropollutants whose abatement efficiency was below 90 during the treatments eeo value is based on extrapolation pisarenko et al 2012 compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 process resulted in higher eeo values for the abatement of diclofenac and bezafibrate in the three water matrices fig 5 these increases can be attributed to the fact that high abatement efficiencies of diclofenac and bezafibrate generally 95 could already be obtained during conventional ozonation of the three waters fig 2 therefore the e peroxone or uv o3 processes cannot further substantially enhance their abatement efficiencies but cost extra energy for h2o2 electro generation or uv irradiation fig 5 in contrast due to the enhanced abatements of ozone resistant micropollutants the e peroxone process reduced the eeo values for their abatements compared to conventional ozonation fig 5 for the tested current range 50 200 ma the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement were reduced by 30 53 and 10 16 during the e peroxone treatment of the groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent respectively compared to conventional ozonation fig 5a and c in addition when a current of 50 100 ma was applied during the e peroxone treatment of the surface water the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement was also 10 lower than that of conventional ozonation fig 5b however due to the low conductivity of the surface water 299 μs cm the cell voltage and thus energy consumption for h2o2 electro generation increased considerably as the currents were increased beyond 100 ma see si table s1 which resulted in a considerable increase in the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement by the e peroxone process similar to the e peroxone process the uv o3 process also enhanced the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants compared to conventional ozonation fig 2 however the eeo values for the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants were approximately 4 10 times higher for the uv o3 process than for conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process see fig 5 and si table s2 these data are consistent with the general conclusions of many previous studies that due to the high energy demand for uv irradiation uv based technologies e g uv photolysis and uv h2o2 process usually are less energy efficient than ozone based processes e g ozonation and o3 h2o2 in terms of micropollutant abatements katsoyiannis et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 santiago morales et al 2013 notably increasing the applied currents beyond 100 ma resulted in an evident increase in the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement especially during the e peroxone treatment of the groundwater and surface water fig 5 these trends can be possibly attributed to the fact that with an applied current of 100 ma the applied o3 doses were already completely transformed during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters fig 3a c therefore further increasing the applied currents above 100 ma could not further substantially enhance the degree of o3 transformation to oh fig 4 and thus the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants fig 2 but cost more energy for h2o2 electro generation moreover fig 6 shows that when a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc was applied in the three water matrices bromate formation could be effectively inhibited to below detectable concentrations by applying 100 ma during the e peroxone process these results suggest that there is a marginal benefit associated with the production of higher h2o2 concentrations in the e peroxone system taking into account all aspects micropollutant abatement energy consumption and bromate control 100 ma appears to be an optimal current to be applied in the e peroxone process with a specific o3 dose of 1 5 mg l see si for more discussion on optimal current at varying applied o3 doses the overall results shown above indicate that larger amounts of energy are required to abate ozone resistant micropollutants than ozone reactive ones in a water matrix by conventional ozonation and ozone based aops therefore if the objective of water treatment is to effectively abate most micropollutants rather than only ozone reactive ones in a water matrix the energy demand for the water treatment will be determined by the most resistant ones si fig s2 shows that despite the extra energy consumption for h2o2 electro generation the e peroxone process 100 ma actually consumed less energy for the abatement of micropollutants with k o3 100 m 1 s 1 i e ozone resistant micropollutants in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation in particular eeo for the abatement of chloramphenicol the most ozone resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters was reduced by 10 53 during the e peroxone 100 ma treatment of the three water matrices compared to conventional ozonation see fig 5 it is noted that the eeo values reported above are calculated based on the applied ozone doses due to the relatively high ozone stability of the groundwater and surface water the applied ozone doses were not completely consumed in the reactor during conventional ozonation of the two water matrices with a hrt of 20 min fig 3 theoretically higher hrt can be used to ensure that all transferred ozone is consumed in the reactor during water and wastewater treatments to compare the energy efficiency of the three processes under such hypothetical hrt conditions eeo values for micropollutant abatements are calculated based on the consumed ozone dose i e the applied ozone dose minus the residual ozone measured in the effluent of the reactor according to eqs s3 s4 and s5 and reported in si table s3 when conventional ozonation was changed to the e peroxone process 100 ma the eeo value for chloramphenicol abatement in the groundwater and secondary wastewater effluent was decreased by 34 0 197 vs 0 135 kwh m3 log and 14 0 317 vs 0 273 kwh m3 log respectively see si fig s3 however the eeo for chloramphenicol abatement in the surface water was slightly increased from 0 135 kwh m3 log for conventional ozonation to 0 147 kwh m3 log for the e peroxone process 50 ma this increase can be mainly attributed to the low conductivity of the selected surface water which results in high energy demand for h2o2 electro generation see si table s1 overall the results presented above clearly show that the e peroxone process can considerably reduce the energy consumption for the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants in the selected groundwater compared to conventional ozonation nevertheless the two processes seem to be comparably efficient in the selected surface water and secondary wastewater effluent when considering all uncertainty inherent in the eeo calculations bolton et al 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 3 1 3 bromate formation fig 6 shows the concentrations of br and bro3 detected at the reactor outlets during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the three water matrices for the applied specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc a considerable fraction 18 34 of the spiked br was transformed to bro3 during conventional ozonation of the three waters consequently the bromate concentrations in the ozonation effluents were much higher than the drinking water standard for bromate 10 μg l equivalent to 0 078 μm in contrast bromate formation was not observed during most experiments of the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the three waters except for the uv o3 treatment of the surface water and the e peroxone treatment of the surface water and secondary wastewater effluent with the lowest current 50 ma these observations are consistent with the previous findings that for an equivalent ozone dose significantly less bromate will be formed during the treatment of bromide containing water by the e peroxone and uv o3 processes compared to conventional ozonation li et al 2015 yao et al 2017 this improvement can be mainly attributed to a combined result of a the h2o2 or uv induced low o3 residual concentrations see fig 3a c and b the quenching of hobr by h2o2 in situ generated during the e peroxone and uv o3 processes as discussed below as shown in fig 3d f h2o2 residual concentrations detected at the reactor outlet increased progressively with increasing the applied currents during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters this trend can be attributed to the acceleration of h2o2 electro generation at higher currents li et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the increase of h2o2 concentrations can in turn enhance both the decomposition of o3 eq 2 and the quenching of hobr eq 3 which is an important intermediate in bromate formation during ozone based processes li et al 2015 von gunten and oliveras 1997 yao et al 2017 consequently bromate formation could be more effectively inhibited as the applied currents were increased during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters fig 6 similar to the e peroxone process the uv o3 process can also produce h2o2 in situ from uv photolysis of o3 legrini et al 1993 under the tested conditions 0 17 0 47 mg l of h2o2 was detected at the reactor outlet during the uv o3 treatment of the three waters fig 3d f these concentrations are slightly lower than those detected during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters with the smallest current of 50 ma see fig 3d f it seems that such low h2o2 concentrations cannot sufficiently inhibit bromate formation during the uv o3 treatment of the surface water therefore 0 28 μm 35 8 μg l bromate was detected in its effluent fig 6b ozone doses have a significant effect on bromate formation as shown in si fig s14 bromate concentration at the reactor outlet increased significantly from 0 119 μm 15 2 μg l to 0 864 μm 110 6 μg l as the specific ozone was increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mg o3 mg doc during conventional ozonation of the selected surface water moreover although bromate was not detected in the reactor effluent when a specific ozone of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc was applied in the uv o3 process its concentration increased to 0 28 0 47 μm 35 8 60 1 μg l with increasing the specific ozone dose to 1 5 2 0 mg o3 mg doc in contrast by adjusting applied currents 50 200 ma during the e peroxone process bromate formation could be effectively suppressed below the drinking water standard for all specific ozone doses tested in this study 1 0 2 0 mg o3 mg doc in routine drinking water or wastewater treatment specific ozone doses are typically in the order of 0 5 1 0 mg o3 mg doc von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 zucker et al 2016 previous studies have suggested that bromate formation is usually not a major concern when specific ozone doses of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc are applied in conventional ozonation pisarenko et al 2012 von gunten 2003b zimmermann et al 2011 however bromate formation may become a problem when high specific ozone doses e g 1 5 mg o3 mg doc are required in conventional ozonation to enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants bourgin et al 2017 soltermann et al 2017 yao et al 2017 the results of this pilot scale study confirm that by in situ generating h2o2 the e peroxone process can offer a simple and convenient way to mitigate bromate formation during the treatment of bromide containing water in agreement with the previous finding from bench scale studies yao et al 2017 3 2 effect of hydraulic residence time on groundwater treatment 3 2 1 micropollutant abatement the effect of hydraulic residence time hrt on micropollutant abatement in the selected groundwater was shown in fig 7 for ozone reactive micropollutants diclofenac naproxen and gemfibrozil varying the hrts between 5 min and 20 min did not considerably change their abatement efficiencies during the three processes fig 7 this observation can be attributed to the fact that ozone reactive micropollutants can be sufficiently abated within short contact time with o3 huber et al 2003 pisarenko et al 2012 rosal et al 2010 yao et al 2016 therefore a short hrt of 5 min is sufficient for their elimination in contrast hrt had distinctly different effects on the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and uv o3 processes during conventional ozonation the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen clofibric acid and chloramphenicol increased generally with increasing the hrts especially from 5 min to 10 min see fig 7a however similar abatement efficiencies were obtained for these micropollutants at the varying hrts during the e peroxone process fig 7b for the uv o3 process the abatement efficiencies of uv reactive clofibric acid and chloramphenicol increased with increasing the hrts while the abatement of uv resistant ibuprofen and p cba did not change considerably with the hrts fig 7c during conventional ozonation o3 residual concentrations detected at the reactor outlet decreased from 1 19 mg l to 0 95 mg l with increasing the hrts from 5 min to 10 min si fig s4a due to the increased degree of ozone transformation 51 at 5 min and 61 at 10 min oh exposure increased from 0 07 10 9 to 0 11 10 9 m s as the hrts were increased from 5 min to 10 min however further increasing the hrts to 20 min only marginally increased the degree of o3 transformation 65 and thus the oh exposures 0 13 10 9 m s si fig s5 consequently the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants increased evidently as the hrts were increased from 5 min to 10 min but then did not change significantly on account of the experimental and analytical errors with further increasing the hrt to 20 min during conventional ozonation these observations indicate that due to the high ozone stability in the groundwater hrt of 5 20 min is too low to efficiently utilize the applied ozone dose for micropollutant abatement during conventional ozonation with increasing the hrt more transferred ozone could be consumed in the reactor which in turn increased the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant micropollutants during conventional ozonation see si fig s6 for the abatement efficiency of micropollutants as a function of consumed specific ozone doses in the presence of electro generated h2o2 or uv irradiation o3 transformation was significantly accelerated during the e peroxone and uv o3 processes as shown in si fig s4 90 of the applied ozone dose could be transformed within 5 min of the e peroxone and uv o3 processes therefore extending hrts beyond 5 min would not further substantially enhance the degree of o3 transformation to oh and thus the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants this is with the exception of uv reactive micropollutants clofibric acid and chloramphenicol during the uv o3 process due to the enhanced direct photolysis at higher hrts their abatement efficiencies were increased by 10 with increasing the hrts from 5 min to 20 min during the uv o3 process fig 7c in general the above results indicate that due to the h2o2 or uv induced enhancement of o3 transformation to oh higher abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants can be obtained in shorter hrts during the e peroxone and uv o3 treatment of the selected groundwater compared to conventional ozonation this feature may be of importance for water utilities under certain conditions e g during storm periods or emergency episodes when shorter hrts than those for routine operations are required to deal with the increased flow rates hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 3 2 2 energy efficiency for micropollutant abatements as the hrts were increased from 5 min to 20 min the energy demand required to abate the concentrations of chloramphenicol the most ozone resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters by 1 order of magnitude decreased for conventional ozonation but increased for the e peroxone and uv o3 processes see fig 8 and si fig s7 for eeo values calculated based on the applied and consumed ozone doses respectively this difference suggests that hrt has different effects on the energy efficiency of micropollutant abatement by the three processes the decrease in the eeo values for chloramphenicol abatement during conventional ozonation can be explained by the increased abatement efficiencies of chloramphenicol at higher hrts fig 7c in contrast extending the hrts beyond 5 min did not considerably increase the abatement efficiencies of chloramphenicol during the e peroxone and uv o3 processes but cost more energy for h2o2 electro generation and uv irradiation therefore the energy demand for micropollutant abatements increased with increasing the hrts during the two aops overall the data shown in fig 8 indicate that under the tested conditions a minimum energy demand of 0 300 0 135 and 0 917 kwh m3 were required to achieve 90 abatement of the concentration of chloramphenicol in the groundwater by conventional ozonation hrt 20 min the e peroxone hrt 5 min and uv o3 hrt 5 min processes respectively these data indicate that among the three processes tested in this study the e peroxone process is the most energy efficient for ozone resistant micropollutant abatement in the groundwater 3 3 implications of the e peroxone process for water and wastewater treatment the results presented here demonstrate that by installing electrodes in an ozone reactor to electrochemically produce h2o2 during ozonation the e peroxone process can improve the performance of water and wastewater treatment in many aspects compared with conventional ozonation the e peroxone process can enhance the efficiencies and reduce the energy consumption for ozone resistant micropollutant abatements especially during the treatment of water matrices that have relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater with low dom and high carbonate contents in addition hrts required for micropollutant abatements can be considerably shortened during the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation furthermore bromate formation can be effectively inhibited during the treatment of bromide containing water by the e peroxone process although some results reported in this study e g the exact values of abatement efficiency and eeo would be strictly related to the system configurations e g the volume type and geometry of the reacting system used in this study the general findings of this pilot scale study e g enhanced abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants and reduced bromate formation agree well with the results of previous bench scale studies wang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 2017 this agreement confirms that the beneficial effects reported previously in the bench scale studies could also be achieved in real ozone reactors and thus verify the applicability of the e peroxone process for practical applications based on the promising results a kinetic analysis will be performed in a further step to better guide the designing and operation of the e peroxone system for micropollutant abatement in general the results observed herein for the e peroxone process are similar to the previous findings reported for the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process acero and von gunten 2001 hubner et al 2015 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 rosal et al 2008 von gunten et al 1996 wang et al 2018 however unlike the conventional peroxone process which requires the addition of h2o2 stocks the e peroxone process can produce h2o2 in situ using o2 that would otherwise be wasted during conventional ozonation the market price for h2o2 stocks is 1 0 2 0 usd kg barazesh et al 2015 campos martin et al 2006 which is equivalent to 15 2 30 3 kwh kg h2o2 based on the electricity cost of 0 066 usd kwh useia 2016 in comparison h2o2 can be in situ produced with an energy consumption of 5 62 18 18 kwh kg h2o2 when a current of 50 100 ma was applied during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters see si table s1 therefore the e peroxone process can not only avoid the risks associated with the transportation storage and handling of concentrated h2o2 stocks for the conventional peroxone process but also reduce the energy cost compared with the more traditional peroxone process the e peroxone process can thus offer a more convenient energy efficient and safer alternative for water and wastewater treatment however it should be noted that due to the shortened lifetime of o3 by electro generated h2o2 disinfection efficiency might be reduced in the e peroxone process compared to conventional ozonation as has been reported for the conventional peroxone process von gunten 2003b this is undesired for drinking water treatment especially in the areas where disinfection is mainly achieved with ozonation other than with chlorination or uv rosario ortiz et al 2016 a possible solution to this problem is to initiate the electro generation of h2o2 at a later stage of conventional ozonation after sufficient disinfection has been obtained i e conventional ozonation followed by the e peroxone process this strategy has been successfully applied in the conventional peroxone process to maintain sufficient disinfection efficiency and reduce bromate formation during drinking water treatment katsoyiannis et al 2011 4 conclusions the results of this pilot scale study demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of the e peroxone process for micropollutant abatements and bromate control in water treatment by electro generating h2o2 during ozonation the e peroxone process considerably enhanced o3 transformation to oh within typical hrts of ozone reactor during the treatment of the selected groundwater and surface water therefore for the same applied ozone doses substantially higher abatement efficiencies could be obtained for ozone resistant micropollutants within shorter hrts during the e peroxone treatment of the groundwater and surface water than during conventional ozonation however due to the fast decomposition of o3 in wastewater the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process only marginally enhanced the degree of o3 transformation and thus the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant micropollutants during the treatment of secondary wastewater effluent besides enhancing micropollutant abatements the e peroxone process significantly reduced bromate formation to below the bromate drinking water standard during the treatment of the various water matrices compared conventional ozonation furthermore due to the enhanced oh production the e peroxone process reduced the energy required to abate ozone resistant micropollutants in the various water matrices compared to conventional ozonation in contrast while the uv o3 process could also similarly enhance ozone resistant micropollutants and reduce bromate formation compared to conventional ozonation it consumed significantly higher energy than conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process overall this pilot scale study indicates that the e peroxone process can provide an effective and energy efficient option for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in drinking water and wastewater treatment

19598,a migration electric field assisted electrocoagulation meaec system was developed to increase phosphate removal from domestic wastewater with reduced energy consumption using a titanium charging inert electrode and a sacrificial iron anode in the meaec an electric field was applied between the inert electrode titanium and an air cathode to drive migration of phosphate anions towards the sacrificial anode current was then applied between the sacrificial anode fe or al mesh and the air cathode to drive electrocoagulation of phosphate a meaec with the fe electrode using primary clarifier effluent achieved 98 phosphate removal producing water with a total phosphorus of 0 3 mg l with 6 min total treatment time five cycles each 10 s inert electrode charging and 1 min electrocoagulation at a constant current density of 1 ma cm2 in the absence of the 10 s charging time electrocoagulation required 15 min for the same removal with an aluminum anode and the same phosphorus removal the meaec required 7 cycles 7 min total treatment 1 min 10 s total charging while conventional electrocoagulation required 20 min the energy demand of fe meaec was only 0 039 kwh m3 for 98 phosphate removal which was 35 less than with the al meaec of 0 06 kwh m3 and 28 less than that previously obtained using an inert graphite electrode analysis of the precipitate showed that a less porous precipitate was obtained with the al anode than with the fe anode the phosphorus in precipitate of fe meaec was identified as po4 3 and hpo4 2 while the fe was present as both fe2 and fe3 only hpo4 2 and al3 were identified in the precipitate of the al meaec these results indicated that the meaec with a titanium inert charging electrode and iron anode could achieve the most efficient phosphate removal with very low energy demands compared to previous electrochemical approaches graphical abstract image 1 keywords energy efficiency wastewater treatment electrocoagulation air cathode iron electrode aluminum electrode 1 introduction in recent years avoiding pollution of water bodies has become even more important due to further industrialization and urbanization but the costs of aerobic treatment of wastewaters remain high anaerobic wastewater treatment can be a less expensive and more effective approach to remove organic matter in the wastewater using processes such as anaerobic fluidized bed reactors anaerobic membrane bioreactors kim et al 2010 ren et al 2014 yoo et al 2012 and microbial fuel cells mfcs he et al 2016a kim et al 2015 however only a small fraction of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are removed in these anaerobic processes therefore additional nutrient removal processes are needed following these anaerobic systems to achieve efficient nutrient removal delgado vela et al 2015 phosphorus removal is particularly needed as it is often the controlling factor in the eutrophication of natural water bodies electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical process that can be used to treat wastewaters in terms of both organic matter and nutrient removal gao et al 2017 the process is based on the use of a sacrificial electrode such as aluminum gharibi et al 2010 irdemez et al 2006a kobya et al 2003 that is oxidized to produce metal ions that coagulate and react with organic matter and nutrients removing them from wastewater by chemical precipitation while many different metals have been examined for electrocoagulation gatsios et al 2015 aluminum or iron are most commonly used due to their good flocculation performance as shown for domestic and textile wastewaters abdel gawad et al 2012 gomes et al 2007 hu et al 2003 kobya et al 2003 as well as wastewaters containing boron chorghe et al 2017 or arsenic delaire et al 2017 katal and pahlavanzadeh 2011 wan et al 2011 when current is applied metal ions that are produced react with primary hydroxides and produce polyhyroxides and polyhydroxy metallic flocs pulkka et

of materials and operational conditions on nutrient removal tian et al 2016 including electrode materials chen et al 2014 si et al 2016 ph gatsios et al 2015 gharibi et al 2010 current density bektaş et al 2004 treatment time and initial nutrient concentration of the influent wastewater gharibi et al 2010 irdemez et al 2006c the major advantages of ec are convenient operational procedures high pollutant removal performance and no requirement of chemical addition into the wastewater however the high electricity and anode material costs have limited more widespread applications of ec processes for wastewater treatment one method recently developed to reduce energy costs was based on using an air breathing cathode to directly reduce oxygen as opposed to aerating the wastewater or driving electrochemical hydrogen production at the cathode tian et al 2016 the use of this cathode was shown to provide effective ec wastewater treatment using an aluminum anode a second recent advance to reduce energy demands and improve the efficiency of phosphate removal was the application of an electric field applied for a short period of time 10 120 s between an additional inert anode graphite positioned in between the sacrificial anode and the cathode tian et al 2017 this charging process drove phosphate ion migration to the sacrificial anode and subsequently improved phosphate ion removal in the subsequent ec process the lower energy and material consumption were found to improve the overall removal of phosphate compared to sustained ec without the initial charging cycle while the energy needed for ec was reduced to 0 14 kwh m3 which was among the lowest yet reported for ec processes this energy demand was still considered to be higher than that desired for a process for phosphate removal from wastewater tian et al 2017 in order to further improve the electrochemical removal of phosphate from domestic wastewaters the migration electric field assisted electrocoagulation meaec system was modified to use new materials in order to reduce energy production improve nutrient removal and produce a more environmentally friendly precipitate first to reduce energy consumption by increasing current when applying a fixed voltage 0 5 v a titanium plate was used instead of graphite sheet as the inert electrode situated between the sacrificial anode and air cathode second a sacrificial iron electrode was used to avoid the production of an aluminum sludge that would be a more toxic byproduct to demonstrate the improved performance of the system with the iron anode experiments were conducted with both the iron and aluminum mesh anodes and the ti inert electrode meaec and without the applied electric field ec control using both primary and secondary clarifier effluents the morphologies of the titanium and graphite inert electrodes and the precipitates formed in the process with these anodes were studied with a scanning electron microscope sem the chemical composition of the precipitates were further investigated with energy dispersive spectrum analysis eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode materials and reactor operating conditions meaec reactors were constructed as previously described tian et al 2017 except different inert and sacrificial anode materials were used here a titanium plate 3 7 cm2 was used as the inert electrode and its charge discharge current and durability was compared to a graphite sheet used in previous studies 3 7 cm2 the sacrificial anodes were either iron mesh mesh size 100 per 2 54 cm wire diameter 0 017 mm opening 0 03 mm yingkai corporation china or aluminum mesh mesh size 200 per 2 54 cm wire diameter 0 05 mm opening 0 07 mm twp corporation usa the projected surface areas of the sacrificial anodes were 15 cm2 3 5 cm2 cathodes used an activated carbon catalyst for oxygen reduction and were made by a continuous rolling and pressing process with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe as the binder and an outer ptfe diffusion layer to avoid water leakage through the cathode dong et al 2012 he et al 2016b all reactors were operated in batch mode the meaec reactors consisted of an inert electrode titanium plate a sacrificial anode aluminum iron mesh and an air cathode while the control ec reactor was made using only the sacrificial anode and air cathode the sacrificial anode was placed between inert anode and cathode with 1 5 cm between the sacrificial anode and air cathode and 2 cm between inert anode and air cathode a potentiostat vmp3 biologic claix france was used to set voltages or current for the meaec reactors a constant voltage of 0 5 v was first applied between inert anode and air cathode for 10 s then the sacrificial anode was connected with air cathode in electric circuit and operated with constant current density of 1 ma cm2 for 1 min while the inert anode was disconnected with cathode these two steps formed a single working cycle and the cycles repeated until the phosphorus concentration was lower than the detection limit 0 1 mg l the control ec reactor was operated continuously at a constant current density of 1 ma cm2 between anode and cathode the durability of the two inert electrodes titanium plate or graphite sheet over time was compared in charging and discharging tests with an air breathing cathode and a synthetic nutrient solution the charge and discharge times were both set at 90 s with an applied voltage of 0 5 v for 400 cycles for both types of electrodes the surface structure of ti and graphite electrodes were then examined using a scanning electron microscope sem to evaluate changes in the electrode surfaces due to oxidation or corrosion the charge transfer efficiency of different electrode materials was evaluated by the current produced over 400 charging discharging cycles the effectiveness of the ti electrode on phosphate removal was further compared to that obtained using a graphite electrode with aluminum mesh as the sacrificial anode for the advanced treatment of both primary high phosphorous concentration and secondary low phosphorus concentration clarifier effluent the inert electrode working time 10 s and total electrocoagulation times 1 3 5 and 7 min were selected based on detectable final concentrations of phosphate the impact of ec on phosphate removal and energy utilization was also compared with a fixed inert electrode time of 10 s the control ec was operated with a continuous working time of 3 5 10 15 and 20 min for primary clarifier effluent and 1 3 5 and 10 min for secondary clarifier effluent based on obtaining a final phosphate concentration below the limit of detection 0 1 mg l for meaec tests the total treatment times were 1 3 5 and 7 min for primary clarifier effluent and 1 2 3 and 5 min for secondary clarifier effluent following each electrocoagulation period particles were allowed to settle in the reactor for 1 h no applied current cathodes were cleaned after every 100 batch cycles by soaking the cathode in a diluted 10 hydrochloric acid solution bdh aristar plus vwr for 2 min to remove salt deposits all tests were conducted using duplicate reactors at 25 c with results reported based on the average and standard deviations sd 2 2 wastewater and synthetic nutrient solution the two wastewater sources primary clarifier effluent and secondary clarifier effluent were both obtained from the wenchang municipal wastewater treatment harbin china and stored at 4 c prior to use the primary clarifier effluent had a ph of 6 8 7 1 a conductivity of 900 μs cm an ammonia concentration of 48 2 mg l a total nitrogen concentration of 65 3 mg l and a phosphate concentration of 17 1 mg l the secondary clarifier effluent had a ph of 7 7 2 a conductivity of 600 μs cm an ammonia concentration of 8 0 5 mg l a total nitrogen of 22 1 mg l and a phosphate concentration of 2 4 0 1 mg l the synthetic nutrient solution contained 1200 mg l nah2po4 sigma aldrich in order to produce the same conductivity as the primary clarifier wastewater 2 3 solution measurements and calculations before phosphate measurements all samples were filtered using 0 45 μm pore diameter syringe filters polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf 25 mm diameter restek corporation samples were analyzed using method 10031 hach company loveland co for phosphate method 10127 hach company loveland co for ammonia and method 10071 for total nitrogen the removal efficiencies were calculated from the initial and final concentrations voltage and the counter electrode potential were recorded at 1 s intervals and analyzed using the potentiostat software ec lab v10 02 energy consumption e kwh m3 for ec wastewater treatment was calculated as w uit v where u is the voltage v i the current a t the electrolysis time s and v the volume of reactor m3 in charge and discharge tests the total inert electrode charge q c was calculated by summing the total charge transferred over both the charging and discharging cycles based on the current where q lt the power p ui to polarize the inert electrode was not included in this calculation as there was only a tiny current 2 4 characterization techniques microstructural study tests were conducted on the precipitates and electrodes using a scanning electron microscope sem quanta200 fei co equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the particles sizes in the sem images were calculated by image analysis using the open platform software of image j surface chemical characterization was performed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using a thermo scientific escalab 250xi spectrometer with a six channel channeltron detector high resolution spectra of the elements identified were corrected using the c1s signal 285 ev as a reference and then the percentages of each element presented in the generated sediment were calculated relative to this signal the precipitates produced from the ec process were dried overnight and ground up for xps analysis and prepared for sem analysis after the gold sputtering treated after 400 cycles the ti and graphite electrodes were dried at 80 c overnight prior to sem analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of titanium and graphite inert electrodes to demonstrate that using a titanium electrode could improve electrochemical performance titanium plate and graphite sheet electrodes were compared in charge and discharge tests using a synthetic nutrient solution no sacrificial anode installed after 400 cycles the graphite electrode absorbed 29 more charge 69 600 c than the ti electrode 49 516 c therefore the ti electrode was relatively more inert in wastewater due to less current transferred which would result in a longer service time and less energy consumption compared to graphite the maximum current produced with the ti electrode fig 1 a was 0 2 ma which was only 5 of that compared to graphite 4 ma fig 1b which also indicated the titanium was less active than graphite the surfaces morphologies obtained using sem of the ti and graphite electrodes indicated the more stable structure of ti than graphite the surface morphology of ti was not noticeably altered after 400 cycles while holes cracks and obvious deformations were observed on graphite electrode surface after the charging and discharging tests fig 2 the large changes in surface morphologies of the graphite electrodes suggested that they were oxidized during electrochemical tests 3 2 treatment of primary clarifier effluent using meaec phosphate removal using primary clarifier effluent was examined in meaec reactors using iron sacrificial anodes fe meaec with each cycle consisting of an applied voltage of 0 5 v between the inert and air cathode for 10 s followed by a constant current density of 1 ma cm2 between the sacrificial anode and air cathode for 1 min phosphate removals increased with treatment time with 76 5 removal using primary clarifier effluent for one cycle and 88 5 for three cycles after 5 cycles there was nearly complete phosphate removal 98 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 3 mg l and no detectable phosphate 0 1 mg l in the effluent after 7 cycles fig 3 a the performance of the fe meaec system was further compared to the control reactor without an inert electrode fe ec fig 3b after the first 3 min of electrocoagulation the phosphate removal of primary clarifier effluent was 88 5 which was very similar with that of meaec however after 5 min of electrocoagulation the phosphate removal was only 93 5 compared to 98 6 for the meaec after 5 min after 10 min of electrocoagulation the phosphate removal of fe ec was 97 and 15 20 min was required to reach a comparable phosphate removal of 98 obtained using the meaec after 6 min 5 min 50 s the differences between fe meaec and control fe ec indicated that the meaec greatly improved phosphate removals for wastewaters with low nutrient concentrations the localized accumulation of target ions near the sacrificial anode by charging inert electrode was considered to be the primary reason which allowed for a greater opportunity for the phosphate ions to be attracted to the sacrificial electrode and thus to more rapidly form precipitates with metal ions or to be absorbed by the flocs for the meaec using the al sacrificial anode phosphate removal of the primary clarifier effluent was 71 6 with one working cycle 10 s migration process 1 min electrolysis time and it increased to 89 5 after 3 working cycles reached fig 3b this was much better than the phosphate removal for the control reactor using an al electrode without an inert electrode al ec which was only 82 6 after 3 min a total of 10 min of working time was needed for the al ec reactor to obtain a similar phosphate removal 97 as that of the al meaec for the same working time of 5 min 6 min including inert electrode charging times the al ec required 15 20 min of treatment to achieve the same as that with the al meaec using only 7 min of treatment time not including inert electrode charging a comparison of the fe meaec and al meaec systems show that they obtained similar phosphate removals of 89 in the first 3 working cycles however after 7 working cycles the effluent phosphate concentration of fe meaec was near the detectable level 0 1 mg l 1 while that of al meaec was still 0 3 mg l 1 this indicated the fe meaec had a slight advantage in reducing phosphate more rapidly to low concentrations both the fe meaec and al meaec required only 50 of the working time compared to the controls for achieving a phosphate removal of 97 the major factor leading to better performance of meaec was the use of the inert anode and its impact on ion migration due to the assisted electric field which localized accumulated target phosphate ions and enhanced the precipitate forming with metal ions the performance of the al meaec system using a titanium inert electrode was compared to the graphite electrode used in previous tests using primarily clarifier effluent over multiple cycles phosphate removals were similar for the two inert materials fig s1 with 70 98 removal using the titanium electrode as the inert electrode fig s1a and 72 97 using the graphite electrode fig s1b thus while the phosphate removals are similar for both ti and graphite inert electrodes under these conditions the much greater stability of the ti electrode made it a better choice as the inert electrode 3 3 treatment of secondary clarifier effluent using the meaec secondary clarifier effluent that had lower organic matter and phosphate concentrations was also tested with both meaec and control ec reactors fig 4 the phosphate removal for the fe meaec reactor increased rapidly in the first 1 3 working cycles from 71 5 to 96 1 0 1 mg l 1 in effluent after that the phosphate removal was essentially constant after 5 working cycles since the phosphate was nearly completely removed phosphate removal by the control fe ec was much lower with 46 6 to 85 2 removals for 1 and 5 min fig 4a with up to a 10 min working time the control fe ec fig 4b achieved only 88 2 phosphate removal with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 the fe meaec however required only 2 working cycles to achieve a higher phosphate removal of 92 2 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 similar trends were observed between the reactors using al electrodes for the al meaec fig 4c and control al ec fig 4d the phosphate removal of the al meaec increased from 67 5 for 1 working cycle to 94 2 with 3 working cycles with 96 removal and an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 after 5 working cycles however the control al ec had a phosphate removal of only 85 2 with a 5 min working time and 88 2 with a 10 min working time 0 3 mg l 1 in effluent compared to only 2 cycles needed for 88 2 phosphorus removal using the al meaec both control reactors fe ec and al ec were inefficient in removing phosphorus from the secondary clarifier effluent due to the lower initial phosphate concentrations 2 4 mg l compared to 17 mg l for the primary clarifier effluent the minimum concentration of phosphate that could be achieved with these two processes was 0 3 mg l 1 for both primary and secondary clarifier effluents however by using the inert electrode in the meaec it was still possible to reduce the effluent phosphate concentration to 0 1 mg l 1 considering other possible conditions that could impact phosphate removals such as suspended solids and cods the meaec performance was still excellent and thus it demonstrated good performance even for secondary clarifier effluent treatment based on the comparison of the fe and al sacrificial anodes the fe meaec was slightly better in performance than the al meaec for 3 working cycles indicating the advantages of the fe electrode with low phosphate concentrations in secondary effluent 3 4 chemical and morphological analysis of precipitates and electrodes 3 4 1 morphology and composition of the sediment by sem eds the morphologies of the precipitate collected from the control ec with both fe and al electrode after treating primary clarifier effluent were examined by sem fig 5 the particles in the precipitate from the control fe ec were 0 45 0 07 μm range of 0 2 0 6 μm which were relatively smaller and more spherical than those collected from control al ec 1 69 0 33 μm unlike the loosely organized particles of control fe ec precipitate the particles of control al ec were closely packed together and formed a bulk precipitate although there is direct reaction of the metal with phosphate ions to form flocs sweep and adsorption effects are considered as the main mechanisms for conventional electrocoagulation processes to remove nutrition ions lacasa et al 2011 moreno casillas et al 2007 therefore the smaller particles and loose structure of the precipitate from fe ec may contribute to its better phosphate removal compared to the al ec fig s2 the surface elemental composition and atomic number percentage of the sediments obtained by eds showed that the most abundant elements in the sediment were c n and p for both electrodes with a higher content of fe or al depending on the specific electrode table 1 the surface elemental composition and atomic percentages of the precipitate from the control fe ec and al ec tests were obtained by eds analysis the most abundant elements in both precipitates were al or fe c o n and p while differences were observed in the atomic number percentages table 1 the electrocoagulation system has been proven to contribute to cod and nitrogen removal lacasa et al 2011 lin et al 2017 therefore the elements of c o n were also observed in precipitates however at treatment times of 1 20 min there was little effective total nitrogen removal with an influent tn of 65 2 mg l and an effluent tn of 62 2 mg l the atomic ratio of fe elements was 23 from the precipitate of control fe ec system while that of al elements was similar at 20 the atomic percentage of phosphorus was 3 4 for the precipitate from the control fe ec system which was almost twice than that of control al ec system 1 8 indicating the higher efficiency of fe as a sacrificial electrode without the assistance of inert electrode the results of the elemental composition are consistent with the better performance of the fe electrode than al electrode in treating the primary clarifier effluent fig 3 3 4 2 determination of surface elemental composition of precipitates by xps in order to identify the valences of the composite elements in the precipitates of the primary clarifier effluent treatment xps analyses were performed for the meaec and the control with both fe and al electrodes nitrogen was detected in the precipitate of from the meaec and control ec reactors consistent with the above results and previous studies lacasa et al 2011 the phosphorus signals in the control ec and meaec with fe electrode were identified as po4 3 and hpo4 2 while the fe elements existed in both fe2 709 5 709 6 ev and fe3 711 8 ev oxidation states however only hpo4 2 and al3 73 8 ev were identified in the systems with al electrode the ph with fe electrode electrocoagulation was near neutral while that of al electrode electrocoagulation was higher due to the longer working times lacasa et al 2011 this change in ph was likely the reason for the existence of the hpo4 2 signal in the comparison of control ec and meaec the atomic proportion of fe from sacrificial anode was reduced from 3 2 to 1 7 by applying inert electrode while that of al was reduced from 12 5 to 8 9 however with the reduction in the atomic proportion of fe and al from the control ec to meaec tests the atomic proportion of phosphorus was slightly increased for both the fe electrode from 1 9 to 2 system and the al electrode from 1 7 to 1 9 system these data indicated that the migration electrical field and inert electrode could effectively reduce the consumption of sacrificial anodes in meaec with the improved efficiency more notable for the fe meaec xps results further demonstrated that there was more efficient phosphate removal with the meaec using fe instead of the al compared to the xps results of the controls with meaec there was no change in the chemical composition of the generated precipitate due to the use of meaec but the decreased elemental content of fe and al in the precipitate demonstrated that the meaec played a role of increasing local phosphate concentrations near the sacrificial electrode comparing the fe precipitate composition using the fe or al electrode the generated flocs containing iron would have less toxicity than those containing high concentrations of aluminum and the iron rich material could easily be safely recycled cheng et al 2012 there were no appreciable nitrogen and ammonia removals from solution although nitrogen was detected using xps in the sediment suggesting minimal nitrogen removal by adsorption 3 5 energy consumption phosphate removals increased with treatment time although more time resulted in greater energy consumption when the iron electrode was used as the sacrificial anode treating primary clarifier wastewater the meaec used only 0 007 kwh m3 for a 1 min treatment with 76 5 phosphate removal and up to 0 039 kwh m3 for a 7 min treatment to achieve 98 2 removal these energy requirements were much less than those for the control fe ec with no ti inert electrode which was 0 024 kwh m3 for 88 5 phosphate 3 min to 0 16 kwh m3 for 98 3 removal 20 min due to the increased treatment times energy requirements using the aluminum electrode and the ti electrode were slightly higher with a range of 0 009 kwh m3 for 70 6 removal 1 min to 0 06 kwh m3 for 98 2 7 min treatment time these energy requirements also increased in the absence of the ti electrode with 0 028 kwh m3 for 82 6 p 3 min to 0 19 kwh m3 for 98 3 removal 20 min considering the balance of energy consumption and nutrient removal a 5 min treatment provided the best balance in phosphate removal 98 and energy demand 0 0039 kwh m3 for the fe meaec for treatment of the secondary clarifier wastewater phosphate removals using the iron sacrificial electrode and ti inert electrode in meaec system were all improved relative to the controls no ti electrode or with the aluminum electrode for example at an initial phosphate concentrations 2 4 0 1 mg l 98 p removal was achieved with an energy consumption of 0 023 kwh m3 for iron electrode in 3 min using the iron electrode in the meaec compared to 0 043 kwh m3 for a longer 5 min tests using the al electrode the energy demand of the controls was much larger for example 0 08 kwh m3 for 87 5 phosphate removal using the fe electrode in 10 min compared to 0 09 kwh m3 for 90 phosphate removal using the al electrode see table 2 these energy requirements of meaec system to treat primary clarifier wastewater with the iron sacrificial anode and the ti inert electrode were all less than those reported in other ec studies using al or fe electrodes table 3 for secondary clarifier wastewater treatment which contained lower concentrations of phosphate and organic matter the meaec system also achieved a good level of phosphate removal as it required much shorter treatment times than those reported in previous studies irdemez et al 2006a 2006b 2006c rodrigo et al 2010 4 conclusions a low energy consumption high phosphate removal efficiency meaec process was developed by using a three electrodes reactor containing a sacrificial fe anode air cathode and an inert ti electrode the inert electrode material comparison showed that the ti electrode was more durable and stable than a graphite electrode by setting inert electrode potentials to drive phosphate ions toward the reactor sacrificial anode electrocoagulation times were reduced using the meaec process compared to electrocoagulation with an air cathode in the absence of the inert electrode the electric field generated using the inert electrode achieved a localized accumulation of target ions near the sacrificial anode which subsequently improved phosphate ion removal especially for low influent phosphate concentrations the iron electrode produced better phosphate removals than the aluminum electrode for treating both primary and secondary clarifier effluents based on a balance of treatment time energy usage and p removal the optimal meaec system operation would be using the iron electrode with a 5 min treatment time and five 10 s intervals for the inert electrode working time at a fixed current density of 1 ma cm2 these conditions could achieve 98 phosphate removal with a low energy consumption of 0 039 kwh m3 which was substantially lower than that reported in previous studies in addition the production of the sediment enriched in fe would be preferred than that containing the more toxic al species the use of the fe sacrificial anode also decreased the cost of treatment because the price of fe 910 rmb t is over 20 times less than that of al 19000 rmb t in china based on the success of this laboratory study it is recommended that a meaec system be further investigated at larger scales to see if the low energy consumption could be maintained with larger

19598,a migration electric field assisted electrocoagulation meaec system was developed to increase phosphate removal from domestic wastewater with reduced energy consumption using a titanium charging inert electrode and a sacrificial iron anode in the meaec an electric field was applied between the inert electrode titanium and an air cathode to drive migration of phosphate anions towards the sacrificial anode current was then applied between the sacrificial anode fe or al mesh and the air cathode to drive electrocoagulation of phosphate a meaec with the fe electrode using primary clarifier effluent achieved 98 phosphate removal producing water with a total phosphorus of 0 3 mg l with 6 min total treatment time five cycles each 10 s inert electrode charging and 1 min electrocoagulation at a constant current density of 1 ma cm2 in the absence of the 10 s charging time electrocoagulation required 15 min for the same removal with an aluminum anode and the same phosphorus removal the meaec required 7 cycles 7 min total treatment 1 min 10 s total charging while conventional electrocoagulation required 20 min the energy demand of fe meaec was only 0 039 kwh m3 for 98 phosphate removal which was 35 less than with the al meaec of 0 06 kwh m3 and 28 less than that previously obtained using an inert graphite electrode analysis of the precipitate showed that a less porous precipitate was obtained with the al anode than with the fe anode the phosphorus in precipitate of fe meaec was identified as po4 3 and hpo4 2 while the fe was present as both fe2 and fe3 only hpo4 2 and al3 were identified in the precipitate of the al meaec these results indicated that the meaec with a titanium inert charging electrode and iron anode could achieve the most efficient phosphate removal with very low energy demands compared to previous electrochemical approaches graphical abstract image 1 keywords energy efficiency wastewater treatment electrocoagulation air cathode iron electrode aluminum electrode 1 introduction in recent years avoiding pollution of water bodies has become even more important due to further industrialization and urbanization but the costs of aerobic treatment of wastewaters remain high anaerobic wastewater treatment can be a less expensive and more effective approach to remove organic matter in the wastewater using processes such as anaerobic fluidized bed reactors anaerobic membrane bioreactors kim et al 2010 ren et al 2014 yoo et al 2012 and microbial fuel cells mfcs he et al 2016a kim et al 2015 however only a small fraction of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are removed in these anaerobic processes therefore additional nutrient removal processes are needed following these anaerobic systems to achieve efficient nutrient removal delgado vela et al 2015 phosphorus removal is particularly needed as it is often the controlling factor in the eutrophication of natural water bodies electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical process that can be used to treat wastewaters in terms of both organic matter and nutrient removal gao et al 2017 the process is based on the use of a sacrificial electrode such as aluminum gharibi et al 2010 irdemez et al 2006a kobya et al 2003 that is oxidized to produce metal ions that coagulate and react with organic matter and nutrients removing them from wastewater by chemical precipitation while many different metals have been examined for electrocoagulation gatsios et al 2015 aluminum or iron are most commonly used due to their good flocculation performance as shown for domestic and textile wastewaters abdel gawad et al 2012 gomes et al 2007 hu et al 2003 kobya et al 2003 as well as wastewaters containing boron chorghe et al 2017 or arsenic delaire et al 2017 katal and pahlavanzadeh 2011 wan et al 2011 when current is applied metal ions that are produced react with primary hydroxides and produce polyhyroxides and polyhydroxy metallic flocs pulkka et

of materials and operational conditions on nutrient removal tian et al 2016 including electrode materials chen et al 2014 si et al 2016 ph gatsios et al 2015 gharibi et al 2010 current density bektaş et al 2004 treatment time and initial nutrient concentration of the influent wastewater gharibi et al 2010 irdemez et al 2006c the major advantages of ec are convenient operational procedures high pollutant removal performance and no requirement of chemical addition into the wastewater however the high electricity and anode material costs have limited more widespread applications of ec processes for wastewater treatment one method recently developed to reduce energy costs was based on using an air breathing cathode to directly reduce oxygen as opposed to aerating the wastewater or driving electrochemical hydrogen production at the cathode tian et al 2016 the use of this cathode was shown to provide effective ec wastewater treatment using an aluminum anode a second recent advance to reduce energy demands and improve the efficiency of phosphate removal was the application of an electric field applied for a short period of time 10 120 s between an additional inert anode graphite positioned in between the sacrificial anode and the cathode tian et al 2017 this charging process drove phosphate ion migration to the sacrificial anode and subsequently improved phosphate ion removal in the subsequent ec process the lower energy and material consumption were found to improve the overall removal of phosphate compared to sustained ec without the initial charging cycle while the energy needed for ec was reduced to 0 14 kwh m3 which was among the lowest yet reported for ec processes this energy demand was still considered to be higher than that desired for a process for phosphate removal from wastewater tian et al 2017 in order to further improve the electrochemical removal of phosphate from domestic wastewaters the migration electric field assisted electrocoagulation meaec system was modified to use new materials in order to reduce energy production improve nutrient removal and produce a more environmentally friendly precipitate first to reduce energy consumption by increasing current when applying a fixed voltage 0 5 v a titanium plate was used instead of graphite sheet as the inert electrode situated between the sacrificial anode and air cathode second a sacrificial iron electrode was used to avoid the production of an aluminum sludge that would be a more toxic byproduct to demonstrate the improved performance of the system with the iron anode experiments were conducted with both the iron and aluminum mesh anodes and the ti inert electrode meaec and without the applied electric field ec control using both primary and secondary clarifier effluents the morphologies of the titanium and graphite inert electrodes and the precipitates formed in the process with these anodes were studied with a scanning electron microscope sem the chemical composition of the precipitates were further investigated with energy dispersive spectrum analysis eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode materials and reactor operating conditions meaec reactors were constructed as previously described tian et al 2017 except different inert and sacrificial anode materials were used here a titanium plate 3 7 cm2 was used as the inert electrode and its charge discharge current and durability was compared to a graphite sheet used in previous studies 3 7 cm2 the sacrificial anodes were either iron mesh mesh size 100 per 2 54 cm wire diameter 0 017 mm opening 0 03 mm yingkai corporation china or aluminum mesh mesh size 200 per 2 54 cm wire diameter 0 05 mm opening 0 07 mm twp corporation usa the projected surface areas of the sacrificial anodes were 15 cm2 3 5 cm2 cathodes used an activated carbon catalyst for oxygen reduction and were made by a continuous rolling and pressing process with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe as the binder and an outer ptfe diffusion layer to avoid water leakage through the cathode dong et al 2012 he et al 2016b all reactors were operated in batch mode the meaec reactors consisted of an inert electrode titanium plate a sacrificial anode aluminum iron mesh and an air cathode while the control ec reactor was made using only the sacrificial anode and air cathode the sacrificial anode was placed between inert anode and cathode with 1 5 cm between the sacrificial anode and air cathode and 2 cm between inert anode and air cathode a potentiostat vmp3 biologic claix france was used to set voltages or current for the meaec reactors a constant voltage of 0 5 v was first applied between inert anode and air cathode for 10 s then the sacrificial anode was connected with air cathode in electric circuit and operated with constant current density of 1 ma cm2 for 1 min while the inert anode was disconnected with cathode these two steps formed a single working cycle and the cycles repeated until the phosphorus concentration was lower than the detection limit 0 1 mg l the control ec reactor was operated continuously at a constant current density of 1 ma cm2 between anode and cathode the durability of the two inert electrodes titanium plate or graphite sheet over time was compared in charging and discharging tests with an air breathing cathode and a synthetic nutrient solution the charge and discharge times were both set at 90 s with an applied voltage of 0 5 v for 400 cycles for both types of electrodes the surface structure of ti and graphite electrodes were then examined using a scanning electron microscope sem to evaluate changes in the electrode surfaces due to oxidation or corrosion the charge transfer efficiency of different electrode materials was evaluated by the current produced over 400 charging discharging cycles the effectiveness of the ti electrode on phosphate removal was further compared to that obtained using a graphite electrode with aluminum mesh as the sacrificial anode for the advanced treatment of both primary high phosphorous concentration and secondary low phosphorus concentration clarifier effluent the inert electrode working time 10 s and total electrocoagulation times 1 3 5 and 7 min were selected based on detectable final concentrations of phosphate the impact of ec on phosphate removal and energy utilization was also compared with a fixed inert electrode time of 10 s the control ec was operated with a continuous working time of 3 5 10 15 and 20 min for primary clarifier effluent and 1 3 5 and 10 min for secondary clarifier effluent based on obtaining a final phosphate concentration below the limit of detection 0 1 mg l for meaec tests the total treatment times were 1 3 5 and 7 min for primary clarifier effluent and 1 2 3 and 5 min for secondary clarifier effluent following each electrocoagulation period particles were allowed to settle in the reactor for 1 h no applied current cathodes were cleaned after every 100 batch cycles by soaking the cathode in a diluted 10 hydrochloric acid solution bdh aristar plus vwr for 2 min to remove salt deposits all tests were conducted using duplicate reactors at 25 c with results reported based on the average and standard deviations sd 2 2 wastewater and synthetic nutrient solution the two wastewater sources primary clarifier effluent and secondary clarifier effluent were both obtained from the wenchang municipal wastewater treatment harbin china and stored at 4 c prior to use the primary clarifier effluent had a ph of 6 8 7 1 a conductivity of 900 μs cm an ammonia concentration of 48 2 mg l a total nitrogen concentration of 65 3 mg l and a phosphate concentration of 17 1 mg l the secondary clarifier effluent had a ph of 7 7 2 a conductivity of 600 μs cm an ammonia concentration of 8 0 5 mg l a total nitrogen of 22 1 mg l and a phosphate concentration of 2 4 0 1 mg l the synthetic nutrient solution contained 1200 mg l nah2po4 sigma aldrich in order to produce the same conductivity as the primary clarifier wastewater 2 3 solution measurements and calculations before phosphate measurements all samples were filtered using 0 45 μm pore diameter syringe filters polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf 25 mm diameter restek corporation samples were analyzed using method 10031 hach company loveland co for phosphate method 10127 hach company loveland co for ammonia and method 10071 for total nitrogen the removal efficiencies were calculated from the initial and final concentrations voltage and the counter electrode potential were recorded at 1 s intervals and analyzed using the potentiostat software ec lab v10 02 energy consumption e kwh m3 for ec wastewater treatment was calculated as w uit v where u is the voltage v i the current a t the electrolysis time s and v the volume of reactor m3 in charge and discharge tests the total inert electrode charge q c was calculated by summing the total charge transferred over both the charging and discharging cycles based on the current where q lt the power p ui to polarize the inert electrode was not included in this calculation as there was only a tiny current 2 4 characterization techniques microstructural study tests were conducted on the precipitates and electrodes using a scanning electron microscope sem quanta200 fei co equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the particles sizes in the sem images were calculated by image analysis using the open platform software of image j surface chemical characterization was performed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using a thermo scientific escalab 250xi spectrometer with a six channel channeltron detector high resolution spectra of the elements identified were corrected using the c1s signal 285 ev as a reference and then the percentages of each element presented in the generated sediment were calculated relative to this signal the precipitates produced from the ec process were dried overnight and ground up for xps analysis and prepared for sem analysis after the gold sputtering treated after 400 cycles the ti and graphite electrodes were dried at 80 c overnight prior to sem analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of titanium and graphite inert electrodes to demonstrate that using a titanium electrode could improve electrochemical performance titanium plate and graphite sheet electrodes were compared in charge and discharge tests using a synthetic nutrient solution no sacrificial anode installed after 400 cycles the graphite electrode absorbed 29 more charge 69 600 c than the ti electrode 49 516 c therefore the ti electrode was relatively more inert in wastewater due to less current transferred which would result in a longer service time and less energy consumption compared to graphite the maximum current produced with the ti electrode fig 1 a was 0 2 ma which was only 5 of that compared to graphite 4 ma fig 1b which also indicated the titanium was less active than graphite the surfaces morphologies obtained using sem of the ti and graphite electrodes indicated the more stable structure of ti than graphite the surface morphology of ti was not noticeably altered after 400 cycles while holes cracks and obvious deformations were observed on graphite electrode surface after the charging and discharging tests fig 2 the large changes in surface morphologies of the graphite electrodes suggested that they were oxidized during electrochemical tests 3 2 treatment of primary clarifier effluent using meaec phosphate removal using primary clarifier effluent was examined in meaec reactors using iron sacrificial anodes fe meaec with each cycle consisting of an applied voltage of 0 5 v between the inert and air cathode for 10 s followed by a constant current density of 1 ma cm2 between the sacrificial anode and air cathode for 1 min phosphate removals increased with treatment time with 76 5 removal using primary clarifier effluent for one cycle and 88 5 for three cycles after 5 cycles there was nearly complete phosphate removal 98 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 3 mg l and no detectable phosphate 0 1 mg l in the effluent after 7 cycles fig 3 a the performance of the fe meaec system was further compared to the control reactor without an inert electrode fe ec fig 3b after the first 3 min of electrocoagulation the phosphate removal of primary clarifier effluent was 88 5 which was very similar with that of meaec however after 5 min of electrocoagulation the phosphate removal was only 93 5 compared to 98 6 for the meaec after 5 min after 10 min of electrocoagulation the phosphate removal of fe ec was 97 and 15 20 min was required to reach a comparable phosphate removal of 98 obtained using the meaec after 6 min 5 min 50 s the differences between fe meaec and control fe ec indicated that the meaec greatly improved phosphate removals for wastewaters with low nutrient concentrations the localized accumulation of target ions near the sacrificial anode by charging inert electrode was considered to be the primary reason which allowed for a greater opportunity for the phosphate ions to be attracted to the sacrificial electrode and thus to more rapidly form precipitates with metal ions or to be absorbed by the flocs for the meaec using the al sacrificial anode phosphate removal of the primary clarifier effluent was 71 6 with one working cycle 10 s migration process 1 min electrolysis time and it increased to 89 5 after 3 working cycles reached fig 3b this was much better than the phosphate removal for the control reactor using an al electrode without an inert electrode al ec which was only 82 6 after 3 min a total of 10 min of working time was needed for the al ec reactor to obtain a similar phosphate removal 97 as that of the al meaec for the same working time of 5 min 6 min including inert electrode charging times the al ec required 15 20 min of treatment to achieve the same as that with the al meaec using only 7 min of treatment time not including inert electrode charging a comparison of the fe meaec and al meaec systems show that they obtained similar phosphate removals of 89 in the first 3 working cycles however after 7 working cycles the effluent phosphate concentration of fe meaec was near the detectable level 0 1 mg l 1 while that of al meaec was still 0 3 mg l 1 this indicated the fe meaec had a slight advantage in reducing phosphate more rapidly to low concentrations both the fe meaec and al meaec required only 50 of the working time compared to the controls for achieving a phosphate removal of 97 the major factor leading to better performance of meaec was the use of the inert anode and its impact on ion migration due to the assisted electric field which localized accumulated target phosphate ions and enhanced the precipitate forming with metal ions the performance of the al meaec system using a titanium inert electrode was compared to the graphite electrode used in previous tests using primarily clarifier effluent over multiple cycles phosphate removals were similar for the two inert materials fig s1 with 70 98 removal using the titanium electrode as the inert electrode fig s1a and 72 97 using the graphite electrode fig s1b thus while the phosphate removals are similar for both ti and graphite inert electrodes under these conditions the much greater stability of the ti electrode made it a better choice as the inert electrode 3 3 treatment of secondary clarifier effluent using the meaec secondary clarifier effluent that had lower organic matter and phosphate concentrations was also tested with both meaec and control ec reactors fig 4 the phosphate removal for the fe meaec reactor increased rapidly in the first 1 3 working cycles from 71 5 to 96 1 0 1 mg l 1 in effluent after that the phosphate removal was essentially constant after 5 working cycles since the phosphate was nearly completely removed phosphate removal by the control fe ec was much lower with 46 6 to 85 2 removals for 1 and 5 min fig 4a with up to a 10 min working time the control fe ec fig 4b achieved only 88 2 phosphate removal with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 the fe meaec however required only 2 working cycles to achieve a higher phosphate removal of 92 2 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 similar trends were observed between the reactors using al electrodes for the al meaec fig 4c and control al ec fig 4d the phosphate removal of the al meaec increased from 67 5 for 1 working cycle to 94 2 with 3 working cycles with 96 removal and an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 after 5 working cycles however the control al ec had a phosphate removal of only 85 2 with a 5 min working time and 88 2 with a 10 min working time 0 3 mg l 1 in effluent compared to only 2 cycles needed for 88 2 phosphorus removal using the al meaec both control reactors fe ec and al ec were inefficient in removing phosphorus from the secondary clarifier effluent due to the lower initial phosphate concentrations 2 4 mg l compared to 17 mg l for the primary clarifier effluent the minimum concentration of phosphate that could be achieved with these two processes was 0 3 mg l 1 for both primary and secondary clarifier effluents however by using the inert electrode in the meaec it was still possible to reduce the effluent phosphate concentration to 0 1 mg l 1 considering other possible conditions that could impact phosphate removals such as suspended solids and cods the meaec performance was still excellent and thus it demonstrated good performance even for secondary clarifier effluent treatment based on the comparison of the fe and al sacrificial anodes the fe meaec was slightly better in performance than the al meaec for 3 working cycles indicating the advantages of the fe electrode with low phosphate concentrations in secondary effluent 3 4 chemical and morphological analysis of precipitates and electrodes 3 4 1 morphology and composition of the sediment by sem eds the morphologies of the precipitate collected from the control ec with both fe and al electrode after treating primary clarifier effluent were examined by sem fig 5 the particles in the precipitate from the control fe ec were 0 45 0 07 μm range of 0 2 0 6 μm which were relatively smaller and more spherical than those collected from control al ec 1 69 0 33 μm unlike the loosely organized particles of control fe ec precipitate the particles of control al ec were closely packed together and formed a bulk precipitate although there is direct reaction of the metal with phosphate ions to form flocs sweep and adsorption effects are considered as the main mechanisms for conventional electrocoagulation processes to remove nutrition ions lacasa et al 2011 moreno casillas et al 2007 therefore the smaller particles and loose structure of the precipitate from fe ec may contribute to its better phosphate removal compared to the al ec fig s2 the surface elemental composition and atomic number percentage of the sediments obtained by eds showed that the most abundant elements in the sediment were c n and p for both electrodes with a higher content of fe or al depending on the specific electrode table 1 the surface elemental composition and atomic percentages of the precipitate from the control fe ec and al ec tests were obtained by eds analysis the most abundant elements in both precipitates were al or fe c o n and p while differences were observed in the atomic number percentages table 1 the electrocoagulation system has been proven to contribute to cod and nitrogen removal lacasa et al 2011 lin et al 2017 therefore the elements of c o n were also observed in precipitates however at treatment times of 1 20 min there was little effective total nitrogen removal with an influent tn of 65 2 mg l and an effluent tn of 62 2 mg l the atomic ratio of fe elements was 23 from the precipitate of control fe ec system while that of al elements was similar at 20 the atomic percentage of phosphorus was 3 4 for the precipitate from the control fe ec system which was almost twice than that of control al ec system 1 8 indicating the higher efficiency of fe as a sacrificial electrode without the assistance of inert electrode the results of the elemental composition are consistent with the better performance of the fe electrode than al electrode in treating the primary clarifier effluent fig 3 3 4 2 determination of surface elemental composition of precipitates by xps in order to identify the valences of the composite elements in the precipitates of the primary clarifier effluent treatment xps analyses were performed for the meaec and the control with both fe and al electrodes nitrogen was detected in the precipitate of from the meaec and control ec reactors consistent with the above results and previous studies lacasa et al 2011 the phosphorus signals in the control ec and meaec with fe electrode were identified as po4 3 and hpo4 2 while the fe elements existed in both fe2 709 5 709 6 ev and fe3 711 8 ev oxidation states however only hpo4 2 and al3 73 8 ev were identified in the systems with al electrode the ph with fe electrode electrocoagulation was near neutral while that of al electrode electrocoagulation was higher due to the longer working times lacasa et al 2011 this change in ph was likely the reason for the existence of the hpo4 2 signal in the comparison of control ec and meaec the atomic proportion of fe from sacrificial anode was reduced from 3 2 to 1 7 by applying inert electrode while that of al was reduced from 12 5 to 8 9 however with the reduction in the atomic proportion of fe and al from the control ec to meaec tests the atomic proportion of phosphorus was slightly increased for both the fe electrode from 1 9 to 2 system and the al electrode from 1 7 to 1 9 system these data indicated that the migration electrical field and inert electrode could effectively reduce the consumption of sacrificial anodes in meaec with the improved efficiency more notable for the fe meaec xps results further demonstrated that there was more efficient phosphate removal with the meaec using fe instead of the al compared to the xps results of the controls with meaec there was no change in the chemical composition of the generated precipitate due to the use of meaec but the decreased elemental content of fe and al in the precipitate demonstrated that the meaec played a role of increasing local phosphate concentrations near the sacrificial electrode comparing the fe precipitate composition using the fe or al electrode the generated flocs containing iron would have less toxicity than those containing high concentrations of aluminum and the iron rich material could easily be safely recycled cheng et al 2012 there were no appreciable nitrogen and ammonia removals from solution although nitrogen was detected using xps in the sediment suggesting minimal nitrogen removal by adsorption 3 5 energy consumption phosphate removals increased with treatment time although more time resulted in greater energy consumption when the iron electrode was used as the sacrificial anode treating primary clarifier wastewater the meaec used only 0 007 kwh m3 for a 1 min treatment with 76 5 phosphate removal and up to 0 039 kwh m3 for a 7 min treatment to achieve 98 2 removal these energy requirements were much less than those for the control fe ec with no ti inert electrode which was 0 024 kwh m3 for 88 5 phosphate 3 min to 0 16 kwh m3 for 98 3 removal 20 min due to the increased treatment times energy requirements using the aluminum electrode and the ti electrode were slightly higher with a range of 0 009 kwh m3 for 70 6 removal 1 min to 0 06 kwh m3 for 98 2 7 min treatment time these energy requirements also increased in the absence of the ti electrode with 0 028 kwh m3 for 82 6 p 3 min to 0 19 kwh m3 for 98 3 removal 20 min considering the balance of energy consumption and nutrient removal a 5 min treatment provided the best balance in phosphate removal 98 and energy demand 0 0039 kwh m3 for the fe meaec for treatment of the secondary clarifier wastewater phosphate removals using the iron sacrificial electrode and ti inert electrode in meaec system were all improved relative to the controls no ti electrode or with the aluminum electrode for example at an initial phosphate concentrations 2 4 0 1 mg l 98 p removal was achieved with an energy consumption of 0 023 kwh m3 for iron electrode in 3 min using the iron electrode in the meaec compared to 0 043 kwh m3 for a longer 5 min tests using the al electrode the energy demand of the controls was much larger for example 0 08 kwh m3 for 87 5 phosphate removal using the fe electrode in 10 min compared to 0 09 kwh m3 for 90 phosphate removal using the al electrode see table 2 these energy requirements of meaec system to treat primary clarifier wastewater with the iron sacrificial anode and the ti inert electrode were all less than those reported in other ec studies using al or fe electrodes table 3 for secondary clarifier wastewater treatment which contained lower concentrations of phosphate and organic matter the meaec system also achieved a good level of phosphate removal as it required much shorter treatment times than those reported in previous studies irdemez et al 2006a 2006b 2006c rodrigo et al 2010 4 conclusions a low energy consumption high phosphate removal efficiency meaec process was developed by using a three electrodes reactor containing a sacrificial fe anode air cathode and an inert ti electrode the inert electrode material comparison showed that the ti electrode was more durable and stable than a graphite electrode by setting inert electrode potentials to drive phosphate ions toward the reactor sacrificial anode electrocoagulation times were reduced using the meaec process compared to electrocoagulation with an air cathode in the absence of the inert electrode the electric field generated using the inert electrode achieved a localized accumulation of target ions near the sacrificial anode which subsequently improved phosphate ion removal especially for low influent phosphate concentrations the iron electrode produced better phosphate removals than the aluminum electrode for treating both primary and secondary clarifier effluents based on a balance of treatment time energy usage and p removal the optimal meaec system operation would be using the iron electrode with a 5 min treatment time and five 10 s intervals for the inert electrode working time at a fixed current density of 1 ma cm2 these conditions could achieve 98 phosphate removal with a low energy consumption of 0 039 kwh m3 which was substantially lower than that reported in previous studies in addition the production of the sediment enriched in fe would be preferred than that containing the more toxic al species the use of the fe sacrificial anode also decreased the cost of treatment because the price of fe 910 rmb t is over 20 times less than that of al 19000 rmb t in china based on the success of this laboratory study it is recommended that a meaec system be further investigated at larger scales to see if the low energy consumption could be maintained with larger

19599,silver impregnated activated carbon siac has been found to be effective in mitigating the formation of brominated disinfection by products during drinking water treatment however there are still uncertainties regarding its silver leaching properties and strategies for the prevention of silver leaching have remained elusive this study focused on the evaluation of one type of commercially available siac for its ability to remove bromide while minimising silver leaching from the material both synthetic and real water matrices were tested depending on solution ph it was found that changing the surface charge properties of siac as measured by the point of zero charge ph can result in additional bromide removal while minimising the extent of silver leaching to better understand the mechanism of silver leaching from the siac eight preconditioning environments i e variable ph and ionic strength were tested for a fixed amount of siac and two preconditioning environments were selected for a more detailed investigation experiments carried out in synthetic water showed that preconditioning at ph 10 4 did not deteriorate the capacity of siac to remove bromide but significantly decreased the release of silver in the form of ionic silver ag silver bromide agbr and silver chloride agcl from 40 for the pristine to 3 for the treated siac this was confirmed using a

activated carbon siac bromide removal silver leaching point of zero charge ph phpzc adsorption 1 introduction naturally occurring bromide in drinking water source creates a multitude of problems for water utilities allard et al 2015 heeb et al 2014 when water is disinfected by chlorine bromide is rapidly converted to hypobromous acid hobr bousher et al 1986 which reacts in an analogous way to chlorine hocl and forms brominated disinfection by products br dbps heeb et al 2014 however reactions involving hobr are generally several orders of magnitude faster than those of hocl criquet et al 2015 2012 br dbps are more physiologically active and more toxic than their chlorinated analogues flury and papritz 1993 in addition to the formation of disinfection by products bromide in source water causes water quality problems including increased disinfectant loss allard et al 2017 sedlak and von gunten 2011 and higher concentrations of odorous brominated compounds acero et al 2005 mcdonald et al 2013 the presence of bromide is sometimes advantageous e g it acts as a catalyst during chlorination and therefore enhances the rate of manganese ii oxidation to mno2 which is removed by a filtration process and increases the rate of iodide oxidation to iodate minimising the formation of toxic i dbps allard et al 2015 criquet et al 2012 however br dbps and organic bromine typically measured as adsorbable organic bromine aobr have recently been reported as the dominant halogenated species after chlorination of ground and surface raw waters containing high concentrations of bromide langsa et al 2017 tan et al 2016 in addition during disinfection with ozone bromide can form bromate a regulated dbp and suspected carcinogen von gunten 2003 although its formation may be minimised by ph control or ammonia addition for example allard et al 2013 buffle et al 2004 obviously the best strategy to avoid the formation of br dbps is to remove bromide prior to the final disinfection step there is currently no commercialised method for the selective removal of bromide from drinking water sources membrane processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration are the only commercially available methods which can effectively remove halides to very low levels harrison et al 2007 khan et al 2005 however these are not considered economical where the primary objective is bromide reduction due to issues such as susceptibility to fouling and scaling high energy consumption short lifespan and high cost these shortcomings and the fact that membrane processes actually treat water to a much higher purity than required have led to a need for alternative methods to remove bromide studies investigating the selective removal of bromide have mainly focused on adsorption techniques which can be readily retrofitted to existing conventional water treatment processes for minimal capital and operational cost activated carbon ac materials have conventionally been effective for the sorption of organic carbon but several recent studies reported that ac materials have low selectivity for bromide uptake in natural waters hoskins et al 2002 kristiana et al 2011 watson et al 2016 silver halides are very insoluble in water with their solubility constants ksp at 25 c decreasing in the reverse order of their occurrence in natural waters agcl ksp 2 8 10 10 agbr ksp 5 2 10 13 agi ksp 8 5 10 17 haynes 2014 hence even in the presence of high concentrations of chloride i e 100 fold higher than bromide and iodide these minor ions can be selectively removed from solution using silver however the direct addition of silver as in silver salts to water is not practical due to the difficulties in removing very fine silver particulates from water agx not to mention ethical and regulatory hurdles surrounding the prospect of adding silver directly to water supplies the australian drinking water guideline maximum value for silver is 0 1 mg l therefore a form of silver that is immobilised for example within a filter medium would be a potential solution for the removal of undesirable halides in a water treatment process silver doped carbon aerogels ag aerogel were successfully synthesized and assessed for the simultaneous removal of bromide and iodide from synthetic and natural waters sánchez polo et al 2007a 2007b these studies showed that the ag aerogels have high bromide uptake capacity above 90 while the addition of excess chloride cl 40 mg l reduced the capacity to adsorb bromide by 36 however the extent of silver leaching was not determined in this research where relatively high concentrations of silver 4 10 wt silver compared to those of bromide 0 10 μm were used sánchez polo et al 2007a silver impregnated activated carbon siac materials are known for their excellent antibacterial properties in water disinfection processes and have been utilised for this purpose for a number of years bandyopadhyaya et al 2008 ortiz ibarra et al 2007 due to the high affinity of halide ions towards silver recent research has shown that siac can also be a promising alternative for the removal of halides from water gong et al 2013 hoskins et al 2002 watson et al 2016 a recent study compared the efficiency of a commercially available siac with 0 1 wt silver and its equivalent unimpregnated activated carbon for the simultaneous removal of bromide iodide and nom from water watson et al 2016 up to 95 of bromide was removed by the combination of enhanced coagulation ec with siac while only 26 of bromide was removed by ec coupled with unimpregnated activated carbon however it was mentioned that further investigation on silver leaching is required before full scale application watson et al 2016 the method of siac preparation was improved to enhance br removal from natural waters and to mitigate the formation of brominated trihalomethanes thms chen et al 2017 similar to the study of watson et al 2016 the impact of ec combined with a siac treatment was evaluated except that the ec treatment was applied after the siac up to 40 br removal was achieved during the siac treatment however the addition of alum ec was not beneficial in this configuration chen et al 2017 although the silver impregnation process was identified as one of the main factors affecting the br removal efficiency no quantification on the extent of silver leaching from the siac was reported in the literature therefore the main objective of this research was to better understand the mechanisms of silver leaching from siac used for bromide removal applications under typical water treatment conditions in this study several factors that govern the practicalities of the use of siac including the bromide removal efficiency and the leaching of silver from the siac into the treated water were investigated in synthetic waters first different preconditioning of siac were tested to reduce silver leaching based on its surface properties i e point of zero charge ph then the release of silver and the adsorption of bromide were compared in both pristine and conditioned siac in the last step the bromide removal efficiency and silver leaching from siac were examined in a real water sample to identify the most important interferences from components of a natural water matrix 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and analytical

equipped with phc101 electrode the point of zero charge phpzc was determined using siac 0 15 g in a sodium nitrate nano3 50 ml of a 10 mm solution at different phs the ph was adjusted by addition of naoh 10 mm or hno3 10 mm and the solutions were agitated for 72 h putra et al 2009 the phpzc was estimated to be 7 2 0 1 2 2 siac washing and pre treatment to remove fine particulates and water soluble impurities siac particles were thoroughly washed 15 times with ultrapure water until a clear supernatant was obtained dried siac 30 00 g was weighed into a clean beaker and was then rinsed in ultrapure water 200 ml followed by ultrasonication for 5 min at ambient temperature this was necessary to ensure loose silver carbon fines were removed from the siac porous structure therefore 15 times washed siac was used throughout this study unless otherwise indicated the resulting siac particles were then dried overnight at 110 c for further use to evaluate the impact of washing on the chemical properties of the conditioned siac samples were taken from the waste washing water after the first second third tenth and the last washing step the samples were then filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter and analysed for silver chloride and nitrate the 15 times washed siac called pristine siac in this manuscript was further treated under various ph and ionic strength conditions the ph and ionic strength values for the conditioning solutions were adjusted using sodium hydroxide naoh 100 mm and sodium perchlorate naclo4 1 m respectively 2 3 evaluation of silver concentration in siac siac particles were dried in the oven at 110 c for 4 h to remove moisture from the samples before measurement of the silver content then the dried siac was accurately weighed and placed in a muffle furnace at 650 5 c silver extraction from the ashed siac samples was completed through acid digestion briefly nitric acid 40 v v 50 ml was added to the ashed samples the mixture was vigorously stirred and heated until the volume was reduced to about 20 ml this procedure was repeated and the hot solution was filtered through a qualitative filter paper whatman grade 4 20 25 μm nominal pore size after cooling the final solution was made up to 100 ml in a volumetric flask using ultrapure water prior to silver measurement using atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas 2 4 evaluation of silver concentration in the solutions previous studies on silver leaching have shown that iodide removal from solution using siac could occur either via the immobilisation of iodide on silver ion attached to the siac or by precipitation of silver ion in solution to form immobilised silver precipitates hoskins et al 2002 the concentrations of dissolved and immobilised silver in solution were monitored before and after experiments using both pristine and preconditioned siac in order to evaluate the dissolved and precipitated silver concentration in the solutions the siac was first removed from the solution by filtering the solution 500 ml through a qualitative filter paper whatman grade 4 20 25 μm nominal pore size followed by the addition of 6 ml concentrated hno3 the solution was vigorously stirred and heated until the volume was reduced to about 50 ml the final solution was made up to 100 ml with purified water in a volumetric flask prior to analysis using aas for the determination of dissolved silver treated water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter to ensure undissolved colloidal silver particles are screened prior to the acid digestion 2 5 batch adsorption studies batch adsorption tests were carried out by adding dried siac samples 0 40 g to synthetic water samples 500 ml lovibond jar testing apparatus with 6 stirring places equipped with a water bath was used for the isothermal kinetic and equilibrium studies at 30 0 5 c with a stirring rate of 150 rpm in order to compare the ion uptake and leaching capacity of the siac for all experiments the following correction factor was used sánchez polo et al 2007a 1 c t v l m a c t ins where ct μmol g is the liquid phase concentration per unit mass of siac ct ins μmol l is the liquid phase concentration read by instrument vl l is the total volume of solution and ma g represents the mass of siac no buffer solution was used for the purpose of ph adjustment so that interferences by coexisting ions could be prevented the ph values were therefore monitored during the experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 bromide uptake complexation with silver vs physisorption on siac bromide solutions were stirred with a fixed amount of siac 0 8 g l for up to 3 h the bromide removals achieved were 98 and 93 for the two lowest bromide concentrations of 12 5 and 25 μm respectively fig 1 a however when the initial bromide concentration was increased to 75 μm only 53 of bromide was removed through siac as expected the percent bromide removal decreased with increasing bromide concentration presumably due to the limited number of accessible silver available to react with bromide chen et al 2017 gong et al 2013 watson et al 2016 this trend is also in agreement with other studies using ag doped carbon aerogels for bromide removal applications sánchez polo et al 2007a however the amount of bromide removed by the siac up to 62 5 μmol was significantly higher than the silver content of the siac 5 4 μmol equal to 0 11 wt therefore these results suggest that there should be other mechanisms involved in the bromide removal through siac fig 1b showed that the uptake of bromide was inversely correlated to the release of chloride in the presence of 12 5 μm bromide a slightly higher chloride concentration 15 5 μm was released in solution after the siac treatment by increasing the initial bromide concentration to 75 μm the amount of chloride in solution was consequently increased to about 35 μm overall increasing the initial bromide concentration promoted the release of chloride which may suggest the involvement of an ion exchange process i e bromide ions exchange with chloride ions entrained within the siac pores in a control experiment without bromide the extent of silver and chloride leaching were determined over the first 90 min of contact time where ph decreased from 6 5 to 4 3 fig s1 the amount of silver leached into the solution was similar to that of chloride with a maximum of 6 5 μmol g this suggests that most of the silver is leached out from pristine siac as agcl a maximum of less than 1 μmol g of nitrate was leached from siac for a contact time of 180 min data not shown suggesting that silver leaching from siac was not in the form of silver nitrate as had been suggested in a previous study watson et al 2016 the phpzc has been widely used to determine the surface charge and electrostatic properties of siac and ag doped aerogels in bromide removal applications chen et al 2017 sánchez polo et al 2007b a schematic illustrating the proposed interactions between the silver particles with halide is shown in fig 2 when phsolution phpzc the siac is in a favourable condition to hold ag which attracts the negatively charged halides from the solution via chemisorption pathway 1 when phsolution phpzc silver is released from the siac to the bulk solution and repulsive electrostatic interactions between negatively charged siac and halides occur leading to the formation of agx in the aqueous phase pathway 2 the siac phpzc was measured as 7 2 which was greater than the solution ph 6 5 and therefore the siac surface would be positively charged phsolution phpzc consequently the attraction of bromide anions to the siac by electrostatic interactions is favoured since agbr is less soluble than agcl mijnendonckx et al 2013 the formation of agbr s is favoured over the formation of agcl s during the bromide removal process however since in natural waters the concentration of chloride is typically 300 fold greater than that of bromide sánchez polo et al 2007b watson et al 2016 the chloride interference and also silver leaching due to the release of agcl from conventional siac would possibly be significant both of these considerations limit the practicality of using conventional siac in drinking water treatment operations therefore novel approaches to mitigate silver leaching and increase the fraction of bromide reaction by direct complexation with silver at the surface of siac were investigated 3 2 impact of siac preconditioning on silver leaching in order to mitigate silver leaching and to assess the capacity of siac to remove bromide via direct complexation the siac was preconditioned at various ph and ionic strengths the extent of silver and chloride leaching was recorded after 3 h in solutions containing 0 8 g l siac fig 3 a and b the amount of chloride leaching increased from 20 to 54 μmol g while the silver leaching was drastically reduced from 6 3 μmol g to below detection limit 0 02 mg l with increasing ph from 6 to 10 4 fig 3a this indicates that hydroxides oh are replacing cl at the surface of the siac in another experiment the influence of ionic strength was investigated sodium perchlorate was used because the perchlorate ion is less likely than other ions to precipitate silver and has a high affinity to replace the chloride at the surface of the siac gu et al 2001 haynes 2014 increasing sodium perchlorate concentration from 0 1 to 1 mm slightly increased the chloride release from 33 to 47 μmol g and significantly reduced silver leaching from 6 μmol g to below detection limit fig 3b from these results two methods for preconditioning the siac were selected ph 8 2 with naclo4 at 1 mm and ph 10 4 without naclo4 the preconditioning procedures were repeated five times using fresh solutions at each stage to maximise chloride removal from siac in both cases the highest levels of both silver and cl were leached in the first step tables s1 and s2 during the first treatment preconditioning at high ph 10 4 led to a higher leaching of cl from the siac 31 4 μmol g compared to the preconditioning with 1 mm naclo4 at ph 8 2 13 8 μmol g tables s1 and s2 this is explained by the higher affinity of hydroxide groups for the exchange with chloride compared to perchlorate cañizares et al 2006 mahmudov and huang 2010 yoon et al 2009 after 5 treatments both preconditioning methods showed reduced level of cl leaching 6 6 and 2 μmol g for the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 with naclo4 and ph 10 4 respectively furthermore the silver release for the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 with naclo4 was similar between the first and the fifth treatment fluctuating between 0 03 and 0 06 μmol g while no silver was detected during the two last treatments of siac at ph 10 4 tables s1 and s2 this showed that preconditioning at higher ph would be more efficient in the mitigation of silver leaching from siac the rate of silver and chloride leaching from the siac treated under each preconditioning environment were also presented in figs s1a and b comparing the silver leaching for preconditioned after the 5 treatments vs pristine siac fig s1a clearly showed that preconditioning at higher ph ph 10 4 was successful in minimising silver leaching in the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 the silver concentrations in solutions were below the analytical detection limit 0 02 mg l compared to 0 4 μmol g for the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 in naclo4 and 5 3 μmol g for pristine siac for the chloride leaching preconditioning at ph 8 2 in naclo4 reduced the chloride in solution compared to the pristine 4 2 and 6 5 μmol g after 90 min respectively while for the siac treated at ph 10 4 only 1 μmol g was released in solution to further assess the efficiency of the two selected preconditioning approaches for mitigating silver release bromide removal experiments were carried out where the mass of silver coating was determined before and after exposure to bromide containing waters using both pristine and preconditioned siac table 2 showed that preconditioning at ph 10 4 greatly increased the amount of silver retained on the siac as a small difference between the initial 13 2 μmol g and final 12 9 μmol g silver content which represented a loss of only 3 was observed likewise a lower loss of silver from 40 to about 16 was observed when the pristine siac was preconditioned in 1 mm of perchlorate at ph 8 2 which may be due to its lower initial silver coating compared to the pristine siac table 2 overall the preconditioning at ph 10 4 seems to be more efficient in reducing silver leaching the total amount of silver that remained in solution after the bromide removal experiment were also measured for each type of siac the highest silver concentration precipitated dissolved in solution was measured for the pristine siac 3 8 μmol g table 2 on the other hand for the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 only 0 8 μmol g was measured in solution in this study both pristine and preconditioned siac are expected to be positively charged in solution however it is hypothesised that the chloride contamination of the pristine siac leads to a release of silver to the solution since the agbr solubility is extremely low ksp 5 2 10 13 haynes 2014 any agbr formed will tend to precipitate immediately on the adjacent ag coating pretty 2011 the more soluble agcl can diffuse away from the siac to the aqueous phase the higher agcl solubility allows it to diffuse into the bulk solution as opposed to immediate precipitation on the ag coating and thereby cause a high loss of ag overall the preconditioning of siac at high ph has high potential to alter the bromide and silver interaction from an aqueous phase precipitation reaction to a chemisorption mechanism occurring on the surface of siac 3 3 impact of siac preconditioning on bromide removal as shown in figs 4a and s2 the bromide removal as well as the release of chloride was investigated for both pristine and preconditioned siac samples similarly for all initial bromide concentrations the use of pristine siac resulted in a lower bromide residual in solution compared to both of the preconditioned siac as an example at 25 μm bromide solution the use of pristine siac reduced the bromide residual in solution to about 3 μm while for both preconditioned siac the bromide residual was slightly higher 9 μm in addition the amount of bromide removed by pristine siac e g 31 μmol br per gram of siac at br 0 50 μm was significantly higher than its initial silver content maximum of 13 6 μmol g in pristine siac this indicates that a large proportion of the bromide is removed through attractive electrostatic physisorption interactions between the activated carbon and bromide rather than silver bromide reaction this removal mechanism however is not considered selective and would not be practical in a real water matrix where the chloride ions are present in much higher amounts than bromide br cl ratio of 1 300 by weight because the extent of physisorption for bromide and chloride would be similar hsu and singer 2010 watson et al 2016 furthermore due to the negative surface charge of pristine siac in natural water systems where ph 7 the propensity for adsorption of bromide to the surface of siac would be weaker the concentration of silver remaining on the siac was quantified after the bromide removal experiment fig 4 b as a general trend the higher the concentration of bromide the lower the silver residual and therefore it was concluded that exposure to higher bromide concentrations resulted in higher amounts of silver being released in solution however the extent of silver release for the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 0 8 μmol g for 12 5 μm of br was lower than the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 1 7 μmol g and the pristine siac 3 8 μmol g fig 4b and table 2 these results further demonstrate the effectiveness of siac preconditioning at high ph to minimise silver loss 3 4 assessment of preconditioned siac performances in synthetic and real waters given that the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 was the most promising in terms of minimal silver leaching it was further investigated in a more complex environment fig 5 shows the extent of silver leaching and bromide removal for both the pristine siac and the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 in the presence of dissolved chloride br cl ratio of 1 300 by weight for all types of siac it was found that increasing the concentration of halide slightly increased the total silver release from 3 3 to 3 6 μmol g for the pristine and from 0 6 to 0 7 μmol g for the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 fig 5a however siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 had significantly lower silver leaching compared to pristine siac the bromide residual in solution were similar for both types of siac approximately 6 and 13 μm for initial bromide concentrations of 12 5 and 25 μm indicating that the presence of cl had a similar impact of both the pristine and the preconditioned siac this also confirms that the preconditioning did not deteriorate the siac efficiency for bromide removal applications fig 5b the preconditioned siac exhibited a specific surface area of 925 cm3 g slightly larger than that of pristine 847 cm3 g which might be due to some silver loss during preconditioning however as shown in fig s3 the micropores distribution is similar for both pristine and preconditioned siac overall only slight physical differences were observed indicating that preconditioning at high ph ph 10 does not significantly affect the structural integrity of the siac although previous study reported that siac with higher specific surface area would have better bromide removal in a control experiment in our case similar bromide removal capacities were found for both siac chen et al 2017 for the real water sample 22 5 μm of br and 16 1 mm of cl 1 6 mgc l of doc ph 8 6 natural organic matter is present and might also impact the removal of bromide and the release of silver it was found that both types of siac had similar initial doc removal capacities but the pristine siac had better removal over longer contact times 24 and 72 h fig s4 at ph 8 6 where the surface of both the pristine and the treated siac are negatively charged there is an electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged nom molecules and the siac surfaces therefore the non electrostatic adsorption of organic matter can be attributed to two mechanisms the weak dispersion forces between siac surface and nonpolar humic sites of nom molecules π π non covalent force attraction between π donor and π acceptor molecules and through the hydrogen bonding between siac surface and polar non humic sites of nom molecules newcombe 1999 nom adsorption doesn t affect the bromide removal since similar concentrations in solution 16 μmol g were obtained for the synthetic water and the real water for both pristine and preconditioned siac fig 5b however similar to the results with synthetic waters a lower release of silver was observed for the preconditioned water 1 μmol g compared to the pristine siac 3 2 μmol g 4 conclusion in this study the impact of siac preconditioning on the bromide removal capacity and the mitigation of silver leaching from a commercially available siac was investigated unlike previous research where the silver leaching properties of siac were not studied in detail this study focused on several factors determining the practicalities of the use of siac for bromide removal in particular the leaching of silver from the siac into the treated water it was found that preconditioning at ph above 10 decreased the release of ag by 40 and that it did not deteriorate the capacity of siac to remove bromide also preconditioning in 1 mm of perchlorate solution at ph 8 2 significantly reduced the silver loss from 40 to about 16 comparing the initial silver coatings between both types of preconditioned siac revealed that siac treatment at high ph 10 4 was more efficient since less silver is removed from the siac during the preconditioning compared to the treatment in mild alkaline solution ph 8 2 and perchlorate furthermore even though the bromide removal in synthetic waters was similar for both preconditioning treatment a significant reduction in silver leaching was observed for the siac preconditioned at high ph overall the study indicated that the preconditioning of siac at high ph has high potential to alter the bromide and silver interaction from an aqueous phase precipitation reaction to a chemisorption mechanism occurring on the surface of siac the treatment of a natural ground water by preconditioning siac at alkaline ph confirmed that the level of bromide removed was similar to the pristine siac while silver leaching was reduced by three times this study gives some new insights on the feasibility and benefits of preconditioning the siac for future use in real applications acknowledgments br wishes to acknowledge phd scholarship from curtin university for providing the curtin international postgraduate

19599,silver impregnated activated carbon siac has been found to be effective in mitigating the formation of brominated disinfection by products during drinking water treatment however there are still uncertainties regarding its silver leaching properties and strategies for the prevention of silver leaching have remained elusive this study focused on the evaluation of one type of commercially available siac for its ability to remove bromide while minimising silver leaching from the material both synthetic and real water matrices were tested depending on solution ph it was found that changing the surface charge properties of siac as measured by the point of zero charge ph can result in additional bromide removal while minimising the extent of silver leaching to better understand the mechanism of silver leaching from the siac eight preconditioning environments i e variable ph and ionic strength were tested for a fixed amount of siac and two preconditioning environments were selected for a more detailed investigation experiments carried out in synthetic water showed that preconditioning at ph 10 4 did not deteriorate the capacity of siac to remove bromide but significantly decreased the release of silver in the form of ionic silver ag silver bromide agbr and silver chloride agcl from 40 for the pristine to 3 for the treated siac this was confirmed using a groundwater sample these results suggest that preconditioned siac has the potential to be an effective method for bromide removal with minimised silver leaching in a long term field application for drinking water production graphical abstract proposed interactions of pristine siac with silver ions pre conditioning minimises leaching of chloride and silver image 1 keywords silver impregnated activated carbon siac bromide removal silver leaching point of zero charge ph phpzc adsorption 1 introduction naturally occurring bromide in drinking water source creates a multitude of problems for water utilities allard et al 2015 heeb et al 2014 when water is disinfected by chlorine bromide is rapidly converted to hypobromous acid hobr bousher et al 1986 which reacts in an analogous way to chlorine hocl and forms brominated disinfection by products br dbps heeb et al 2014 however reactions involving hobr are generally several orders of magnitude faster than those of hocl criquet et al 2015 2012 br dbps are more physiologically active and more toxic than their chlorinated analogues flury and papritz 1993 in addition to the formation of disinfection by products bromide in source water causes water quality problems including increased disinfectant loss allard et al 2017 sedlak and von gunten 2011 and higher concentrations of odorous brominated compounds acero et al 2005 mcdonald et al 2013 the presence of bromide is sometimes advantageous e g it acts as a catalyst during chlorination and therefore enhances the rate of manganese ii oxidation to mno2 which is removed by a filtration process and increases the rate of iodide oxidation to iodate minimising the formation of toxic i dbps allard et al 2015 criquet et al 2012 however br dbps and organic bromine typically measured as adsorbable organic bromine aobr have recently been reported as the dominant halogenated species after chlorination of ground and surface raw waters containing high concentrations of bromide langsa et al 2017 tan et al 2016 in addition during disinfection with ozone bromide can form bromate a regulated dbp and suspected carcinogen von gunten 2003 although its formation may be minimised by ph control or ammonia addition for example allard et al 2013 buffle et al 2004 obviously the best strategy to avoid the formation of br dbps is to remove bromide prior to the final disinfection step there is currently no commercialised method for the selective removal of bromide from drinking water sources membrane processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration are the only commercially available methods which can effectively remove halides to very low levels harrison et al 2007 khan et al 2005 however these are not considered economical where the primary objective is bromide reduction due to issues such as susceptibility to fouling and scaling high energy consumption short lifespan and high cost these shortcomings and the fact that membrane processes actually treat water to a much higher purity than required have led to a need for alternative methods to remove bromide studies investigating the selective removal of bromide have mainly focused on adsorption techniques which can be readily retrofitted to existing conventional water treatment processes for minimal capital and operational cost activated carbon ac materials have conventionally been effective for the sorption of organic carbon but several recent studies reported that ac materials have low selectivity for bromide uptake in natural waters hoskins et al 2002 kristiana et al 2011 watson et al 2016 silver halides are very insoluble in water with their solubility constants ksp at 25 c decreasing in the reverse order of their occurrence in natural waters agcl ksp 2 8 10 10 agbr ksp 5 2 10 13 agi ksp 8 5 10 17 haynes 2014 hence even in the presence of high concentrations of chloride i e 100 fold higher than bromide and iodide these minor ions can be selectively removed from solution using silver however the direct addition of silver as in silver salts to water is not practical due to the difficulties in removing very fine silver particulates from water agx not to mention ethical and regulatory hurdles surrounding the prospect of adding silver directly to water supplies the australian drinking water guideline maximum value for silver is 0 1 mg l therefore a form of silver that is immobilised for example within a filter medium would be a potential solution for the removal of undesirable halides in a water treatment process silver doped carbon aerogels ag aerogel were successfully synthesized and assessed for the simultaneous removal of bromide and iodide from synthetic and natural waters sánchez polo et al 2007a 2007b these studies showed that the ag aerogels have high bromide uptake capacity above 90 while the addition of excess chloride cl 40 mg l reduced the capacity to adsorb bromide by 36 however the extent of silver leaching was not determined in this research where relatively high concentrations of silver 4 10 wt silver compared to those of bromide 0 10 μm were used sánchez polo et al 2007a silver impregnated activated carbon siac materials are known for their excellent antibacterial properties in water disinfection processes and have been utilised for this purpose for a number of years bandyopadhyaya et al 2008 ortiz ibarra et al 2007 due to the high affinity of halide ions towards silver recent research has shown that siac can also be a promising alternative for the removal of halides from water gong et al 2013 hoskins et al 2002 watson et al 2016 a recent study compared the efficiency of a commercially available siac with 0 1 wt silver and its equivalent unimpregnated activated carbon for the simultaneous removal of bromide iodide and nom from water watson et al 2016 up to 95 of bromide was removed by the combination of enhanced coagulation ec with siac while only 26 of bromide was removed by ec coupled with unimpregnated activated carbon however it was mentioned that further investigation on silver leaching is required before full scale application watson et al 2016 the method of siac preparation was improved to enhance br removal from natural waters and to mitigate the formation of brominated trihalomethanes thms chen et al 2017 similar to the study of watson et al 2016 the impact of ec combined with a siac treatment was evaluated except that the ec treatment was applied after the siac up to 40 br removal was achieved during the siac treatment however the addition of alum ec was not beneficial in this configuration chen et al 2017 although the silver impregnation process was identified as one of the main factors affecting the br removal efficiency no quantification on the extent of silver leaching from the siac was reported in the literature therefore the main objective of this research was to better understand the mechanisms of silver leaching from siac used for bromide removal applications under typical water treatment conditions in this study several factors that govern the practicalities of the use of siac including the bromide removal efficiency and the leaching of silver from the siac into the treated water were investigated in synthetic waters first different preconditioning of siac were tested to reduce silver leaching based on its surface properties i e point of zero charge ph then the release of silver and the adsorption of bromide were compared in both pristine and conditioned siac in the last step the bromide removal efficiency and silver leaching from siac were examined in a real water sample to identify the most important interferences from components of a natural water matrix 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and analytical

these were of analytical reagent ar grade purity and were used without further purification ultrapure water produced by an elga water purification system resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used throughout this study for the preparation of reagents and solutions unless otherwise indicated the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the samples were measured by n2 adsorption desorption using a micromeritics tristar 3000 prior to measurement the samples were degassed at 150 c overnight under vacuum condition n2 adsorption isotherms and pore size distribution of pristine and preconditioned siac at ph 10 4 are presented in table 1 the total silver concentrations in solutions were measured using a varian model spectraa 50 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas with a nominal limit of detection lod of 0 02 mg l for ag bromide chloride and nitrate concentrations were measured in a single method using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatography

equipped with phc101 electrode the point of zero charge phpzc was determined using siac 0 15 g in a sodium nitrate nano3 50 ml of a 10 mm solution at different phs the ph was adjusted by addition of naoh 10 mm or hno3 10 mm and the solutions were agitated for 72 h putra et al 2009 the phpzc was estimated to be 7 2 0 1 2 2 siac washing and pre treatment to remove fine particulates and water soluble impurities siac particles were thoroughly washed 15 times with ultrapure water until a clear supernatant was obtained dried siac 30 00 g was weighed into a clean beaker and was then rinsed in ultrapure water 200 ml followed by ultrasonication for 5 min at ambient temperature this was necessary to ensure loose silver carbon fines were removed from the siac porous structure therefore 15 times washed siac was used throughout this study unless otherwise indicated the resulting siac particles were then dried overnight at 110 c for further use to evaluate the impact of washing on the chemical properties of the conditioned siac samples were taken from the waste washing water after the first second third tenth and the last washing step the samples were then filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter and analysed for silver chloride and nitrate the 15 times washed siac called pristine siac in this manuscript was further treated under various ph and ionic strength conditions the ph and ionic strength values for the conditioning solutions were adjusted using sodium hydroxide naoh 100 mm and sodium perchlorate naclo4 1 m respectively 2 3 evaluation of silver concentration in siac siac particles were dried in the oven at 110 c for 4 h to remove moisture from the samples before measurement of the silver content then the dried siac was accurately weighed and placed in a muffle furnace at 650 5 c silver extraction from the ashed siac samples was completed through acid digestion briefly nitric acid 40 v v 50 ml was added to the ashed samples the mixture was vigorously stirred and heated until the volume was reduced to about 20 ml this procedure was repeated and the hot solution was filtered through a qualitative filter paper whatman grade 4 20 25 μm nominal pore size after cooling the final solution was made up to 100 ml in a volumetric flask using ultrapure water prior to silver measurement using atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas 2 4 evaluation of silver concentration in the solutions previous studies on silver leaching have shown that iodide removal from solution using siac could occur either via the immobilisation of iodide on silver ion attached to the siac or by precipitation of silver ion in solution to form immobilised silver precipitates hoskins et al 2002 the concentrations of dissolved and immobilised silver in solution were monitored before and after experiments using both pristine and preconditioned siac in order to evaluate the dissolved and precipitated silver concentration in the solutions the siac was first removed from the solution by filtering the solution 500 ml through a qualitative filter paper whatman grade 4 20 25 μm nominal pore size followed by the addition of 6 ml concentrated hno3 the solution was vigorously stirred and heated until the volume was reduced to about 50 ml the final solution was made up to 100 ml with purified water in a volumetric flask prior to analysis using aas for the determination of dissolved silver treated water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter to ensure undissolved colloidal silver particles are screened prior to the acid digestion 2 5 batch adsorption studies batch adsorption tests were carried out by adding dried siac samples 0 40 g to synthetic water samples 500 ml lovibond jar testing apparatus with 6 stirring places equipped with a water bath was used for the isothermal kinetic and equilibrium studies at 30 0 5 c with a stirring rate of 150 rpm in order to compare the ion uptake and leaching capacity of the siac for all experiments the following correction factor was used sánchez polo et al 2007a 1 c t v l m a c t ins where ct μmol g is the liquid phase concentration per unit mass of siac ct ins μmol l is the liquid phase concentration read by instrument vl l is the total volume of solution and ma g represents the mass of siac no buffer solution was used for the purpose of ph adjustment so that interferences by coexisting ions could be prevented the ph values were therefore monitored during the experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 bromide uptake complexation with silver vs physisorption on siac bromide solutions were stirred with a fixed amount of siac 0 8 g l for up to 3 h the bromide removals achieved were 98 and 93 for the two lowest bromide concentrations of 12 5 and 25 μm respectively fig 1 a however when the initial bromide concentration was increased to 75 μm only 53 of bromide was removed through siac as expected the percent bromide removal decreased with increasing bromide concentration presumably due to the limited number of accessible silver available to react with bromide chen et al 2017 gong et al 2013 watson et al 2016 this trend is also in agreement with other studies using ag doped carbon aerogels for bromide removal applications sánchez polo et al 2007a however the amount of bromide removed by the siac up to 62 5 μmol was significantly higher than the silver content of the siac 5 4 μmol equal to 0 11 wt therefore these results suggest that there should be other mechanisms involved in the bromide removal through siac fig 1b showed that the uptake of bromide was inversely correlated to the release of chloride in the presence of 12 5 μm bromide a slightly higher chloride concentration 15 5 μm was released in solution after the siac treatment by increasing the initial bromide concentration to 75 μm the amount of chloride in solution was consequently increased to about 35 μm overall increasing the initial bromide concentration promoted the release of chloride which may suggest the involvement of an ion exchange process i e bromide ions exchange with chloride ions entrained within the siac pores in a control experiment without bromide the extent of silver and chloride leaching were determined over the first 90 min of contact time where ph decreased from 6 5 to 4 3 fig s1 the amount of silver leached into the solution was similar to that of chloride with a maximum of 6 5 μmol g this suggests that most of the silver is leached out from pristine siac as agcl a maximum of less than 1 μmol g of nitrate was leached from siac for a contact time of 180 min data not shown suggesting that silver leaching from siac was not in the form of silver nitrate as had been suggested in a previous study watson et al 2016 the phpzc has been widely used to determine the surface charge and electrostatic properties of siac and ag doped aerogels in bromide removal applications chen et al 2017 sánchez polo et al 2007b a schematic illustrating the proposed interactions between the silver particles with halide is shown in fig 2 when phsolution phpzc the siac is in a favourable condition to hold ag which attracts the negatively charged halides from the solution via chemisorption pathway 1 when phsolution phpzc silver is released from the siac to the bulk solution and repulsive electrostatic interactions between negatively charged siac and halides occur leading to the formation of agx in the aqueous phase pathway 2 the siac phpzc was measured as 7 2 which was greater than the solution ph 6 5 and therefore the siac surface would be positively charged phsolution phpzc consequently the attraction of bromide anions to the siac by electrostatic interactions is favoured since agbr is less soluble than agcl mijnendonckx et al 2013 the formation of agbr s is favoured over the formation of agcl s during the bromide removal process however since in natural waters the concentration of chloride is typically 300 fold greater than that of bromide sánchez polo et al 2007b watson et al 2016 the chloride interference and also silver leaching due to the release of agcl from conventional siac would possibly be significant both of these considerations limit the practicality of using conventional siac in drinking water treatment operations therefore novel approaches to mitigate silver leaching and increase the fraction of bromide reaction by direct complexation with silver at the surface of siac were investigated 3 2 impact of siac preconditioning on silver leaching in order to mitigate silver leaching and to assess the capacity of siac to remove bromide via direct complexation the siac was preconditioned at various ph and ionic strengths the extent of silver and chloride leaching was recorded after 3 h in solutions containing 0 8 g l siac fig 3 a and b the amount of chloride leaching increased from 20 to 54 μmol g while the silver leaching was drastically reduced from 6 3 μmol g to below detection limit 0 02 mg l with increasing ph from 6 to 10 4 fig 3a this indicates that hydroxides oh are replacing cl at the surface of the siac in another experiment the influence of ionic strength was investigated sodium perchlorate was used because the perchlorate ion is less likely than other ions to precipitate silver and has a high affinity to replace the chloride at the surface of the siac gu et al 2001 haynes 2014 increasing sodium perchlorate concentration from 0 1 to 1 mm slightly increased the chloride release from 33 to 47 μmol g and significantly reduced silver leaching from 6 μmol g to below detection limit fig 3b from these results two methods for preconditioning the siac were selected ph 8 2 with naclo4 at 1 mm and ph 10 4 without naclo4 the preconditioning procedures were repeated five times using fresh solutions at each stage to maximise chloride removal from siac in both cases the highest levels of both silver and cl were leached in the first step tables s1 and s2 during the first treatment preconditioning at high ph 10 4 led to a higher leaching of cl from the siac 31 4 μmol g compared to the preconditioning with 1 mm naclo4 at ph 8 2 13 8 μmol g tables s1 and s2 this is explained by the higher affinity of hydroxide groups for the exchange with chloride compared to perchlorate cañizares et al 2006 mahmudov and huang 2010 yoon et al 2009 after 5 treatments both preconditioning methods showed reduced level of cl leaching 6 6 and 2 μmol g for the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 with naclo4 and ph 10 4 respectively furthermore the silver release for the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 with naclo4 was similar between the first and the fifth treatment fluctuating between 0 03 and 0 06 μmol g while no silver was detected during the two last treatments of siac at ph 10 4 tables s1 and s2 this showed that preconditioning at higher ph would be more efficient in the mitigation of silver leaching from siac the rate of silver and chloride leaching from the siac treated under each preconditioning environment were also presented in figs s1a and b comparing the silver leaching for preconditioned after the 5 treatments vs pristine siac fig s1a clearly showed that preconditioning at higher ph ph 10 4 was successful in minimising silver leaching in the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 the silver concentrations in solutions were below the analytical detection limit 0 02 mg l compared to 0 4 μmol g for the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 in naclo4 and 5 3 μmol g for pristine siac for the chloride leaching preconditioning at ph 8 2 in naclo4 reduced the chloride in solution compared to the pristine 4 2 and 6 5 μmol g after 90 min respectively while for the siac treated at ph 10 4 only 1 μmol g was released in solution to further assess the efficiency of the two selected preconditioning approaches for mitigating silver release bromide removal experiments were carried out where the mass of silver coating was determined before and after exposure to bromide containing waters using both pristine and preconditioned siac table 2 showed that preconditioning at ph 10 4 greatly increased the amount of silver retained on the siac as a small difference between the initial 13 2 μmol g and final 12 9 μmol g silver content which represented a loss of only 3 was observed likewise a lower loss of silver from 40 to about 16 was observed when the pristine siac was preconditioned in 1 mm of perchlorate at ph 8 2 which may be due to its lower initial silver coating compared to the pristine siac table 2 overall the preconditioning at ph 10 4 seems to be more efficient in reducing silver leaching the total amount of silver that remained in solution after the bromide removal experiment were also measured for each type of siac the highest silver concentration precipitated dissolved in solution was measured for the pristine siac 3 8 μmol g table 2 on the other hand for the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 only 0 8 μmol g was measured in solution in this study both pristine and preconditioned siac are expected to be positively charged in solution however it is hypothesised that the chloride contamination of the pristine siac leads to a release of silver to the solution since the agbr solubility is extremely low ksp 5 2 10 13 haynes 2014 any agbr formed will tend to precipitate immediately on the adjacent ag coating pretty 2011 the more soluble agcl can diffuse away from the siac to the aqueous phase the higher agcl solubility allows it to diffuse into the bulk solution as opposed to immediate precipitation on the ag coating and thereby cause a high loss of ag overall the preconditioning of siac at high ph has high potential to alter the bromide and silver interaction from an aqueous phase precipitation reaction to a chemisorption mechanism occurring on the surface of siac 3 3 impact of siac preconditioning on bromide removal as shown in figs 4a and s2 the bromide removal as well as the release of chloride was investigated for both pristine and preconditioned siac samples similarly for all initial bromide concentrations the use of pristine siac resulted in a lower bromide residual in solution compared to both of the preconditioned siac as an example at 25 μm bromide solution the use of pristine siac reduced the bromide residual in solution to about 3 μm while for both preconditioned siac the bromide residual was slightly higher 9 μm in addition the amount of bromide removed by pristine siac e g 31 μmol br per gram of siac at br 0 50 μm was significantly higher than its initial silver content maximum of 13 6 μmol g in pristine siac this indicates that a large proportion of the bromide is removed through attractive electrostatic physisorption interactions between the activated carbon and bromide rather than silver bromide reaction this removal mechanism however is not considered selective and would not be practical in a real water matrix where the chloride ions are present in much higher amounts than bromide br cl ratio of 1 300 by weight because the extent of physisorption for bromide and chloride would be similar hsu and singer 2010 watson et al 2016 furthermore due to the negative surface charge of pristine siac in natural water systems where ph 7 the propensity for adsorption of bromide to the surface of siac would be weaker the concentration of silver remaining on the siac was quantified after the bromide removal experiment fig 4 b as a general trend the higher the concentration of bromide the lower the silver residual and therefore it was concluded that exposure to higher bromide concentrations resulted in higher amounts of silver being released in solution however the extent of silver release for the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 0 8 μmol g for 12 5 μm of br was lower than the siac preconditioned at ph 8 2 1 7 μmol g and the pristine siac 3 8 μmol g fig 4b and table 2 these results further demonstrate the effectiveness of siac preconditioning at high ph to minimise silver loss 3 4 assessment of preconditioned siac performances in synthetic and real waters given that the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 was the most promising in terms of minimal silver leaching it was further investigated in a more complex environment fig 5 shows the extent of silver leaching and bromide removal for both the pristine siac and the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 in the presence of dissolved chloride br cl ratio of 1 300 by weight for all types of siac it was found that increasing the concentration of halide slightly increased the total silver release from 3 3 to 3 6 μmol g for the pristine and from 0 6 to 0 7 μmol g for the siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 fig 5a however siac preconditioned at ph 10 4 had significantly lower silver leaching compared to pristine siac the bromide residual in solution were similar for both types of siac approximately 6 and 13 μm for initial bromide concentrations of 12 5 and 25 μm indicating that the presence of cl had a similar impact of both the pristine and the preconditioned siac this also confirms that the preconditioning did not deteriorate the siac efficiency for bromide removal applications fig 5b the preconditioned siac exhibited a specific surface area of 925 cm3 g slightly larger than that of pristine 847 cm3 g which might be due to some silver loss during preconditioning however as shown in fig s3 the micropores distribution is similar for both pristine and preconditioned siac overall only slight physical differences were observed indicating that preconditioning at high ph ph 10 does not significantly affect the structural integrity of the siac although previous study reported that siac with higher specific surface area would have better bromide removal in a control experiment in our case similar bromide removal capacities were found for both siac chen et al 2017 for the real water sample 22 5 μm of br and 16 1 mm of cl 1 6 mgc l of doc ph 8 6 natural organic matter is present and might also impact the removal of bromide and the release of silver it was found that both types of siac had similar initial doc removal capacities but the pristine siac had better removal over longer contact times 24 and 72 h fig s4 at ph 8 6 where the surface of both the pristine and the treated siac are negatively charged there is an electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged nom molecules and the siac surfaces therefore the non electrostatic adsorption of organic matter can be attributed to two mechanisms the weak dispersion forces between siac surface and nonpolar humic sites of nom molecules π π non covalent force attraction between π donor and π acceptor molecules and through the hydrogen bonding between siac surface and polar non humic sites of nom molecules newcombe 1999 nom adsorption doesn t affect the bromide removal since similar concentrations in solution 16 μmol g were obtained for the synthetic water and the real water for both pristine and preconditioned siac fig 5b however similar to the results with synthetic waters a lower release of silver was observed for the preconditioned water 1 μmol g compared to the pristine siac 3 2 μmol g 4 conclusion in this study the impact of siac preconditioning on the bromide removal capacity and the mitigation of silver leaching from a commercially available siac was investigated unlike previous research where the silver leaching properties of siac were not studied in detail this study focused on several factors determining the practicalities of the use of siac for bromide removal in particular the leaching of silver from the siac into the treated water it was found that preconditioning at ph above 10 decreased the release of ag by 40 and that it did not deteriorate the capacity of siac to remove bromide also preconditioning in 1 mm of perchlorate solution at ph 8 2 significantly reduced the silver loss from 40 to about 16 comparing the initial silver coatings between both types of preconditioned siac revealed that siac treatment at high ph 10 4 was more efficient since less silver is removed from the siac during the preconditioning compared to the treatment in mild alkaline solution ph 8 2 and perchlorate furthermore even though the bromide removal in synthetic waters was similar for both preconditioning treatment a significant reduction in silver leaching was observed for the siac preconditioned at high ph overall the study indicated that the preconditioning of siac at high ph has high potential to alter the bromide and silver interaction from an aqueous phase precipitation reaction to a chemisorption mechanism occurring on the surface of siac the treatment of a natural ground water by preconditioning siac at alkaline ph confirmed that the level of bromide removed was similar to the pristine siac while silver leaching was reduced by three times this study gives some new insights on the feasibility and benefits of preconditioning the siac for future use in real applications acknowledgments br wishes to acknowledge phd scholarship from curtin university for providing the curtin international postgraduate
