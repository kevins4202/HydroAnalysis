urban growth urban self organization regional analysis land value 1 urban assets cities are the great invention of human civilization they attract people jobs and wealth increasing the collective power of their residents even as they intensify crime pollution or inequality bettencourt and west 2010 cities have also grown dramatically in population as the amounts of ready power increased through the modern period changing their size shape and organization and steadily increasing the proportion of people who live in urban areas reaching 74 in wealthy countries and 44 in poorer ones united nations 2018 the question this research seeks to answer is how the massive expenditure of power and resources is invested in assets that enhance urban power from structures and infrastructures to education and information energy is the ultimate driver for urban growth providing the engine for its physical and economic activities however it is the concentration of energy into more valuable forms such as fuels buildings institutions and knowledge that underlies the capacity for development the goal of the project was to evaluate the interactions between resource flows renewable and non renewable and the spatial distribution of assets using household consumption as the primary lens through which to construct a regional emergy model the project was undertaken in support of the development of an agent based simulation by the ackoff collaboratory which will be used to model the social and economic choices made by the different households bharaty 2012 there are multiple examples of urban emergy models by odum et al 1995 brown 1980 lei et al 2008 huang and chen 2005 and ascione et al 2009 but we sought a model focused on the consumption decisions of households giving a more fine grained picture of urban self organization following the insights of abel 2004 about socio economic models of the population the regional emergy diagram fig 1 was structured around the social economic and spatial distribution of people in households as the drivers of consumption in the built environment ultimately the choices people make about location and lifestyle drive the patterns of settlement and flows of resources even as governments seek to regulate and direct those decisions the work of this project is two fold the first is to develop a sufficiently fine grained description of the distribution of land uses buildings and household types to support the modelling and second to understand the accumulation of assets through the region 2 methodology the project uses the method of emergy synthesis to understand the interaction of natural and socioeconomic factors in the self organization of the region as h t odum explained it emergy spelled with an m is the available energy of one kind previously used up directly and indirectly to make a product or service odum 2007 it is a form of life cycle analysis that accounts for the all work and resources dissipated in the production of any product service or activity all the way back to the environmental inputs the result is normalized to the original solar energy and expressed in solar emjoules sej odum 1996 this provides a common measurement for readily comparing the costs of different kinds of resources and services as an accounting method it mostly uses unit emergy values uev published in the research literature expressed as sej j sej g sej etc for the many inputs to a system multiplying them by the flows of energy materials and services in a system to quantify the total amounts of environmental work and resources involved the uevs used in the study were drawn from many sources where possible they have been adapted specifically to the region but in other cases the closest analog was used to complete the analysis uevs are also used to characterize the relative cost or intensity of different stocks flows and resources within the system whether it is a fresh water estuary or an urban economy the real power of emergy synthesis is not simply adding another measure of environmental cost though the common metric is extremely helpful but revealing the structure of systems odum s original insight was that in a self organizing system the particular intensity of a resource how much energy had to be used up to make it was a measure of the value of that resource to the system that hypothesis was based on observations of natural food chains in which a top predator consumes many lower level animals who in turn eat large amounts of plants making the predator expensive or resource intensive predators may be more wasteful than primary producers like plants but in a well balanced eco system the predator regulates the population of herbivorous animals so they don t deplete the plant matter justifying their higher cost a successful ecosystem is the result of their interaction balancing populations and resources and the relative emergy intensity of the different actors identifies the role of each element cities are complex self organizing systems similar in behavior to natural eco systems with a number of key distinctions first is that the species in natural eco systems can not change foxes do not become chickens while humans in socioeconomic systems can change roles second natural evolution proceeds slowly by small variations in the information coded in dna which can sometimes lead to large changes in phenotypes while human society manipulates information in many more open forms to enhance its ability to adapt finally human society has grown dramatically by investing in elaborate external technologies which have dramatically enhanced its power and control over its environment information and technology assets characterize the modern city allowing it to expand so successfully this study proceeds by assessing the emergy intensity of urban land focusing on the construction of the assets that make it work and equally on the resource flows that those assets facilitate land is a special form of asset which has three ways to capture or hold value one is the ability to receive environmental resource flows determined largely by its area two is the value of the movable assets located on or under the land such a buildings or minerals three is its location relative to adjacent parcels of land or to which it is connected by transportation systems this paper addresses the first two documenting the total amount of work and resources invested in buildings infrastructure and education on each a piece of land each of these represents a significant investment in a relatively fixed asset whose value depreciates over time but that seeks to enhance wealth or power the goal is to reveal the patterns of urban self organization and their driving factors 2 1 philadelphia and its region william penn founded the city of philadelphia in 1682 at the confluence of the delaware and schuylkill rivers it grew to become the most populous city in the american colonies by 1760 though new york surpassed it in 1800 and it remained the second largest city until 1900 it is currently the sixth largest city the seventh largest metropolitan statistical area msa and the eight largest combined statistical area csa in the united states us census 2017 each of those statistical measures identifies urban boundaries based on degrees of economic and transportation connections illustrating the point that the boundaries of a city depend on the questions being asked as part of the ever intensifying northeast megaregion first identified in the late 1950s gottman 1957 philadelphia has worried about becoming a sixth borough of new york since the late nineteenth century wes 2015 even though it retains a distinct civic identity and regional accent the study area selected for the project is the nine county region established by the delaware valley regional planning commission dvrpc which is a formally constituted entity that administers various state and federal programs fig 2 unlike the msa this definition excludes wilmington delaware because the dvrpc was formed by the states of pennsylvania and new jersey but it still accounts for over 95 of the regional population comprising 6 096 905 people in 2 346 978 households with 3 189 505 jobs over the last decade dvrpc has assembled gis databases of the region and reporting mechanisms for a regional carbon footprint which provided the initial data for the project dvrpc 2017 2 2 regional data the land use and building information was extracted and harmonized from county level tax data the dvrpc gis land use models us census and the american community survey acs 2017 the region has 352 municipalities including the cities of philadelphia camden and trenton the capital of new jersey and 1 379 census tracts which each represent about 4000 residents fig 2 the census tracts form the basic unit of analysis in the project an overlay of the county level tax data the land use map the municipal government expenditure data and the census tract data was used to establish the number of residents workers and land and building areas in each census tract by type and use fig 3 assets were evaluated for each category of land use in a census tract from soils and biomass for agriculture and wooded areas to buildings and education levels for households fig 4 for the emergy of building construction the footprint floor area number of stories and type of use were used to make assumptions about specific forms of construction which were combined with data from rsmeans square foot construction costs to estimate the quantities of materials in each building lee and braham 2017 means 2003 similarly the construction of infrastructure roads sidewalks street lights traffic signals sewer line and water main lines are estimated using rsmeans sitework cost estimation and the highway and local street construction standard in both cases the total emergy value of the construction is recorded as an asset sej and then a depreciation value is entered as an annual flow sej lifespan the census records education levels of residents for each tract and emergy values for those levels were based on the work of campbell and lu 2009 which was derived from an earlier analysis by odum 1996 building and household consumption data for food water and energy were derived from national and regional norms multiplying building areas or number of residents by normalized consumption data developed land was grouped in three broad categories residential business and industry and government and institutional fig 4 shows the assets and resource flows assigned to each category the exchanges between the categories indicated in the emergy diagram are mostly physical flows with some modest amount of economic activity included it proved impossible to identify business value or activity at the census tract level so wages were used as a proxy of business activity naics 2012 similarly household incomes were included as an indicator of household wealth acs 2017 for government and educational uses the more detailed flows in the comprehensive annual financial report cafr were used to indicate the investment in shared institutions though no detailed tracking of tax money from households or businesses was available the results are compiled and reported at the level of the census track giving a detailed picture of the emergy intensity of land uses within the region for the other land uses such as agriculture timber and mining county or state level data was apportioned to each tract on an area basis which accurately represents the totals but flattens out the spatial differences further work needs to be done with the available spatial data for mining and water resources to reveal any correlation between the distribution of these assets and economic assets the other asset which needs to be more accurately evaluated are transportation networks these were assessed using the amounts of transportation infrastructure within each tract and current measures of travel times from the acs this captures the immediate emergy cost of transportation but a more comprehensive measure would incorporate some measure of the resources to which the transportation networks are connected for the annual energy consumption of buildings the average energy intensity for each class of buildings was obtained from the doe building performance database and multiplied by the building area the totals achieved with this bottom up technique for each county were adjusted to match the top down consumption totals obtained by dvrpc using aggregate data from energy utilities other consumption categories water food waste and so on were determined with similar methods and compared to county wide totals when available in contrast transportation data is available from a detailed regional survey by dvrpc which could be assigned to individual census tracts the energy systems language esl diagram shown in fig 1 was developed to focus on the consumption level decisions of households non residential actors and a basic set of interactions with government activities most of these interactions are aggregated within total consumption but labor and transportation were both accounted for explicitly the detailed categories are listed in table 1 in an emergy synthesis table for the whole region showing the distinction between assets and flows 3 results emergy syntheses were prepared for all 1379 census tracts in the region and their spatial emergy intensity is plotted in fig 5 eight characteristic census tracts ranging from rural to central business district are called out in the plot to make the hierarchy more intelligible these same tracts are located on a map in fig 6 and their details reported in table 2 broadly speaking the results confirm the expected spatial hierarchy of the city in its region with the central business district cbd and cbd residential exhibiting the greatest emergy intensity per unit of land rural land is lowest and interestingly the suburban community has a greater intensity of assets and annual resource flows than suburban retail reflecting the concentration of residents with higher levels of education and a higher value of household income the same hierarchy is visible when the spatial emergy intensities for all census tracts are plotted in map form in fig 7 the central business district and residential areas form the largest concentrations but the powerful exurban concentrations are also clearly visible the census tracts with higher empower density sej m2 show the typical characteristics of urban neighborhoods they are generally smaller in size with twice the floor area ratio far and four times greater household density the primary land use for these communities is commercial including retail and office therefore wages and the consumption of food and materials by employees tend to drive the empower density higher than average since these urban tracts cover smaller geographic areas the emergy for public service is lower than average due to the size of the tracts there is less infrastructure such as roads sewer lines and traffic signals the tracts with higher empower density also show lower dependency on the automobile resulting in lower transportation emergy per capita the educational level is higher than the average of the region more residents had college or graduate degrees in these tracts but there is also greater disparity household incomes are lower than average across the urban center philadelphia trenton and camden the urban centers in the delaware valley region exemplify high empower density tracts however central location and higher density are not the sole driver of empower density a few suburban centers also exhibit high empower density princeton upper darby township and nether providence township are high in empower density but located at the periphery larger tract geometry and the peripheral location require more driving even though a majority of commuters use public transit the local governments invest more than double the per capita expenditure on education but land is cheaper than in the city centers there is also less crowding with half the population and household density at 766 people per hectare and 287 households per hectare the average far was 1 4 one and a half times higher than all the other high empower density tracts except the cbd the residents of these communities enjoy larger homes in less busy neighborhoods with affordable housing prices and decent education the new center periphery configuration that has emerged over the last 50 years is even more apparent in a mapping of the emergy per capita plotted in fig 8 census tracts with higher per capita emergy sej yr person show the particular characteristics of affluent suburban communities first they cover larger geographic areas as a result they require higher infrastructure investment for road and sewer lines public transit systems do not effectively serve the sprawl of roads and tracts therefore the automobile is the primary transportation mode residents are generally better educated and enjoy above average household income the population density and household density is much lower in these communities at 13 people per hectare compared to the regional average of 336 person per hectare remote communities living in rural and forested areas often form the dream image of a sustainable settlement with a middle class standard of living however this comes at the cost of a very high per capita emergy west marlborough township west nantmeal township and hopewell borough are some of the examples these communities maximize the flow of emergy by building road networks to service the network of ever larger houses three times more than average emergy per person is spent in transportation alone while homes are three times larger than average but provide shelter at 10 of the average regional population density on the other hand much recent writing about sustainable forms of settlement focuses on the efficiencies of higher density settlements served by mass transportation in the nine county region there are two kinds of high population density settlements wealthier and poorer which correspond to higher and lower emergy intensities per capita the higher emergy per capita residential portions of the cbd are themselves concentrated in smaller pockets the lower per capita emergy areas are spread across northern and western philadelphia camden and trenton the original colonial and early industrial settlements where there is access to and use of subway and rail systems for commuting which in turn supports higher population densities however these communities are much less educated with only 22 achieving some college and graduate education lower than the regional average of 55 and with median household incomes of just 22 000 making philadelphia the poorest large city in the us in the hierarchy of tracts in the region higher population density tracts with lower per capita emergy consumption generally signals poverty suggesting that the challenge of sustainable settlement cannot be solved with increased population density alone 4 emergy location and land value the connection between location and land value has been a major interest of urban scholars in the more narrowly economic view land prices are a major determinant of land use and urban form land price decreases as it is located farther from the central markets and transportation costs increase within this spatial logic people find optimal places to maximize their economic utility and that determines much of the physical layout of cities thünen and hall 1966 conversely others argue that land price is determined by self sorting according to the economic status of the residents irregular patches of adjacent neighborhoods with very different characteristics in america cities are the cumulative result of individual choices households negotiate the dynamic between budgets and the level of public service from local governments and land prices follow the residents ability to pay tiebout 1956 that process of self organization can seem almost accidental in its patterns until we recognize the powerful effect of the assets laid down in previous generations of organization one premise of emergy research is that the growth of cities depends on the concentration of assets to amplify the flows or energy work and resources communities invest work resources and energy to convert farmland or forest to residential communities main streets and eventually central business districts supporting larger communities and flows of resources more work and resources are expended to build a dense center and use transportation energy to connect the center to surrounding communities a hierarchy emerges as the center becomes more efficient for transportation with better connectivity to the periphery this centrality reinforces higher demand and in turn higher land price and development density krugman 1991 the hypothesis we sought to test is whether the total intensity of emergy invested in a parcel of land ultimately determines the land price emergy synthesis helps reveal the relationships between urban form and land price in a comprehensive perspective it is a unique accounting method that allows direct comparisons between assets of different kinds buildings education transportation and so on differences in public service and neighborhood assets are revealed as emergy accumulated in assets over time to test the hypothesis about land value we evaluated the correlation of emergy assets and flows with the property tax assessment value of all parcels in the delaware valley region the data was consolidated from county tax offices assessment data since only a few counties separate the assessments for buildings and land we used overall property assessment while controlling for construction of buildings and median household income for each tract the distribution of property tax assessment is not normal so we used a multivariate regression model with a generalized linear model glm mass package r studio to evaluate the relationship between the emergy flows and assets with land value table 3 the hypothesis about the correlation of land price and emergy intensity is generally confirmed for the delaware valley region the model tested in table 3 includes the emergy of assets and annual flows determined at the tract level the results support the conventional understanding of land price for example when the results are controlled for the size of land and the number of residents the price of land increases as the automobile transportation emergy decreases in the classic view people drive further to suburban areas for lower housing price and make tradeoffs between the two expenses conversely public transit emergy has a positive relationship to price which indicates that infrastructure investment and access to transit system increase the land value the higher government expenditure on education increases the land price with somewhat less significance both emergy assets and flows correlate to land price but the effect of assets is many orders of magnitude higher the assets in the built environment buildings infrastructure and education show generally strong relationships to land price however the relationship differs by the kinds of land use while residential building assets do not correlate strongly commercial building assets have a very positive relationship as does the education attainment of the community residents this is consistent with classic economic analysis of land values peiser 1987 among annual emergy flows consumption including water waste and non renewable supplies is the biggest contributor along with transportation and energy which are determined by the number of people and household income it can be challenging to identify causes within such a complex process of self organization and reinforcement but it seems that the spatially anchored assets buildings and infrastructure are the most likely causes of land price where the annual flows and mobile assets are as likely to be the effects of price as their cause when we chart land price against empower densities sej m2 yr and sej person yr the relationships become clearer as seen in fig 9 of annual flows sej m2 yr land price changes at a log of empower density of 15 that emergy density generally occurs in high density city centers brown 1980 and is exemplified in manhattan lee and braham 2017 fig 10 shows that emergy per capita sej person yr is a more consistent index for higher land prices with some variability moe srinivasan argue that higher emergy flows per capita translate into quality of life and the ability to afford more expensive land srinivasan and moe 2015 but higher per capita flows also occur in older low density towns hollowed out as the economy shifted the spatial density of asset empower does not have a clear relationship to land assessment which seems surprising but asset emergy per capita shown in fig 11 has the clearest correlation to land prices this would mean that the spatial concentration of assets described by sej m2 helps amplify power to the degree that it involves a greater density of population the chart also indicates a plateau beginning around log base 10 of 21 suggesting that there is an optimum concentration of assets a condition of maximum power after which the accumulation of assets becomes less productive this is a further demonstration of the dynamic between fixed and mobile assets with fixed assets like buildings and infrastructures only being effective to the degree that they attract mobile assets like people and their levels of education from the perspective of the city as an engine maximizing its power people are also mobile adaptable assets mobility is the factor not fully encompassed by this analysis the direct emergy costs of commuting and travel are included in each parcel however the third factor outlined above the value of adjacent parcels of land may be better understood as a function of travel time the value of a parcel benefits from the assets accumulated on other pieces of land in proportion to the speed with which they can be accessed whether by walking or transportation systems the next phase of the project will be to account for the effects of movement and transportation more directly which provides the first step to quantify the effects of teleconnection between different parts of the region and to produce a more meaningful and playable game seto et al 2012 5 conclusion the regional emergy analysis at the census tract level allows us to revisit current beliefs about how cities and regions work tracking the assets embodied in buildings infrastructure and education provides a fascinating picture of the layers of historical development in the region which are guided and constrained by the slow turnover time of structures and infrastructure it seems that each form of settlement attracts further investments that intensify it even as the original reason for the location changes by charting the emergy intensity of assets assembled over time emergy synthesis becomes a form of historic analysis spatially the largest amount of assets are concentrated at the city center confirming odum s broad proposition about the city as a concentrating system for amplifying power however the steady sprawl of the contemporary city over the last 60 years is revealed by the very high per capita emergy levels of the suburban centers and describes a form of power amplification heavily dependent on extensive automobile networks further exemplifying the importance of assets in the persistence of stable forms the older colonial centers of chester camden trenton and princeton still retain their spatial intensity though their roles and prosperity have changed dramatically as they have been fit into new roles within the regional economy the strong correlation between emergy intensities and land value confirms the broad hypothesis about the role of assets in the self organization of urban areas perhaps the most important insight is the reminder that fixed assets only succeed when they accommodate people in productive roles city building can been seen as the constant back and forth between fixed and mobile assets between structures and infrastructure with their long turnover times and more mobile people and their expertise funding initial phases of this research were supported by the kleinman center for energy policy university of

through the modern period changing their size shape and organization and steadily increasing the proportion of people who live in urban areas reaching 74 in wealthy countries and 44 in poorer ones united nations 2018 the question this research seeks to answer is how the massive expenditure of power and resources is invested in assets that enhance urban power from structures and infrastructures to education and information energy is the ultimate driver for urban growth providing the engine for its physical and economic activities however it is the concentration of energy into more valuable forms such as fuels buildings institutions and knowledge that underlies the capacity for development the goal of the project was to evaluate the interactions between resource flows renewable and non renewable and the spatial distribution of assets using household consumption as the primary lens through which to construct a regional emergy model the project was undertaken in support of the development of an agent based simulation by the ackoff collaboratory which will be used to model the social and economic choices made by the different households bharaty 2012 there are multiple examples of urban emergy models by odum et al 1995 brown 1980 lei et al 2008 huang and chen 2005 and ascione et al 2009 but we sought a model focused on the consumption decisions of households giving a more fine grained picture of urban self organization following the insights of abel 2004 about socio economic models of the population the regional emergy diagram fig 1 was structured around the social economic and spatial distribution of people in households as the drivers of consumption in the built environment ultimately the choices people make about location and lifestyle drive the patterns of settlement and flows of resources even as governments seek to regulate and direct those decisions the work of this project is two fold the first is to develop a sufficiently fine grained description of the distribution of land uses buildings and household types to support the modelling and second to understand the accumulation of assets through the region 2 methodology the project uses the method of emergy synthesis to understand the interaction of natural and socioeconomic factors in the self organization of the region as h t odum explained it emergy spelled with an m is the available energy of one kind previously used up directly and indirectly to make a product or service odum 2007 it is a form of life cycle analysis that accounts for the all work and resources dissipated in the production of any product service or activity all the way back to the environmental inputs the result is normalized to the original solar energy and expressed in solar emjoules sej odum 1996 this provides a common measurement for readily comparing the costs of different kinds of resources and services as an accounting method it mostly uses unit emergy values uev published in the research literature expressed as sej j sej g sej etc for the many inputs to a system multiplying them by the flows of energy materials and services in a system to quantify the total amounts of environmental work and resources involved the uevs used in the study were drawn from many sources where possible they have been adapted specifically to the region but in other cases the closest analog was used to complete the analysis uevs are also used to characterize the relative cost or intensity of different stocks flows and resources within the system whether it is a fresh water estuary or an urban economy the real power of emergy synthesis is not simply adding another measure of environmental cost though the common metric is extremely helpful but revealing the structure of systems odum s original insight was that in a self organizing system the particular intensity of a resource how much energy had to be used up to make it was a measure of the value of that resource to the system that hypothesis was based on observations of natural food chains in which a top predator consumes many lower level animals who in turn eat large amounts of plants making the predator expensive or resource intensive predators may be more wasteful than primary producers like plants but in a well balanced eco system the predator regulates the population of herbivorous animals so they don t deplete the plant matter justifying their higher cost a successful ecosystem is the result of their interaction balancing populations and resources and the relative emergy intensity of the different actors identifies the role of each element cities are complex self organizing systems similar in behavior to natural eco systems with a number of key distinctions first is that the species in natural eco systems can not change foxes do not become chickens while humans in socioeconomic systems can change roles second natural evolution proceeds slowly by small variations in the information coded in dna which can sometimes lead to large changes in phenotypes while human society manipulates information in many more open forms to enhance its ability to adapt finally human society has grown dramatically by investing in elaborate external technologies which have dramatically enhanced its power and control over its environment information and technology assets characterize the modern city allowing it to expand so successfully this study proceeds by assessing the emergy intensity of urban land focusing on the construction of the assets that make it work and equally on the resource flows that those assets facilitate land is a special form of asset which has three ways to capture or hold value one is the ability to receive environmental resource flows determined largely by its area two is the value of the movable assets located on or under the land such a buildings or minerals three is its location relative to adjacent parcels of land or to which it is connected by transportation systems this paper addresses the first two documenting the total amount of work and resources invested in buildings infrastructure and education on each a piece of land each of these represents a significant investment in a relatively fixed asset whose value depreciates over time but that seeks to enhance wealth or power the goal is to reveal the patterns of urban self organization and their driving factors 2 1 philadelphia and its region william penn founded the city of philadelphia in 1682 at the confluence of the delaware and schuylkill rivers it grew to become the most populous city in the american colonies by 1760 though new york surpassed it in 1800 and it remained the second largest city until 1900 it is currently the sixth largest city the seventh largest metropolitan statistical area msa and the eight largest combined statistical area csa in the united states us census 2017 each of those statistical measures identifies urban boundaries based on degrees of economic and transportation connections illustrating the point that the boundaries of a city depend on the questions being asked as part of the ever intensifying northeast megaregion first identified in the late 1950s gottman 1957 philadelphia has worried about becoming a sixth borough of new york since the late nineteenth century wes 2015 even though it retains a distinct civic identity and regional accent the study area selected for the project is the nine county region established by the delaware valley regional planning commission dvrpc which is a formally constituted entity that administers various state and federal programs fig 2 unlike the msa this definition excludes wilmington delaware because the dvrpc was formed by the states of pennsylvania and new jersey but it still accounts for over 95 of the regional population comprising 6 096 905 people in 2 346 978 households with 3 189 505 jobs over the last decade dvrpc has assembled gis databases of the region and reporting mechanisms for a regional carbon footprint which provided the initial data for the project dvrpc 2017 2 2 regional data the land use and building information was extracted and harmonized from county level tax data the dvrpc gis land use models us census and the american community survey acs 2017 the region has 352 municipalities including the cities of philadelphia camden and trenton the capital of new jersey and 1 379 census tracts which each represent about 4000 residents fig 2 the census tracts form the basic unit of analysis in the project an overlay of the county level tax data the land use map the municipal government expenditure data and the census tract data was used to establish the number of residents workers and land and building areas in each census tract by type and use fig 3 assets were evaluated for each category of land use in a census tract from soils and biomass for agriculture and wooded areas to buildings and education levels for households fig 4 for the emergy of building construction the footprint floor area number of stories and type of use were used to make assumptions about specific forms of construction which were combined with data from rsmeans square foot construction costs to estimate the quantities of materials in each building lee and braham 2017 means 2003 similarly the construction of infrastructure roads sidewalks street lights traffic signals sewer line and water main lines are estimated using rsmeans sitework cost estimation and the highway and local street construction standard in both cases the total emergy value of the construction is recorded as an asset sej and then a depreciation value is entered as an annual flow sej lifespan the census records education levels of residents for each tract and emergy values for those levels were based on the work of campbell and lu 2009 which was derived from an earlier analysis by odum 1996 building and household consumption data for food water and energy were derived from national and regional norms multiplying building areas or number of residents by normalized consumption data developed land was grouped in three broad categories residential business and industry and government and institutional fig 4 shows the assets and resource flows assigned to each category the exchanges between the categories indicated in the emergy diagram are mostly physical flows with some modest amount of economic activity included it proved impossible to identify business value or activity at the census tract level so wages were used as a proxy of business activity naics 2012 similarly household incomes were included as an indicator of household wealth acs 2017 for government and educational uses the more detailed flows in the comprehensive annual financial report cafr were used to indicate the investment in shared institutions though no detailed tracking of tax money from households or businesses was available the results are compiled and reported at the level of the census track giving a detailed picture of the emergy intensity of land uses within the region for the other land uses such as agriculture timber and mining county or state level data was apportioned to each tract on an area basis which accurately represents the totals but flattens out the spatial differences further work needs to be done with the available spatial data for mining and water resources to reveal any correlation between the distribution of these assets and economic assets the other asset which needs to be more accurately evaluated are transportation networks these were assessed using the amounts of transportation infrastructure within each tract and current measures of travel times from the acs this captures the immediate emergy cost of transportation but a more comprehensive measure would incorporate some measure of the resources to which the transportation networks are connected for the annual energy consumption of buildings the average energy intensity for each class of buildings was obtained from the doe building performance database and multiplied by the building area the totals achieved with this bottom up technique for each county were adjusted to match the top down consumption totals obtained by dvrpc using aggregate data from energy utilities other consumption categories water food waste and so on were determined with similar methods and compared to county wide totals when available in contrast transportation data is available from a detailed regional survey by dvrpc which could be assigned to individual census tracts the energy systems language esl diagram shown in fig 1 was developed to focus on the consumption level decisions of households non residential actors and a basic set of interactions with government activities most of these interactions are aggregated within total consumption but labor and transportation were both accounted for explicitly the detailed categories are listed in table 1 in an emergy synthesis table for the whole region showing the distinction between assets and flows 3 results emergy syntheses were prepared for all 1379 census tracts in the region and their spatial emergy intensity is plotted in fig 5 eight characteristic census tracts ranging from rural to central business district are called out in the plot to make the hierarchy more intelligible these same tracts are located on a map in fig 6 and their details reported in table 2 broadly speaking the results confirm the expected spatial hierarchy of the city in its region with the central business district cbd and cbd residential exhibiting the greatest emergy intensity per unit of land rural land is lowest and interestingly the suburban community has a greater intensity of assets and annual resource flows than suburban retail reflecting the concentration of residents with higher levels of education and a higher value of household income the same hierarchy is visible when the spatial emergy intensities for all census tracts are plotted in map form in fig 7 the central business district and residential areas form the largest concentrations but the powerful exurban concentrations are also clearly visible the census tracts with higher empower density sej m2 show the typical characteristics of urban neighborhoods they are generally smaller in size with twice the floor area ratio far and four times greater household density the primary land use for these communities is commercial including retail and office therefore wages and the consumption of food and materials by employees tend to drive the empower density higher than average since these urban tracts cover smaller geographic areas the emergy for public service is lower than average due to the size of the tracts there is less infrastructure such as roads sewer lines and traffic signals the tracts with higher empower density also show lower dependency on the automobile resulting in lower transportation emergy per capita the educational level is higher than the average of the region more residents had college or graduate degrees in these tracts but there is also greater disparity household incomes are lower than average across the urban center philadelphia trenton and camden the urban centers in the delaware valley region exemplify high empower density tracts however central location and higher density are not the sole driver of empower density a few suburban centers also exhibit high empower density princeton upper darby township and nether providence township are high in empower density but located at the periphery larger tract geometry and the peripheral location require more driving even though a majority of commuters use public transit the local governments invest more than double the per capita expenditure on education but land is cheaper than in the city centers there is also less crowding with half the population and household density at 766 people per hectare and 287 households per hectare the average far was 1 4 one and a half times higher than all the other high empower density tracts except the cbd the residents of these communities enjoy larger homes in less busy neighborhoods with affordable housing prices and decent education the new center periphery configuration that has emerged over the last 50 years is even more apparent in a mapping of the emergy per capita plotted in fig 8 census tracts with higher per capita emergy sej yr person show the particular characteristics of affluent suburban communities first they cover larger geographic areas as a result they require higher infrastructure investment for road and sewer lines public transit systems do not effectively serve the sprawl of roads and tracts therefore the automobile is the primary transportation mode residents are generally better educated and enjoy above average household income the population density and household density is much lower in these communities at 13 people per hectare compared to the regional average of 336 person per hectare remote communities living in rural and forested areas often form the dream image of a sustainable settlement with a middle class standard of living however this comes at the cost of a very high per capita emergy west marlborough township west nantmeal township and hopewell borough are some of the examples these communities maximize the flow of emergy by building road networks to service the network of ever larger houses three times more than average emergy per person is spent in transportation alone while homes are three times larger than average but provide shelter at 10 of the average regional population density on the other hand much recent writing about sustainable forms of settlement focuses on the efficiencies of higher density settlements served by mass transportation in the nine county region there are two kinds of high population density settlements wealthier and poorer which correspond to higher and lower emergy intensities per capita the higher emergy per capita residential portions of the cbd are themselves concentrated in smaller pockets the lower per capita emergy areas are spread across northern and western philadelphia camden and trenton the original colonial and early industrial settlements where there is access to and use of subway and rail systems for commuting which in turn supports higher population densities however these communities are much less educated with only 22 achieving some college and graduate education lower than the regional average of 55 and with median household incomes of just 22 000 making philadelphia the poorest large city in the us in the hierarchy of tracts in the region higher population density tracts with lower per capita emergy consumption generally signals poverty suggesting that the challenge of sustainable settlement cannot be solved with increased population density alone 4 emergy location and land value the connection between location and land value has been a major interest of urban scholars in the more narrowly economic view land prices are a major determinant of land use and urban form land price decreases as it is located farther from the central markets and transportation costs increase within this spatial logic people find optimal places to maximize their economic utility and that determines much of the physical layout of cities thünen and hall 1966 conversely others argue that land price is determined by self sorting according to the economic status of the residents irregular patches of adjacent neighborhoods with very different characteristics in america cities are the cumulative result of individual choices households negotiate the dynamic between budgets and the level of public service from local governments and land prices follow the residents ability to pay tiebout 1956 that process of self organization can seem almost accidental in its patterns until we recognize the powerful effect of the assets laid down in previous generations of organization one premise of emergy research is that the growth of cities depends on the concentration of assets to amplify the flows or energy work and resources communities invest work resources and energy to convert farmland or forest to residential communities main streets and eventually central business districts supporting larger communities and flows of resources more work and resources are expended to build a dense center and use transportation energy to connect the center to surrounding communities a hierarchy emerges as the center becomes more efficient for transportation with better connectivity to the periphery this centrality reinforces higher demand and in turn higher land price and development density krugman 1991 the hypothesis we sought to test is whether the total intensity of emergy invested in a parcel of land ultimately determines the land price emergy synthesis helps reveal the relationships between urban form and land price in a comprehensive perspective it is a unique accounting method that allows direct comparisons between assets of different kinds buildings education transportation and so on differences in public service and neighborhood assets are revealed as emergy accumulated in assets over time to test the hypothesis about land value we evaluated the correlation of emergy assets and flows with the property tax assessment value of all parcels in the delaware valley region the data was consolidated from county tax offices assessment data since only a few counties separate the assessments for buildings and land we used overall property assessment while controlling for construction of buildings and median household income for each tract the distribution of property tax assessment is not normal so we used a multivariate regression model with a generalized linear model glm mass package r studio to evaluate the relationship between the emergy flows and assets with land value table 3 the hypothesis about the correlation of land price and emergy intensity is generally confirmed for the delaware valley region the model tested in table 3 includes the emergy of assets and annual flows determined at the tract level the results support the conventional understanding of land price for example when the results are controlled for the size of land and the number of residents the price of land increases as the automobile transportation emergy decreases in the classic view people drive further to suburban areas for lower housing price and make tradeoffs between the two expenses conversely public transit emergy has a positive relationship to price which indicates that infrastructure investment and access to transit system increase the land value the higher government expenditure on education increases the land price with somewhat less significance both emergy assets and flows correlate to land price but the effect of assets is many orders of magnitude higher the assets in the built environment buildings infrastructure and education show generally strong relationships to land price however the relationship differs by the kinds of land use while residential building assets do not correlate strongly commercial building assets have a very positive relationship as does the education attainment of the community residents this is consistent with classic economic analysis of land values peiser 1987 among annual emergy flows consumption including water waste and non renewable supplies is the biggest contributor along with transportation and energy which are determined by the number of people and household income it can be challenging to identify causes within such a complex process of self organization and reinforcement but it seems that the spatially anchored assets buildings and infrastructure are the most likely causes of land price where the annual flows and mobile assets are as likely to be the effects of price as their cause when we chart land price against empower densities sej m2 yr and sej person yr the relationships become clearer as seen in fig 9 of annual flows sej m2 yr land price changes at a log of empower density of 15 that emergy density generally occurs in high density city centers brown 1980 and is exemplified in manhattan lee and braham 2017 fig 10 shows that emergy per capita sej person yr is a more consistent index for higher land prices with some variability moe srinivasan argue that higher emergy flows per capita translate into quality of life and the ability to afford more expensive land srinivasan and moe 2015 but higher per capita flows also occur in older low density towns hollowed out as the economy shifted the spatial density of asset empower does not have a clear relationship to land assessment which seems surprising but asset emergy per capita shown in fig 11 has the clearest correlation to land prices this would mean that the spatial concentration of assets described by sej m2 helps amplify power to the degree that it involves a greater density of population the chart also indicates a plateau beginning around log base 10 of 21 suggesting that there is an optimum concentration of assets a condition of maximum power after which the accumulation of assets becomes less productive this is a further demonstration of the dynamic between fixed and mobile assets with fixed assets like buildings and infrastructures only being effective to the degree that they attract mobile assets like people and their levels of education from the perspective of the city as an engine maximizing its power people are also mobile adaptable assets mobility is the factor not fully encompassed by this analysis the direct emergy costs of commuting and travel are included in each parcel however the third factor outlined above the value of adjacent parcels of land may be better understood as a function of travel time the value of a parcel benefits from the assets accumulated on other pieces of land in proportion to the speed with which they can be accessed whether by walking or transportation systems the next phase of the project will be to account for the effects of movement and transportation more directly which provides the first step to quantify the effects of teleconnection between different parts of the region and to produce a more meaningful and playable game seto et al 2012 5 conclusion the regional emergy analysis at the census tract level allows us to revisit current beliefs about how cities and regions work tracking the assets embodied in buildings infrastructure and education provides a fascinating picture of the layers of historical development in the region which are guided and constrained by the slow turnover time of structures and infrastructure it seems that each form of settlement attracts further investments that intensify it even as the original reason for the location changes by charting the emergy intensity of assets assembled over time emergy synthesis becomes a form of historic analysis spatially the largest amount of assets are concentrated at the city center confirming odum s broad proposition about the city as a concentrating system for amplifying power however the steady sprawl of the contemporary city over the last 60 years is revealed by the very high per capita emergy levels of the suburban centers and describes a form of power amplification heavily dependent on extensive automobile networks further exemplifying the importance of assets in the persistence of stable forms the older colonial centers of chester camden trenton and princeton still retain their spatial intensity though their roles and prosperity have changed dramatically as they have been fit into new roles within the regional economy the strong correlation between emergy intensities and land value confirms the broad hypothesis about the role of assets in the self organization of urban areas perhaps the most important insight is the reminder that fixed assets only succeed when they accommodate people in productive roles city building can been seen as the constant back and forth between fixed and mobile assets between structures and infrastructure with their long turnover times and more mobile people and their expertise funding initial phases of this research were supported by the kleinman center for energy policy university of

25071,social network analysis provides a powerful tool for understanding social organisation of animals however in free ranging populations it is almost impossible to monitor exhaustively the individuals of a population and to track their associations ignoring the issue of imperfect and possibly heterogeneous individual detection can lead to substantial bias in standard network measures here we develop capture recapture models to analyse network data while accounting for imperfect and heterogeneous detection we carry out a simulation study to validate our approach in addition we show how the visualisation of networks and the calculation of standard metrics can account for detection probabilities the method is illustrated with data from a population of commerson s dolphin cephalorhynchus commersonii in patagonia argentina our approach provides a step towards a general statistical framework for the analysis of social networks of wild animal populations keywords bayesian inference capture recapture multistate models social networks 1 introduction knowledge of the social organisation of animal populations is essential to develop sound conservation and management strategies as social structure affects habitat use information diffusion as well as the genetic composition and the spread of information and diseases within these populations krause and ruxton 2002 social network analysis sna croft et al 2008 whitehead 2008 has recently known an increasing number of applications to characterize in particular the social structure of animal populations sna allows the study of social networks through their visualisation and the calculation of several descriptive statistics with important applications in ecology evolution epidemiology and behavioural ecology craft and caillaud 2011 farine and whitehead 2015 krause et al 2007 sih et al 2009 wey et al 2008 in free ranging populations however individuals may or may not be seen or recaptured at various times over a study period this raises the issue of detectability less than one that makes it difficult to track associations between individuals in other words when one or two individuals of a dyad are missed were they associated or not besides being imperfect detection is often heterogeneous due to variation in individual traits such as e g sex tavecchia et al 2001 social status cubaynes et al 2010 hickey and sollmann 2019 infection status marescot et al 2018 or pair bond status choquet and gimenez 2012 culina et al 2013 overall ignoring the issue of imperfect and heterogeneous individual detection can lead to substantial bias in estimating the probability of association between individuals hoppitt and farine 2018 lusseau et al 2008 weko 2018 to address these issues klaich et al 2011 developed a capture recapture model where detection probabilities of individuals in dyads varied between individuals that are associated and those that are not their approach requires complex probabilistic calculations that make it specific to their case study and therefore difficult to extend to other situations here we use a state space modelling ssm approach e g buckland et al 2004 to acknowledge that data on associations between individuals derived from field studies are imperfect observations of the underlying social structure specifically the ssm approach makes the two component process underlying network structure explicit i the temporal dynamic of associations between individuals and ii the observations generated from the underlying process in i we apply the ssm framework to capture recapture cr data gimenez et al 2007 to analyse network data while accounting for imperfect and heterogeneous detection of individuals we estimate dyad association probability and distinguish the dynamic of associated vs non associated states from their partial observation we carry out a simulation study to assess bias in the association probability last we show how the visualisation and the calculation of standard network metrics can account for detection probabilities the approach is illustrated with data from a population of commerson s dolphin cephalorhynchus commersonii in patagonia argentina 2 model development 2 1 state space modelling of capture recapture data following klaich et al 2011 we derived dyad association histories from individual captures and non captures for example let us assume a 4 occasion cr experiment in which two individuals have capture histories 1011 and 1001 where a 1 stands for an individual detection and 0 for a non detection we considered that behavioural interactions between individuals occurred within groups gambit of the group sensu whitehead and dufault 1999 let us assume that these two individuals were both detected in the same group at the first occasion but in a different group at the last one then the association history for this particular dyad is 2013 where 0 stands for none of the two individuals of a dyad are seen 1 for one individual only of the dyad is seen 2 for the two individuals of a dyad are seen associated and 3 for the two individuals of a dyad are seen non associated to analyse these dyadic data we implemented a ssm formulation gimenez et al 2007 of multistate cr models lebreton et al 2009 for closed populations we considered two states a and b for dyad associated and dyad non associated respectively we denoted x t i a multinomial trial taking values 1 0 or 0 1 if at time t dyad i is in state a or b respectively given the underlying states a dyad may be recaptured in the observations 0 1 2 or 3 defined above considering imperfect detection we denoted y t i a multinomial trial taking values 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 if at time t dyad i is observed as a 0 1 2 or 3 the state space model relies on a combination of two equations first the state equation specifies the state of dyad i at time t given its state at time t 1 x t i multinomial 1 ψ x t 1 i where ψ gathers the probabilities for a dyad of staying associated and non associated between two successive occasions table 1 a we also defined the probability π for a dyad of being in initial state associated second the observation equation specifies the observation of dyad i at time t given its state at time t y t i multinomial 1 p x t i where p gathers the detection probabilities and of an individual being associated and non associated in a dyad table 1b 2 2 bayesian fitting using mcmc methods we used bayesian theory in conjunction with markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods to carry out inference inference was based on empirical medians and credible intervals as a by product of the mcmc simulations we also obtained numerical summaries for any function of the parameters in particular the metrics describing the network structure 2 3 calculating network measures while accounting for imperfect detection in sna a wide range of descriptive statistics can be used to characterize the properties of the structure of a network here we focused on four of them we used for each animal in the network the number of other animals with which it was associated degree and the number of shortest paths between pairs of animals that passed through it betweeness in addition we quantified the degree to which an animal s immediate neighbours were associated cluster coefficient and the average of all path lengths between all pairs of animals in the network average path length croft et al 2008 these measures are useful to characterize the properties of a network regarding the spread of disease or information craft and caillaud 2011 watts and strogatz 1998 a feature of mcmc algorithms is that the dyad states x t i s are treated as parameters to be estimated just like the transition and detection probabilities we generated values from the posterior distributions of the dyads states which in turn were used to visualize the network and characterize its structure over time specifically for each mcmc iteration we calculated the degree and betweeness for each individual r package sna butts 2008 as well as the clustering coefficient and the average path length r package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 hence obtaining the posterior distribution for each of these metrics data and codes are available on github https github com oliviergimenez social networks capture recapture 3 simulation study we conducted a simulation study to assess the bias in parameter estimates we considered a scenario where detection probabilities were homogeneous we simulated 100 cr datasets with π 0 2 0 7 ψaa 0 1 0 4 0 9 and ψbb 0 1 0 4 0 9 and pa pb 0 3 0 8 in total 36 different configurations and to each simulated dataset we fitted a cr model with homogeneous detection probabilities we also considered a heterogeneous scenario where all parameters were set to the same values as in the homogeneous scenarios except the detection probabilities which we set to pa 0 3 pb 0 8 and pa 0 8 pb 0 3 in total 36 different configurations we fitted a model with heterogeneous detection probabilities to these simulated datasets for both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous scenarios we calculated the relative bias of all parameters for the homogeneous scenarios the bias decreased when detection increased table 2 bias was negligible on detection around 5 on the transition probabilities and around 13 on π in scenario 19 with ψbb 0 4 when ψbb 0 9 in scenario 31 the bias in π decreased by a factor 2 for the heterogeneous scenarios the bias was negligible except for scenario 31 in which the proportion of associated dyads was low and all dyads tended to remain non associated table 3 4 case study to illustrate our methodological approach we used a real world example as a case study we used photo identification data on a population of commerson s dolphin c commersonii that was monitored in the coastal waters near the chubut river mouth 43 20 s 65 00 w in the patagonian coast coscarella et al 2003 commerson s dolphins are particularly abundant in the area during the austral spring coscarella et al 2010 the mean residence time in the sampling area was 15 days se 6 4 therefore we sampled 5 times in october 2007 to unravel which individual was associated with which while arriving and leaving the area together coscarella et al 2011 two individuals were considered associated when they were photo identified during the same encounter while they were considered not associated otherwise coscarella et al 2011 over the study a total of 71 dolphins were detected which led to 71 71 1 2 2485 association histories based on previous analyses klaich et al 2011 we considered time dependent state independent individual detection probabilities individual detections varied between 11 and 44 table 4 the probability of staying associated was 33 while that of staying non associated was 57 with very little overlap in the credible intervals table 4 suggesting a high turnover in the dynamic of associations and a fission fusion social organization along the five sampling occasions the estimated network showed changes in its structure fig 1 at occasions 1 2 3 and 5 the estimated network had a single component with a higher number of associated dyads at occasion 1 than at occasions 2 3 and 5 although the number of dyads was higher at occasion 1 all networks were fully connected i e none individual or group of individuals were isolated from other individuals at occasion 4 the network estimated had two components isolated from each other i e none of the individuals from one component was associated with any of the individuals in the other component this suggests that at least two groups might exist having preferential associations between individuals inside each group average path length was lower on the first sampling occasion than in the subsequent ones while the reverse pattern was observed for the clustering coefficient table 4 these estimated values also suggest high individual connectivity and that the estimated social network has features related to a small world type network at the individual level degree was heterogeneous fig 2 with individuals spreading all over the range of its distribution fig 2 in contrast betweeness appeared relatively homogeneous despite some dolphins with low betweeness and a single animal with very high betweeness fig 2 5 discussion we have proposed a new statistical approach combining network analyses with cr models formulated as state space models our framework has several appealing advantages first and most importantly ignoring imperfect and possibly heterogeneous detection may lead to biased results about the structure and dynamics of associations see fig 1 our cr model provides a robust method to estimate social networks second in addition to social status our model can easily incorporate individual level traits such as age or sex through regression like functions this opens an avenue towards investigating the relationships between the phenotype and social position of individuals third our method provides unbiased and precise estimates of relevant metrics to characterise the properties of social networks see the simulation study section the whole process being controlled for imperfect and heterogeneous detection another appealing feature of our approach is the quantification of uncertainty associated to network measures under the form of bayesian credible intervals table 2 and fig 2 last the social organisation can be visualised over time while accounting for imperfect detection providing the opportunity for testing socio ecological hypotheses in free ranging animal populations for example the rapid turnover of the free ranging commerson s dolphin groups has been previously proposed coscarella et al 2011 and here we could identify this turnover within the fission fusion society model when inspecting the results of the dolphin case study there are advantages in adopting a cr approach to infer social networks first when it comes to visualizing the network we illustrate in fig 1 what we would obtain with a standard approach with in black edges while the green edges correspond to the dyads that are estimated to be associated with the new approach by correcting for imperfect detection clearly the structure and dynamics of the network are different depending on whether we ignore imperfect detection black edges only or we consider the model based estimated network edges of both colors second regarding network metrics the only way to estimate degree and betweenness for all occasions when non detections occur fig 2 is to resort to a cr approach to account for missing values our cr model requires data on individuals that can be uniquely identifiable identifying individuals can be achieved using non invasive marking such as coat patterns body scars or genetic profiling for mammals e g cubaynes et al 2010 marescot et al 2018 santostasi et al 2016 or invasive marking such as rings for birds colouring for insects or passive integrated transponders for fishes e g băncilă et al 2018 buoro et al 2010 lagrange et al 2014 the model also needs data on interactions or associations here we rely on the gambit of the group method which states that all individuals within a group of animals observed at a point in time are associated farine and whitehead 2015 our model relies on several assumptions first we have considered closed populations while demographic process might occur in animal populations the extension of our model to open populations is feasible lebreton et al 2009 to incorporate survival and dispersal therefore allowing to assess the influence of social structure on fitness second we assumed that association states were correctly assigned while some uncertainty might occur due to incomplete information in the ssm framework incorporating uncertainty in state assignment is relatively straightforward gimenez et al 2012 pradel 2005 third we assumed independence of the association histories to form the ssm likelihood to account for an individual effect random effects can be incorporated in cr models choquet et al 2013 choquet and gimenez 2012 gimenez and choquet 2010 which opens a promising avenue towards a general statistical framework for the analysis of animal social networks cross et al 2012 van duijn et al 2004 overall we hope our proposal will foster applications of social network analysis to free ranging animal population in behavioural ecology to describe social behaviour and social dynamics in evolution ecology to explore the fitness consequences of the social positions of individuals and in epidemiological ecology to

25072,of all the challenges facing the sustainability of cities water food and energy are the most critical in the context of rapid urbanization unsustainable human activities have resulted in fundamental changes in the structure and function of land cover and urban water systems and the degradation of ecosystem services taking beijing a typical fast growing mega city as an example to establish a food energy water impact model this research studied the temporal spatial changes in the water system pattern in a mega city along with the driving forces especially the nexus to rice production and energy and the ensuing series of environmental impacts on the basis of land use data remote sensing images and thematic maps from 1993 2001 and 2007 water system information was extracted and adjusted for beijing with the aid of rs and gis techniques the water system was classified into four types and the spatial and temporal dynamic of the landscape patterns of beijing s water system systematically was analyzed the landscape metrics were then calculated using fragstats 3 3 the results show that the total area of water system in beijing declined from 63 494 ha to 43 652 ha from 1993 to 2007 the decrease of the linear water surface is more significant than that of the non linear water surface in the terms of landscape metrics change the number of patches has decreased from 5510 to 5396 the density indexes have increased by 40 61 the average area of patches has decreased by 30 18 the patch shape has tended to become more regular and the overall pattern of the water system is becoming more fragmented urban sprawl the shortage of water resources and the increasing amount of construction land are the major reasons accounting for the changes in the water system in beijing because of these changes farmland has decreased by 212 428 ha and especially rice paddy fields are significantly decreasing from 52 200 ha in 1980 to 199 6 ha in 2015 a decrease of 99 62 consequently rice production is decreasing by 99 61 more energy is being consumed for food production meanwhile the local water supply rate has decreased from 100 to 78 4 between 2001 to 2016 the underground water level has decreased by 14 24 m from 1994 to 2016 there is more competition for water resources more urban water flooding disasters and emerging urban environmental problems such as declining underground water level posing a serious threat to the sustainability of the city therefore a systematic and smart thinking is needed to analyze the complex land use water food energy relationship keywords water system f e w system landscape pattern land use and land cover temporal spatial change beijing 1 introduction food energy water f e w constitutes a combination of three essential resources that are critical to the development of every city the exploitation and utilization of water requires energy yet energy production cannot be separated from water for example coal mining and hydropower generation are both reliant on water indeed in china hydropower accounts for 12 3 of national water consumption 4 1 of the water use and 8 3 of the wastewater discharge the production and processing of grain also requires both water and energy by 2011 agriculture took up 62 of the water use in china water also constrains the production of food as the development and servicing of water systems is critical for agriculture when water shortages prevent local farms from producing sufficient food food must be transported sometimes from great distances thus consuming more energy the efficient management and utilization of the food energy water resource is also essential to cope with many challenges such as climate change and we have yet to develop a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of these systems and their feedback mechanisms ringler et al 2013 walker et al 2014 estimated resource fluxes nutrients water and energy entering leaving and circulating within an urban watershed system as well as the economic benefits of managing the f e w system zhao et al 2018 used a long term hydrologic impact analysis model to simulate the relationship between agricultural development and water and energy use in xining city qinghai province currently and into the future and concluded that pressure on the development of f e w system would continue to increase as time goes on chen et al 2018 studied the effects of input capacity constraints on food quality and the design of regulation mechanisms for food safety management and concluded that incentives would be more effective than sanctions for improving food quality the landscape pattern of a water system refers to the spatial arrangement and combination of various types of natural and artificial water bodies including their type quantity and spatial distribution fu 2003 in the early 1950s descriptive research on landscape patterns was carried out by forman forman and godron 1986 and quantitative research in the field began in earnest in the 1970s turner and gardner 1991 at present studies on water system landscape patterns mainly include the influence of urbanization on wetland landscape patterns the relationship between water quality and changes in landscape patterns and the influences of climate change changes in water landscape patterns will influence the evolution of wetland landscapes and wetland ecosystem structures and their functions therefore studying the dynamic changes in wetland landscape patterns can explain the changes to wetland landscapes over time in terms of components and functions bai et al 2005 2008 as well as provide theoretical support for wetland resources utilization conservation and management using support erdas image arcgis and fragstats software he et al 2011 analyzed the distribution and temporal spatial changes in the wetlands of zhengzhou city in 2002 and 2009 the results showed that the area of the yellow river as well as that of local ponds had decreased because of the drop in upstream inflow and that urbanization had a significant impact on the changes of landscape patterns in yellow river wetlands xia et al 2012 analyzed landscape patterns and river water quality in baiyangdian by using gis tools and the landscape pattern index method the results showed that urban construction and farming are the main causes of water pollution in that region based on remote sensing and field measurement data in 1900 and 2006 zhou et al 2012 found that the water quality in the upstream midstream and downstream reaches of the dong river had clearly deteriorated over the past few decades and was continuing to do so ever more rapidly land use patterns and land cover types have significant effects on the flow and water quality of the dong river at multiple spatial scales some scholars have found that river landscape patterns have been strongly influenced by urbanization and that 60 of the world s rivers have significantly changed nicola 2003 aear and mewson 2003 a study in shanghai yang et al 2004 also showed that the urbanization process had influenced the water system structure tending to simplify the river system using the shenzhen drainage maps in 1982 and 2002 huang et al 2008 quantitatively analyzed the influence of urbanization on water system structure concluding that the river s total length density and number of channels through shenzhen had decreased and that the decrease rate was even higher in low level tributaries these previous studies of the urban water system pattern all focused on the changes in the river system structure however there have been few researches about total urban water system patterns such as a comprehensive analysis including ponds lakes ditches and other kinds of water bodies and how the water system pattern affects the f e w resource furthermore most major research was performed on cities with humid climates and abundant water resources few studies have focused on the mega cities located in arid and semi arid regions where the landscape patterns probably change more significantly and suffer more severe f e w resource problems the landscape index landscape metrics is the main tool of landscape pattern analysis fu et al 2011 its data mainly come from maps based on remote sensing rs geographic information system gis and global positioning system gps technologies deng 2010 however the landscape index is actually sensitive to the classification system or index of the data source e g remote sensing image versus land use map as well as to the observation or sample scales li et al 2004 whereas it is not sensitive to the functional characteristic of landscapes wiens 1989 as an important source of original data in landscape pattern analysis rs technology has certain limitations when used in the analysis of water system landscape patterns first while remote sensing data is quite useful in revealing land cover conditions it is unable to reflect the specific uses of a water system by the resident population for example rs technology cannot determine whether a pond is used for flood retention recreation or fishing second the commonly used spatial resolution of remote sensing data is 30m 30 m landsat tm and while this is useful for analyzing regional land cover over a large area its accuracy is insufficient for large scale analysis based on large scale thematic maps and artificial statistic of land use however the function of a water system can be determined making up for the defects of remote sensing data nevertheless this kind of data also has limitations for example it cannot distinguish whether the river and lakes are stable or are drying up and therefore it is unable to reflect the real ecological functions of a water body thus in order to guarantee the reliability of landscape pattern analysis it is necessary not only to perform a deep analysis of the regional geographical elements and aquatic ecosystem types but also to use data of different origins such as land use statistic data thematic maps and remote sensing images to complement the analysis to solve these problems taking beijing city as an example this study analyzes the spatial patterns and changing rules of different types of water system elements including rivers channels reservoirs lakes ponds and reed patches tidal flats both inside and surrounding the city with the application of rs and gis techniques the water system data of beijing metropolitan area were extracted from the land use statistic data at various different times and were then revised according to remote sensing images and thematic maps in this way the errors and missing information of the existing land use data were corrected and supplemented using the landscape pattern index analysis method the analysis results based on the original and corrected data were compared and evaluated using this method the characteristics of dynamic changes driving factors and potential impacts on the ecosystem services of the f e w system in beijing during the rapid urbanization process were analyzed quantitatively and an implementation strategy for repairing the f e w nexus and environmental problems is proposed thus providing scientific evidence for the informed management of f e w resources of mega cities 2 research model methods and data sources 2 1 research area and model as the capital of china beijing is representative of the mega cities of developing countries and even of the whole world beijing is located in northwestern portion of the north china plain 39 26 41 03 n 115 25 117 30 e with a total area of 16 410 km2 beijing has a semi arid and semi humid warm temperate continental monsoon climate the rainfall averages about 600 mm a year beijing water affairs bureau 1980 2017 but rainfall distribution is very unevenly distributed among the seasons the average annual precipitation is 9 237 billion m3 in beijing surface runoff takes up 1 203 billion m3 groundwater resources take up 1 774 billion m3 and the total locally produced water resource is around 2 977 billion m3 per year there are five drainage systems within beijing the average amount of water inflow is 0 503 billion m3 the exit flow 1 726 billion m3 beijing water affairs bureau 1980 2017 beijing is a city with a serious water scarcity while the water resource occupied per capita is 137 m3 first we established a model based on the food energy water resource and the urbanization process and used this model as a research framework in the process of rapid urban expansion the urban development process is constrained by both natural resources and urban policies this tripartite resource f e w has collectively changed the land use type of the city among the three components we chose the water system land use type as the core and the evolution of the water system was examined taking into account the changes in land use type especially the increased amount of urban construction land decreasing farmland we determined that there have been direct environmental consequences such as increasing urban runoff decreasing surface water resources decreasing underground water and reduction in food production at the same time these environmental impacts undermine the stability of urban ecosystems and enlarge the ecological footprint we conducted quantitative research to analyze the impact of these changes in the water system on food energy and the environment and posing strategies to solve the environment problems fig 1 2 2 land use data sources the major data in this study included the land use statistic data of beijing for 1993 2001 and 2007 and the landsat tm remote sensing images of beijing for 1993 2001 and 2007 30 m resolution ratio based on the existing water system landscape structure and the landscape research method rs and existing data were used to obtain information about the surface water system landscape in the vast majority of research and gis was employed to quantitatively and spatially analyze the water system information in order to understand the transformation of urban land types based on the current land use structure of 2007 after reclassifying and correcting the land use data of beijing we imported it into arcgis first constructing the spatial data topology and then establishing the attributes corresponding to each type of spatial data from this we then made our statistical calculations and developed the attribute table finally we built a classification of land use types in beijing table 1 2 3 water system classifications and data adjustments in this study based on the actual conditions of the water system of beijing the water area in the land use classification was subdivided into river ditch reservoir lake pond and reed patch intertidal zone table 2 and among these the river ditch was the only linear water element identifying the significant ecological corridors within beijing while reservoir lake pond and reed patch intertidal zone represented non linear water bodies with different functions and areas as significant patches in the water landscape analysis in the early land use surveys some linear land cover and land use factors were not regarded as key content in the survey as a result in the land use data of 1993 the linear water bodies such as rivers and ditches were cursory resulting in land use data that did not accurately reflect the real conditions of the water system the data were therefore interpolated in order to include linear water bodies as a type of land use in this research the specific modification was that the linear water area was determined through a combined manual computerized interpretation using the arcgis platform according to the water related thematic map and remote sensing image from the 1990s fig 2 wang 2010 in addition owing to a decrease in the precipitation recharge and damming by the upper reservoir as well as groundwater recession most rivers and streams in the plain area contained no water and some reservoirs lakes rivers and ponds were severely short of water directly restricting the implementation of the water ecosystem function although these water bodies were regarded as rivers ditches lakes reservoirs or ponds in the land use statistic they might be short of water all year round no longer providing the necessary ecosystem service functions therefore it was necessary to measure and calculate the real water surface to obtain data reflecting the actual condition of the land cover therefore in order to obtain useful remote sensing images for 1993 2001 and 2007 july and august data were selected the water surface was then extracted according to the remote sensing interpretation described above on that basis the actual area of water surface and the landscape pattern indexes of the wet season in beijing were analyzed and calculated thus reflecting the real conditions of the water landscape patterns and aquatic ecosystem services 2 4 landscape pattern analysis the landscape pattern index represents the spatial characteristics of a landscape and it can reflect these characteristics from the landscape element level up to the level of the entire landscape in this study based on previous literature chen et al 2002 the representative landscape pattern indexes were selected including the np number of patches pd patch density lpi largest patch index enn mn euclidean nearest neighbor distance cohesion and division np represents the number of patches pd represents the patch density lpi represents the largest patch index it can reflect the percentage of the largest patch in the total landscape area enn mn represents the euclidean nearest neighbor distance it is widely used to quantify the degree of patch dispersion the minimum proximity distance referred is the shortest straight line distance between a particular patch and its nearest peer in euclidean geometry cohesion represents the patch cohesion index cohesion is used to measure the physical connectivity of the corresponding patch type division represents the landscape division index the degree of division is based on the accumulation of the patch distribution area and it represents the probability that two randomly selected pixels are not located in the same patch in the corresponding patch type here with the three sets of land use data of beijing 1993 2001 and 2007 and remote sensing images the water system was classified and calculated on the arcgis platform and the landscape pattern indexes of the water system were computed with fragstats 3 3 thus allowing the temporal spatial changes of the water system in beijing during the rapid urbanization process to be analyzed 2 5 direct environmental consequences and analysis the soil conversation service curve number scs cn model is a mathematical model developed by the u s department of agriculture s soil and water conservation bureau in the 1950s to estimate surface runoff it can estimate the direct runoff from a certain rainfall on a catchment the scs cn model was used to calculate the total runoff through the number of runoff curves cn where the value of cn depends on factors such as antecedent moisture condition soil type land cover slope and so on since the establishment of the scs cn model it has become a widely used method for estimating runoff throughout the world wang et al 2015 at present researches on scs cn model mainly focus on the accurate value of cn scs cn model is used to calculate the runoff amount to forecast the disaster or to recover the rainwater zhao 2012 in this study the scs cn model was used to calculate and simulate the runoff under different land cover conditions to study the impact of land cover type changes on urban runoff specific governing equations can be found as the following the calculation formula of cn value is shown in eq 1 1 c n c c n p

assess the local supply rate of food and water we also established food and water supply rates to measure food and water security data sources such as surface water groundwater and related water resources are collected in the beijing water resources bulletin from the beijing water authority beijing water affairs bureau 1980 2017 the data related to rice and energy were collected from a series of continuous statistical yearbooks of beijing beijing municipal bureau of statistics 1992 2007 3 results of water system and land use changes 3 1 area changes of the water system in beijing in recent years there have been dramatic changes in the patterns processes and functions of the water ecosystem in beijing resulting in a series of severe ecological problems such as shrinking wetlands a gradual decrease in the underground water level fragmentation in the water system landscape pattern frequent occurrence of urban drainage floods loss of rain water resources a decrease in biological diversity and deterioration of the quality of the water environment of these shrinking wetlands are one of the most significant and direct reasons for the decreasing quality of the water ecosystem service according to a study conducted by li et al since 1996 the wetland area of beijing decreased year by year showing an obvious degradation trend specifically the wetland area of beijing was 605 67 km2 in 1996 but only 466 77 km2 in 1998 since then the wetland resource in beijing has been continuing to degrade until in 2006 it was only 270 38 km2 having decreased 42 1 from its 1998 level and 55 4 from its 1996 level li et al 2008 it is can be easily seen that the water area in beijing fell by 5 08 from 1993 to 2007 table 3 among the different water types the area of ponds decreased the most by 15 89 at the same time the area of reservoirs and lakes also dropped by 7 16 putting them in second place the areas of rivers and ditches first increased and then decreased while the areas of reed patches and intertidal zones decreased and then increased fig 3 wang 2010 looking at the change ranges for the different types of water bodies it can be seen that the extent of change of the linear elements was less than that of the non linear elements the smaller sized water patches such as ponds decreased faster than the larger sized ones such as reservoirs and lakes from the temporal perspective the rate of change from 2001 to 2007 was greater than that from 1993 to 2001 for the water system as a whole 3 2 actual water quantity changes in beijing it can be seen from the statistical data for 2007 table 4 that among the various water areas in beijing that of reservoir lake was the greatest mainly because there are many large and medium sized reservoirs in beijing such as the miyun reservoir the guanting reservoir and so forth the ponds mainly distributed in the environs of beijing city make up the second largest proportion the river ditch and reed patch mud flat types are characterized with typical ecological functions but make up the smallest proportion of the water system as for the variations in area from 1993 to 2007 the total area of the water system in beijing declined from 63 494 ha to 43 652 ha about a 31 25 decrease in fact the areas of all the types of water landscape decreased dramatically with the area of the river ditch type decreasing the most about 34 30 while the areas of reservoir lake and pond decreased by 31 68 and 31 85 respectively and the area of reed patch mud flat showed a small decrease about 21 62 generally the change rate of the linear water area was greater than that of the non linear water area as for the reduction in the area of the water system the decreasing speed from 2001 to 2007 19 12 was greater than that from 1993 to 2001 15 the reductions in river ditch and reservoir lake types by contrast were greater from 1993 to 2001 than from 2001 to 2007 opposite to the trends for the pond and the reed patch mud flat fig 4 wang 2010 as for land area covered the total water system areas obtained from original land use data for 1993 2001 2007 were 78 019 ha 78 099 ha and 74 055 ha respectively which are all larger than the actual water surface area based on our revised data 63 494 ha 53 972 ha and 43 652 ha respectively in terms of change magnitude the actual surface water area decreased by 31 25 while the reported reduction in the water system area was only 5 08 this result shows that the change of actual surface area was more significant than the structural changes of the water system in beijing for example the total length of the rivers and ditches actually experienced a slight growth but the actual water area of the river and ditches decreased 34 30 in the same period as can be seen from the above analysis there is a big difference in the landscape pattern analysis results between using land use data and using corrected data in this study although the major structures and forms of the lakes reservoirs rivers and ditches still exist the aquatic ecosystem services cannot be fully provided due to the scarcity of water resources in the beijing metropolitan area the results suggest that water system data need to be carefully checked and even revised for any similar analysis in the future allowing a more objective evaluation of urban water system change and landscape ecological functions to be obtained 3 3 temporal spatial changes of the landscape pattern of water system in beijing looking at the changes in the landscape pattern indexes of the water system in beijing table 5 the np indexes of the water system decreased the pd indexes of the water system increased the average patch area decreased the distances between patches increased the form of the patches tended to become more regular the cohesion decreased and the division increased all the changes in these indexes showed that the landscape pattern of the water system tended to become more fragmented and the small patches decreased more significantly it can be seen from the variation speed of the landscape indexes that this speed generally decreased and that the variation ranges from 1993 to 2001 was greater than that from 2001 to 2007 among the indexes the pd and lpi had the greatest variation range suggesting that the number and density of water patches changed dramatically the area of single water bodies decreased and the density increased the indexes of the overall landscape pattern had a smaller variation range showing that there was no evident change in the landscape pattern of the regional water system 3 4 changes of land use in order to understand the changes of the water system by land use type construction land and farmland we obtained the change of land use type table 6 and the land use type of the beijing transfer probability matrix table 7 by combining gis and land use data fig 5 wang 2010 from the perspective of beijing s land types the land areas used for the water system and for farmland have been greatly reduced while construction land has increased significantly table 6 the decrease in water system land is mainly attributable to the increase in construction land accounting for 13 89 but this has been partly offset by increases to the water area from arable land and other land accounting for 6 69 table 7 the continuous transformation of farmland to other types of land is the main source of new land types such as garden land woodland and construction land 22 40 of the decrease has gone to construction land increases in farmland meanwhile have come mainly from garden plots water areas and other land farmland has been more susceptible to change when it is located near human activity centers the number location and functions of which are shifting with urbanization the increase in construction land has come mainly from farmland and garden land accounting for 22 40 and 15 74 respectively construction land is highly irreversible and about 83 of it has not been transformed among other non construction land garden plots have been transformed mainly to forest land and construction land while their increase has come mainly from farmland due to the expansion of beijing total area and statistical errors the total area will have a little of errors 4 results of land use pattern changes on water food and energy 4 1 increasing surface runoff and urban flooding disasters in this study the soil conversation service curve number scs cn model was used to calculate and simulate the runoff under different land covers so as to study the impact of the change of land cover type on urban runoff specific governing equations can be found in the section 2 5 and the cn value was listed in the table 8 in order to understand the impacts of the changes of land type on runoff in beijing we selected the suburban areas with large changes in land type as the study area and calculated the changes in runoff the inner suburbs of beijing include the chaoyang district the haidian district the fengtai district and the shijingshan district with a total area of 1275 93 km2 accounting for 7 76 of the city this area undertakes beijing area urban expansion development dredge function at present the type of land is mainly urban construction land and the level of urbanization is relatively high according to the calculation results table 9 the runoff in 2001 had increased compared with 1993 by 1 28 in 2007 it was significantly increased compared with 2001 with an increase of 4 21 in other words with these changes in urban development and land type the urban rainwater runoff trend increased faster and more significantly in reality the frequency of flooding disasters in beijing suburbs is also increasing since 1960 the frequency has increased significantly every ten years between 1960 and 2016 there were 21 flooding disasters and the frequency of occurrence increased year by year fig 6 taking beijing s july 21 2012 rainstorm disaster as an example 77 people were killed and the economic loss was 120 million yuan when urban drainage land decreases and construction land increases the impermeability of the construction land will lead to an increase in urban runoff at the same time as the area of the water system decreases rainfall cannot be absorbed into nearby drainage systems such as pits and ponds causing the accumulation of runoff to increase and elevating the occurrence of urban flooding disaster increasing energy to solve the urban flooding disaster partial data source ye et al 2018 4 2 decreasing surface water resources and surface water supply through analysis of the supply of water resources in beijing it was found that the supply of water from local sources in beijing has been declining year by year increasing the reliance on external water transfers such as from the south to north water diversion project the supply of water from local sources in beijing declined from 100 to 78 4 between 2001 to 2016 while the supply of local surface water decreased from 30 05 to 5 36 over the same period from 1 17 billion m3 in 2001 to 208 million m3 in 2016 despite the impact of inbound immigration flow and reservoir impoundment the amount of surface water resources has increased but the available surface water is still declining making beijing rely more on external water transfers such as from the south to north water transfer fig 7 at the same time competition for industrial agricultural and urban domestic water will be intensified leading to increased energy consumption to meet the demand for water 4 3 decreasing groundwater resources and related analysis according to analysis the underground water level decreased by 14 241 m from 1994 to 2016 from 1994 to 2006 the decrease was dramatic with an average annual decrease of 0 878 m the decline was slower from 2006 to 2016 dropping an average of 0 371 m per year at the same time the storage of groundwater declined by 9 21 billion m3 in 2016 compared with 1980 fig 8 the storage of groundwater is closely related to the groundwater level when the local water level rises even slightly the groundwater reserves will increase accordingly at this stage the water level in individual years has rebounded slightly the impervious surfaces in urban construction land affects the rainfall infiltration thus influencing the groundwater level in order to analyze the relationship between the urban construction land and the underground water level we set up a multiple regression model based on rainfall amounts construction land types and the amount of groundwater mining so as to analyze how these relationships affected the underground water level we selected data from 2001 to 2015 including rainfall x1 the area of urban construction land x2 groundwater exploitation x3 and groundwater level y and established the multiple regression analysis the following model was obtained 5 y 15 82 1 596 x1 0 583 x2 0 556 x3 however since p x1 0 548 p x2 0 0088 and p x3 0 0006 it can be seen that the significance of x1 is not obvious when compared with the x2 of urban construction land or the x3 of underground water extraction however the urban land area x2 and the groundwater exploitation amount x3 can affect the groundwater level in more obvious ways therefore multiple regression models of urban construction land x2 groundwater exploitation quantity x3 and groundwater level y were established again as follows 6 y 17 01 0 529 x2 0 567x3 the adjusted r2 of the model 0 958 r 0 982 and r2 0 965 the correlation degree between x2 and x3 was 0 982 the fitting effect and interpretation degree were 0 982 and the simulation effect was relatively good this result shows that the groundwater level was affected by the urban construction land and the groundwater exploitation quantity and the groundwater exploitation quantity had a slightly higher influence on the groundwater level than did the urban construction land the model of groundwater resources and groundwater table presented a negative correlation because with declining water levels groundwater reserves decreased since the adjusted groundwater water policy in beijing was adopted the production of groundwater has been reduced and other sources of water were used to relieve the tension of water problems such as the south north water diversion groundwater exploitation is closely related to groundwater level although we continue to limit the exploitation of underground water the continued expansion of urban construction land area prevents the groundwater from being replenished in time and the groundwater level is consequently also on a downward trend clearly it is not enough just to reduce the amount of exploitation to control the decline of groundwater it is equally important to promote the reclamation of groundwater and reduce the area of impervious land 4 4 reduction in food production and self sufficiency rate and increasing energy consumption it can be seen from the above analysis that since the 1990s the water system area has been severely reduced in beijing the landscape pattern is tending toward fragmentation and this trend is becoming even more severe the shrinking of surface water area and the declining connectivity of the water landscape were already the significant factors restricting the hydrological regulating function in beijing posing severe threats to the overall quality of ecological conditions in beijing the output of rice dropped from 296 930 tons in 1980 to 1391 5 tons in 2015 down by 99 53 the area dedicated to paddy fields fell from 50 800 ha in 1980 to 1970 51 ha in 2015 down by 96 12 the planting area of rice decreased from 52 200 ha in 1980 to 199 6 ha in 2015 a decrease of 99 62 fig 9 with the rapid reduction and destruction of the water system in beijing the surface water and groundwater resources are decreasing and rice production in beijing is on the verge of collapse in the u s the total energy used for producing food is categorized into four main groups 21 for crop cultivation 14 for transportation 11 16 for food processing and around 50 for food handling e g food packaging service and sales lillie 2015 we know that when food is not supplied locally more energy is needed to transport and reprocess the food from other places otherwise new ways must be explored of using the water resources to adapt to these changes meanwhile more energy is used to cultivate crops that can adapt to changes in the water system pattern and this will translate to increase per capita energy consumption fig 10 data source lillie 2015 urban food self sufficiency is one of the important indicators for assessing local food security based on the per capita food demand index of the balanced dietary model of chinese residents each person needs 118 63 kg of grain per year and the required rice accounts for 55 4 of this amount tang et al 2012 therefore we estimated the total annual demand for rice based on the population and then calculated the self sufficiency rate for local rice the rice yield in beijing the total demand for rice per year the self sufficiency rate of local rice it can be seen from fig 11 that the self sufficiency rate of rice in beijing in 1993 was 26 95 by 2016 it had dropped to 0 08 a decrease of 99 7 the decline in urban self sufficiency rate directly affects food security in beijing at the same time in terms of ecosystem stability it also illustrates the rapid decline of urban ecosystem supply services in beijing which affects the stability of urban ecosystems 5 conclusion through this study we found that in arid and semi arid area water plays a significantly important and core role in f e w system taking beijing as an example during the process of rapid urbanization the total area of water system is being rapidly reduced due to its complex reasons and its patter becomes more regular and fragmented which also trigger a series of environmental problems such as pressure on surface water resources increase in surface runoff and more frequent urban flooding disasters decrease in underground water level the decline of the water system like ponds and reed patches which have the high ecological value has pushed rice production to the verge of collapse these environmental problems have profoundly affected food and water security as well as urban environmental safety yet in order to solve these environmental and food challenges it is necessary to consume more energy aimed at the outstanding problems in beijing including the water resource shortages and the fragmentation of the water system pattern the f e w ecosystem was assessed and restoration strategies were proposed establishing a water ecological security pattern to protect the water system space using the f e w nexus model analysis to enhance the ecological stability recovering the natural hydrological cycle by combined with sponge city construction yu et al 2015 1 in the process of rapid urbanization we should pay attention to protecting aquatic ecosystems and establishing water ecological security patterns using f e w nexus model analysis in the process of rapid urbanization water ecosystems should be protected and the relationship between water ecosystems and food and energy should be emphasized a water ecological security pattern should be established yu et al 2011 the encroachment of urban development areas on water ecosystems should be limited and protections for the water ecological security pattern should be implemented to avoid even more problems caused by the deterioration of the water environment at the same time an evaluation model of f e w should be established to find the optimal solution to lowering the impact of urbanization on the environment including the f e w system 2 restoration of the water ecosystems should be combined with sponge city construction and food harvest which can help to reduce energy consumption and improve the stability of urban ecology security combined with sponge city construction to restore the water system recycle rainwater can be collected with economical and appropriate measures and can be used for irrigation and replenishment of landscape ponds to recharge underground water by combining stormwater facilities and landscape design for food harvest landscape ponds and plantations of green space can be used as multi functional retention facilities and green and blue ecological infrastructure yu et al 2012 to form creative green space integrating the ecological management of rainwater recharging the groundwater food harvest creating wetland landscape and even serving recreational functions which can help to reduce energy consumption and improve the stability of urban ecology and reduce the city s ecological footprint acknowledgements the research project was funded by the beijing land resources bureau title beijing ecological security pattern research and in part by the national natural science foundation of china 31870704 51208020 
25072,of all the challenges facing the sustainability of cities water food and energy are the most critical in the context of rapid urbanization unsustainable human activities have resulted in fundamental changes in the structure and function of land cover and urban water systems and the degradation of ecosystem services taking beijing a typical fast growing mega city as an example to establish a food energy water impact model this research studied the temporal spatial changes in the water system pattern in a mega city along with the driving forces especially the nexus to rice production and energy and the ensuing series of environmental impacts on the basis of land use data remote sensing images and thematic maps from 1993 2001 and 2007 water system information was extracted and adjusted for beijing with the aid of rs and gis techniques the water system was classified into four types and the spatial and temporal dynamic of the landscape patterns of beijing s water system systematically was analyzed the landscape metrics were then calculated using fragstats 3 3 the results show that the total area of water system in beijing declined from 63 494 ha to 43 652 ha from 1993 to 2007 the decrease of the linear water surface is more significant than that of the non linear water surface in the terms of landscape metrics change the number of patches has decreased from 5510 to 5396 the density indexes have increased by 40 61 the average area of patches has decreased by 30 18 the patch shape has tended to become more regular and the overall pattern of the water system is becoming more fragmented urban sprawl the shortage of water resources and the increasing amount of construction land are the major reasons accounting for the changes in the water system in beijing because of these changes farmland has decreased by 212 428 ha and especially rice paddy fields are significantly decreasing from 52 200 ha in 1980 to 199 6 ha in 2015 a decrease of 99 62 consequently rice production is decreasing by 99 61 more energy is being consumed for food production meanwhile the local water supply rate has decreased from 100 to 78 4 between 2001 to 2016 the underground water level has decreased by 14 24 m from 1994 to 2016 there is more competition for water resources more urban water flooding disasters and emerging urban environmental problems such as declining underground water level posing a serious threat to the sustainability of the city therefore a systematic and smart thinking is needed to analyze the complex land use water food energy relationship keywords water system f e w system landscape pattern land use and land cover temporal spatial change beijing 1 introduction food energy water f e w constitutes a combination of three essential resources that are critical to the development of every city the exploitation and utilization of water requires energy yet energy production cannot be separated from water for example coal mining and hydropower generation are both reliant on water indeed in china hydropower accounts for 12 3 of national water consumption 4 1 of the water use and 8 3 of the wastewater discharge the production and processing of grain also requires both water and energy by 2011 agriculture took up 62 of the water use in china water also constrains the production of food as the development and servicing of water systems is critical for agriculture when water shortages prevent local farms from producing sufficient food food must be transported sometimes from great distances thus consuming more energy the efficient management and utilization of the food energy water resource is also essential to cope with many challenges such as climate change and we have yet to develop a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of these systems and their feedback mechanisms ringler et al 2013 walker et al 2014 estimated resource fluxes nutrients water and energy entering leaving and circulating within an urban watershed system as well as the economic benefits of managing the f e w system zhao et al 2018 used a long term hydrologic impact analysis model to simulate the relationship between agricultural development and water and energy use in xining city qinghai province currently and into the future and concluded that pressure on the development of f e w system would continue to increase as time goes on chen et al 2018 studied the effects of input capacity constraints on food quality and the design of regulation mechanisms for food safety management and concluded that incentives would be more effective than sanctions for improving food quality the landscape pattern of a water system refers to the spatial arrangement and combination of various types of natural and artificial water bodies including their type quantity and spatial distribution fu 2003 in the early 1950s descriptive research on landscape patterns was carried out by forman forman and godron 1986 and quantitative research in the field began in earnest in the 1970s turner and gardner 1991 at present studies on water system landscape patterns mainly include the influence of urbanization on wetland landscape patterns the relationship between water quality and changes in landscape patterns and the influences of climate change changes in water landscape patterns will influence the evolution of wetland landscapes and wetland ecosystem structures and their functions therefore studying the dynamic changes in wetland landscape patterns can explain the changes to wetland landscapes over time in terms of components and functions bai et al 2005 2008 as well as provide theoretical support for wetland resources utilization conservation and management using support erdas image arcgis and fragstats software he et al 2011 analyzed the distribution and temporal spatial changes in the wetlands of zhengzhou city in 2002 and 2009 the results showed that the area of the yellow river as well as that of local ponds had decreased because of the drop in upstream inflow and that urbanization had a significant impact on the changes of landscape patterns in yellow river wetlands xia et al 2012 analyzed landscape patterns and river water quality in baiyangdian by using gis tools and the landscape pattern index method the results showed that urban construction and farming are the main causes of water pollution in that region based on remote sensing and field measurement data in 1900 and 2006 zhou et al 2012 found that the water quality in the upstream midstream and downstream reaches of the dong river had clearly deteriorated over the past few decades and was continuing to do so ever more rapidly land use patterns and land cover types have significant effects on the flow and water quality of the dong river at multiple spatial scales some scholars have found that river landscape patterns have been strongly influenced by urbanization and that 60 of the world s rivers have significantly changed nicola 2003 aear and mewson 2003 a study in shanghai yang et al 2004 also showed that the urbanization process had influenced the water system structure tending to simplify the river system using the shenzhen drainage maps in 1982 and 2002 huang et al 2008 quantitatively analyzed the influence of urbanization on water system structure concluding that the river s total length density and number of channels through shenzhen had decreased and that the decrease rate was even higher in low level tributaries these previous studies of the urban water system pattern all focused on the changes in the river system structure however there have been few researches about total urban water system patterns such as a comprehensive analysis including ponds lakes ditches and other kinds of water bodies and how the water system pattern affects the f e w resource furthermore most major research was performed on cities with humid climates and abundant water resources few studies have focused on the mega cities located in arid and semi arid regions where the landscape patterns probably change more significantly and suffer more severe f e w resource problems the landscape index landscape metrics is the main tool of landscape pattern analysis fu et al 2011 its data mainly come from maps based on remote sensing rs geographic information system gis and global positioning system gps technologies deng 2010 however the landscape index is actually sensitive to the classification system or index of the data source e g remote sensing image versus land use map as well as to the observation or sample scales li et al 2004 whereas it is not sensitive to the functional characteristic of landscapes wiens 1989 as an important source of original data in landscape pattern analysis rs technology has certain limitations when used in the analysis of water system landscape patterns first while remote sensing data is quite useful in revealing land cover conditions it is unable to reflect the specific uses of a water system by the resident population for example rs technology cannot determine whether a pond is used for flood retention recreation or fishing second the commonly used spatial resolution of remote sensing data is 30m 30 m landsat tm and while this is useful for analyzing regional land cover over a large area its accuracy is insufficient for large scale analysis based on large scale thematic maps and artificial statistic of land use however the function of a water system can be determined making up for the defects of remote sensing data nevertheless this kind of data also has limitations for example it cannot distinguish whether the river and lakes are stable or are drying up and therefore it is unable to reflect the real ecological functions of a water body thus in order to guarantee the reliability of landscape pattern analysis it is necessary not only to perform a deep analysis of the regional geographical elements and aquatic ecosystem types but also to use data of different origins such as land use statistic data thematic maps and remote sensing images to complement the analysis to solve these problems taking beijing city as an example this study analyzes the spatial patterns and changing rules of different types of water system elements including rivers channels reservoirs lakes ponds and reed patches tidal flats both inside and surrounding the city with the application of rs and gis techniques the water system data of beijing metropolitan area were extracted from the land use statistic data at various different times and were then revised according to remote sensing images and thematic maps in this way the errors and missing information of the existing land use data were corrected and supplemented using the landscape pattern index analysis method the analysis results based on the original and corrected data were compared and evaluated using this method the characteristics of dynamic changes driving factors and potential impacts on the ecosystem services of the f e w system in beijing during the rapid urbanization process were analyzed quantitatively and an implementation strategy for repairing the f e w nexus and environmental problems is proposed thus providing scientific evidence for the informed management of f e w resources of mega cities 2 research model methods and data sources 2 1 research area and model as the capital of china beijing is representative of the mega cities of developing countries and even of the whole world beijing is located in northwestern portion of the north china plain 39 26 41 03 n 115 25 117 30 e with a total area of 16 410 km2 beijing has a semi arid and semi humid warm temperate continental monsoon climate the rainfall averages about 600 mm a year beijing water affairs bureau 1980 2017 but rainfall distribution is very unevenly distributed among the seasons the average annual precipitation is 9 237 billion m3 in beijing surface runoff takes up 1 203 billion m3 groundwater resources take up 1 774 billion m3 and the total locally produced water resource is around 2 977 billion m3 per year there are five drainage systems within beijing the average amount of water inflow is 0 503 billion m3 the exit flow 1 726 billion m3 beijing water affairs bureau 1980 2017 beijing is a city with a serious water scarcity while the water resource occupied per capita is 137 m3 first we established a model based on the food energy water resource and the urbanization process and used this model as a research framework in the process of rapid urban expansion the urban development process is constrained by both natural resources and urban policies this tripartite resource f e w has collectively changed the land use type of the city among the three components we chose the water system land use type as the core and the evolution of the water system was examined taking into account the changes in land use type especially the increased amount of urban construction land decreasing farmland we determined that there have been direct environmental consequences such as increasing urban runoff decreasing surface water resources decreasing underground water and reduction in food production at the same time these environmental impacts undermine the stability of urban ecosystems and enlarge the ecological footprint we conducted quantitative research to analyze the impact of these changes in the water system on food energy and the environment and posing strategies to solve the environment problems fig 1 2 2 land use data sources the major data in this study included the land use statistic data of beijing for 1993 2001 and 2007 and the landsat tm remote sensing images of beijing for 1993 2001 and 2007 30 m resolution ratio based on the existing water system landscape structure and the landscape research method rs and existing data were used to obtain information about the surface water system landscape in the vast majority of research and gis was employed to quantitatively and spatially analyze the water system information in order to understand the transformation of urban land types based on the current land use structure of 2007 after reclassifying and correcting the land use data of beijing we imported it into arcgis first constructing the spatial data topology and then establishing the attributes corresponding to each type of spatial data from this we then made our statistical calculations and developed the attribute table finally we built a classification of land use types in beijing table 1 2 3 water system classifications and data adjustments in this study based on the actual conditions of the water system of beijing the water area in the land use classification was subdivided into river ditch reservoir lake pond and reed patch intertidal zone table 2 and among these the river ditch was the only linear water element identifying the significant ecological corridors within beijing while reservoir lake pond and reed patch intertidal zone represented non linear water bodies with different functions and areas as significant patches in the water landscape analysis in the early land use surveys some linear land cover and land use factors were not regarded as key content in the survey as a result in the land use data of 1993 the linear water bodies such as rivers and ditches were cursory resulting in land use data that did not accurately reflect the real conditions of the water system the data were therefore interpolated in order to include linear water bodies as a type of land use in this research the specific modification was that the linear water area was determined through a combined manual computerized interpretation using the arcgis platform according to the water related thematic map and remote sensing image from the 1990s fig 2 wang 2010 in addition owing to a decrease in the precipitation recharge and damming by the upper reservoir as well as groundwater recession most rivers and streams in the plain area contained no water and some reservoirs lakes rivers and ponds were severely short of water directly restricting the implementation of the water ecosystem function although these water bodies were regarded as rivers ditches lakes reservoirs or ponds in the land use statistic they might be short of water all year round no longer providing the necessary ecosystem service functions therefore it was necessary to measure and calculate the real water surface to obtain data reflecting the actual condition of the land cover therefore in order to obtain useful remote sensing images for 1993 2001 and 2007 july and august data were selected the water surface was then extracted according to the remote sensing interpretation described above on that basis the actual area of water surface and the landscape pattern indexes of the wet season in beijing were analyzed and calculated thus reflecting the real conditions of the water landscape patterns and aquatic ecosystem services 2 4 landscape pattern analysis the landscape pattern index represents the spatial characteristics of a landscape and it can reflect these characteristics from the landscape element level up to the level of the entire landscape in this study based on previous literature chen et al 2002 the representative landscape pattern indexes were selected including the np number of patches pd patch density lpi largest patch index enn mn euclidean nearest neighbor distance cohesion and division np represents the number of patches pd represents the patch density lpi represents the largest patch index it can reflect the percentage of the largest patch in the total landscape area enn mn represents the euclidean nearest neighbor distance it is widely used to quantify the degree of patch dispersion the minimum proximity distance referred is the shortest straight line distance between a particular patch and its nearest peer in euclidean geometry cohesion represents the patch cohesion index cohesion is used to measure the physical connectivity of the corresponding patch type division represents the landscape division index the degree of division is based on the accumulation of the patch distribution area and it represents the probability that two randomly selected pixels are not located in the same patch in the corresponding patch type here with the three sets of land use data of beijing 1993 2001 and 2007 and remote sensing images the water system was classified and calculated on the arcgis platform and the landscape pattern indexes of the water system were computed with fragstats 3 3 thus allowing the temporal spatial changes of the water system in beijing during the rapid urbanization process to be analyzed 2 5 direct environmental consequences and analysis the soil conversation service curve number scs cn model is a mathematical model developed by the u s department of agriculture s soil and water conservation bureau in the 1950s to estimate surface runoff it can estimate the direct runoff from a certain rainfall on a catchment the scs cn model was used to calculate the total runoff through the number of runoff curves cn where the value of cn depends on factors such as antecedent moisture condition soil type land cover slope and so on since the establishment of the scs cn model it has become a widely used method for estimating runoff throughout the world wang et al 2015 at present researches on scs cn model mainly focus on the accurate value of cn scs cn model is used to calculate the runoff amount to forecast the disaster or to recover the rainwater zhao 2012 in this study the scs cn model was used to calculate and simulate the runoff under different land cover conditions to study the impact of land cover type changes on urban runoff specific governing equations can be found as the following the calculation formula of cn value is shown in eq 1 1 c n c c n p

assess the local supply rate of food and water we also established food and water supply rates to measure food and water security data sources such as surface water groundwater and related water resources are collected in the beijing water resources bulletin from the beijing water authority beijing water affairs bureau 1980 2017 the data related to rice and energy were collected from a series of continuous statistical yearbooks of beijing beijing municipal bureau of statistics 1992 2007 3 results of water system and land use changes 3 1 area changes of the water system in beijing in recent years there have been dramatic changes in the patterns processes and functions of the water ecosystem in beijing resulting in a series of severe ecological problems such as shrinking wetlands a gradual decrease in the underground water level fragmentation in the water system landscape pattern frequent occurrence of urban drainage floods loss of rain water resources a decrease in biological diversity and deterioration of the quality of the water environment of these shrinking wetlands are one of the most significant and direct reasons for the decreasing quality of the water ecosystem service according to a study conducted by li et al since 1996 the wetland area of beijing decreased year by year showing an obvious degradation trend specifically the wetland area of beijing was 605 67 km2 in 1996 but only 466 77 km2 in 1998 since then the wetland resource in beijing has been continuing to degrade until in 2006 it was only 270 38 km2 having decreased 42 1 from its 1998 level and 55 4 from its 1996 level li et al 2008 it is can be easily seen that the water area in beijing fell by 5 08 from 1993 to 2007 table 3 among the different water types the area of ponds decreased the most by 15 89 at the same time the area of reservoirs and lakes also dropped by 7 16 putting them in second place the areas of rivers and ditches first increased and then decreased while the areas of reed patches and intertidal zones decreased and then increased fig 3 wang 2010 looking at the change ranges for the different types of water bodies it can be seen that the extent of change of the linear elements was less than that of the non linear elements the smaller sized water patches such as ponds decreased faster than the larger sized ones such as reservoirs and lakes from the temporal perspective the rate of change from 2001 to 2007 was greater than that from 1993 to 2001 for the water system as a whole 3 2 actual water quantity changes in beijing it can be seen from the statistical data for 2007 table 4 that among the various water areas in beijing that of reservoir lake was the greatest mainly because there are many large and medium sized reservoirs in beijing such as the miyun reservoir the guanting reservoir and so forth the ponds mainly distributed in the environs of beijing city make up the second largest proportion the river ditch and reed patch mud flat types are characterized with typical ecological functions but make up the smallest proportion of the water system as for the variations in area from 1993 to 2007 the total area of the water system in beijing declined from 63 494 ha to 43 652 ha about a 31 25 decrease in fact the areas of all the types of water landscape decreased dramatically with the area of the river ditch type decreasing the most about 34 30 while the areas of reservoir lake and pond decreased by 31 68 and 31 85 respectively and the area of reed patch mud flat showed a small decrease about 21 62 generally the change rate of the linear water area was greater than that of the non linear water area as for the reduction in the area of the water system the decreasing speed from 2001 to 2007 19 12 was greater than that from 1993 to 2001 15 the reductions in river ditch and reservoir lake types by contrast were greater from 1993 to 2001 than from 2001 to 2007 opposite to the trends for the pond and the reed patch mud flat fig 4 wang 2010 as for land area covered the total water system areas obtained from original land use data for 1993 2001 2007 were 78 019 ha 78 099 ha and 74 055 ha respectively which are all larger than the actual water surface area based on our revised data 63 494 ha 53 972 ha and 43 652 ha respectively in terms of change magnitude the actual surface water area decreased by 31 25 while the reported reduction in the water system area was only 5 08 this result shows that the change of actual surface area was more significant than the structural changes of the water system in beijing for example the total length of the rivers and ditches actually experienced a slight growth but the actual water area of the river and ditches decreased 34 30 in the same period as can be seen from the above analysis there is a big difference in the landscape pattern analysis results between using land use data and using corrected data in this study although the major structures and forms of the lakes reservoirs rivers and ditches still exist the aquatic ecosystem services cannot be fully provided due to the scarcity of water resources in the beijing metropolitan area the results suggest that water system data need to be carefully checked and even revised for any similar analysis in the future allowing a more objective evaluation of urban water system change and landscape ecological functions to be obtained 3 3 temporal spatial changes of the landscape pattern of water system in beijing looking at the changes in the landscape pattern indexes of the water system in beijing table 5 the np indexes of the water system decreased the pd indexes of the water system increased the average patch area decreased the distances between patches increased the form of the patches tended to become more regular the cohesion decreased and the division increased all the changes in these indexes showed that the landscape pattern of the water system tended to become more fragmented and the small patches decreased more significantly it can be seen from the variation speed of the landscape indexes that this speed generally decreased and that the variation ranges from 1993 to 2001 was greater than that from 2001 to 2007 among the indexes the pd and lpi had the greatest variation range suggesting that the number and density of water patches changed dramatically the area of single water bodies decreased and the density increased the indexes of the overall landscape pattern had a smaller variation range showing that there was no evident change in the landscape pattern of the regional water system 3 4 changes of land use in order to understand the changes of the water system by land use type construction land and farmland we obtained the change of land use type table 6 and the land use type of the beijing transfer probability matrix table 7 by combining gis and land use data fig 5 wang 2010 from the perspective of beijing s land types the land areas used for the water system and for farmland have been greatly reduced while construction land has increased significantly table 6 the decrease in water system land is mainly attributable to the increase in construction land accounting for 13 89 but this has been partly offset by increases to the water area from arable land and other land accounting for 6 69 table 7 the continuous transformation of farmland to other types of land is the main source of new land types such as garden land woodland and construction land 22 40 of the decrease has gone to construction land increases in farmland meanwhile have come mainly from garden plots water areas and other land farmland has been more susceptible to change when it is located near human activity centers the number location and functions of which are shifting with urbanization the increase in construction land has come mainly from farmland and garden land accounting for 22 40 and 15 74 respectively construction land is highly irreversible and about 83 of it has not been transformed among other non construction land garden plots have been transformed mainly to forest land and construction land while their increase has come mainly from farmland due to the expansion of beijing total area and statistical errors the total area will have a little of errors 4 results of land use pattern changes on water food and energy 4 1 increasing surface runoff and urban flooding disasters in this study the soil conversation service curve number scs cn model was used to calculate and simulate the runoff under different land covers so as to study the impact of the change of land cover type on urban runoff specific governing equations can be found in the section 2 5 and the cn value was listed in the table 8 in order to understand the impacts of the changes of land type on runoff in beijing we selected the suburban areas with large changes in land type as the study area and calculated the changes in runoff the inner suburbs of beijing include the chaoyang district the haidian district the fengtai district and the shijingshan district with a total area of 1275 93 km2 accounting for 7 76 of the city this area undertakes beijing area urban expansion development dredge function at present the type of land is mainly urban construction land and the level of urbanization is relatively high according to the calculation results table 9 the runoff in 2001 had increased compared with 1993 by 1 28 in 2007 it was significantly increased compared with 2001 with an increase of 4 21 in other words with these changes in urban development and land type the urban rainwater runoff trend increased faster and more significantly in reality the frequency of flooding disasters in beijing suburbs is also increasing since 1960 the frequency has increased significantly every ten years between 1960 and 2016 there were 21 flooding disasters and the frequency of occurrence increased year by year fig 6 taking beijing s july 21 2012 rainstorm disaster as an example 77 people were killed and the economic loss was 120 million yuan when urban drainage land decreases and construction land increases the impermeability of the construction land will lead to an increase in urban runoff at the same time as the area of the water system decreases rainfall cannot be absorbed into nearby drainage systems such as pits and ponds causing the accumulation of runoff to increase and elevating the occurrence of urban flooding disaster increasing energy to solve the urban flooding disaster partial data source ye et al 2018 4 2 decreasing surface water resources and surface water supply through analysis of the supply of water resources in beijing it was found that the supply of water from local sources in beijing has been declining year by year increasing the reliance on external water transfers such as from the south to north water diversion project the supply of water from local sources in beijing declined from 100 to 78 4 between 2001 to 2016 while the supply of local surface water decreased from 30 05 to 5 36 over the same period from 1 17 billion m3 in 2001 to 208 million m3 in 2016 despite the impact of inbound immigration flow and reservoir impoundment the amount of surface water resources has increased but the available surface water is still declining making beijing rely more on external water transfers such as from the south to north water transfer fig 7 at the same time competition for industrial agricultural and urban domestic water will be intensified leading to increased energy consumption to meet the demand for water 4 3 decreasing groundwater resources and related analysis according to analysis the underground water level decreased by 14 241 m from 1994 to 2016 from 1994 to 2006 the decrease was dramatic with an average annual decrease of 0 878 m the decline was slower from 2006 to 2016 dropping an average of 0 371 m per year at the same time the storage of groundwater declined by 9 21 billion m3 in 2016 compared with 1980 fig 8 the storage of groundwater is closely related to the groundwater level when the local water level rises even slightly the groundwater reserves will increase accordingly at this stage the water level in individual years has rebounded slightly the impervious surfaces in urban construction land affects the rainfall infiltration thus influencing the groundwater level in order to analyze the relationship between the urban construction land and the underground water level we set up a multiple regression model based on rainfall amounts construction land types and the amount of groundwater mining so as to analyze how these relationships affected the underground water level we selected data from 2001 to 2015 including rainfall x1 the area of urban construction land x2 groundwater exploitation x3 and groundwater level y and established the multiple regression analysis the following model was obtained 5 y 15 82 1 596 x1 0 583 x2 0 556 x3 however since p x1 0 548 p x2 0 0088 and p x3 0 0006 it can be seen that the significance of x1 is not obvious when compared with the x2 of urban construction land or the x3 of underground water extraction however the urban land area x2 and the groundwater exploitation amount x3 can affect the groundwater level in more obvious ways therefore multiple regression models of urban construction land x2 groundwater exploitation quantity x3 and groundwater level y were established again as follows 6 y 17 01 0 529 x2 0 567x3 the adjusted r2 of the model 0 958 r 0 982 and r2 0 965 the correlation degree between x2 and x3 was 0 982 the fitting effect and interpretation degree were 0 982 and the simulation effect was relatively good this result shows that the groundwater level was affected by the urban construction land and the groundwater exploitation quantity and the groundwater exploitation quantity had a slightly higher influence on the groundwater level than did the urban construction land the model of groundwater resources and groundwater table presented a negative correlation because with declining water levels groundwater reserves decreased since the adjusted groundwater water policy in beijing was adopted the production of groundwater has been reduced and other sources of water were used to relieve the tension of water problems such as the south north water diversion groundwater exploitation is closely related to groundwater level although we continue to limit the exploitation of underground water the continued expansion of urban construction land area prevents the groundwater from being replenished in time and the groundwater level is consequently also on a downward trend clearly it is not enough just to reduce the amount of exploitation to control the decline of groundwater it is equally important to promote the reclamation of groundwater and reduce the area of impervious land 4 4 reduction in food production and self sufficiency rate and increasing energy consumption it can be seen from the above analysis that since the 1990s the water system area has been severely reduced in beijing the landscape pattern is tending toward fragmentation and this trend is becoming even more severe the shrinking of surface water area and the declining connectivity of the water landscape were already the significant factors restricting the hydrological regulating function in beijing posing severe threats to the overall quality of ecological conditions in beijing the output of rice dropped from 296 930 tons in 1980 to 1391 5 tons in 2015 down by 99 53 the area dedicated to paddy fields fell from 50 800 ha in 1980 to 1970 51 ha in 2015 down by 96 12 the planting area of rice decreased from 52 200 ha in 1980 to 199 6 ha in 2015 a decrease of 99 62 fig 9 with the rapid reduction and destruction of the water system in beijing the surface water and groundwater resources are decreasing and rice production in beijing is on the verge of collapse in the u s the total energy used for producing food is categorized into four main groups 21 for crop cultivation 14 for transportation 11 16 for food processing and around 50 for food handling e g food packaging service and sales lillie 2015 we know that when food is not supplied locally more energy is needed to transport and reprocess the food from other places otherwise new ways must be explored of using the water resources to adapt to these changes meanwhile more energy is used to cultivate crops that can adapt to changes in the water system pattern and this will translate to increase per capita energy consumption fig 10 data source lillie 2015 urban food self sufficiency is one of the important indicators for assessing local food security based on the per capita food demand index of the balanced dietary model of chinese residents each person needs 118 63 kg of grain per year and the required rice accounts for 55 4 of this amount tang et al 2012 therefore we estimated the total annual demand for rice based on the population and then calculated the self sufficiency rate for local rice the rice yield in beijing the total demand for rice per year the self sufficiency rate of local rice it can be seen from fig 11 that the self sufficiency rate of rice in beijing in 1993 was 26 95 by 2016 it had dropped to 0 08 a decrease of 99 7 the decline in urban self sufficiency rate directly affects food security in beijing at the same time in terms of ecosystem stability it also illustrates the rapid decline of urban ecosystem supply services in beijing which affects the stability of urban ecosystems 5 conclusion through this study we found that in arid and semi arid area water plays a significantly important and core role in f e w system taking beijing as an example during the process of rapid urbanization the total area of water system is being rapidly reduced due to its complex reasons and its patter becomes more regular and fragmented which also trigger a series of environmental problems such as pressure on surface water resources increase in surface runoff and more frequent urban flooding disasters decrease in underground water level the decline of the water system like ponds and reed patches which have the high ecological value has pushed rice production to the verge of collapse these environmental problems have profoundly affected food and water security as well as urban environmental safety yet in order to solve these environmental and food challenges it is necessary to consume more energy aimed at the outstanding problems in beijing including the water resource shortages and the fragmentation of the water system pattern the f e w ecosystem was assessed and restoration strategies were proposed establishing a water ecological security pattern to protect the water system space using the f e w nexus model analysis to enhance the ecological stability recovering the natural hydrological cycle by combined with sponge city construction yu et al 2015 1 in the process of rapid urbanization we should pay attention to protecting aquatic ecosystems and establishing water ecological security patterns using f e w nexus model analysis in the process of rapid urbanization water ecosystems should be protected and the relationship between water ecosystems and food and energy should be emphasized a water ecological security pattern should be established yu et al 2011 the encroachment of urban development areas on water ecosystems should be limited and protections for the water ecological security pattern should be implemented to avoid even more problems caused by the deterioration of the water environment at the same time an evaluation model of f e w should be established to find the optimal solution to lowering the impact of urbanization on the environment including the f e w system 2 restoration of the water ecosystems should be combined with sponge city construction and food harvest which can help

for elucidating the causes and effects of fire due to the difficulties of experimentation and the societal need for information about risks and management options there are a broad range of stand

the wildland urban interface fire dynamics simulator mell et al 2007 or the coupled atmospheric weather fire experiment coen et al 2013 these approaches to modeling ignition and fire spread are

alter vegetation and succession including insect outbreaks and climatic effects on regeneration and growth furthermore landscape simulation models can represent direct human modifications to the fire

detections giglio et al 2003 have been demonstrated to track the progression of large wildfires veraverbeke et al 2014 and used to update fire spread simulations pinto et al 2016 coen et al 2018

fire suppression in addition scrpple captures the effects of topography fuels and climate we emphasized parameterization using landscape scale datasets that have recently become more widely available see table 1 finally the approach allows for targeted emphasis on different processes if suppression is not practiced on the landscape it can be readily disabled the fire model described could be operated without any information except the relationship between ignitions spread and fire weather index fwi van wagner 1987 scrpple was initially developed for the lake tahoe basin ltb in california and nevada fig 1 even though our model was initially parameterized for ltb and the initial suite of assumptions reflect the fire dynamics of this area our approach and these assumptions are broadly applicable to landscapes worldwide where fire is driven by both social and physical processes both anthropogenic and non human factors drive fire regimes in the ltb because of the value and density of people and structures fuel treatments i e vegetation management that reduces surface and mid story ladder fuels and prescribed fire are both actively deployed accidental ignitions predominate the arrangement and amount of fuels are a primary concern due to historical patterns of land use e g a relatively young and even aged forest age structure determined by historical logging events loudermilk et al 2013 and future fire regimes are likely to be substantially shaped by climate change yang et al 2015 in this paper we present the scrpple modeling approach and demonstrate model behavior using four scenarios for ltb that explicitly integrate multiple types of human actions and show the utility of our approach for assessing the trade offs among approaches for reducing fire on the landscape 2 methods the initial implementation of scrpple is within the landis ii landscape change framework landis ii represents vegetation succession scheller et al 2007 forest harvest and fuel treatments syphard et al 2011 and insect mortality sturtevant et al 2004 details about landis ii implementation computational requirements operating systems and open source code can be found at www landis ii org landis ii has two existing fire extensions the base fire extension which does not include climatic effects he and mladenoff 1999 and the dynamic fire extension which does not explicitly include anthropogenic processes sturtevant et al 2009 here we focus on the details of the new scrpple fire extension which consists of four primary algorithms ignition including human ignitions spread including the effects of suppression and fuel treatments fire intensity and fire mortality these algorithms simulate three separate types of fires lightning human unintentional accidental and prescribed fire rxfire allowing each fire type to have its own ignition and suppression and intensity patterns the extension assumes that if suppression is constant lightning and accidental fires will behave similarly in regard to spread and mortality under the same weather and wind speeds prescribed fires may be limited by fwi and wind speed all model code is available at https github com landis ii foundation extension scrpple details about input formats keywords etc are provided in the associated user guide http www landis ii org extensions scrapple 2 1 ignition our ignitions follow a supply and allocation model whereby the supply of ignitions is generated from a zero inflated poisson model and then ignitions are allocated across the landscape with an ignition surface for accidental and lightning fires the number of ignitions per day was determined by relating the number of ignitions by each of three the fire types accidental lightning prescribed to fire weather index fwi the canadian fire prediction system 1992 is used to calculate fwi as a smoothed average that integrates long and short term variation in precipitation and temperature fwi is calculated for each day of the year and the appropriate number of ignitions are generated for each day the following equation was fit to ignition and fwi data table 1 1 number of fires eβ0 β1 fwi this assumes a zero inflated poisson distribution zuur et al 2009 and uses a log link function requiring a fit of β0 and β1 that vary by ignition type and the estimated non zero portion of the ignition response for fractional ignitions e g number of ignitions 1 6 rounding determines the number of ignitions e g number of ignitions 2 prescribed fires rxfire are routinely deployed to reduce fine fuels agee and skinner 2005 and there are calls to substantially increase their use e g state of california executive order b 52 18 for rxfire a set number of fires are generated per year based on expert input and or scenario design rxfires are attempted sequentially by day of year until the expected number of fires is successfully ignited prescribed fire is often used under weather conditions different from wildfires therefore our model allows conditions to be placed on rxfire ignitions including a minimum fwi necessary to maintain fire spread below a maximum fwi conditions under which prescribed fire would be avoided and a maximum wind speed again conditions under which prescribed fire would be avoided a continuous weighted surface of historical ignitions for the entire landscape is required for each of the three ignition types and used to allocate ignitions for regions where the spatial pattern of ignitions is weak or unknown this surface can be a constant value or a smoothed average of ignition rates for other regions the spatial pattern of ignitions could be projected based on climate change estimates e g yang et al 2015 all available sites are then shuffled using an algorithm that biases selection by the ignition probability maps the list of ignitions sites is re shuffled at the beginning of each year in combination the three ignition sources generate the total number of fires per year per fire type and are dependent upon fwi 2 2 fire spread growth from the point of ignition fire can spread to each adjacent cell i e four nearest neighbors dependent upon a probability of spread pspread fire spread is from cell to cell and determines fire size a fire will continue burning until no more cells are selected for spread probability of fire spread is estimated using a general equation relating event probability to fwi beverly and wotton 2007 that creates a 0 1 probability function which is then applied at a daily time step to determine the success of cell to cell fire transmission 2 probability of fire spread pspread 1 1 eβ0 where β0 is the probability of spread into a site given conditions on that site 3 β0 β0 β1 fwi β2 effectivewindspeed β3 finefuels where effectivewindspeed is an adjusted wind speed whereby reported wind speed and direction for the region from meteorological stations is downscaled to individual sites by accounting for slope angle and the slope azimuth relative to the wind direction nelson 2002 effectivewindspeed also incorporates the intensity of the neighboring cell from which the fire is spreading see intensity calculations below a high intensity fire burning upslope generates a greater effectivewindspeed than a moderate or light fire this in turn feeds back into the estimate of fire intensity see below creating self sustaining high intensity fires under certain conditions during model execution fire fuels are estimated from endogenous internal to the model framework litter estimates during model execution fine fuels are spatially and temporally variable and reflect reductions from fuel treatments and fires and additions from overstory mortality e g from insect outbreaks e g sturtevant et al 2009 as calculated within an appropriate landis ii succession extension a fire will spread until it has reached a maximum area for the day or no cell to cell spread is predicted to occur due to fuel limitations or suppression activities below maximum area was determined empirically 4 maximum daily spread area β0 β1 fwi β2 effectivewindspeed maximum daily spread is an overall limit to daily area burned and therefore calculated separately from cell to cell fire spread maximum area spread parameters were derived using a fitted generalized linear model glm in the r statistical software both cell to cell spread and maximum daily fire spread are updated with daily fwi estimates until the fire can no longer spread e g disconnected fuels low fwi or suppression is applied 2 3 suppression suppression is simulated as the capacity to reduce the probability of fire spread and is unique for each fire type our suppression algorithm was designed in collaboration with fire managers and approximates the decisions made when deciding whether to suppress and the overall suppression effort suppression was implemented as four zones per fire type none minimal moderate maximal suppression each zone is assigned an integer reflecting suppression effectiveness that reduces pspread as a fraction suppression effectiveness 100 zones are input as unique maps for each fire type the unique maps allow for different kinds of suppression dependent upon circumstances for example lightning generated fires may be allowed to spread in remote areas of a landscape accidental fires may be heavily suppressed in all areas prescribed fires are typically suppressed in all areas except where the fires are intentionally introduced although they can escape these zones should be based on current or anticipated management efforts suppression effectiveness can vary as a function of fwi more resources for suppression are typically allocated during extreme fire weather higher fwi two fwi breakpoints determine when suppression efforts effectiveness increase in addition a maximum daily wind speed limits suppression to days when resources can be safely deployed if daily wind speed exceeds the maximum limit suppression does not occur 2 4 fire intensity we developed three classes of fire intensity low 1 2 m 4 feet flame lengths moderate 1 2 2 4 m 4 8 feet and high 2 4 m 8 feet these intensity classes correspond to metrics of intensity commonly used by fire managers corresponding mortality classes were also defined see below unlike fire ignition and spread empirical data of fire intensity are not available at the regional scale differenced normalized burn ratio dnbr is a metric of severity and does not readily translate into a metric of intensity therefore we used a multi condition risk approach to determine whether a site burned at low moderate or high intensity we defined three risk conditions based on fine and ladder fuels schoennagel et al 2004 and fire spread agee et al 2000 1 does the mass g m 2 of fine fuels exceed a calibrated threshold 2 does the mass g m 2 of ladder fuels exceed a calibrated threshold ladder fuels are assigned via a list of species with maximum ages that can be regarded as ladder fuels for example abies concolor aged 0 25 might be regarded as ladder fuels 3 is the fire intensity of the source site the neighboring site from where a fire spread high intensity a high intensity fire will promote higher intensity fire as it spreads the default is low intensity if one of these three conditions is true the intensity become moderate if two or more conditions are true the fire is high intensity 2 5 fire mortality fire mortality varies depending on fire intensity and the tree species and ages present a low intensity fire for example may cause extensive mortality if the forest is dominated by fire intolerant tree species for each fire intensity class a fire mortality table is defined that includes the age ranges and associated probability of mortality for each tree species a single random number is generated a global function within the landis ii framework for each burned site ensuring a consistent effect on all trees if pmortality from the corresponding fire mortality table exceeds the random number the species age cohort is killed 100 mortality 3 model parameterization and application 3 1 study area we parameterized and applied our fire model to the lake tahoe basin ltb fig 1 ltb is a dry conifer forest on the east side of the sierra nevada with a high average snowpack 50 150 cm and dry summers although ltb is now largely a recreational destination it was heavily logged at the end of the 19th century and the forests today reflect recovery from these past land uses loudermilk et al 2013 historically fires were frequent occurring every 3 20 years nagel and taylor 2005 but have been actively suppressed since the early 20th century in addition fire ignitions have substantially shifted in frequency and location with about 80 of fires started accidentally by humans and typically near the lake shore whereas most lightning fires occur on ridgetops short 2013 prescribed fire has historically been limited in scale and located only within the wildland urban interface loudermilk et al 2013 although recent efforts intend to expand prescribed fire to the broader watershed climate change is expected to increase annual temperatures increase fire season duration and increase the probability of extended droughts loudermilk et al 2013 and ignition locations yang et al 2015 3 2 model parameterization in order to parameterize ignitions historical fire data from 1992 to 2013 for the ltb short 2013 were used to estimate the relationship between daily number of ignitions and fwi we included only fires that spread to 1 ha ignitions within the historical data set were separated by ignition type into lightning coded as lightning within the short data and human accidental many codes including campfire arson and child were combined daily historical fwi was calculated from daily temperature and precipitation data prism as implemented within the climate library of landis ii lucash et al 2017 which produced daily fwi values for our period of record a zero inflated poisson distribution of fire ignitions was then fitted using the zeroinfl function within the pscl package in r producing estimates for β0 and β1 in eq 1 this was done for both lightning ignitions and human accidental ignitions the analysis was conducted using the likelihood package in r r core team 2014 we verified ignition behavior by testing eq 1 using random fwi values produced by a random number generator within r to validate fire ignitions we ran simulations to assess whether fire ignition parameters recreated the appropriate number of fires given a particular fwi value we also validated each ignition type such that the spatial patterns of fire ignitions provided by the input maps generally match the spatial patterns of fire ignitions by type the short 2013 data were also used to define an ignition surface for each fire type the cumulative number of ignitions by fire type by cell were used as inputs the model subsequently translates these data into weights whereby cells with higher weights are preferentially selected for ignitions to parameterize spread within the ltb we used the sierra nevada boundary defined by the sierra nevada conservancy see fig 1 we chose this area as being broadly representative of the conditions found in the ltb and containing more fires than the ltb alone providing a larger sample size for model fitting fire perimeters were polyline layers and each of the fire spread variables were raster datasets table 1 unsuccessful and successful spread cells were then identified and tracked throughout the period of record unsuccessful cells were defined as those that fell on a fire perimeter that did not burn on the following day to estimate the fire spread parameters spatial data are needed for daily fwi daily wind speed daily wind direction and fine fuel loading table 1 for a set of reference fires daily fire perimeters are then overlain on each of the datasets to extract successful and unsuccessful spread areas and assigned to a given day of the fire both year and day of year maximum spread area was drawn from the geomac fire perimeter data table 1 and was defined as the day to day increase in area of fire perimeters suppression zones intensity and the fwi breakpoints were determined via consultation with cooperating fire managers similarly the probability of mortality given the above intensity calculation estimates were collected using expert opinion whereby available fire experts for the ltb provided independent estimates of mortality provided via on line survey for varying species and age combinations these data were collected independently and collated and areas of disagreement indicated by a range among experts 0 35 discussed and refined our model design utilizes current estimates of fine fuels coarse fuels and ladder fuels the landis ii framework provides projections of fuel loads in response to vegetation growth mortality and disturbances eliminating the need to categorize sites into fuel classes which by design simplifies and averages landscape variation in fuels for example utilizing continuous fuel information will allow differentiation based on intensity and time since insect defoliation or mortality rather than a single fuel type for post insect outbreaks 3 3 model calibration and validation prior to applying the model to forecasting unique scenarios we calibrated and validated the model against historical fire regimes we assessed model accuracy by comparing model outputs against historical fire data from the ltb including fire rotation period years the distribution of fire sizes and estimates of intensity our calibration assumed that suppression in the sierra nevada broadly represented fire suppression in ltb therefore fire suppression efforts were parameterized via inputs from local fire managers to calibrate the relative total area of our three fire intensity classes we compared simulated burned area for each intensity class against empirical estimates of ratio of area burned in three similar severity classes although intensity and severity are not equivalent empirical intensity data are not available and so we used severity as the best available proxy historical fire severity data were drawn from the same broad sierra nevada geography as spread parameters avoiding potential sampling bias towards small high intensity fires which are most prominent in the basin table 1 3 4 model application we demonstrated the behavior and utility of our model via four simple scenarios that emphasize the effects of human activities on fire regimes the scenarios were run on the lake tahoe basin ltb landscape we simulated a randomized historical climate 1992 2011 whereby historical climate was randomly arranged with replacement on an annual basis although note that this approach does not capture longer term climatic trends e g kitzberger et al 2007 each scenario was simulated for 100 years the duration of available downscaled climate projections at a 1 ha resolution with four replicates per scenario the number of replicates reflected intra scenario variation and available computing time fire was simulated using scrpple while other processes were simulated using pre existing model components within the landis ii framework we simulated succession including seed dispersal regeneration and competition for water light and nitrogen using the net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen necn succession extension v5 0 scheller et al 2011 necn simulates the regeneration and growth of tree and shrub species age cohorts limitations include sunlight for regeneration mineral nitrogen available soil water and temperature necn tracks above and belowground live c as woody and non woody components for each cohort detrital c duff and large woody debris and soil organic carbon soc which decays and transforms following the three pool structure of the century soil model parton et al 1983 to estimate initial conditions we used an imputation of inventory data details of ltb succession parameterization including imputation of the initial vegetation conditions are found in loudermilk et al 2013 climate data was identical for both necn and scrpple table 1 our scenarios were as follows a recent historical we simulated recent historical patterns of lightning and accidental fires and current patterns of fire suppression fig 1 ignition data were calculated as described above and using data described in table 1 suppression data were estimated via extensive interviews with fire managers responsible for ltb fuel treatments and prescribed fires were not included b natural fire regime we simulated wildfire without suppression accidental fires or prescribed fires holding all other factors the same as recent historical c enhanced suppression in this scenario the resources devoted to suppression doubled the effectiveness of suppression holding all other factors the same as recent historical d reduced accidental ignitions in this scenario the number of accidental fires was reduced by half holding all other factors the same as recent historical representing an alternative to enhanced suppression whereby resources were allocated to reducing accidental ignitions rather than suppression such reductions could be achieved variously including education e g smokey bear camping restrictions fireworks and firearms restrictions or other the associated human activity is less defined than in the case of fire suppression or fuel treatments 4 results 4 1 model validation to validate model behavior we compared simulated patterns against historical patterns accidental human ignitions accounted for about 78 7 of recorded ignitions while lightning ignitions accounted for 20 3 of recorded ignitions in the ltb during the calibration period the spatial distribution of ignitions follows distinct patterns such that fires started accidentally cluster near the lake shore and most lightning ignitions occur on ridgetops the weighted surfaces for ignitions captured patterns that demonstrated human accidental ignitions and natural influences on the spatial distribution of ignitions ignition parameterization table 2 produced the expected distribution in the number of ignitions within a year given seasonal weather conditions fig 2 with both human accidental and lightning ignitions increasing with the fwi during the summer annual values approximated historical averages of both lightning and human accidental ignitions although with reduced variability fig 3 probability surfaces allocated a realistic spatial distribution of fire which followed observed patterns short 2013 simulated burn patterns are directly related to ignition patterns with more frequent smaller fires occurring at lower elevations where human accidental ignitions are typical fig 4 fire intensity was mixed by total area 42 8 low intensity 35 9 mid intensity and 24 3 high intensity for business as usual scenario for most fires with an overall balance of the three intensities matching the estimates from the forest service s mtbs derived burn severity maps 4 2 fire size and spread our fire spread parameterization table 2 produced highly variable shapes and within patch heterogeneity of intensity fig 5 dependent on local fuels topography and daily fire weather fire sizes varied with daily fire progression matching equation 4 table 2 indicating that physical barriers were not a frequent limit to fire spread in this landscape most 98 historical fires in the sierra nevada mountains were small i e 20 ha but fires larger than 100 ha accounted for most burned area our approach captured this fire size distribution fig 6 additionally our approach allowed for the creation of unburned islands within perimeters which are important ecologically and may cover up to 37 of the area within a perimeter kolden et al 2012 4 3 model performance under different management scenarios our four scenarios demonstrate a consistent increase in high intensity fires and a decline in low intensity fires due to succession and increased fuel loading across the four management scenarios enhanced suppression had the highest proportion of low intensity fires fig 7 in contrast the area burned was more variable over time the natural fire regime scenario burned the least area overall and recent historical and reduced accidental ignitions had the largest area burned fig 8 the total mortality shows a clear trend of increasing and higher mortality for recent historical and enhanced education fig 9 in summary recent historical resulted in the most active fire regime although the fraction burned as high intensity was not exceptional particularly after year 75 recent historical produced more intense fires more total area burned and more biomass killed than any other scenario recent historical included accidental fires which account for differences with the natural scenario the enhanced suppression and reduced accidental ignitions scenarios were broadly similar and had the lowest total area burned and lowest mortality after 75 years figs 8 and 9 5 discussion fire regimes are changing rapidly in response to human actions that affect ignition and suppression patterns fuel management and climate change given the rapid rate of change there is a great need to expand our capabilities to simulate integrate and understand feedbacks among human actions that will alter vegetation succession and disturbances in response to this need we developed a new approach to simulate natural accidental and prescribed fires in the landis ii landscape simulation model although scrpple was able to approximate the historical fire size distribution individual fire shapes have been notoriously difficult to estimate keane et al 2004 duff et al 2013 sá et al 2017 ellipses form the basis for many fire simulations e g finney 2002 although the formation of an actual ellipse would require constant wind direction and minimal topography our simulated fire shapes are neither ellipses nor circular rather each is complex with inclusions of unburned patches and with patchy fire intensity reflecting the complex terrain shifting wind directions and variable fuels unburned patches and within fire heterogeneity represent critical biological refugia that are important seed sources for post fire vegetation recovery kolden et al 2012 fornwalt et al 2018 our approach simulated fire size distributions that mirrored the fire size distribution of ltb as well as the shape of individual fires and within fire heterogeneity representing an advance in the capabilities of fire models to realistically represent the ecological impacts of fires for testing different management scenarios our design also improved the capacity to utilize expert opinion allowing for rapid development of simulation scenarios for instance the intensity classes are flexible and can be modified to suit fire managers typology and experience for this study fire intensity classes were based on flame length bins that fire managers use regularly to make decisions around planning and resource deployment manager familiarity with this metric enabled the efficient utilization of expert opinion and allowed their input to come from a place of field based knowledge explicit recognition and interface with manager expertise facilitates co production of scenarios and ultimately utilization of the knowledge produced gustafson et al 2006 in addition our fire simulation approach has improved capacity to utilize remotely sensed data and fire databases where available doing so we intentionally chose to move away from a rothermel style physics engine to a geospatial data driven landscape engine whereby we focused on capturing landscape scale determinants of fire behavior rather than fine scaled experimentally derived determinants see also stavros et al 2018 our approach is more congruent with the intended use of landscape scale modeling understanding disturbance consequences across many thousands of hectares and over many decades and fire regimes respond dynamically to climate whereas fire regimes are prescribed in a top down manner in many landscape simulation models e g keane et al 2004 this opens some exciting possibilities to understand how fire regimes may evolve over time and is critical for understanding the consequences of shifts in fire weather ignition patterns management strategies other disturbances and feedbacks with vegetation change in addition our approach facilitates sensitivity testing i e a reduced parameter set uncertainty analysis and cooperative scenario building every model approach has inherent limitations and scrpple is no exception it requires substantial spatial and temporal data for sufficient parameterization however these data needs are already being met given the large amount of remotely sensed imagery that has been collected over active fires e g duff et al 2013 sá et al 2017 specifically our application of daily fire perimeters to calibrate spread rates represents a novel application of remote sensing to inform a fire spread model in addition scrpple does not simulate social processes themselves rather it simulates the actions that result from social or cultural preferences agent based models are increasingly capable of simulating learning networking and decision making sotnik 2018 and could in the future substitute for our suppression and fuel treatment algorithms 5 1 implications from the lake tahoe basin scrpple provides a new framework to simulate interactions among human activities vegetation climate and fire in a bottom up fashion although we parameterized and evaluated scrpple for the ltb as an extension of the flexible and widely applied landis ii platform scrpple is suitable for application to forest landscapes worldwide importantly scrpple can make use of geospatial data and expert opinion to parameterize fire ignition rates spread behavior and effects such data requirements can be met in many places with modis active fire data giglio et al 2016 benali et al 2016 veraverbeke et al 2014 which tracks fire ignitions and fire spread likewise daily weather data suitable for calculating fwi are widely available from ncep ncar reanalysis daily weather data https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html by explicitly including anthropogenic processes in scrpple and parameterizing with widely available metrics of fire behavior the resulting simulations are suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of different management strategies for maintaining ecosystem services and enhancing ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change and human development the simulation results for our different scenarios highlight the potential for landis ii to assess socio ecological dimensions of fire regimes notably the similar ability of enhanced suppression and reduced accidental ignitions to reduce fire and related tree mortality over time suggests that within the broad outlines of the scenarios reducing accidental fires via education or other social processes unspecified can be as effective as substantially increasing resources for suppression because costs of fire suppression have increased markedly in recent years bladon 2018 our reduced accidental ignitions scenario implies that considerable cost savings are possible via social pathways consideration of the social dimensions of fire will become increasingly important as the wildland urban interface expands radeloff et al 2018 and we move into the era of managed wildfire explicit consideration of human activity allowed us to untangle multiple correlated factors e g accidental fires and fire suppression efforts are highly spatially correlated next steps are to consider climate change effects on ltb fire regimes and the

changes in fire regimes and the potential impacts of fires on human and natural systems is critical for shaping policy and management responses simulating fires and fire regimes is a common approach for elucidating the causes and effects of fire due to the difficulties of experimentation and the societal need for information about risks and management options there are a broad range of stand alone fire models available each designed for specific purposes these include models that predict ignition type and quantity fire size and total area burned within regions and ecoregions e g abatzoglou and williams 2016 balch et al 2017 dennison et al 2014 stavros et al 2014 combined statistical models of both number of ignitions and fire size westerling et al 2011 or pixel level

the wildland urban interface fire dynamics simulator mell et al 2007 or the coupled atmospheric weather fire experiment coen et al 2013 these approaches to modeling ignition and fire spread are designed for landscape scales and interact with vegetation patterns fuel loads topography and weather but do not directly incorporate vegetation change or feedbacks among human activities vegetation climate and fire over time in contrast landscape simulation models can integrate feedbacks among human actions e g logging fire and vegetation as well as other dimensions of landscape change that alter vegetation and succession including insect outbreaks and climatic effects on regeneration and growth furthermore landscape simulation models can represent direct human modifications to the fire regime such modifications include human effects on ignition rates chas amil et al 2015 the likelihood of suppression success ntaimo et al 2004 and the impact of fuel treatments that reduce fire spread and or mortality e g loudermilk et al 2014 krofcheck et al 2017 ager et al 2017 currently few landscape simulation models incorporate ignitions spread mortality and a full suite of human activities in addition to feedbacks with climate and emergent vegetation envision contains many of these processes although follows a state and transition succession sub model spies et al 2017 parameterization of fire models typically emphasizes calibration to broad scale metrics characterizing the recent fire regime e g fire size distribution fire rotation period less effort has been made to parameterize fire models to fine scale and short term metrics characterizing individual fire progression in part because the data required to do so are either lacking or difficult to acquire daily satellite active fire detections giglio et al 2003 have been demonstrated to track the progression of large wildfires veraverbeke et al 2014 and used to update fire spread simulations pinto et al 2016 coen et al 2018 however limited effort has been made to fully parameterize fire spread simulations entirely from remote sensing and geospatial data duff et al 2013 sá et al 2017 consequently we also sought to create a fire projection model that could be parameterized from available exogenous e g remote sensing expert opinion and endogenous vegetation data existing within a modeling framework e g tree species ages biomass data input variables e g those relating daily climate to probability of ignition should be tractable with solutions that can be estimated from remotely sensed data and or readily resolved using spatial data and or derived from local fire expertise therefore we developed a new fire model social climate related pyrogenic processes and their landscape effects scrpple that emphasizes the social dimensions of fire and captures 1 human ignitions accidental or via prescribed fire 2 the spatial and temporal patterns of prescribed fires 3 fuel treatment effects 4 the spatial patterns of fire suppression in addition scrpple captures the effects of topography fuels and climate we emphasized parameterization using landscape scale datasets that have recently become more widely available see table 1 finally the approach allows for targeted emphasis on different processes if suppression is not practiced on the landscape it can be readily disabled the fire model described could be operated without any information except the relationship between ignitions spread and fire weather index fwi van wagner 1987 scrpple was initially developed for the lake tahoe basin ltb in california and nevada fig 1 even though our model was initially parameterized for ltb and the initial suite of assumptions reflect the fire dynamics of this area our approach and these assumptions are broadly applicable to landscapes worldwide where fire is driven by both social and physical processes both anthropogenic and non human factors drive fire regimes in the ltb because of the value and density of people and structures fuel treatments i e vegetation management that reduces surface and mid story ladder fuels and prescribed fire are both actively deployed accidental ignitions predominate the arrangement and amount of fuels are a primary concern due to historical patterns of land use e g a relatively young and even aged forest age structure determined by historical logging events loudermilk et al 2013 and future fire regimes are likely to be substantially shaped by climate change yang et al 2015 in this paper we present the scrpple modeling approach and demonstrate model behavior using four scenarios for ltb that explicitly integrate multiple types of human actions and show the utility of our approach for assessing the trade offs among approaches for reducing fire on the landscape 2 methods the initial implementation of scrpple is within the landis ii landscape change framework landis ii represents vegetation succession scheller et al 2007 forest harvest and fuel treatments syphard et al 2011 and insect mortality sturtevant et al 2004 details about landis ii implementation computational requirements operating systems and open source code can be found at www landis ii org landis ii has two existing fire extensions the base fire extension which does not include climatic effects he and mladenoff 1999 and the dynamic fire extension which does not explicitly include anthropogenic processes sturtevant et al 2009 here we focus on the details of the new scrpple fire extension which consists of four primary algorithms ignition including human ignitions spread including the effects of suppression and fuel treatments fire intensity and fire mortality these algorithms simulate three separate types of fires lightning human unintentional accidental and prescribed fire rxfire allowing each fire type to have its own ignition and suppression and intensity patterns the extension assumes that if suppression is constant lightning and accidental fires will behave similarly in regard to spread and mortality under the same weather and wind speeds prescribed fires may be limited by fwi and wind speed all model code is available at https github com landis ii foundation extension scrpple details about input formats keywords etc are provided in the associated user guide http www landis ii org extensions scrapple 2 1 ignition our ignitions follow a supply and allocation model whereby the supply of ignitions is generated from a zero inflated poisson model and then ignitions are allocated across the landscape with an ignition surface for accidental and lightning fires the number of ignitions per day was determined by relating the number of ignitions by each of three the fire types accidental lightning prescribed to fire weather index fwi the canadian fire prediction system 1992 is used to calculate fwi as a smoothed average that integrates long and short term variation in precipitation and temperature fwi is calculated for each day of the year and the appropriate number of ignitions are generated for each day the following equation was fit to ignition and fwi data table 1 1 number of fires eβ0 β1 fwi this assumes a zero inflated poisson distribution zuur et al 2009 and uses a log link function requiring a fit of β0 and β1 that vary by ignition type and the estimated non zero portion of the ignition response for fractional ignitions e g number of ignitions 1 6 rounding determines the number of ignitions e g number of ignitions 2 prescribed fires rxfire are routinely deployed to reduce fine fuels agee and skinner 2005 and there are calls to substantially increase their use e g state of california executive order b 52 18 for rxfire a set number of fires are generated per year based on expert input and or scenario design rxfires are attempted sequentially by day of year until the expected number of fires is successfully ignited prescribed fire is often used under weather conditions different from wildfires therefore our model allows conditions to be placed on rxfire ignitions including a minimum fwi necessary to maintain fire spread below a maximum fwi conditions under which prescribed fire would be avoided and a maximum wind speed again conditions under which prescribed fire would be avoided a continuous weighted surface of historical ignitions for the entire landscape is required for each of the three ignition types and used to allocate ignitions for regions where the spatial pattern of ignitions is weak or unknown this surface can be a constant value or a smoothed average of ignition rates for other regions the spatial pattern of ignitions could be projected based on climate change estimates e g yang et al 2015 all available sites are then shuffled using an algorithm that biases selection by the ignition probability maps the list of ignitions sites is re shuffled at the beginning of each year in combination the three ignition sources generate the total number of fires per year per fire type and are dependent upon fwi 2 2 fire spread growth from the point of ignition fire can spread to each adjacent cell i e four nearest neighbors dependent upon a probability of spread pspread fire spread is from cell to cell and determines fire size a fire will continue burning until no more cells are selected for spread probability of fire spread is estimated using a general equation relating event probability to fwi beverly and wotton 2007 that creates a 0 1 probability function which is then applied at a daily time step to determine the success of cell to cell fire transmission 2 probability of fire spread pspread 1 1 eβ0 where β0 is the probability of spread into a site given conditions on that site 3 β0 β0 β1 fwi β2 effectivewindspeed β3 finefuels where effectivewindspeed is an adjusted wind speed whereby reported wind speed and direction for the region from meteorological stations is downscaled to individual sites by accounting for slope angle and the slope azimuth relative to the wind direction nelson 2002 effectivewindspeed also incorporates the intensity of the neighboring cell from which the fire is spreading see intensity calculations below a high intensity fire burning upslope generates a greater effectivewindspeed than a moderate or light fire this in turn feeds back into the estimate of fire intensity see below creating self sustaining high intensity fires under certain conditions during model execution fire fuels are estimated from endogenous internal to the model framework litter estimates during model execution fine fuels are spatially and temporally variable and reflect reductions from fuel treatments and fires and additions from overstory mortality e g from insect outbreaks e g sturtevant et al 2009 as calculated within an appropriate landis ii succession extension a fire will spread until it has reached a maximum area for the day or no cell to cell spread is predicted to occur due to fuel limitations or suppression activities below maximum area was determined empirically 4 maximum daily spread area β0 β1 fwi β2 effectivewindspeed maximum daily spread is an overall limit to daily area burned and therefore calculated separately from cell to cell fire spread maximum area spread parameters were derived using a fitted generalized linear model glm in the r statistical software both cell to cell spread and maximum daily fire spread are updated with daily fwi estimates until the fire can no longer spread e g disconnected fuels low fwi or suppression is applied 2 3 suppression suppression is simulated as the capacity to reduce the probability of fire spread and is unique for each fire type our suppression algorithm was designed in collaboration with fire managers and approximates the decisions made when deciding whether to suppress and the overall suppression effort suppression was implemented as four zones per fire type none minimal moderate maximal suppression each zone is assigned an integer reflecting suppression effectiveness that reduces pspread as a fraction suppression effectiveness 100 zones are input as unique maps for each fire type the unique maps allow for different kinds of suppression dependent upon circumstances for example lightning generated fires may be allowed to spread in remote areas of a landscape accidental fires may be heavily suppressed in all areas prescribed fires are typically suppressed in all areas except where the fires are intentionally introduced although they can escape these zones should be based on current or anticipated management efforts suppression effectiveness can vary as a function of fwi more resources for suppression are typically allocated during extreme fire weather higher fwi two fwi breakpoints determine when suppression efforts effectiveness increase in addition a maximum daily wind speed limits suppression to days when resources can be safely deployed if daily wind speed exceeds the maximum limit suppression does not occur 2 4 fire intensity we developed three classes of fire intensity low 1 2 m 4 feet flame lengths moderate 1 2 2 4 m 4 8 feet and high 2 4 m 8 feet these intensity classes correspond to metrics of intensity commonly used by fire managers corresponding mortality classes were also defined see below unlike fire ignition and spread empirical data of fire intensity are not available at the regional scale differenced normalized burn ratio dnbr is a metric of severity and does not readily translate into a metric of intensity therefore we used a multi condition risk approach to determine whether a site burned at low moderate or high intensity we defined three risk conditions based on fine and ladder fuels schoennagel et al 2004 and fire spread agee et al 2000 1 does the mass g m 2 of fine fuels exceed a calibrated threshold 2 does the mass g m 2 of ladder fuels exceed a calibrated threshold ladder fuels are assigned via a list of species with maximum ages that can be regarded as ladder fuels for example abies concolor aged 0 25 might be regarded as ladder fuels 3 is the fire intensity of the source site the neighboring site from where a fire spread high intensity a high intensity fire will promote higher intensity fire as it spreads the default is low intensity if one of these three conditions is true the intensity become moderate if two or more conditions are true the fire is high intensity 2 5 fire mortality fire mortality varies depending on fire intensity and the tree species and ages present a low intensity fire for example may cause extensive mortality if the forest is dominated by fire intolerant tree species for each fire intensity class a fire mortality table is defined that includes the age ranges and associated probability of mortality for each tree species a single random number is generated a global function within the landis ii framework for each burned site ensuring a consistent effect on all trees if pmortality from the corresponding fire mortality table exceeds the random number the species age cohort is killed 100 mortality 3 model parameterization and application 3 1 study area we parameterized and applied our fire model to the lake tahoe basin ltb fig 1 ltb is a dry conifer forest on the east side of the sierra nevada with a high average snowpack 50 150 cm and dry summers although ltb is now largely a recreational destination it was heavily logged at the end of the 19th century and the forests today reflect recovery from these past land uses loudermilk et al 2013 historically fires were frequent occurring every 3 20 years nagel and taylor 2005 but have been actively suppressed since the early 20th century in addition fire ignitions have substantially shifted in frequency and location with about 80 of fires started accidentally by humans and typically near the lake shore whereas most lightning fires occur on ridgetops short 2013 prescribed fire has historically been limited in scale and located only within the wildland urban interface loudermilk et al 2013 although recent efforts intend to expand prescribed fire to the broader watershed climate change is expected to increase annual temperatures increase fire season duration and increase the probability of extended droughts loudermilk et al 2013 and ignition locations yang et al 2015 3 2 model parameterization in order to parameterize ignitions historical fire data from 1992 to 2013 for the ltb short 2013 were used to estimate the relationship between daily number of ignitions and fwi we included only fires that spread to 1 ha ignitions within the historical data set were separated by ignition type into lightning coded as lightning within the short data and human accidental many codes including campfire arson and child were combined daily historical fwi was calculated from daily temperature and precipitation data prism as implemented within the climate library of landis ii lucash et al 2017 which produced daily fwi values for our period of record a zero inflated poisson distribution of fire ignitions was then fitted using the zeroinfl function within the pscl package in r producing estimates for β0 and β1 in eq 1 this was done for both lightning ignitions and human accidental ignitions the analysis was conducted using the likelihood package in r r core team 2014 we verified ignition behavior by testing eq 1 using random fwi values produced by a random number generator within r to validate fire ignitions we ran simulations to assess whether fire ignition parameters recreated the appropriate number of fires given a particular fwi value we also validated each ignition type such that the spatial patterns of fire ignitions provided by the input maps generally match the spatial patterns of fire ignitions by type the short 2013 data were also used to define an ignition surface for each fire type the cumulative number of ignitions by fire type by cell were used as inputs the model subsequently translates these data into weights whereby cells with higher weights are preferentially selected for ignitions to parameterize spread within the ltb we used the sierra nevada boundary defined by the sierra nevada conservancy see fig 1 we chose this area as being broadly representative of the conditions found in the ltb and containing more fires than the ltb alone providing a larger sample size for model fitting fire perimeters were polyline layers and each of the fire spread variables were raster datasets table 1 unsuccessful and successful spread cells were then identified and tracked throughout the period of record unsuccessful cells were defined as those that fell on a fire perimeter that did not burn on the following day to estimate the fire spread parameters spatial data are needed for daily fwi daily wind speed daily wind direction and fine fuel loading table 1 for a set of reference fires daily fire perimeters are then overlain on each of the datasets to extract successful and unsuccessful spread areas and assigned to a given day of the fire both year and day of year maximum spread area was drawn from the geomac fire perimeter data table 1 and was defined as the day to day increase in area of fire perimeters suppression zones intensity and the fwi breakpoints were determined via consultation with cooperating fire managers similarly the probability of mortality given the above intensity calculation estimates were collected using expert opinion whereby available fire experts for the ltb provided independent estimates of mortality provided via on line survey for varying species and age combinations these data were collected independently and collated and areas of disagreement indicated by a range among experts 0 35 discussed and refined our model design utilizes current estimates of fine fuels coarse fuels and ladder fuels the landis ii framework provides projections of fuel loads in response to vegetation growth mortality and disturbances eliminating the need to categorize sites into fuel classes which by design simplifies and averages landscape variation in fuels for example utilizing continuous fuel information will allow differentiation based on intensity and time since insect defoliation or mortality rather than a single fuel type for post insect outbreaks 3 3 model calibration and validation prior to applying the model to forecasting unique scenarios we calibrated and validated the model against historical fire regimes we assessed model accuracy by comparing model outputs against historical fire data from the ltb including fire rotation period years the distribution of fire sizes and estimates of intensity our calibration assumed that suppression in the sierra nevada broadly represented fire suppression in ltb therefore fire suppression efforts were parameterized via inputs from local fire managers to calibrate the relative total area of our three fire intensity classes we compared simulated burned area for each intensity class against empirical estimates of ratio of area burned in three similar severity classes although intensity and severity are not equivalent empirical intensity data are not available and so we used severity as the best available proxy historical fire severity data were drawn from the same broad sierra nevada geography as spread parameters avoiding potential sampling bias towards small high intensity fires which are most prominent in the basin table 1 3 4 model application we demonstrated the behavior and utility of our model via four simple scenarios that emphasize the effects of human activities on fire regimes the scenarios were run on the lake tahoe basin ltb landscape we simulated a randomized historical climate 1992 2011 whereby historical climate was randomly arranged with replacement on an annual basis although note that this approach does not capture longer term climatic trends e g kitzberger et al 2007 each scenario was simulated for 100 years the duration of available downscaled climate projections at a 1 ha resolution with four replicates per scenario the number of replicates reflected intra scenario variation and available computing time fire was simulated using scrpple while other processes were simulated using pre existing model components within the landis ii framework we simulated succession including seed dispersal regeneration and competition for water light and nitrogen using the net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen necn succession extension v5 0 scheller et al 2011 necn simulates the regeneration and growth of tree and shrub species age cohorts limitations include sunlight for regeneration mineral nitrogen available soil water and temperature necn tracks above and belowground live c as woody and non woody components for each cohort detrital c duff and large woody debris and soil organic carbon soc which decays and transforms following the three pool structure of the century soil model parton et al 1983 to estimate initial conditions we used an imputation of inventory data details of ltb succession parameterization including imputation of the initial vegetation conditions are found in loudermilk et al 2013 climate data was identical for both necn and scrpple table 1 our scenarios were as follows a recent historical we simulated recent historical patterns of lightning and accidental fires and current patterns of fire suppression fig 1 ignition data were calculated as described above and using data described in table 1 suppression data were estimated via extensive interviews with fire managers responsible for ltb fuel treatments and prescribed fires were not included b natural fire regime we simulated wildfire without suppression accidental fires or prescribed fires holding all other factors the same as recent historical c enhanced suppression in this scenario the resources devoted to suppression doubled the effectiveness of suppression holding all other factors the same as recent historical d reduced accidental ignitions in this scenario the number of accidental fires was reduced by half holding all other factors the same as recent historical representing an alternative to enhanced suppression whereby resources were allocated to reducing accidental ignitions rather than suppression such reductions could be achieved variously including education e g smokey bear camping restrictions fireworks and firearms restrictions or other the associated human activity is less defined than in the case of fire suppression or fuel treatments 4 results 4 1 model validation to validate model behavior we compared simulated patterns against historical patterns accidental human ignitions accounted for about 78 7 of recorded ignitions while lightning ignitions accounted for 20 3 of recorded ignitions in the ltb during the calibration period the spatial distribution of ignitions follows distinct patterns such that fires started accidentally cluster near the lake shore and most lightning ignitions occur on ridgetops the weighted surfaces for ignitions captured patterns that demonstrated human accidental ignitions and natural influences on the spatial distribution of ignitions ignition parameterization table 2 produced the expected distribution in the number of ignitions within a year given seasonal weather conditions fig 2 with both human accidental and lightning ignitions increasing with the fwi during the summer annual values approximated historical averages of both lightning and human accidental ignitions although with reduced variability fig 3 probability surfaces allocated a realistic spatial distribution of fire which followed observed patterns short 2013 simulated burn patterns are directly related to ignition patterns with more frequent smaller fires occurring at lower elevations where human accidental ignitions are typical fig 4 fire intensity was mixed by total area 42 8 low intensity 35 9 mid intensity and 24 3 high intensity for business as usual scenario for most fires with an overall balance of the three intensities matching the estimates from the forest service s mtbs derived burn severity maps 4 2 fire size and spread our fire spread parameterization table 2 produced highly variable shapes and within patch heterogeneity of intensity fig 5 dependent on local fuels topography and daily fire weather fire sizes varied with daily fire progression matching equation 4 table 2 indicating that physical barriers were not a frequent limit to fire spread in this landscape most 98 historical fires in the sierra nevada mountains were small i e 20 ha but fires larger than 100 ha accounted for most burned area our approach captured this fire size distribution fig 6 additionally our approach allowed for the creation of unburned islands within perimeters which are important ecologically and may cover up to 37 of the area within a perimeter kolden et al 2012 4 3 model performance under different management scenarios our four scenarios demonstrate a consistent increase in high intensity fires and a decline in low intensity fires due to succession and increased fuel loading across the four management scenarios enhanced suppression had the highest proportion of low intensity fires fig 7 in contrast the area burned was more variable over time the natural fire regime scenario burned the least area overall and recent historical and reduced accidental ignitions had the largest area burned fig 8 the total mortality shows a clear trend of increasing and higher mortality for recent historical and enhanced education fig 9 in summary recent historical resulted in the most active fire regime although the fraction burned as high intensity was not exceptional particularly after year 75 recent historical produced more intense fires more total area burned and more biomass killed than any other scenario recent historical included accidental fires which account for differences with the natural scenario the enhanced suppression and reduced accidental ignitions scenarios were broadly similar and had the lowest total area burned and lowest mortality after 75 years figs 8 and 9 5 discussion fire regimes are changing rapidly in response to human actions that affect ignition and suppression patterns fuel management and climate change given the rapid rate of change there is a great need to expand our capabilities to simulate integrate and understand feedbacks among human actions that will alter vegetation succession and disturbances in response to this need we developed a new approach to simulate natural accidental and prescribed fires in the landis ii landscape simulation model although scrpple was able to approximate the historical fire size distribution individual fire shapes have been notoriously difficult to estimate keane et al 2004 duff et al 2013 sá et al 2017 ellipses form the basis for many fire simulations e g finney 2002 although the formation of an actual ellipse would require constant wind direction and minimal topography our simulated fire shapes are neither ellipses nor circular rather each is complex with inclusions of unburned patches and with patchy fire intensity reflecting the complex terrain shifting wind directions and variable fuels unburned patches and within fire heterogeneity represent critical biological refugia that are important seed sources for post fire vegetation recovery kolden et al 2012 fornwalt et al 2018 our approach simulated fire size distributions that mirrored the fire size distribution of ltb as well as the shape of individual fires and within fire heterogeneity representing an advance in the capabilities of fire models to realistically represent the ecological impacts of fires for testing different management scenarios our design also improved the capacity to utilize expert opinion allowing for rapid development of simulation scenarios for instance the intensity classes are flexible and can be modified to suit fire managers typology and experience for this study fire intensity classes were based on flame length bins that fire managers use regularly to make decisions around planning and resource deployment manager familiarity with this metric enabled the efficient utilization of expert opinion and allowed their input to come from a place of field based knowledge explicit recognition and interface with manager expertise facilitates co production of scenarios and ultimately utilization of the knowledge produced gustafson et al 2006 in addition our fire simulation approach has improved capacity to utilize remotely sensed data and fire databases where available doing so we intentionally chose to move away from a rothermel style physics engine to a geospatial data driven landscape engine whereby we focused on capturing landscape scale determinants of fire behavior rather than fine scaled experimentally derived determinants see also stavros et al 2018 our approach is more congruent with the intended use of landscape scale modeling understanding disturbance consequences across many thousands of hectares and over many decades and fire regimes respond dynamically to climate whereas fire regimes are prescribed in a top down manner in many landscape simulation models e g keane et al 2004 this opens some exciting possibilities to understand how fire regimes may evolve over time and is critical for understanding the consequences of shifts in fire weather ignition patterns management strategies other disturbances and feedbacks with vegetation change in addition our approach facilitates sensitivity testing i e a reduced parameter set uncertainty analysis and cooperative scenario building every model approach has inherent limitations and scrpple is no exception it requires substantial spatial and temporal data for sufficient parameterization however these data needs are already being met given the large amount of remotely sensed imagery that has been collected over active fires e g duff et al 2013 sá et al 2017 specifically our application of daily fire perimeters to calibrate spread rates represents a novel application of remote sensing to inform a fire spread model in addition scrpple does not simulate social processes themselves rather it simulates the actions that result from social or cultural preferences agent based models are increasingly capable of simulating learning networking and decision making sotnik 2018 and could in the future substitute for our suppression and fuel treatment algorithms 5 1 implications from the lake tahoe basin scrpple provides a new framework to simulate interactions among human activities vegetation climate and fire in a bottom up fashion although we parameterized and evaluated scrpple for the ltb as an extension of the flexible and widely applied landis ii platform scrpple is suitable for application to forest landscapes worldwide importantly scrpple can make use of geospatial data and expert opinion to parameterize fire ignition rates spread behavior and effects such data requirements can be met in many places with modis active fire data giglio et al 2016 benali et al 2016 veraverbeke et al 2014 which tracks fire ignitions and fire spread likewise daily weather data suitable for calculating fwi are widely available from ncep ncar reanalysis daily weather data https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html by explicitly including anthropogenic processes in scrpple and parameterizing with widely available metrics of fire behavior the resulting simulations are suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of different management strategies for maintaining ecosystem services and enhancing ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change and human development the simulation results for our different scenarios highlight the potential for landis ii to assess socio ecological dimensions of fire regimes notably the similar ability of enhanced suppression and reduced accidental ignitions to reduce fire and related tree mortality over time suggests that within the broad outlines of the scenarios reducing accidental fires via education or other social processes unspecified can be as effective as substantially increasing resources for suppression because costs of fire suppression have increased markedly in recent years bladon 2018 our reduced accidental ignitions scenario implies that considerable cost savings are possible via social pathways consideration of the social dimensions of fire will become increasingly important as the wildland urban interface expands radeloff et al 2018 and we move into the era of managed wildfire explicit consideration of human activity allowed us to untangle multiple correlated factors e g accidental fires and fire suppression efforts are highly spatially correlated next steps are to consider climate change effects on ltb fire regimes and the

development to explore land surface biophysics terrestrial carbon fluxes and global vegetation dynamics the ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 indicated that the terrestrial biosphere contains organic carbon of 450 650 pgc in living plant biomass and 1500 2400 pgc in the dead organic matter in litters and soils however the estimated carbon storages still exhibited large variation due to model structure input dataset and key parameter algorithm the complexity of the model makes it difficult to quantitatively identify the impact factors on carbon storage quantitatively xia et al 2013 the pool and flux scheme has been widely used in tbms for instance century model had a profound effect on the development of the carbon cycle model parton et al 1987 parton et al 1993 based on this framework wang et al 2010 further developed casa cnp model which contains 9 carbon pools as well as the integrated terrestrial ecosystem carbon budget intec model ju et al 2006 and the community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable model wang et al 2011 wang et al 2010 xia et al 2012 whereas the carbon exchange between vegetation soil and the atmosphere cevsa model cao and woodward 1998 consisted of 8 carbon pools and the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps chen et al 1999 chen et al 2015 model comprised of 13 carbon pools however the property of carbon pools usually explains the description rather than the analysis thus the carbon exchange among carbon pools the size of each carbon pool and its internal carbon exchanges remain obscured the confusion in carbon structure constrains our understanding of the carbon cycle the terrestrial carbon cycle process can be separated into several independent components according to its fundamental characteristics xia et al 2013 this study introduced a framework of the detachable carbon cycle model dcc which base on a pool and flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools the average npp calculated from 1982 to 2008 was used as the influx data to obtain an optimal representation each of the carbon pool can be considered as an independent component and the model detachability facilitates the identification of the degree of uncertainty that parameters affect carbon storage the amount of carbon exchange in carbon pools enables the correction and improvement of the carbon cycle model because each of the carbon flow processes is highly quantitatively assessed the carbon pool size and exchange of each carbon pool were analyzed in detail and the influx efflux ie function based on carbon flux was also established in this study this work aims to contribute to our understanding of carbon flow exchange and distribution in the carbon cycle process and quantitatively provide a reference and framework for analyzing the global carbon cycle in a detachable perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 biome map a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land cover product mod12q1 was used to specify biomes this dataset was developed by the international geosphere biosphere program igbp data and information system the igbp classification system is utilized to obtain a land cover map for each year since 2001 thus the year 2001 was employed to drive the dcc model the product provides maps of global land covered at a 1 km spatial resolution furthermore i resampled the pixel resolution to 0 08 and converted the coordinate and projection system to the world geodetic system 1984 to match the global npp precipitation temperature and moisture datasets at the global and regional scales the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic and the algorithm performs well friedl et al 2002 the global distribution of biomes is shown in fig 1 the biomes include evergreen needle leaf forest enf evergreen broad leaf forest ebf deciduous needle leaf forest dnf deciduous broad leaf forest dbf mixed forest mf closed shrublands cs open shrublands os woody savannas ws savannas sav grasslands gra permanent wetlands pw croplands cro urban area ua cropland or nature land cro nat snow and ice si barren or sparse vegetation bsv however the biomes of pw ua si and bsv excluded in this study because of the lack of parameters to drive the model or without the cover of vegetation 2 2 climate datasets the daily meteorological dataset used was from the global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modeling archive http rda ucar edu datasets ds314 0 this dataset included temperature precipitation and moisture data these data are constructed by combining a suite of global observation based datasets with the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research reanalysis i further composited the daily data to yearly the soil textural data were obtained from the global soil dataset for use in earth gsde system models http globalchange bnu edu cn research soilw gsde is based on the soil map of the world and various regional and national soil databases and provides a more realistic data set of the physical and chemical properties of global soils wei et al 2014 all the data have the same spatial resolution coordinate and projection system as land cover data 2 3 description of the model i propose the detachable carbon cycle model dcc which based on pool and flux scheme wang et al 2017 and the century derived soil concept incorporated into the model fig 2 the initial value of each carbon pool was set to zero arora and boer 2005 xia et al 2013 i further developed the vegetation part and extended the carbon pool number to 14 dcc model consists of 3 parts namely vegetation carbon pools surface litter pools and soil carbon pools the vegetation carbon pool includes the stem pool leaf pool fine root pool and coarse root pool numbered separately from 11 to 14 the green region in fig 2 the surface litter pool contains surface wood structure pool surface structure pool surface metabolic pool and surface microbe pool numbered 9 1 5 and 4 respectively red region in fig 2 the soil c pool includes soil metabolic pool soil structure pool soil wood structure pool soil microbe pool slow pool and passive pool numbered 6 2 10 3 7 and 8 respectively the decomposition process of which occurred in soil yellow region in fig 2 the straight line arrow denotes the carbon flow direction and the curved arrow indicates the ratio of the carbon outflow vegetation soil system released as co2 photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration process of plants occurred in the blue region which generates gross primary productivity gpp and net primary productivity npp the fixed npp is allocated to the stem leaf fine roots and coarse roots the turnover rate of leaves is calculated as a function of leaf age arora and boer 2005 and the turnover rates of woody tissue or fine roots are treated as constant for each biome but vary with biome type wang et al 2010 litter shed on the soil surface and entering the soil are decomposed as co2 or transferred to each carbon pool leaf litter is divided into surface metabolic and surface structure pools the surface metabolic pool is directly decomposed into the surface microbe pool then the surface organic carbon is transferred into the slow pool by microorganism decomposition by contrast the surface and wood structure pool are partitioned into lignin and cellulose respectively the cellulose part is transferred into the surface microbe pool and the lignin part is transferred into the slow pool meanwhile the fine root litter is split into soil metabolic and soil structure pool the soil metabolic pool is transferred into the soil microbe pool and the soil structure and soil wood structure pool are divided into lignin and cellulose in contrast to that in the surface microbe pool the carbon in the soil microbe pool is divided into slow and passive pool depending on the soil texture finally most of the carbon accumulates in the passive pool whereas a small amount of carbon transferred to the soil microbe pool or released as co2 the lignin parts of structural carbon pools exhibit less heterotrophic respiration 30 released and higher transfer coefficient 70 transferred than the cellulose parts of structural carbon pools metabolic pools and microbe pools therefore lignin parts of structural carbon pools are turning into slow carbon pool because it is resistant to decomposition the carbon allocation strategies of biomes according to cable described in table a1 b11 14 the stem and coarse root have the lowest turnover rate of all plant organs across different biomes table a1 a11 14 cro is the most special biomes because it involves the human management and crop types which makes the carbon cycle process is quite complicated therefore i treat cro as annual crops and assume that there are no wood parts in cro and the turnover rate of cro leaves fine stems is set to 1 which means cro is harvested once a year the leaves fine stems or stubbles and fine roots are entering the litter pools after harvest however i did not consider the carbon losses because of harvest these carbon are named storage organs in the lpj dynamic global vegetation model with managed land version 4 0 lpjml4 schaphoff et al 2018 for nature vegetations the storage organs are directly entering litter pools the decomposition process is the same as leaves or fine roots but in crops these parts are removed from the vegetation soil system and are not involved in the carbon cycle 2 4 calculating gpp the gpp calculation is based on the biome bgc

study 2 6 carbon cycle equation the dcc model also adopts a pool and flux structure like other terrestrial carbon models the carbon variation and accumulation become dependent on carbon influx and efflux the terrestrial carbon cycle can be represented by a matrix equation luo et al 2015 as such the kernel parameters of the dcc model were expressed as a matrix equation carbon allocated to plant organs is preset according to wang et al 2010 but varies with the biome type the turnover time of each biome determines the amount of carbon from living tissues to death litter lignin to nitrogen l n ratio controls the split of leaf and fine root residues into structural and metabolic materials parton et al 1987 i assumed that the coarse root and stem residues directly flow into the structure pool lignin content controls the amount of the structure carbon pool that flows to the slow or microbe pool and is also negatively related to structural decay rates the soil microbe pool is more complicated than the surface microbe pool because soil texture regulates the input and output of carbon the carbon variation in each pool could express as in vegetation carbon pools ci t denotes the size of the carbon pool i at time t bi denotes the proportion of carbon allocated to ci u t is the carbon input at time t that is npp and ai is the plant turnover time from live tissues to death

data two soil carbon storage datasets were used in this study to compare with the soil carbon storage simulated by the dcc model hwsd version 1 2 was developed by the land use change and agriculture program of the international institute for applied systems analysis and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations in collaboration with the international soil reference and information centre world soil information the european commission joint research centre and the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences the spatial resolution of raster data database is 30 arc second and the raster datasets are linked to soil organic carbon soc density property data which with the topsoil 0 30 cm and the subsoil 30 100 cm layers from the amended hwsd with estimates derived from other global datasets for these depth layers hiederer and köchy 2011 the northern circumpolar soil carbon database ncscd version 2 was developed to quantify stocks of soil organic carbon soc in the northern circumpolar permafrost region a total area of 18 7 106 km2 the ncscd version 2 contains information on fractions of coverage of different soil types and storage of soc between 0 300 cm depth hugelius et al 2013 this database is available either as a polygon based database or converted to gridded data the two soc datasets were resampled to 0 08 by using a cubic method 3 results 3 1 gpp and npp validation the validation of gpp and npp as shown in fig 3 the results indicated that the gpp simulated in this study exhibited satisfactory accuracy by compared with eddy covariance flux measurement database r2 0 65 slope 0 92 fig 3 a the npp simulated by the photosynthesis sub module of dcc model was slightly overestimated by compared with emdi class c datasets r2 0

validation results of our model passed the significant test by comparing with eddy covariance flux measurement database data emdi class a and c datasets and tem data the model accuracy can be potentially improved 3 2 distribution of carbon storage territorial carbon storage as shown in fig 4 a the high carbon storage regions mainly located in the amazon plains in south america the congo basin in central africa southeast asia islands in the south pacific ocean and northern and eastern north america as well as scatter across high latitude of eurasia the vegetation carbon of tropical forest is dramatically higher than the other regions fig 4 b by contrast the high carbon storage of surface litter observed in circumpolar latitude regions of eurasia and northern america fig 4 c dnf enf os and mf were the dominated vegetation types soil carbon determines the carbon distribution because most of the carbon stored in the soil therefore the distribution of soil carbon is very similar to that of territorial carbon storage fig 4 d the carbon storage and density of each biome as shown in fig 5 globally the total territorial carbon storage was 2766 25 pg vegetation surface litter and soil carbon storage accounted for 25 52 1 39 and 73 10 of territorial carbon storage the carbon stored in soil typically higher than that stored in vegetation across all biomes in contrast the surface litter carbon was much smaller the ebf exhibits the most carbon storage of all biomes 740 77 pg accounted for 26 78 of total territorial carbon storage the vegetation and soil carbon storage of which was 325 44 and 412 65 pg respectively the carbon storage of mf was approximately half of ebf 13 07 361 59 pg except for ebf the vegetation carbon storage of mf 124 47 pg was higher than other biomes by contrast the carbon storage of enf was less than half of that of mf 5 63 148 21 pg and 63 05 of the carbon stored in the soil whereas the carbon storage of dbf was similar to that of dnf which accounted for 2 17 of total territorial carbon storage and dnf occupied 2 10 of that the soil carbon of the two biomes was 37 84 and 43 43 pg accounted for 62 96 and 74 80 of their carbon storage respectively overall the carbon stored in forest biomes accounted for 49 48 of the total territorial carbon storage while the soil carbon accounted for 59 36 of their carbon storage the carbon stored in non forest biomes occupied 50 52 of total territorial carbon storage and over 86 54 of the carbon stored in the soil the carbon stored in ws sav and gra accounted for 25 47 of total territorial carbon storage among them the soil carbon storage of ws sav and gra were 246 33 135 09 and 186 41 pg accounting for 75 45 71 14 and 96 81 of its carbon storage respectively by contrast the carbon storage of crop and crop nat was 372 92 pg over 99 67 stored in the soil the carbon stored in os and cs was 319 96 pg and the soil carbon occupied 84 37 the average carbon density of forest biomes was dramatically higher than that of non forest biomes especially ebf which had the highest carbon density 56 19 kg m2 of all biomes the carbon density of mf was 29 92 kg m2 a litter higher than that of dbf 29 06 kg m2 but second only to ebf by contrast the carbon density of enf and dnf was 28 34 and 25 04 kg m2 respectively however none of the non forest biomes carbon densities over 20 kg m2 ws had the highest carbon density 19 74 kg m2 crop nat and sav after it 16 86 and 15 78 kg m2 next was crop cs and os 12 02 10 37 and 9 63 kg m2 gra had the lowest carbon density of all biomes 7 30 kg m2 the soil carbon storage of the dcc model was compared with hwsd and ncscd data in latitude fig 6 the soil carbon storage of the dcc model is consistent with hwsd and ncscd data from 45 n to 60 n whereas the dcc model underestimates the soil carbon storage at 60 n to 88 n fig 6a the r2 is 0 78 dcc hwsd and 0 69 dcc ncscd in high latitudes globally the dcc model overestimates the soil carbon storage in tropics but underestimates it at 50 n to 70 n by compared with hwsd data fig 6b the r2 is 0 90 at global scale moreover this study s result was compared with the carbon storage which collected from literatures table 1 although the carbon storage demonstrated large variation the average carbon storage value simulated by different models or methods demonstrated statistical significance the average carbon values of global vegetation and soil are 2296 76 529 48 562 51 129 16 and 1689 25 522 35 pg c respectively in general our results are within a reasonable range 3 3 carbon storage and internal carbon exchange the spatial distribution of carbon storage of each carbon pool as shown in fig 7 the carbon stored in a tropical forest of south america islands in the south pacific ocean and circumpolar latitude regions in asia and north america than that of the other region the carbon flow diagram shown in fig 8 is derived from the average data in the global scale at carbon equilibrium state the carbon storage of stem and coarse root pools pools 11 and 14 is remarkably higher than leaf and fine root pool pools 12 and 13 respectively most of the carbon in the structure pools including surface wood structure surface structure soil structure and soil wood structure pool pools 9 1 2 and 10 respectively is transferred to slow pool while a small part fraction is released as co2 soil microbe pool 3 is the a highly complicated carbon pool which receives carbon from five directions the carbon pool storage of soil and surface microbe pool pools 3 and 4 is relatively higher than that of surface and soil metabolic pool pools 5 and 6 soil metabolic pool exhibits the lowest carbon storage among all carbon pools passive pool pool 8 holds the largest carbon storage followed by slow pool pool 7 and the carbon stored in these two pools accounted for 70 42 of the total carbon storage the carbon influx of each pool exhibits different characteristics compared with carbon storage the influxes of stem leaf and fine and coarse roots derive from photosynthesis whereas efflux relies on turnover time of the plant organ the maximum carbon influx was observed in npp allocated to fine root pool and the carbon influx of slow soil microbe soil metabolic and leaf pool is over 100 gc m2 by contrast the carbon influx of the other carbon pools is less than 80 gc m2 and the minimum carbon influx was identified in the passive pool the released co2 of soil carbon pools accounted for 67 74 of the total released co2 the slow pool released the most co2 among all carbon pools whereas the least released co2 was identified in the passive pool surface litter carbon pools contributed to 32 26 of the released co2 and surface metabolic pool released the most co2 in them in summary the carbon accumulation is highly dependent on the net carbon flux influx subtract efflux and equilibrium time and the passive pool was the largest carbon pool size slow pool released the most co2 among all carbon pools in the carbon decomposition process heterotrophic respiration and the co2 released by soil carbon pools was approximately twofold higher than that of surface litter pools 3 4 carbon ie function as previously mentioned the carbon storage is highly related to the net carbon flux and equilibrium time i collected the global mean annual carbon influx and efflux of each carbon pool from initial to equilibrium state for instance the passive pool needs 11020 years to reach equilibrium state then 11 020 global mean carbon influx and efflux data were obtained respectively thus the influx and efflux curves of each carbon pool were also obtained however the function that can explicitly represent the influx and efflux curves is unknown therefore a nonlinear curve fitting was performed to obtain the ie function if the functions were obtained the carbon storage of each carbon pool can simply represent as the integration of carbon influx function y1 minus that of carbon efflux function y2 from the initial time t 0 to equilibrium time t eq c a r b o n s t o r a g e t 0 t e q y 1 d t t 0 t e q y 2 d t t 0 t e q y 1 y 2 d t the influx and efflux data of carbon pool 6 are used an example and a total of four nonlinear functions were tested to determine the function that was robust table 2 the function was selected in accordance with the following principles 1 all datasets were successfully fitted 2 the residual sum of squares rss is minimal 3 the adjusted r2 is as high as possible the results indicated that the ie function can represent deformation of logistic function no 2 in table 2 because it exhibits the minimal rss and promising adjusted r2 the ie function can be written as follows c a r b o n f l u x a 1 a 2 1 x x 0 p a 2 where a1 a2 x0 and p are the parameters x is the equilibrium time from 1 to equilibrium state which varied in each carbon pool the logistic function was used for the nonlinear fitting of each carbon pool the results indicated that the largest and least rss values of the ie function were observed in the slow pool and surface structure pools table 3 respectively all functions passed the significance test and the original form was kept for effectively understanding the function variables as shown in fig 9 time is the only independent variable the carbon storage can represent as the yellow area that is surrounded by the initial line of x 1 and ie function the initial time was set to one and the equilibrium time was the intersection point of the ie function line carbon storage simulated by the ie function was less than that of dcc model table 4 by contrast the equilibrium time predicted by the ie function is typically less than that of the dcc model however the equilibrium time of pools 5 6 9 and 10 cannot be determined because the ie function of these carbon pools exhibits premature convergence and is constant along with the time sequence therefore the equilibrium time of the four carbon pools can be determined if the difference between influx and efflux remains constant 4 discussions 4 1 advantages and limitations of the dcc model the dcc model provides a framework to simulate the carbon equilibrium state which cannot be achieved by field experimental study first the model detachability contributes to our understanding of the carbon cycle model because each carbon pool can be regarded as an independent component the detachability does not mean that each component of the model isolates from the main structure but it provides us a new perspective to understand the complexity of the carbon cycle second the dcc model demonstrated 14 carbon pools the substantial carbon pools indicate excellent stability of the carbon cycle structure and small disturbances will cause no large fluctuations in the carbon pools wang et al 2014 third the dcc model also facilitates the identification of the manner by which the internal and external factors regulate the carbon cycle process and enables the correction and improvement of the carbon cycle model in this study i identified the carbon flow characteristics at equilibrium state and found that the maximum co2 emissions come from slow carbon pool finally this study first revealed that the influx and efflux of each carbon pool can be described as a logistic function from disequilibrium to equilibrium state in addition the carbon storage of each carbon pool can be calculated as the difference between the integration of ie function the carbon cycle process of crops is simplified in the dcc model because the intervention of human management makes the carbon cycle process slightly complicated therefore the cro biomes were treated as annual crops by setting the turnover rate of leaves to one in the dcc model i e the cro biomass was harvested once a year the harvested carbon is uninvolved in the carbon cycle thereby indicating that the input carbon from plant organs to litter pools is overestimated in the current dcc model which also led to the overestimation of total carbon storage of cro the latest lpjml4 model includes 12 different annual crop functional types and the harvested carbon named storage organs is computed by phenological stage and the harvest index the storage organs are directly harvested from the field while 10 of the aboveground biomass remained on the field if the crop residues were removed schaphoff et al 2018 the lpjml4 model serves us a guide to study the carbon cycle of cropland ecosystems however the crop function types of the lpjml4 model are annual crops specifically the storage organs are harvested once a year whereas some crops are harvested twice a year or thrice every two years such kind of crops exhibits higher turnover rate and less carbon input in the carbon cycle and soil carbon storage than nature plants the dcc model decomposition is a first order kinetic function which assumes that the decomposed soil carbon is proportional to the size of soil carbon pool and the maximum carbon decomposition rate of each carbon pool is varied with environmental conditions e g temperature moisture and soil texture however the soil carbon decomposition process is not only dependent on the carbon concentration but also affected by the microbe biomass microbial feedback to environmental conditions is inexplicitly represented in the first order kinetic model wieder et al 2015a that is the adaptability of soil microbe to warming is excluded moreover the priming effect the decomposition rate of recalcitrant organic soil carbon varies after the addition of easily decomposable organic carbon to soil cannot be explained by the first order kinetic model wang et al 2015 therefore the michaelis menten kinetics formulation which exhibits a nonlinear feature was incorporated in the recent soil carbon model try to reveal the effect of the microbial biomass on carbon decomposition nevertheless the carbon structure of the nonlinear soil carbon model is significantly simplified compared with the traditional first order kinetic model which only contains three or four pools allison et al 2010 wang et al 2015 wieder et al 2013 wutzler and reichstein 2008 the over simplified structure may induce oscillations of the nonlinear models in response to small perturbations which was unobserved in field measurements wang et al 2014 although the nonlinear soil carbon model shows advantages in simulating the effect of microbe activities on soil carbon decomposition and the feedback of microbial biomass to warming is absent in the first order carbon model it still faces numerous challenges such as further study of the model parameter estimation and inter comparison analyses that must be resolved before being incorporated into tbms in summary nonlinear soil carbon model contributes to our understanding of the carbon cycle and the combination of the advantage of the first order and nonlinear model e g multiple pools coupled with nonlinear function might be a worthwhile approach to accurately simulate the global carbon cycle the current dcc model still exhibited several ecological processes that should be take into consideration first plant mortality includes background stress and fire mortality in lpjml4 schaphoff et al 2018 the background mortality is a fraction of population density whereas competition and heat caused stress mortality and fire caused mortality plant mortality accelerates the carbon cycle process in vegetation soil system because mortality terminates the growth of plants and turns it into litters in a short time especially fire caused mortality the organic carbon turned into co2 released to the atmosphere and the nutrients entered soil for plant growth second lpj guess was incorporated in the n cycle in vegetation and soil smith et al 2014 the original n cycle scheme was adopted from the century model parton et al 1993 and further improved parton et al 2010 the modification is incorporated n stress in the model compared with c only model thereby resulting in a reduction in simulated npp and carbon pool size however the biological n fixation is simplified in the n cycle of lpj guess which is a linear function evapotranspiration and the direct driver and mechanism remained obscured smith et al 2014 finally orchidee mict includes the implementation of the thermal and hydrological effects in a multi layered soil which is important to simulate the response of permafrost carbon storage to warming huntingford 2017 however orchidee mict simulates substantial permafrost than observations which probably missed some crucial processes in winter between the air and the deep soil thus the freezing thawing process of permafrost needs further study in the future 4 2 uncertainty of carbon storage and its influencing factors the dcc model overestimates the carbon storage in tropics but underestimates that in high latitudes this condition might be attributed to the environment factors temperature and soil moisture are the main influencing factors on the spatial distribution of carbon storage and a slight variation of the two environmental scalars might cause a significant difference in carbon storage temperature and moisture water algorithms were widely incorporated into tbms to reflect the environmental effect on carbon cycle fisher et al 2014 the high environmental scalar indicates that the substantial carbon is released from the initial carbon pool however large uncertainties are existed in the spatial distribution of temperature and moisture scalar in tbms the uncertainties of temperature scalar in high latitudes are larger than that of the other regions whereas the largest uncertainties of moisture scalar are mainly found in tropics therefore the manner by which temperature and soil moisture affects soil heterotrophic respiration in high latitudes and tropics is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of spatial distribution of carbon storage moreover the dcc model does not include the freezing and thawing process of permafrost which might be one of the reasons for the large uncertainties in simulating carbon storage of high latitudes npp is another influencing factor on carbon storage a stable carbon input is required to reach an equilibrium state in the carbon cycle process xia et al 2012 the varied npp will result in fluctuation in the net carbon flux and the instability makes it difficult to determine whether the carbon pool reached an equilibrium state the average npp which is derived from a given period is selected as the carbon input to prevent this problem chen et al 2015 xia et al 2012 in this study the npp based on remote sensing data is derived from the mean of 27 year npp data to obtain an optimal representation the model driven by remote sensing data can significantly decrease the uncertainty in npp because there is unnecessary to simulate the plant physiological processes however the remote sensing data were typically applied to calculate fpar by using vegetation indexes e g ndvi evi and lai cheng et al 2014 potter et al 2012 potter et al 1993 zhou et al 2016 the difference in physical characteristics of vegetation index and fpar algorithm might result in inconsistency in npp prediction carbon storage is also influenced by the vegetation dynamics in this study only one biome map was used to drive the dcc model the dcc model needs more than 10 thousand years to reach an equilibrium state therefore incorporating vegetation dynamics into the dcc model in equilibrium state simulation is still a challenge the lpj model has simulated the vegetation dynamics sitch et al 2003 smith 2001 however the vegetation classification system is slightly different from the igbp the difference in vegetation classification system will inevitably lead to variation in carbon storage 4 3 ie function although the decomposition rate of carbon pool exhibits a linear relationship with carbon pool size in the dcc model the carbon accumulation process presented nonlinear characteristics and result in nonlinear ie functions of each carbon pool in which the equilibrium time is the only independent variable the carbon storage can be easily obtained because the ie functions were primarily known in addition the equilibrium time can be regarded as the intersection point of the ie functions however the differences in carbon storage simulated by ie function and dcc model were observed because the ie functions were established based on the average value of global carbon influx and efflux equilibrium time is considered as the intersection point of the ie function however the premature convergences of the ie function identified no intersection point e g carbon pool 5 6 9 and 10 therefore the equilibrium time of these carbon pools were determined by assuming that the differences between ie functions were constant changing the function parameters might solve the premature convergences of the ie functions but it still needs further study in summary the ie function contributes to our understanding that the process of carbon equilibrium state simulation can represent as a logistic function from initial state to equilibrium state 5 conclusion this study proposed a dcc model which based on a pool and flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools a steady carbon influx was calculated from the mean of 27 year npp data the carbon pool size and flow process were easily accessed because of the model detachability the territorial carbon storage was 2766 25 pg the carbon storage values in vegetation and soil are 705 85 and 2022 00 pg and carbon pools 7 and 8 occupied 70 42 of the territorial carbon storage at the equilibrium state 67 74 of the total released co2 derived from soil carbon pools and slow pool contributes the most co2 among them the influx and efflux of each carbon pool can serve as a logistic function and the carbon storage is the difference between the

25074,terrestrial carbon storage plays a crucial role in determining the global carbon cycle and regulating global climate however the carbon storage as simulated by terrestrial biosphere models tbms exhibits considerable inconsistency at the regional or global scale because the model structure input dataset and key parameter are quite different in tbms in this study i proposed a detachable carbon cycle dcc model to simulate terrestrial carbon storage internal carbon exchange and the influx efflux ie function of each carbon pool the model was established based on a pool and flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools or carbon flow processes each process can be detached from the primary model and evaluated as an independent component the average net primary productivity npp from 1982 to 2008 was used as the influx carbon to drive the dcc model the magnitude of the internal carbon exchanges of the dcc model was explicitly represented and the carbon ie function of each carbon pool was fitted based on the characteristics of carbon flux results indicated that the terrestrial carbon storage was 2766 25 pg and carbon stored in vegetation and soil was 705 85 and 2022 00 pg respectively carbon stored in slow and passive pools accounted for 70 42 of the terrestrial carbon storage and the slow pool contributes the highest amount of released co2 among of all carbon pools during carbon decomposition the ie functions exhibited a nonlinear curve feature and satisfactory adjust r2 this study aimed to contribute to our understanding of the carbon cycle from non equilibrium state to equilibrium state and can serve as a reference and framework for global carbon storage simulation research keywords terrestrial carbon storage influx efflux function detachable carbon cycle model equilibrium state 1 introduction terrestrial carbon storage is essential in determining the state of the global carbon cycle and regulating the global climate foley et al 1996 wang et al 2017 the amount of organic carbon stored in plant and soil are twofold that in the atmosphere and the carbon fluxes in the vegetation soil atmosphere system is tenfold larger than carbon dioxide co2 emissions from fossil fuel cao and woodward 1998 the co2 exchange among between vegetation soil and the atmosphere highly depends on carbon storage the increasing co2 concentration in the atmosphere exerts in a strong feedback effect e g global warming on climate friedlingstein et al 2006 ipcc 2013 wang et al 2016 terrestrial carbon storage and its using efficiency at the global or regional scale have been extensively investigated using terrestrial biosphere models tbms or field measurement method li et al 2015 wieder et al 2015b wu et al 2018 fisher et al 2014 provided an incomplete overview of the tbms and determined that more than 70 models have been used to research the terrestrial carbon cycle for example carvalhais et al 2014 combined remote sensing data with the enhanced harmonized world soil database hwsd dataset and concluded that the carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems approximate to 2 807 555 855 pg potter et al 1993 presented the carnegie ames stanford approach casa biosphere model to predict the global terrestrial net primary production and edaphic controls in patterns of soil microbial respiration wang et al 2010 further developed the casa cnp model to investigate the carbon nitrogen n and phosphorus cycle and its limitation on the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems the lund potsdam jena lpj dynamic global vegetation model combines process based large scale representations of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and land atmosphere carbon exchanges to evaluate terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling sitch et al 2003 organizing carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystemsan orchidee model based on surface vegetation atmosphere transfer scheme to simulates global carbon cycle krinner et al 2005 foley et al 1996 presented a framework for biosphere model development to explore land surface biophysics terrestrial carbon fluxes and global vegetation dynamics the ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 indicated that the terrestrial biosphere contains organic carbon of 450 650 pgc in living plant biomass and 1500 2400 pgc in the dead organic matter in litters and soils however the estimated carbon storages still exhibited large variation due to model structure input dataset and key parameter algorithm the complexity of the model makes it difficult to quantitatively identify the impact factors on carbon storage quantitatively xia et al 2013 the pool and flux scheme has been widely used in tbms for instance century model had a profound effect on the development of the carbon cycle model parton et al 1987 parton et al 1993 based on this framework wang et al 2010 further developed casa cnp model which contains 9 carbon pools as well as the integrated terrestrial ecosystem carbon budget intec model ju et al 2006 and the community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable model wang et al 2011 wang et al 2010 xia et al 2012 whereas the carbon exchange between vegetation soil and the atmosphere cevsa model cao and woodward 1998 consisted of 8 carbon pools and the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps chen et al 1999 chen et al 2015 model comprised of 13 carbon pools however the property of carbon pools usually explains the description rather than the analysis thus the carbon exchange among carbon pools the size of each carbon pool and its internal carbon exchanges remain obscured the confusion in carbon structure constrains our understanding of the carbon cycle the terrestrial carbon cycle process can be separated into several independent components according to its fundamental characteristics xia et al 2013 this study introduced a framework of the detachable carbon cycle model dcc which base on a pool and flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools the average npp calculated from 1982 to 2008 was used as the influx data to obtain an optimal representation each of the carbon pool can be considered as an independent component and the model detachability facilitates the identification of the degree of uncertainty that parameters affect carbon storage the amount of carbon exchange in carbon pools enables the correction and improvement of the carbon cycle model because each of the carbon flow processes is highly quantitatively assessed the carbon pool size and exchange of each carbon pool were analyzed in detail and the influx efflux ie function based on carbon flux was also established in this study this work aims to contribute to our understanding of carbon flow exchange and distribution in the carbon cycle process and quantitatively provide a reference and framework for analyzing the global carbon cycle in a detachable perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 biome map a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land cover product mod12q1 was used to specify biomes this dataset was developed by the international geosphere biosphere program igbp data and information system the igbp classification system is utilized to obtain a land cover map for each year since 2001 thus the year 2001 was employed to drive the dcc model the product provides maps of global land covered at a 1 km spatial resolution furthermore i resampled the pixel resolution to 0 08 and converted the coordinate and projection system to the world geodetic system 1984 to match the global npp precipitation temperature and moisture datasets at the global and regional scales the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic and the algorithm performs well friedl et al 2002 the global distribution of biomes is shown in fig 1 the biomes include evergreen needle leaf forest enf evergreen broad leaf forest ebf deciduous needle leaf forest dnf deciduous broad leaf forest dbf mixed forest mf closed shrublands cs open shrublands os woody savannas ws savannas sav grasslands gra permanent wetlands pw croplands cro urban area ua cropland or nature land cro nat snow and ice si barren or sparse vegetation bsv however the biomes of pw ua si and bsv excluded in this study because of the lack of parameters to drive the model or without the cover of vegetation 2 2 climate datasets the daily meteorological dataset used was from the global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modeling archive http rda ucar edu datasets ds314 0 this dataset included temperature precipitation and moisture data these data are constructed by combining a suite of global observation based datasets with the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research reanalysis i further composited the daily data to yearly the soil textural data were obtained from the global soil dataset for use in earth gsde system models http globalchange bnu edu cn research soilw gsde is based on the soil map of the world and various regional and national soil databases and provides a more realistic data set of the physical and chemical properties of global soils wei et al 2014 all the data have the same spatial resolution coordinate and projection system as land cover data 2 3 description of the model i propose the detachable carbon cycle model dcc which based on pool and flux scheme wang et al 2017 and the century derived soil concept incorporated into the model fig 2 the initial value of each carbon pool was set to zero arora and boer 2005 xia et al 2013 i further developed the vegetation part and extended the carbon pool number to 14 dcc model consists of 3 parts namely vegetation carbon pools surface litter pools and soil carbon pools the vegetation carbon pool includes the stem pool leaf pool fine root pool and coarse root pool numbered separately from 11 to 14 the green region in fig 2 the surface litter pool contains surface wood structure pool surface structure pool surface metabolic pool and surface microbe pool numbered 9 1 5 and 4 respectively red region in fig 2 the soil c pool includes soil metabolic pool soil structure pool soil wood structure pool soil microbe pool slow pool and passive pool numbered 6 2 10 3 7 and 8 respectively the decomposition process of which occurred in soil yellow region in fig 2 the straight line arrow denotes the carbon flow direction and the curved arrow indicates the ratio of the carbon outflow vegetation soil system released as co2 photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration process of plants occurred in the blue region which generates gross primary productivity gpp and net primary productivity npp the fixed npp is allocated to the stem leaf fine roots and coarse roots the turnover rate of leaves is calculated as a function of leaf age arora and boer 2005 and the turnover rates of woody tissue or fine roots are treated as constant for each biome but vary with biome type wang et al 2010 litter shed on the soil surface and entering the soil are decomposed as co2 or transferred to each carbon pool leaf litter is divided into surface metabolic and surface structure pools the surface metabolic pool is directly decomposed into the surface microbe pool then the surface organic carbon is transferred into the slow pool by microorganism decomposition by contrast the surface and wood structure pool are partitioned into lignin and cellulose respectively the cellulose part is transferred into the surface microbe pool and the lignin part is transferred into the slow pool meanwhile the fine root litter is split into soil metabolic and soil structure pool the soil metabolic pool is transferred into the soil microbe pool and the soil structure and soil wood structure pool are divided into lignin and cellulose in contrast to that in the surface microbe pool the carbon in the soil microbe pool is divided into slow and passive pool depending on the soil texture finally most of the carbon accumulates in the passive pool whereas a small amount of carbon transferred to the soil microbe pool or released as co2 the lignin parts of structural carbon pools exhibit less heterotrophic respiration 30 released and higher transfer coefficient 70 transferred than the cellulose parts of structural carbon pools metabolic pools and microbe pools therefore lignin parts of structural carbon pools are turning into slow carbon pool because it is resistant to decomposition the carbon allocation strategies of biomes according to cable described in table a1 b11 14 the stem and coarse root have the lowest turnover rate of all plant organs across different biomes table a1 a11 14 cro is the most special biomes because it involves the human management and crop types which makes the carbon cycle process is quite complicated therefore i treat cro as annual crops and assume that there are no wood parts in cro and the turnover rate of cro leaves fine stems is set to 1 which means cro is harvested once a year the leaves fine stems or stubbles and fine roots are entering the litter pools after harvest however i did not consider the carbon losses because of harvest these carbon are named storage organs in the lpj dynamic global vegetation model with managed land version 4 0 lpjml4 schaphoff et al 2018 for nature vegetations the storage organs are directly entering litter pools the decomposition process is the same as leaves or fine roots but in crops these parts are removed from the vegetation soil system and are not involved in the carbon cycle 2 4 calculating gpp the gpp calculation is based on the biome bgc

study 2 6 carbon cycle equation the dcc model also adopts a pool and flux structure like other terrestrial carbon models the carbon variation and accumulation become dependent on carbon influx and efflux the terrestrial carbon cycle can be represented by a matrix equation luo et al 2015 as such the kernel parameters of the dcc model were expressed as a matrix equation carbon allocated to plant organs is preset according to wang et al 2010 but varies with the biome type the turnover time of each biome determines the amount of carbon from living tissues to death litter lignin to nitrogen l n ratio controls the split of leaf and fine root residues into structural and metabolic materials parton et al 1987 i assumed that the coarse root and stem residues directly flow into the structure pool lignin content controls the amount of the structure carbon pool that flows to the slow or microbe pool and is also negatively related to structural decay rates the soil microbe pool is more complicated than the surface microbe pool because soil texture regulates the input and output of carbon the carbon variation in each pool could express as in vegetation carbon pools ci t denotes the size of the carbon pool i at time t bi denotes the proportion of carbon allocated to ci u t is the carbon input at time t that is npp and ai is the plant turnover time from live tissues to death

information centre world soil information the european commission joint research centre and the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences the spatial resolution of raster data database is

derived from other global datasets for these depth layers hiederer and köchy 2011 the northern circumpolar soil carbon database ncscd version 2 was developed to quantify stocks of soil organic carbon soc in the northern circumpolar permafrost region a total area of 18 7 106 km2 the ncscd version 2 contains information on fractions of coverage of different soil types and storage of soc between 0

results 3 1 gpp and npp validation the validation of gpp and npp as shown in fig 3 the results indicated that the gpp simulated in this study exhibited satisfactory accuracy by compared with eddy

validation results of our model passed the significant test by comparing with eddy covariance flux measurement database data emdi class a and c datasets and tem data the model accuracy can be potentially improved 3 2 distribution of carbon storage territorial carbon storage as shown in fig 4 a the high carbon storage regions mainly located in the amazon plains in south america the congo basin in central africa southeast asia islands in the south pacific ocean and northern and eastern north america as well as scatter across high latitude of eurasia the vegetation carbon of tropical forest is dramatically higher than the other regions fig 4 b by contrast the high carbon storage of surface litter observed in circumpolar latitude regions of eurasia and northern america fig 4 c dnf enf os and mf were the dominated vegetation types soil carbon determines the carbon distribution because most of the carbon stored in the soil therefore the distribution of soil carbon is very similar to that of territorial carbon storage fig 4 d the carbon storage and density of each biome as shown in fig 5 globally the total territorial carbon storage was 2766 25 pg vegetation surface litter and soil carbon storage accounted for 25 52 1 39 and 73 10 of territorial carbon storage the carbon stored in soil typically higher than that stored in vegetation across all biomes in contrast the surface litter carbon was much smaller the ebf exhibits the most carbon storage of all biomes 740 77 pg accounted for 26 78 of total territorial carbon storage the vegetation and soil carbon storage of which was 325 44 and 412 65 pg respectively the carbon storage of mf was approximately half of ebf 13 07 361 59 pg except for ebf the vegetation carbon storage of mf 124 47 pg was higher than other biomes by contrast the carbon storage of enf was less than half of that of mf 5 63 148 21 pg and 63 05 of the carbon stored in the soil whereas the carbon storage of dbf was similar to that of dnf which accounted for 2 17 of total territorial carbon storage and dnf occupied 2 10 of that the soil carbon of the two biomes was 37 84 and 43 43 pg accounted for 62 96 and 74 80 of their carbon storage respectively overall the carbon stored in forest biomes accounted for 49 48 of the total territorial carbon storage while the soil carbon accounted for 59 36 of their carbon storage the carbon stored in non forest biomes occupied 50 52 of total territorial carbon storage and over 86 54 of the carbon stored in the soil the carbon stored in ws sav and gra accounted for 25 47 of total territorial carbon storage among them the soil carbon storage of ws sav and gra were 246 33 135 09 and 186 41 pg accounting for 75 45 71 14 and 96 81 of its carbon storage respectively by contrast the carbon storage of crop and crop nat was 372 92 pg over 99 67 stored in the soil the carbon stored in os and cs was 319 96 pg and the soil carbon occupied 84 37 the average carbon density of forest biomes was dramatically higher than that of non forest biomes especially ebf which had the highest carbon density 56 19 kg m2 of all biomes the carbon density of mf was 29 92 kg m2 a litter higher than that of dbf 29 06 kg m2 but second only to ebf by contrast the carbon density of enf and dnf was 28 34 and 25 04 kg m2 respectively however none of the non forest biomes carbon densities over 20 kg m2 ws had the highest carbon density 19 74 kg m2 crop nat and sav after it 16 86 and 15 78 kg m2 next was crop cs and os 12 02 10 37 and 9 63 kg m2 gra had the lowest carbon density of all biomes 7 30 kg m2 the soil carbon storage of the dcc model was compared with hwsd and ncscd data in latitude fig 6 the soil carbon storage of the dcc model is consistent with hwsd and ncscd data from 45 n to 60 n whereas the dcc model underestimates the soil carbon storage at 60 n to 88 n fig 6a the r2 is 0 78 dcc hwsd and 0 69 dcc ncscd in high latitudes globally the dcc model overestimates the soil carbon storage in tropics but underestimates it at 50 n to 70 n by compared with hwsd data fig 6b the r2 is 0 90 at global scale moreover this study s result was compared with the carbon storage which collected from literatures table 1 although the carbon storage demonstrated large variation the average carbon storage value simulated by different models or methods demonstrated statistical significance the average carbon values of global vegetation and soil are 2296 76 529 48 562 51 129 16 and 1689 25 522 35 pg c respectively in general our results are within a reasonable range 3 3 carbon storage and internal carbon exchange the spatial distribution of carbon storage of each carbon pool as shown in fig 7 the carbon stored in a tropical forest of south america islands in the south pacific ocean and circumpolar latitude regions in asia and north america than that of the other region the carbon flow diagram shown in fig 8 is derived from the average data in the global scale at carbon equilibrium state the carbon storage of stem and coarse root pools pools 11 and 14 is remarkably higher than leaf and fine root pool pools 12 and 13 respectively most of the carbon in the structure pools including surface wood structure surface structure soil structure and soil wood structure pool pools 9 1 2 and 10 respectively is transferred to slow pool while a small part fraction is released as co2 soil microbe pool 3 is the a highly complicated carbon pool which receives carbon from five directions the carbon pool storage of soil and surface microbe pool pools 3 and 4 is relatively higher than that of surface and soil metabolic pool pools 5 and 6 soil metabolic pool exhibits the lowest carbon storage among all carbon pools passive pool pool 8 holds the largest carbon storage followed by slow pool pool 7 and the carbon stored in these two pools accounted for 70 42 of the total carbon storage the carbon influx of each pool exhibits different characteristics compared with carbon storage the influxes of stem leaf and fine and coarse roots derive from photosynthesis whereas efflux relies on turnover time of the plant organ the maximum carbon influx was observed in npp allocated to fine root pool and the carbon influx of slow soil microbe soil metabolic and leaf pool is over 100 gc m2 by contrast the carbon influx of the other carbon pools is less than 80 gc m2 and the minimum carbon influx was identified in the passive pool the released co2 of soil carbon pools accounted for 67 74 of the total released co2 the slow pool released the most co2 among all carbon pools whereas the least released co2 was identified in the passive pool surface litter carbon pools contributed to 32 26 of the released co2 and surface metabolic pool released the most co2 in them in summary the carbon accumulation is highly dependent on the net carbon flux influx subtract efflux and equilibrium time and the passive pool was the largest carbon pool size slow pool released the most co2 among all carbon pools in the carbon decomposition process heterotrophic respiration and the co2 released by soil carbon pools was approximately twofold higher than that of surface litter pools 3 4 carbon ie function as previously mentioned the carbon storage is highly related to the net carbon flux and equilibrium time i collected the global mean annual carbon influx and efflux of each carbon pool from initial to equilibrium state for instance the passive pool needs 11020 years to reach equilibrium state then 11 020 global mean carbon influx and efflux data were obtained respectively thus the influx and efflux curves of each carbon pool were also obtained however the function that can explicitly represent the influx and efflux curves is unknown therefore a nonlinear curve fitting was performed to obtain the ie function if the functions were obtained the carbon storage of each carbon pool can simply represent as the integration of carbon influx function y1 minus that of carbon efflux function y2 from the initial time t 0 to equilibrium time t eq c a r b o n s t o r a g e t 0 t e q y 1 d t t 0 t e q y 2 d t t 0 t e q y 1 y 2 d t the influx and efflux data of carbon pool 6 are used an example and a total of four nonlinear functions were tested to determine the function that was robust table 2 the function was selected in accordance with the following principles 1 all datasets were successfully fitted 2 the residual sum of squares rss is minimal 3 the adjusted r2 is as high as possible the results indicated that the ie function can represent deformation of logistic function no 2 in table 2 because it exhibits the minimal rss and promising adjusted r2 the ie function can be written as follows c a r b o n f l u x a 1 a 2 1 x x 0 p a 2 where a1 a2 x0 and p are the parameters x is the equilibrium time from 1 to equilibrium state which varied in each carbon pool the logistic function was used for the nonlinear fitting of each carbon pool the results indicated that the largest and least rss values of the ie function were observed in the slow pool and surface structure pools table 3 respectively all functions passed the significance test and the original form was kept for effectively understanding the function variables as shown in fig 9 time is the only independent variable the carbon storage can represent as the yellow area that is surrounded by the initial line of x 1 and ie function the initial time was set to one and the equilibrium time was the intersection point of the ie function line carbon storage simulated by the ie function was less than that of dcc model table 4 by contrast the equilibrium time predicted by the ie function is typically less than that of the dcc model however the equilibrium time of pools 5 6 9 and 10 cannot be determined because the ie function of these carbon pools exhibits premature convergence and is constant along with the time sequence therefore the equilibrium time of the four carbon pools can be determined if the difference between influx and efflux remains constant 4 discussions 4 1 advantages and limitations of the dcc model the dcc model provides a framework to simulate the carbon equilibrium state which cannot be achieved by field experimental study first the model detachability contributes to our understanding of the carbon cycle model because each carbon pool can be regarded as an independent component the detachability does not mean that each component of the model isolates from the main structure but it provides us a new perspective to understand the complexity of the carbon cycle second the dcc model demonstrated 14 carbon pools the substantial carbon pools indicate excellent stability of the carbon cycle structure and small disturbances will cause no large fluctuations in the carbon pools wang et al 2014 third the dcc model also facilitates the identification of the manner by which the internal and external factors regulate the carbon cycle process and enables the correction and improvement of the carbon cycle model in this study i identified the carbon flow characteristics at equilibrium state and found that the maximum co2 emissions come from slow carbon pool finally this study first revealed that the influx and efflux of each carbon pool can be described as a logistic function from disequilibrium to equilibrium state in addition the carbon storage of each carbon pool can be calculated as the difference between the integration of ie function the carbon cycle process of crops is simplified in the dcc model because the intervention of human management makes the carbon cycle process slightly complicated therefore the cro biomes were treated as annual crops by setting the turnover rate of leaves to one in the dcc model i e the cro biomass was harvested once a year the harvested carbon is uninvolved in the carbon cycle thereby indicating that the input carbon from plant organs to litter pools is overestimated in the current dcc model which also led to the overestimation of total carbon storage of cro the latest lpjml4 model includes 12 different annual crop functional types and the harvested carbon named storage organs is computed by phenological stage and the harvest index the storage organs are directly harvested from the field while 10 of the aboveground biomass remained on the field if the crop residues were removed schaphoff et al 2018 the lpjml4 model serves us a guide to study the carbon cycle of cropland ecosystems however the crop function types of the lpjml4 model are annual crops specifically the storage organs are harvested once a year whereas some crops are harvested twice a year or thrice every two years such kind of crops exhibits higher turnover rate and less carbon input in the carbon cycle and soil carbon storage than nature plants the dcc model decomposition is a first order kinetic function which assumes that the decomposed soil carbon is proportional to the size of soil carbon pool and the maximum carbon decomposition rate of each carbon pool is varied with environmental conditions e g temperature moisture and soil texture however the soil carbon decomposition process is not only dependent on the carbon concentration but also affected by the microbe biomass microbial feedback to environmental conditions is inexplicitly represented in the first order kinetic model wieder et al 2015a that is the adaptability of soil microbe to warming is excluded moreover the priming effect the decomposition rate of recalcitrant organic soil carbon varies after the addition of easily decomposable organic carbon to soil cannot be explained by the first order kinetic model wang et al 2015 therefore the michaelis menten kinetics formulation which exhibits a nonlinear feature was incorporated in the recent soil carbon model try to reveal the effect of the microbial biomass on carbon decomposition nevertheless the carbon structure of the nonlinear soil carbon model is significantly simplified compared with the traditional first order kinetic model which only contains three or four pools allison et al 2010 wang et al 2015 wieder et al 2013 wutzler and reichstein 2008 the over simplified structure may induce oscillations of the nonlinear models in response to small perturbations which was unobserved in field measurements wang et al 2014 although the nonlinear soil carbon model shows advantages in simulating the effect of microbe activities on soil carbon decomposition and the feedback of microbial biomass to warming is absent in the first order carbon model it still faces numerous challenges such as further study of the model parameter estimation and inter comparison analyses that must be resolved before being incorporated into tbms in summary nonlinear soil carbon model contributes to our understanding of the carbon cycle and the combination of the advantage of the first order and nonlinear model e g multiple pools coupled with nonlinear function might be a worthwhile approach to accurately simulate the global carbon cycle the current dcc model still exhibited several ecological processes that should be take into consideration first plant mortality includes background stress and fire mortality in lpjml4 schaphoff et al 2018 the background mortality is a fraction of population density whereas competition and heat caused stress mortality and fire caused mortality plant mortality accelerates the carbon cycle process in vegetation soil system because mortality terminates the growth of plants and turns it into litters in a short time especially fire caused mortality the organic carbon turned into co2 released to the atmosphere and the nutrients entered soil for plant growth second lpj guess was incorporated in the n cycle in vegetation and soil smith et al 2014 the original n cycle scheme was adopted from the century model parton et al 1993 and further improved parton et al 2010 the modification is incorporated n stress in the model compared with c only model thereby resulting in a reduction in simulated npp and carbon pool size however the biological n fixation is simplified in the n cycle of lpj guess which is a linear function evapotranspiration and the direct driver and mechanism remained obscured smith et al 2014 finally orchidee mict includes the implementation of the thermal and hydrological effects in a multi layered soil which is important to simulate the response of permafrost carbon storage to warming huntingford 2017 however orchidee mict simulates substantial permafrost than observations which probably missed some crucial processes in winter between the air and the deep soil thus the freezing thawing process of permafrost needs further study in the future 4 2 uncertainty of carbon storage and its influencing factors the dcc model overestimates the carbon storage in tropics but underestimates that in high latitudes this condition might be attributed to the environment factors temperature and soil moisture are the main influencing factors on the spatial distribution of carbon storage and a slight variation of the two environmental scalars might cause a significant difference in carbon storage temperature and moisture water algorithms were widely incorporated into tbms to reflect the environmental effect on carbon cycle fisher et al 2014 the high environmental scalar indicates that the substantial carbon is released from the initial carbon pool however large uncertainties are existed in the spatial distribution of temperature and moisture scalar in tbms the uncertainties of temperature scalar in high latitudes are larger than that of the other regions whereas the largest uncertainties of moisture scalar are mainly found in tropics therefore the manner by which temperature and soil moisture affects soil heterotrophic respiration in high latitudes and tropics is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of spatial distribution of carbon storage moreover the dcc model does not include the freezing and thawing process of permafrost which might be one of the reasons for the large uncertainties in simulating carbon storage of high latitudes npp is another influencing factor on carbon storage a stable carbon input is required to reach an equilibrium state in the carbon cycle process xia et al 2012 the varied npp will result in fluctuation in the net carbon flux and the instability makes it difficult to determine whether the carbon pool reached an equilibrium state the average npp which is derived from a given period is selected as the carbon input to prevent this problem chen et al 2015 xia et al 2012 in this study the npp based on remote sensing data is derived from the mean of 27 year npp data to obtain an optimal representation the model driven by remote sensing data can significantly decrease the uncertainty in npp because there is unnecessary to simulate the plant physiological processes however the remote sensing data were typically applied to calculate fpar by using vegetation indexes e g ndvi evi and lai cheng et al 2014 potter et al 2012 potter et al 1993 zhou et al 2016 the difference in physical characteristics of vegetation index and fpar algorithm might result in inconsistency in npp prediction carbon storage is also influenced by the vegetation dynamics in this study only one biome map was used to drive the dcc model the dcc model needs more than 10 thousand years to reach an equilibrium state therefore incorporating vegetation dynamics into the dcc model in equilibrium state simulation is still a challenge the lpj model has simulated the vegetation dynamics sitch et al 2003 smith 2001 however the vegetation classification system is slightly different from the igbp the difference in vegetation classification system will inevitably lead to variation in carbon storage 4 3 ie function although the decomposition rate of carbon pool exhibits a linear relationship with carbon pool size in the dcc model the carbon accumulation process presented nonlinear characteristics and result in nonlinear ie functions of each carbon pool in which the equilibrium time is the only independent variable the carbon storage can be easily obtained because the ie functions were primarily known in addition the equilibrium time can be regarded as the intersection point of the ie functions however the differences in carbon storage simulated by ie function and dcc model were observed because the ie functions were established based on the average value of global carbon influx and efflux equilibrium time is considered as the intersection point of the ie function however the premature convergences of the ie function identified no intersection point e g carbon pool 5 6 9 and 10 therefore the equilibrium time of these carbon pools were determined by assuming that the differences between ie functions were constant changing the function parameters might solve the premature convergences of the ie functions but it still needs further study in summary the ie function contributes to our understanding that the process of carbon equilibrium state simulation can represent as a logistic function from initial state to equilibrium state 5 conclusion this study proposed a dcc model which based on a pool and flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools a steady carbon influx was calculated from the mean of 27 year npp data the carbon pool size and flow process were easily accessed because of the model detachability the territorial carbon storage was 2766 25 pg the carbon storage values in vegetation and soil are 705 85 and 2022 00 pg and carbon pools 7 and 8 occupied 70 42 of the territorial carbon storage at the equilibrium state 67 74 of the total released co2 derived from soil carbon pools and slow pool contributes the most co2 among them the influx and efflux of each carbon pool can serve as a logistic function and the carbon storage is the difference between the
