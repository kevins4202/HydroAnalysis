1025,this study aimed the potential of terrain indices to control the relative proportion of soil organic and inorganic carbon contained in soil total carbon stock stcs within water erosion prone environments three elevation groups 1 000 1 300 masl 1 300 1 500 masl and 1 500 2 000 masl within a watershed were selected terrain indices which included slope stream power index spi and topographic wetness index twi were extracted furthermore stcs soil organic and inorganic c microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and alkaline cations were measured despite both organic and inorganic carbon demonstrated a significant increase in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 and 1 300 1 500 masl compared with the range of 1 500 2 000 masl the sics socs ratio exhibited the higher rate only at the range of 1000 1300 m the higher sics values at 1 000 1 300 masl showed a significant positive relationship with twi and a negative relationship with spi and slope the sics was significantly positively correlated with alkaline cations in 1 000 1 300 masl whereas this relationship was significant and negative with socs these findings showed that decreased spi values and consequently decreasing the erosive power of surface runoff stimulated the higher concentration of the fine particle on 1 000 1 300 masl the fine particles accumulated on these positions together with the carbon dioxide generated by microbial respiration bond with alkaline cations to create carbonate production these findings show the importance of terrain attributes not only in variation of the soil organic c but also in the creation of mineral forms of carbon causing variation in the quality of stcs within different watershed positions keywords terrain indices soil total carbon topographic wetness index stream power index watershed 1 introduction water erosion represents a worldwide problem in the many watershed landscapes that strongly affect soil total carbon stock stcs dynamics causing variability in the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and pedosphere berhe et al 2007 the carbon contained in soils is more than three times the amount stored in terrestrial plants and in the atmosphere eswaran et al 2000 liu et al 2018 furthermore the largest rate of stcs exists in the upper 2 m of soil schomakers et al 2017 as a result in water erosion prone landscapes such as watershed environments since sediment entrainment and transport processes by surface runoff considerably affect surface soil layer wainwright et al 2000 turnbull et al 2010 these landscapes are recognized one of the most important resources of variability in the global carbon budget due to their high instability in the stcs dynamics despite the stcs comprises two principal components of soil organic soc and inorganic sic carbon zhang et al 2015 the importance of the soc storage in regional carbon budget has received considerable attention in contrast the quantity of sics has been extensively neglected furthermore in arid and semiarid regions that cover more than 40 of the global land surface the sic is the dominant carbon form and its storage is approximately two to ten times larger than the soc storage wu et al 2009 gao et al 2017 batjes 2004 the storage of sic exists as lithogenic inheriting from soil parent material with no change in sic content and pedogenic forming by soil biochemical processes such as the combination of co2 generated by microbial respiration and alkaline cations contained in soil wu et al 2009 rawlins et al 2011 lal kimble 2000 the relationship between primary terrain attributes such as slope aspect of slope elevation plan curvature and profile curvature secondary terrain variables such as slope length stream power index and topographic wetness index as well as sediment entrainment and transport processes induced by water erosion can provide an opportunity for the exchange of soc to inorganic forms of carbon via changes in soil biochemical processes the condition that fluctuates the relative proportion of soc and sic contained in soil total carbon stock i e the quality of stcs within different watershed positions although both organic and inorganic carbon contribute a high proportion of the spatial dynamics of soil carbon pool the most of researches focused on soc accumulation and stabilization smith et al 2001 berhe and kleber 2013 ryals et al 2014 dominati et al 2010 hilton et al 2011 lozano garcía et al 2017 van den bygaart et al 2012 fiener et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 or on the relationship between the storage of soc and terrain indices fissore et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the researches proved that decreasing the erosive power of surface runoff in a parallel decrease in elevation and slope can occur an opportunity for soc accumulation and burial promoting higher soc content and inhabitation from decomposition at depositional watershed positions fissore et al 2017 berhe and kleber 2013 however the present study showed that how the interactions between terrain attributes and inherent soil characteristics with impact on soil biochemical mechanisms may disturb the prevailing trend of soc stabilization and accumulation within erosional and depositional positions the condition that can encourage the exchanges of soc to carbonate production sic causing variation in the relative proportion of soc and sic contained in soil total carbon stock within different watershed positions the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the interactions between the terrain indices such as stream power index topographic wetness index and slope and the soil variables on variation in the quality of soil total carbon stock the relative proportion of soil inorganic and organic carbon within different positions of a landscape prone to water erosion 2 materials and methods 2 1 study watershed this research was implemented on the binaloud watershed located in khorasan razavi province northeastern iran fig 1 the geographical coordinate of the study watershed can be seen in fig 1 the average annual precipitation and temperature of the watershed are between 200 and 250 mm and 13 c respectively the gradient of the watershed slope was ranged from 10 to 70 also the elevation of the watershed was ranged from 1 000 to 3 211 masl meters above sea level the steep slope the semiarid climatic conditions and the extreme rainfall events resulted in a high susceptibility of the watershed to water erosion processes the drainage pattern of the watershed mainly comprises dendritic and parallel patterns the almost 4 km the main stream of the watershed plays an important role in detachment and transportation of surface soils along different topographic levels 2 2 classification of elevation groups and soil sampling firstly the study watershed was classified to three elevation groups fig 1 the elevation ranges included 1 a range of 1 000 1 300 masl that was the area of alluvial fans as depositional watershed positions 2 a range of 1 300 1 500 masl that included the area of the apex of alluvial fan and the parts of hillslope as depositional erosional watershed positions 3 a range of 1 500 2 000 masl as erosional watershed positions at each of the elevation groups 20 soil samples were collected from the center of 1 1 m quadrats to a depth of 0 20 cm the soil organic carbon component soc was determined using walkley black titration rowell 1994 the soil inorganic carbon sic was determined by hydrochloric acid neutralization and sodium hydroxide titration loeppert suarez 1996 the soil total carbon content stc was calculated based on the sum of soc and sic the soil total carbon stock stcs g cm2 was calculated as follows stcs stc bd 1 rc d where bd rc and d represent the soil bulk density g cm3 the percentage of soil particle 2 mm and the sampling depth respectively furthermore the soil organic carbon stock socs g cm2 and soil inorganic carbon stock sics g cm2 was calculated exchangeable cations cmoles kg including ca mg na and k were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry david 1960 the ph was measured in the saturated paste and the saturated paste extract using a ph meter soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen mbc and mbn mg g were determined using the chloroform fumigation extraction method vance et al 1987 the distribution of soil fractions 2 mm and soil fractions 2 mm was determined using the standard hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 and the mechanical sieve shaker respectively the soil bulk density bd g cm3 was measured using intact soil cores blake and hartge 1986 soil moisture m3 m3 as volumetric water content was measured using the wet dry weight of soil mass and bulk density of the soil samples 2 3 extraction of terrain indices the primary and secondary terrain indices were derived from a 30 m grid digital elevation model dem of iran the primary terrain attributes were included elevation m slope degrees profile curvature and plan curvature the secondary terrain indices which included stream power index spi topographic wetness index twi were also extracted stream power index eq 1 moore et al 1993 is an index of the erosive power of surface runoff affected by slope and contributing area a higher value of spi exhibits the intensification of soil erosion resulting from concentrated runoff mhiret et al 2019 topographic wetness index eq 2 bell et al 1995 represents the soil moisture conditions within different watershed positions which can affect the erosive power of surface runoff all the terrain indices were extracted by using arcgis10 4 1 spi ln a c tan s l o p e 100 2 twi ln a c tan s l o p e where ac is the specific catchment area the local upslope area draining through a certain point per unit contour length which is equal to a certain grid cell width raduła et al 2018 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance and tukey post hoc test was first used to test the significant differences in the quality i e the relative proportion of sic and soc contained in stcs and quantity of stcs and the associated soil physiochemical factors as well as the measured terrain attributes between the different elevation groups stepwise multiple regression was then used to analyze the factors the combination of the soil and terrain attributes affecting the quantity of stcs within the different elevation groups further the relationship between the soil terrain attributes and variability in sics socs ratio along the watershed was assessed by using pearson correlation analysis the statistical analyses were done by using spss version 19 0 3 results 3 1 variable analysis controlling the quantity of stcs along watershed based on the results of anova analysis and tukey post hoc test the different elevation groups within the watershed illustrated statistically significant differences p 0 05 in terms of the terrains indices table 1 and soil biotic abiotic attributes table 2 average terrains indices of the sampled points showed statistically significant differences between the elevation groups the average slope ranged between 7 to 23 p 0 05 with the least and greatest values at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 and 1 500 2 000 masl respectively fig 2 the elevation range of 1 300 1 500 masl was intermediate 14 on overage in this regard the average spi ranged between 9 to 5 p 0 05 with the highest and lowest values at the elevation ranges of 1 500 2 000 and 1 000 1 300 masl respectively fig 3 the average twi exhibited a range of 7 to 17 p 0 05 with the highest value in the lower elevation groups compared with the elevation group of 1 500 2 000 masl fig 4 both profile and plan curvature indices showed a range of 8 5 to 8 5 exhibiting concave curvature in the elevation group of 1 000 1 300 masl and convex curvature in the elevation groups of 1 500 2 000 masl the stcs exhibited the highest value p 0 05 in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl in comparison with other elevation groups the socs statistically exhibited a higher value in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 and 1 300 1 500 masl compared with the range of 1 500 2 000 masl the sics sics socs ratio and amount of exchangeable cations showed the highest value in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl compared with other elevation groups mbc and mbn significantly increased in the elevation of 1 000 1 300 masl compared with other elevation ranges the highest value of soil moisture was observed in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl compared with the range of 1 500 2 000 masl the elevation of 1 300 1 500 masl was intermediate in this regard the average ph value increased at the range of 1 000 1 300 masl compared with the elevation of 1 500 2 000 masl the elevation range of 1 300 1 500 masl was again intermediate in this regard the highest value of soil particles 2 mm and soil particles 2 mm was seen at the range of 1 000 1 300 and 1 500 2 000 masl respectively bulk density significantly decreased in the range of 1 000 1 300 masl in comparison with the higher elevation groups as shown in table 3 the results of the multiple stepwise regressions show a combination of the terrain attributes and associated soil variables significantly controlled the spatial distribution of stcs along the watershed in all the elevation ranges stcs significantly exhibited a positive and negative relationship with twi and slope respectively at the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl the stcs was significantly correlated with spi sic ph mg and soc at the elevation range of 1 300 1 500 masl independent variables that could significantly positively control the quantity of stcs were the soc and soil moisture further at the elevation range of 1 500 2 000 masl the stcs was significantly correlated with soc spi and soil moisture 3 2 impact of terrain indices on the quality of stcs within watershed the results of the pearson correlation analysis could show the causes of variations in the relative proportion sic and soc contained in soil total carbon stock within the different elevation ranges a high correlation between the sics and terrain attributes could explain the increasing sics socs ratio in the elevation group of 1 000 1 300 masl in comparison with other groups as shown in fig 5 the sics exhibited a significant negative correlation with the spi and slope in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl whereas the correlation between the sics and twi was significant and positive further as shown in table 4 the sics indicated a significant relationship with the exchangeable cations and socs in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl 4 discussion despite the extensive researches about the stcs dynamic within hillslope landscapes the most of researches focused on the relationship between the terrain indices and variability of soc berhe and kleber 2013 dominati et al 2010 fiener et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 van den bygaart et al 2012 however there is no dedicated study regarding how variability in terrain indices can affect soil biochemical factors and processes and thereby vary the quality of stcs i e the relative proportion of soc and sic contained in soil total carbon stock along watershed landscapes based on the results of the multiple regression terrain attributes such as twi spi and slope were found as powerful predictors controlling the variability of stcs along the watershed table 3 these variables similarly affected the quantity of stcs in all the elevation ranges however the soil variables controlling the stcs exhibited significant differences between the elevation groups at the elevation ranges of 1 300 1 500 and 1 500 2 000 masl increasing slope led to decreased topographic wetness index values and subsequently increasing the stream power index values this condition stimulated the significant reduction of stcs because of water transportation and substance migration and subsequently higher soc decomposition lower socs values in table 2 especially in the elevation of 1 500 2 000 masl while in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl area of alluvial fans within the watershed decreasing slope resulted in decreasing the erosive power of surface runoff lower spi values and subsequently increasing water infiltration into the soil higher twi values such changes in the terrain attributes provided a condition for the significant accumulation of the fine fractions and increasing soil moisture stimulating a significant increase in the microbial activity higher mbc and mbn values at the position compared with other positions contrary to the terrain attributes that similarly affected the stcs in all the elevation groups the soil variables controlling the stcs differed between the groups the stcs in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl exhibited a statistically significant relationship with soc sic and ph whereas at the elevation ranges of 1 300 1 500 and 1 500 2 000 masl the soc and soil moisture were the main factors controlling the quantity of stcs the socs exhibited a significant increase in both the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 and 1 300 1 500 masl whereas the sics socs ratio demonstrated a significant increase only at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl the results of correlation analysis illustrated how the terrain attributes could affect soil biochemical mechanisms causing changes in the relative proportion of sic and soc contained in soil total carbon stock within different watershed positions the quantity of sics demonstrated a significant positive correlation with topographic wetness index at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl fig 5a in contrast this relationship was significant and negative with the stream power index fig 5a and slope fig 5b in the position in the case of soil variables a significant positive relationship was seen between the sics and alkaline cations in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl table 4 whereas this relationship was significant and negative with the socs these findings show the critical role of terrain attributes not only in variation of the soc but also in the creation of inorganic carbon forms along the watershed decreasing the stream power index values and consequently the erosive power of surface runoff provided a condition for the concentration of the fine particle on the elevations of 1 000 1 300 masl compared with other positions these fine particles accumulated on this position together with the carbon dioxide generated by microbial respiration i e organic carbon decomposition resulting from increasing microbial activity higher mbc and mbn values in table 2 bond with alkaline cations such as na mg k and ca variables that demonstrated the greatest rates at the elevations of 1 000 1 300 masl to contribute toward carbonate production thomas et al 2014 the process that caused the negative relationship between sics and socs in this elevation range table 4 these results differ from those of previous studies which claimed that at depositional positions within the hillslope landscape soc accumulation is higher in comparison with erosional positions berhe and kleber 2013 fiener et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 according to our findings although both erosional and depositional positions contributed to soc decomposition the function of the terrain indices on the soil biotic abiotic attributes such as accumulation of fine fraction increasing ph increasing alkaline cations increasing soil moisture and increasing soc at the lower positions provided a condition for the exchange of decomposed soc due to carbon dioxide generated by microbial respiration because of increasing microbial activity to inorganic forms of carbon the condition that could promote the higher storage of soil total carbon within the depositional positions 5 conclusions although it has been proven that erosional and depositional positions within hillslope landscape have the different role in soc stabilization and accumulation our findings demonstrate that the interactions between the terrain indices such as stream power index slope and topographic wetness index and the soil variables controlling the stcs dynamics can affect soil biochemical mechanisms thereby encouraging a change in the relative proportion of inorganic and organic carbon contained in soil total carbon stock within different watershed positions the condition that stimulates the emergence of hot spots of mineral and organic forms of carbon within the landscape based on the findings increasing slope and spi and decreasing twi led to removing organic c and subsequently decreasing the rate of organic c in the elevation ranges of 1 500 2 000 masl conversely decreasing spi and slope and increasing twi provided a condition for increasing organic c in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl although both erosional and depositional positions contributed to soil organic carbon decomposition the interaction between the terrain indices such as slope spi and twi and soil attributes at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl could provide an opportunity for the exchange of decomposed soil organic carbon to carbonate production compared with the erosional elevation range the condition that could encourage the higher storage of soil total carbon within the positions with lower slope and spi and higher twi declaration of competing interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

range of 1000 1300 m the higher sics values at 1 000 1 300 masl showed a significant positive relationship with twi and a negative relationship with spi and slope the sics was significantly positively correlated with alkaline cations in 1 000 1 300 masl whereas this relationship was significant and negative with socs these findings showed that decreased spi values and consequently decreasing the erosive power of surface runoff stimulated the higher concentration of the fine particle on 1 000 1 300 masl the fine particles accumulated on these positions together with the carbon dioxide

respectively bulk density significantly decreased in the range of 1 000 1 300 masl in comparison with the higher elevation groups as shown in table 3 the results of the multiple stepwise regressions show a combination of the terrain attributes and associated soil variables significantly controlled the spatial distribution of stcs along the watershed in all the elevation ranges stcs significantly

show the causes of variations in the relative proportion sic and soc contained in soil total carbon stock within the different elevation ranges a high correlation between the sics and terrain attributes could explain the increasing sics socs ratio in the elevation group of 1 000 1 300 masl in comparison with other groups as shown in fig 5 the sics exhibited a significant negative correlation with the spi and slope in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl whereas the correlation between the sics and twi was significant and positive further as shown in table 4 the sics indicated a significant relationship with the exchangeable cations and socs in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl 4 discussion despite the extensive researches about the stcs dynamic within hillslope landscapes the most of researches focused on the relationship between the terrain indices and variability of soc berhe and kleber 2013 dominati et al 2010 fiener et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 van den bygaart et al 2012 however there is no dedicated study regarding how variability in terrain indices can affect soil biochemical factors and processes and thereby vary the quality of stcs i e the relative proportion of soc and sic contained in soil total carbon stock along watershed landscapes based on the results of the multiple regression terrain attributes such as twi spi and slope were found as powerful predictors controlling the variability of stcs along the watershed table 3 these variables similarly affected the quantity of stcs in all the elevation ranges however the soil variables controlling the stcs exhibited significant differences between the elevation groups at the elevation ranges of 1 300 1 500 and 1 500 2 000 masl increasing slope led to decreased topographic wetness index values and subsequently increasing the stream power index values this condition stimulated the significant reduction of stcs because of water transportation and substance migration and subsequently higher soc decomposition lower socs values in table 2 especially in the elevation of 1 500 2 000 masl while in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl area of alluvial fans within the watershed decreasing slope resulted in decreasing the erosive power of surface runoff lower spi values and subsequently increasing water infiltration into the soil higher twi values such changes in the terrain attributes provided a condition for the significant accumulation of the fine fractions and increasing soil moisture stimulating a significant increase in the microbial activity higher mbc and mbn values at the position compared with other positions contrary to the terrain attributes that similarly affected the stcs in all the elevation groups the soil variables controlling the stcs differed between the groups the stcs in the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl exhibited a statistically significant relationship with soc sic and ph whereas at the elevation ranges of 1 300 1 500 and 1 500 2 000 masl the soc and soil moisture were the main factors controlling the quantity of stcs the socs exhibited a significant increase in both the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 and 1 300 1 500 masl whereas the sics socs ratio demonstrated a significant increase only at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl the results of correlation analysis illustrated how the terrain attributes could affect soil biochemical mechanisms causing changes in the relative proportion of sic and soc contained in soil total carbon stock within different watershed positions the quantity of sics demonstrated a significant positive correlation with topographic wetness index at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl fig 5a in contrast this relationship was significant and negative with the stream power index fig 5a and slope fig 5b in the position in the case of soil variables a significant positive relationship was seen between the sics and alkaline cations in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl table 4 whereas this relationship was significant and negative with the socs these findings show the critical role of terrain attributes not only in variation of the soc but also in the creation of inorganic carbon forms along the watershed decreasing the stream power index values and consequently the erosive power of surface runoff provided a condition for the concentration of the fine particle on the elevations of 1 000 1 300 masl compared with other positions these fine particles accumulated on this position together with the carbon dioxide generated by microbial respiration i e organic carbon decomposition resulting from increasing microbial activity higher mbc and mbn values in table 2 bond with alkaline cations such as na mg k and ca variables that demonstrated the greatest rates at the elevations of 1 000 1 300 masl to contribute toward carbonate production thomas et al 2014 the process that caused the negative relationship between sics and socs in this elevation range table 4 these results differ from those of previous studies which claimed that at depositional positions within the hillslope landscape soc accumulation is higher in comparison with erosional positions berhe and kleber 2013 fiener et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 according to our findings although both erosional and depositional positions contributed to soc decomposition the function of the terrain indices on the soil biotic abiotic attributes such as accumulation of fine fraction increasing ph increasing alkaline cations increasing soil moisture and increasing soc at the lower positions provided a condition for the exchange of decomposed soc due to carbon dioxide generated by microbial respiration because of increasing microbial activity to inorganic forms of carbon the condition that could promote the higher storage of soil total carbon within the depositional positions 5 conclusions although it has been proven that erosional and depositional positions within hillslope landscape have the different role in soc stabilization and accumulation our findings demonstrate that the interactions between the terrain indices such as stream power index slope and topographic wetness index and the soil variables controlling the stcs dynamics can affect soil biochemical mechanisms thereby encouraging a change in the relative proportion of inorganic and organic carbon contained in soil total carbon stock within different watershed positions the condition that stimulates the emergence of hot spots of mineral and organic forms of carbon within the landscape based on the findings increasing slope and spi and decreasing twi led to removing organic c and subsequently decreasing the rate of organic c in the elevation ranges of 1 500 2 000 masl conversely decreasing spi and slope and increasing twi provided a condition for increasing organic c in the elevation range of 1 000 1 300 masl although both erosional and depositional positions contributed to soil organic carbon decomposition the interaction between the terrain indices such as slope spi and twi and soil attributes at the elevation ranges of 1 000 1 300 masl could provide an opportunity for the exchange of decomposed soil organic carbon to carbonate production compared with the erosional elevation range the condition that could encourage the higher storage of soil total carbon within the positions with lower slope and spi and higher twi declaration of competing interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

usda agricultural research service ars long term agroecosystem research ltar network initiated in 2011 walbridge and shafer 2011 consists of 18 federal and university agricultural research sites this new network seeks to develop strategies for sustainable intensification of agricultural production under different stressors and expectations kleinman et al 2018 in order to attain this challenging goal the network sites carry out research studies that evaluate current and develop sustainable agricultural production systems conventional tillage is one of the commonly used tillage systems although many farmers also use conservation tillage or no till systems conventional tillage is a land preparation process that uses tillage equipment such as a plow or disc to loosen the soil and incorporate materials at the surface as part of seedbed preparation mechanical manipulation of the soil affects soil properties evapotranspiration et and crop production busari et al 2015 plowing a land surface improves soil porosity and buries crop residues manures and weeds however conventional tillage leads to increased soil erosion and loss of soil organic carbon aggregate stability and moisture west and marland 2002 therefore it is crucial to implement conservation tillage such as no till or reduced tillage for sustainable agricultural production conservation agricultural systems have been adopted in different climatic regions of the world liu et al 2013 marandola et al 2019 vitale et al 2011 showed that 43 2 26 7 and 30 1 of oklahoma s acreage were covered by conventional conservation and reduced tillage respectively adoption of conservation tillage has been recommended to increase infiltration and soil water content and reduce evaporation soil temperature and erosion steiner et al 2015 bonfil et al 1999 in addition conservation tillage can add organic matter build soil fertility and minimize greenhouse gas emissions franzluebbers 2010 however studies have shown mixed results regarding the impacts of conservation tillage on soil and water resources implementation of conservation tillage has been shown to decrease soil erosion by increasing surface residue cornelis et al 2002 west and post 2002 indicated that less intensive cultivation practices could reduce loss of soil organic carbon other studies have shown higher soil water content under conservation tillage compared to conventional tillage system asmamaw 2016 casa and cascio 2008 cornelis et al 2002 liu et al 2013 mitchell et al 2012 however kováč et al 2005 reported that soil moisture content was higher under conventional tillage than conservation tillage while dalmago et al 2004 showed 15 20 higher evaporation in no till systems compared to the conventional system the grazinglands research on agroecosystems and the environment green farm located in central oklahoma was developed in 2014 as part of the ltar network walbridge and shafer 2011 to study the effect of different agricultural practices such as tillage crop rotation and grazing on crop yield water and air quality wagle et al 2018 to quantify the impact of these practices instruments were installed and data are being measured throughout the year data collected from these fields are intended for use in crop hydrologic and water quality models to assess the impacts of different land use and land management systems on crop and livestock production selected soil properties hydrologic components and water quality a major component of hydrologic cycle is et evapotranspiration can be estimated using different hydrological models such as the agricultural policy environmental extender apex williams et al 2008 williams and izaurralde 2005 and soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 the apex model has been used to assess et under dryland tadesse et al 2018 and irrigated farming saleh et al 2018 and tadesse et al 2019 plotkin et al 2013 also evaluated and compared crop yield surface runoff and tile outflow for fields managed by conventional and strip tillage using apex model however there is no available literature on apex modeling studies that compare the impact of tillage practices on et therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine model parameters that affect et simulation in the apex model for winter wheat triticum aestivum l fields managed under conservation and conventional tillage systems and 2 evaluate the ability of apex to simulate et for each of these tillage systems 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites the study sites are located at the green farm of the usda ars grazinglands research laboratory grl in el reno oklahoma fig 1 the green farm is a part of the ltar network which seeks to develop national strategies for sustainable agricultural production the green farm area is divided into five zones northern southern eastern rolling and undulating based on slope and orientation wagle et al 2018 each zone is further sub divided into conventional and conservation till fields two co located grain only winter wheat fields in the eastern zone of the green farm managed under conventional till e2 22 9 ha lat 35 5598 and long 98 0623 and conservation till e1 16 3 ha lat 35 5643 and long 98 0614 systems during the 2016 2017 growing season were used in this study two tillage types were initiated in 2015 a complex of renfrow kirkland silt loams bethany silt loams and norge silt loams is the primary soil type in the study area soil properties of the two study fields are summarized in table 1 most of the soil parameters were analyzed at the usda ars grl el reno ok and oklahoma state university stillwater ok usa before the green farm was divided into paired fields and planted soil cores measuring 30 cm deep by 5 cm in diameter were acquired at ten random locations within each field using a truck mounted probe to measure soil physical and chemical properties a set of baseline soil measurements included ph electrical conductivity ec bulk density ρb and soil texture sand silt and clay after drying the soil cores were re weighed and ρb g cm 3 was determined from core volume and dry weights after determination of ρb the core was ground and sieved to pass through a 2 mm screen to determine soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay and texture ph and ec from the texture and bulk density measurements pedo transfer functions were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat residual volumetric soil water content θr and saturated volumetric soil water content θs to support modeling activities moisture content at wilting point and field capacity was calculated using spaw soil plant air water model saxton and rawls 2006 the conventional till e2 field was tilled three times before planting 13 15 cm deep with mini sweep on june 12 2016 10 13 cm deep by tandem disc on august 13 2016 and 8 10 cm deep by field cultivator on october 15 2016 the conservation till e1 field was left uncultivated from june through october with weed control undertaken by applications of glyphosate 1 54 kg a i ha 1 n phosphonomethyl glycine solution as required during the period of summer fallow and prior to planting a vertical tillage of no greater than 5 cm was implemented at the e1 field on october 17 2016 to manipulate large amounts of residues on the soil surface to improve seed to soil contact for better germination a multi purpose winter wheat variety gallagher was planted at 19 cm row spacing during october 16 18 2016 urea 46 nitrogen was broadcast at the rate of 112 kg ha 1 on september 6 2016 in e2 field and urea ammonium nitrate uan 28 n was applied at the rate of 18 7 kg ha 1 on october 17 2016 in e1 field on the day of planting dry nitrogen and phosphorus 32 23 00 was applied in furrow at the rate of 81 5 kg ha 1 in both fields herbicides chem surf 90 and quelex were applied on march 3 2017 to control broadleaf weeds the fields were harvested for grain during june 10 12 2017 2 2 weather data daily weather data required by the apex model include solar radiation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed all the daily weather data inputs were collected from the el reno mesonet station 2015 to 2018 located within grl mcpherson et al 2007 however some missing weather data such as wind speed were also collected from the nearby mesonet stations including kingfisher minco hinton watonga fort cobb and chickasha fig 2 shows annual patterns of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature in 2016 and 2017 the weather data were processed and formatted for apex version 0806 the study area received 631 mm rainfall in 2016 and 1273 mm in 2017 the 30 year normal 1981 2010 annual temperature and rainfall for the study area is 15 c and 925 mm respectively wagle et al 2018 during the 2016 2017 wheat growing season october 2016 may 2017 the study area received a total rainfall of 517 mm 9 lower than the 30 year mean of 567 mm for the same period overall severe dry periods were not observed during the entire growing season indicating a good growing season for winter wheat wagle et al 2019 2 3 measured et and crop growth daily et was measured in both fields using eddy covariance ec towers starting from october 2016 after planting wheat the ec systems comprised of an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 rs licor lincoln ne usa and a 3 d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were installed near the center of fields at a fixed height of a 2 5 m above the ground the ec measurements were collected at 10 hz frequency raw ec data were processed to calculate 30 min et values using the eddypro software licor lincoln ne details on ec measurements data processing screening and gap filling of et data are presented in previous papers wagle et al 2018 2019 canopy height canopy cover percentage leaf area index lai and aboveground dry biomass were collected at 16 day intervals that coincided with landsat overpass dates throughout the growing season the samples were taken from five randomly located positions in both fields the lai was measured using a lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer licor inc lincoln ne usa and biomass samples were collected destructively within 0 5 0 5 m2 quadrats and clipped to about 1 cm above the soil surface crop growth and grain yields were observed at the level of maximum potential due to well distributed good rainfall throughout the growing season maximum lai reached approximately 7 5 m2 m 2 for e1 and 7 0 m2 m 2 for e2 during late march 2017 table 3 maximum dry aboveground biomass 1 3 kg m 2 equivalent to 13 t ha 1 in both fields was observed in late april canopy coverage was 95 and fairly constant from march to mid april and declined afterwards due to crop senescence average grain yield approximated 4 86 and 3 53 t ha 1 respectively for e1 and e2 fields the average grain yield for winter wheat in oklahoma for the same year was 2 7 t ha 1 usda nass 2018 seasonality of measured et corresponded well with the seasonality of wheat growth the et rates increased with increasing wheat growth declined and remained at low levels during winter and increased again after mid january with growing crop figs 3 and 5 daily et reached 6 mm during peak growth in may in both fields monthly et values ranged from 25 30 mm in winter to 110 mm in may figs 4 and 6 the magnitudes seasonal dynamics and monthly sums of measured et were identical in both wheat fields due to uniform canopy stands wagle et al 2019 seasonal from doy 306 in 2016 to doy 163 in 2017 cumulative et was 473 and 481 mm for conventional and conservation till fields respectively however the conventional till field had 10 higher et 43 mm vs 39 mm for the first month after wheat plantation most likely due to more evaporative loss from tilled filled before the field was covered by wheat canopies tillage exposes the soil to direct sunlight and this increases the rate of evaporative water loss during early stage of crop growth 2 4 model setup in this study the apex model version 0806 was used apex model inputs include weather data soil type agronomic practices and elevation data the apex project was built using the nutrient tracking tool ntt user interface saleh et al 2012 each field was delineated the ntt map navigation tool using known location coordinates after each field was delineated all model inputs were selected and populated the agronomic practices included in the management were tillage method crop type planting rate and date fertilizer type and amount harvest date and others table 2 the soil map was used from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo usda nrcs however the measured soil parameters in table 1 were used to modify the soil input obtained from suurgo database for the apex modeling in addition the slope parameter in apex sub subarea was modified using measured data from the study area some crop parameters such as harvest index hi maximum potential leaf area index dmla fraction of growing season when leaf area declines dlai first point on optimal leaf area development curve dlap1 and second point on optimal leaf area development curve dlap2 were also modified using measured data and preliminary analysis table 2 the potential heat unit phu or growing degree day gdd for winter wheat in the study area used for modeling was 1852 computed using daily minimum and maximum temperatures all weather inputs for the study area were collected from el reno mesonet station and formatted for the apex model the penman monteith monteith 1965 method was used to simulate et in this study as it was considered the best tadesse et al 2018 2 5 sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive parameters for adjustment during the calibration process a global sensitivity analysis yuan et al 2015 was carried out using the apexsensun uncertainty and sensitivity analysis software package talebizadeh et al 2018 the sensitivity of these parameters on et simulation was determined based on their impact on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 performance measures the pbias is used to evaluate model simulation performance of et with respect to the average magnitude for the entire period of the model run whereas nse is used to evaluate the ability of the model to simulate the temporal variability of et during the simulation period because the temporal variability and average long term variability of et were important in this study parameters determined to be sensitive to either of these performance measures were selected initially 47 control apexcont and global parm file parameters which impact the variability of simulated et were used in this study two thousand model simulation runs were made for the sensitivity analysis and parameter selection parameter sensitivity ranking was based on the standardized regression coefficient src method the parameters with src 0 05 nelson et al 2017 were considered sensitive in this study after selecting sensitive parameters all other parameters were reset to their respective default apex value steglich and williams 2013 2 6 calibration after sensitive parameters were identified and selected the model was calibrated at the daily and monthly time scales using measured lai data et and crop yield ten thousand model simulations were completed covering the full range of the selected sensitive parameters and the default values for the non sensitive parameters both graphical and statistical analyses were used for the model evaluation the model runs with nse values greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 2015 and less than 10 pbias moriasi et al 2015 were selected in addition to preset evaluation criteria for the selected performance measures calibrations were also constrained such that the simulated lai and crop yield values were realistic and representative of the study fields simulated crop yields that were within 25 of average measured values for the simulation period were applied to select the final model runs the average measured grain yields for wheat in 2017 were 3 53 t ha 1 and 4 86 t ha 1 for e1 conservation tillage and e2 conventional tillage respectively the simulated lai values that met these criteria were compared with the measured lai values for both the conventional and conservation tillage systems table 3 in addition simulated biomass values for models that met abovementioned criteria were compared with the measured biomass values for both the conventional and conservation tillage systems the coefficient of determination r2 was also calculated to compare the simulated and measured et at a biweekly time step 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 conservation tillage sensitivity analysis results for the conservation tillage field are presented in table 4 with respect to the statistical model performance measure pbias or nse used there were differences in the number of sensitive parameters and their rankings the total number of sensitive parameters for the conservation tillage was 10 there were 8 and 6 sensitive parameters based on nse and pbias respectively this implies that more parameters need to be included in the calibration process to capture temporal variability of et during the simulation period soil evaporation plant cover factor root growth soil strength soil evaporation coefficient and winter dormancy were sensitive with respect to both temporal variability and long term average simulation of et among the sensitive parameters that were unique to temporal variability three were related to curve number that controls the surface runoff infiltration process expand cn retention parameter runoff cn int abs and runoff cn adj parameter and the root temperature stress exponent table 4 the two parameters that were unique and sensitive to simulation of long term average et were maximum rain intercept and rain intercept coefficient both related to rainfall 3 1 2 conventional tillage sensitivity analysis results for the conventional tillage field are presented in table 5 the total number of sensitive parameters for the conventional tillage field was 8 which is lower than the number for the conservation tillage field 10 the number of sensitive parameters based on nse and pbias were 6 and 7 respectively root growth soil strength soil evaporation plant cover winter dormancy water storage n and maximum rain intercept were sensitive to both long term average et and its temporal variability the only sensitive parameter that was unique to temporal variability of et was soil evaporation coefficient table 5 the two parameters unique to simulation of long term average et were water storage residue coefficient and rain intercept coefficient in comparison between conventional and conservation tillage fields parameters related to curve number were not sensitive to simulation of et by apex in the conventional field these results can be attributed to increased surface runoff and decreased infiltration in conventional tillage field feyereisen et al 2008 endale et al 2010 volkmer 2014 which reduces availability of water for et in the field 3 1 3 comparison of sensitivity of parameters in conservation and conventional tillage systems soil evaporation plant cover factor root growth soil strength soil evaporation coefficient winter dormancy maximum rain intercept and rain intercept coefficient were sensitive to simulation in both conservation tillage and conventional tillage wheat systems tables 4 and 5 curve number was sensitive only in conservation tillage due to increased infiltration that stores more water within the field soil profile for plant growth and hence transpiration tillage practices have an impact on the surface runoff and soil water infiltration processes hangen eta l 2002 feyereisen et al 2008 endale et al 2010 volkmer 2014 according to hangen et al 2002 water retention capacity increased in silty soils managed by conservation tillage feyereisen et al 2008 conducted a study to estimate cns for a cotton peanut rotation under conventional and strip tillage st methods for growing and dormant seasons their results showed that st tillage operations resulted in 5 to 6 cn values lower than those in the conventional sites combining both growing and dormant periods of the year which implies that st resulted in less surface runoff and more infiltration in a 2 7 ha catchment managed under no till in watkinsville georgia the mean measured cn value was 36 compared with the cn values from standard nrcs tables for the conventionally tilled conditions of approximately 60 to 70 endale et al 2010 the lower cn numbers were supported by low surface runoff due to higher infiltration under conservation tillage endale et al 2010 in another study volkmer 2014 found that on average the cn on no till sites were 5 points lower than the tilled sites indicating no till sites had less runoff than the tilled sites the only parameters that were unique to et simulation in the conventional tillage wheat field were water storage n and groundwater storage threshold with higher surface runoff and consequent less infiltration the availability of water within the soil profile for et depends on the soil s ability to hold water water storage n leaching represents the fraction of soil porosity that interacts with percolating water as n leaching occurs while groundwater storage threshold is the fraction of groundwater storage that initiates return flow return flow which takes water away from the soil profile will not occur unless the fraction of maximum groundwater storage is greater than this parameter both percolation and return flow processes determine how much water is stored within the soil profile 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 conservation tillage the model simulated daily et satisfactorily moriasi et al 2007 with nse value of 0 58 during the growing season but overpredicted daily et in march and early may fig 3 the r2 for the 14 day et running average was 0 95 fig 4 the monthly nse of the calibrated model was 0 98 indicating a good agreement between simulated and measured monthly et fig 4 the pbias values for the et simulation were 2 and 3 at daily and monthly time scales respectively also simulated biomass values matched generally well nse 0 91 pbias 17 r2 0 96 with the measured biomass values fig 5 3 2 2 conventional tillage during the growing season the apex model satisfactorily simulated daily et as indicated by the nse value of 0 66 moriasi et al 2007 however simulated daily et during december and may exhibited overprediction while it underpredicted daily et during the month of february fig 6 the r2 for the 14 day et running average was 0 94 fig 7 indicating a reasonable agreement between biweekly simulated and measured et the monthly nse of the calibrated model was 0 96 which also indicates a good agreement between simulated and measured monthly et fig 7 the pbias value for the et simulation in the conventional tillage field was 1 at both daily and monthly temporal scales in addition simulated daily biomass closely matched measured biomass values nse 0 91 pbias 21 r2 0 99 fig 5 based on the statistical and graphical performance measures of the calibrated models there were no major differences in the ability of the apex model to simulate et at different temporal scales in conservation and conventional tillage practices this result indicates that if well calibrated using appropriate sensitive parameters apex can simulate well the et in either of these tillage operations overall daily biomass estimation using apex model also showed good correspondence with the measured biomass values in both farming systems however further research using multiyear data and crop type is needed in order to fully investigate the impact of tillage operation on et simulation performance of the apex model 4 conclusions tillage system had an impact on the number and type of the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model parameters sensitive for simulation of evapotranspiration et the total number of sensitive parameters for the conservation and conventional tillage were 10 and 8 respectively soil evaporation plant cover factor root growth soil strength soil evaporation coefficient winter dormancy maximum rain intercept and rain intercept coefficient were sensitive in simulation of et in both conservation tillage and conventional tillage wheat systems the sensitive parameters that were unique to conservation tillage field included three parameters related to curve number that controls the surface runoff infiltration process and the root temperature stress exponent the sensitive parameters unique to simulation of et in the conventional tillage wheat field were water storage n and groundwater storage threshold with higher surface runoff and thereby less infiltration availability of water within the soil profile for et depends on the soil s ability to hold water both of these parameters control the percolation and return flow processes which determine how much water is stored within the soil profile this study indicates that sensitive parameters published in literature for a particular tillage operation in a given study area cannot be adopted and used as model calibration parameters it is therefore essential to perform a sensitivity analysis for study areas with different tillage management practices to determine appropriate parameters for the calibration process overall the daily et simulation had good nash sutcliffe efficiency nse performance values in both tillage systems the nse for the simulated monthly et of the calibrated model was 0 98 and 0 96 for conservation and conventional tillage fields respectively indicating that apex simulated the temporal variability of et during the simulation period well in both fields the percent bias pbias values for the et simulation were 2 and 3 at daily and monthly time scales respectively for the conservation tillage field and 1 at both daily and monthly temporal scales for the conventional tillage field this indicates that the average simulated et values were within 3 of the average measured et values for both conservation and conventional tillage fields the nse for the simulated daily biomass of the calibrated model was 0 91 for both conservation and conventional tillage fields indicating that apex simulated the temporal variability of daily biomass during the simulation period well in both fields the pbias values for daily biomass simulation were 21 and 17 for conventional and conservation tillage fields respectively which implies that apex simulated daily biomass within 25 of measured values in both tillage systems these results indicate that a well calibrated apex model using appropriate sensitive parameters can simulate et and biomass satisfactorily in both tillage systems there were no major differences in ability of the apex model to simulate et at different temporal scales in conservation and conventional tillage practices however further research using multiyear data and crop type is needed in order to fully investigate the impact of tillage operation on et and

usda agricultural research service ars long term agroecosystem research ltar network initiated in 2011 walbridge and shafer 2011 consists of 18 federal and university agricultural research sites this new network seeks to develop strategies for sustainable intensification of agricultural production under different stressors and expectations kleinman et al 2018 in order to attain this challenging goal the network sites carry out research studies that evaluate current and develop sustainable agricultural production systems conventional tillage is one of the commonly used tillage systems although many farmers also use conservation tillage or no till systems conventional tillage is a land preparation process that uses tillage equipment such as a plow or disc to loosen the soil and incorporate materials at the surface as part of seedbed preparation mechanical manipulation of the soil affects soil properties evapotranspiration et and crop production busari et al 2015 plowing a land surface improves soil porosity and buries crop residues manures and weeds however conventional tillage leads to increased soil erosion and loss of soil organic carbon aggregate stability and moisture west and marland 2002 therefore it is crucial to implement conservation tillage such as no till or reduced tillage for sustainable agricultural production conservation agricultural systems have been adopted in different climatic regions of the world liu et al 2013 marandola et al 2019 vitale et al 2011 showed that 43 2 26 7 and 30 1 of oklahoma s acreage were covered by conventional conservation and reduced tillage respectively adoption of conservation tillage has been recommended to increase infiltration and soil water content and reduce evaporation soil temperature and erosion steiner et al 2015 bonfil et al 1999 in addition conservation tillage can add organic matter build soil fertility and minimize greenhouse gas emissions franzluebbers 2010 however studies have shown mixed results regarding the impacts of conservation tillage on soil and water resources implementation of conservation tillage has been shown to decrease soil erosion by increasing surface residue cornelis et al 2002 west and post 2002 indicated that less intensive cultivation practices could reduce loss of soil organic carbon other studies have shown higher soil water content under conservation tillage compared to conventional tillage system asmamaw 2016 casa and cascio 2008 cornelis et al 2002 liu et al 2013 mitchell et al 2012 however kováč et al 2005 reported that soil moisture content was higher under conventional tillage than conservation tillage while dalmago et al 2004 showed 15 20 higher evaporation in no till systems compared to the conventional system the grazinglands research on agroecosystems and the environment green farm located in central oklahoma was developed in 2014 as part of the ltar network walbridge and shafer 2011 to study the effect of different agricultural practices such as tillage crop rotation and grazing on crop yield water and air quality wagle et al 2018 to quantify the impact of these practices instruments were installed and data are being measured throughout the year data collected from these fields are intended for use in crop hydrologic and water quality models to assess the impacts of different land use and land management systems on crop and livestock production selected soil properties hydrologic components and water quality a major component of hydrologic cycle is et evapotranspiration can be estimated using different hydrological models such as the agricultural policy environmental extender apex williams et al 2008 williams and izaurralde 2005 and soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 the apex model has been used to assess et under dryland tadesse et al 2018 and irrigated farming saleh et al 2018 and tadesse et al 2019 plotkin et al 2013 also evaluated and compared crop yield surface runoff and tile outflow for fields managed by conventional and strip tillage using apex model however there is no available literature on apex modeling studies that compare the impact of tillage practices on et therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine model parameters that affect et simulation in the apex model for winter wheat triticum aestivum l fields managed under conservation and conventional tillage systems and 2 evaluate the ability of apex to simulate et for each of these tillage systems 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites the study sites are located at the green farm of the usda ars grazinglands research laboratory grl in el reno oklahoma fig 1 the green farm is a part of the ltar network which seeks to develop national strategies for sustainable agricultural production the green farm area is divided into five zones northern southern eastern rolling and undulating based on slope and orientation wagle et al 2018 each zone is further sub divided into conventional and conservation till fields two co located grain only winter wheat fields in the eastern zone of the green farm managed under conventional till e2 22 9 ha lat 35 5598 and long 98 0623 and conservation till e1 16 3 ha lat 35 5643 and long 98 0614 systems during the 2016 2017 growing season were used in this study two tillage types were initiated in 2015 a complex of renfrow kirkland silt loams bethany silt loams and norge silt loams is the primary soil type in the study area soil properties of the two study fields are summarized in table 1 most of the soil parameters were analyzed at the usda ars grl el reno ok and oklahoma state university stillwater ok usa before the green farm was divided into paired fields and planted soil cores measuring 30 cm deep by 5 cm in diameter were acquired at ten random locations within each field using a truck mounted probe to measure soil physical and chemical properties a set of baseline soil measurements included ph electrical conductivity ec bulk density ρb and soil texture sand silt and clay after drying the soil cores were re weighed and ρb g cm 3 was determined from core volume and dry weights after determination of ρb the core was ground and sieved to pass through a 2 mm screen to determine soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay and texture ph and ec from the texture and bulk density measurements pedo transfer functions were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat residual volumetric soil water content θr and saturated volumetric soil water content θs to support modeling activities moisture content at wilting point and field capacity was calculated using spaw soil plant air water model saxton and rawls 2006 the conventional till e2 field was tilled three times before planting 13 15 cm deep with mini sweep on june 12 2016 10 13 cm deep by tandem disc on august 13 2016 and 8 10 cm deep by field cultivator on october 15 2016 the conservation till e1 field was left uncultivated from june through october with weed control undertaken by applications of glyphosate 1 54 kg a i ha 1 n phosphonomethyl glycine solution as required during the period of summer fallow and prior to planting a vertical tillage of no greater than 5 cm was implemented at the e1 field on october 17 2016 to manipulate large amounts of residues on the soil surface to improve seed to soil contact for better germination a multi purpose winter wheat variety gallagher was planted at 19 cm row spacing during october 16 18 2016 urea 46 nitrogen was broadcast at the rate of 112 kg ha 1 on september 6 2016 in e2 field and urea ammonium nitrate uan 28 n was applied at the rate of 18 7 kg ha 1 on october 17 2016 in e1 field on the day of planting dry nitrogen and phosphorus 32 23 00 was applied in furrow at the rate of 81 5 kg ha 1 in both fields herbicides chem surf 90 and quelex were applied on march 3 2017 to control broadleaf weeds the fields were harvested for grain during june 10 12 2017 2 2 weather data daily weather data required by the apex model include solar radiation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed all the daily weather data inputs were collected from the el reno mesonet station 2015 to 2018 located within grl mcpherson et al 2007 however some missing weather data such as wind speed were also collected from the nearby mesonet stations including kingfisher minco hinton watonga fort cobb and chickasha fig 2 shows annual patterns of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature in 2016 and 2017 the weather data were processed and formatted for apex version 0806 the study area received 631 mm rainfall in 2016 and 1273 mm in 2017 the 30 year normal 1981 2010 annual temperature and rainfall for the study area is 15 c and 925 mm respectively wagle et al 2018 during the 2016 2017 wheat growing season october 2016 may 2017 the study area received a total rainfall of 517 mm 9 lower than the 30 year mean of 567 mm for the same period overall severe dry periods were not observed during the entire growing season indicating a good growing season for winter wheat wagle et al 2019 2 3 measured et and crop growth daily et was measured in both fields using eddy covariance ec towers starting from october 2016 after planting wheat the ec systems comprised of an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 rs licor lincoln ne usa and a 3 d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were installed near the center of fields at a fixed height of a 2 5 m above the ground the ec measurements were collected at 10 hz frequency raw ec data were processed to calculate 30 min et values using the eddypro software licor lincoln ne details on ec measurements data processing screening and gap filling of et data are presented in previous papers wagle et al 2018 2019 canopy height canopy cover percentage leaf area index lai and aboveground dry biomass were collected at 16 day intervals that coincided with landsat overpass dates throughout the growing season the samples were taken from five randomly located positions in both fields the lai was measured using a lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer licor inc lincoln ne usa and biomass samples were collected destructively within 0 5 0 5 m2 quadrats and clipped to about 1 cm above the soil surface crop growth and grain yields were observed at the level of maximum potential due to well distributed good rainfall throughout the growing season maximum lai reached approximately 7 5 m2 m 2 for e1 and 7 0 m2 m 2 for e2 during late march 2017 table 3 maximum dry aboveground biomass 1 3 kg m 2 equivalent to 13 t ha 1 in both fields was observed in late april canopy coverage was 95 and fairly constant from march to mid april and declined afterwards due to crop senescence average grain yield approximated 4 86 and 3 53 t ha 1 respectively for e1 and e2 fields the average grain yield for winter wheat in oklahoma for the same year was 2 7 t ha 1 usda nass 2018 seasonality of measured et corresponded well with the seasonality of wheat growth the et rates increased with increasing wheat growth declined and remained at low levels during winter and increased again after mid january with growing crop figs 3 and 5 daily et reached 6 mm during peak growth in may in both fields monthly et values ranged from 25 30 mm in winter to 110 mm in may figs 4 and 6 the magnitudes seasonal dynamics and monthly sums of measured et were identical in both wheat fields due to uniform canopy stands wagle et al 2019 seasonal from doy 306 in 2016 to doy 163 in 2017 cumulative et was 473 and 481 mm for conventional and conservation till fields respectively however the conventional till field had 10 higher et 43 mm vs 39 mm for the first month after wheat plantation most likely due to more evaporative loss from tilled filled before the field was covered by wheat canopies tillage exposes the soil to direct sunlight and this increases the rate of evaporative water loss during early stage of crop growth 2 4 model setup in this study the apex model version 0806 was used apex model inputs include weather data soil type agronomic practices and elevation data the apex project was built using the nutrient tracking tool ntt user interface saleh et al 2012 each field was delineated the ntt map navigation tool using known location coordinates after each field was delineated all model inputs were selected and populated the agronomic practices included in the management were tillage method crop type planting rate and date fertilizer type and amount harvest date and others table 2 the soil map was used from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo usda nrcs however the measured soil parameters in table 1 were used to modify the soil input obtained from suurgo database for the apex modeling in addition the slope parameter in apex sub subarea was modified using measured data from the study area some crop parameters such as harvest index hi maximum potential leaf area index dmla fraction of growing season when leaf area declines dlai first point on optimal leaf area development curve dlap1 and second point on optimal leaf area development curve dlap2 were also modified using measured data and preliminary analysis table 2 the potential heat unit phu or growing degree day gdd for winter wheat in the study area used for modeling was 1852 computed using daily minimum and maximum temperatures all weather inputs for the study area were collected from el reno mesonet station and formatted for the apex model the penman monteith monteith 1965 method was used to simulate et in this study as it was considered the best tadesse et al 2018 2 5 sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive parameters for adjustment during the calibration process a global sensitivity analysis yuan et al 2015 was carried out using the apexsensun uncertainty and sensitivity analysis software package talebizadeh et al 2018 the sensitivity of these parameters on et simulation was determined based on their impact on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 performance measures the pbias is used to evaluate model simulation performance of et with respect to the average magnitude for the entire period of the model run whereas nse is used to evaluate the ability of the model to simulate the temporal variability of et during the simulation period because the temporal variability and average long term variability of et were important in this study parameters determined to be sensitive to either of these performance measures were selected initially 47 control apexcont and global parm file parameters which impact the variability of simulated et were used in this study two thousand model simulation runs were made for the sensitivity analysis and parameter selection parameter sensitivity ranking was based on the standardized regression coefficient src method the parameters with src 0 05 nelson et al 2017 were considered sensitive in this study after selecting sensitive parameters all other parameters were reset to their respective default apex value steglich and williams 2013 2 6 calibration after sensitive parameters were identified and selected the model was calibrated at the daily and monthly time scales using measured lai data et and crop yield ten thousand model simulations were completed covering the full range of the selected sensitive parameters and the default values for the non sensitive parameters both graphical and statistical analyses were used for the model evaluation the model runs with nse values greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 2015 and less than 10 pbias moriasi et al 2015 were selected in addition to preset evaluation criteria for the selected performance measures calibrations were also constrained such that the simulated lai and crop yield values were realistic and representative of the study fields simulated crop yields that were within 25 of average measured values for the simulation period were applied to select the final model runs the average measured grain yields for wheat in 2017 were 3 53 t ha 1 and 4 86 t ha 1 for e1 conservation tillage and e2 conventional tillage respectively the simulated lai values that met these criteria were compared with the measured lai values for both the conventional and conservation tillage systems table 3 in addition simulated biomass values for models that met abovementioned criteria were compared with the measured biomass values for both the conventional and conservation tillage systems the coefficient of determination r2 was also calculated to compare the simulated and measured et at a biweekly time step 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis 3 1 1 conservation tillage sensitivity analysis results for the conservation tillage field are presented in table 4 with respect to the statistical model performance measure pbias or nse used there were differences in the number of sensitive parameters and their rankings the total number of sensitive parameters for the conservation tillage was 10 there were 8 and 6 sensitive parameters based on nse and pbias respectively this implies that more parameters need to be included in the calibration process to capture temporal variability of et during the simulation period soil evaporation plant cover factor root growth soil strength soil evaporation coefficient and winter dormancy were sensitive with respect to both temporal variability and long term average simulation of et among the sensitive parameters that were unique to temporal variability three were related to curve number that controls the surface runoff infiltration process expand cn retention parameter runoff cn int abs and runoff cn adj parameter and the root temperature stress exponent table 4 the two parameters that were unique and sensitive to simulation of long term average et were maximum rain intercept and rain intercept coefficient both related to rainfall 3 1 2 conventional tillage sensitivity analysis results for the conventional tillage field are presented in table 5 the total number of sensitive parameters for the conventional tillage field was 8 which is lower than the number for the conservation tillage field 10 the number of sensitive parameters based on nse and pbias were 6 and 7 respectively root growth soil strength soil evaporation plant cover winter dormancy water storage n and maximum rain intercept were sensitive to both long term average et and its temporal variability the only sensitive parameter that was unique to temporal variability of et was soil evaporation coefficient table 5 the two parameters unique to simulation of long term average et were water storage residue coefficient and rain intercept coefficient in comparison between conventional and conservation tillage fields parameters related to curve number were not sensitive to simulation of et by apex in the conventional field these results can be attributed to increased surface runoff and decreased infiltration in conventional tillage field feyereisen et al 2008 endale et al 2010 volkmer 2014 which reduces availability of water for et in the field 3 1 3 comparison of sensitivity of parameters in conservation and conventional tillage systems soil evaporation plant cover factor root growth soil strength soil evaporation coefficient winter dormancy maximum rain intercept and rain intercept coefficient were sensitive to simulation in both conservation tillage and conventional tillage wheat systems tables 4 and 5 curve number was sensitive only in conservation tillage due to increased infiltration that stores more water within the field soil profile for plant growth and hence transpiration tillage practices have an impact on the surface runoff and soil water infiltration processes hangen eta l 2002 feyereisen et al 2008 endale et al 2010 volkmer 2014 according to hangen et al 2002 water retention capacity increased in silty soils managed by conservation tillage feyereisen et al 2008 conducted a study to estimate cns for a cotton peanut rotation under conventional and strip tillage st methods for growing and dormant seasons their results showed that st tillage operations resulted in 5 to 6 cn values lower than those in the conventional sites combining both growing and dormant periods of the year which implies that st resulted in less surface runoff and more infiltration in a 2 7 ha catchment managed under no till in watkinsville georgia the mean measured cn value was 36 compared with the cn values from standard nrcs tables for the conventionally tilled conditions of approximately 60 to 70 endale et al 2010 the lower cn numbers were supported by low surface runoff due to higher infiltration under conservation tillage endale et al 2010 in another study volkmer 2014 found that on average the cn on no till sites were 5 points lower than the tilled sites indicating no till sites had less runoff than the tilled sites the only parameters that were unique to et simulation in the conventional tillage wheat field were water storage n and groundwater storage threshold with higher surface runoff and consequent less infiltration the availability of water within the soil profile for et depends on the soil s ability to hold water water storage n leaching represents the fraction of soil porosity that interacts with percolating water as n leaching occurs while groundwater storage threshold is the fraction of groundwater storage that initiates return flow return flow which takes water away from the soil profile will not occur unless the fraction of maximum groundwater storage is greater than this parameter both percolation and return flow processes determine how much water is stored within the soil profile 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 conservation tillage the model simulated daily et satisfactorily moriasi et al 2007 with nse value of 0 58 during the growing season but overpredicted daily et in march and early may fig 3 the r2 for the 14 day et running average was 0 95 fig 4 the monthly nse of the calibrated model was 0 98 indicating a good agreement between simulated and measured monthly et fig 4 the pbias values for the et simulation were 2 and 3 at daily and monthly time scales respectively also simulated biomass values matched generally well nse 0 91 pbias 17 r2 0 96 with the measured biomass values fig 5 3 2 2 conventional tillage during the growing season the apex model satisfactorily simulated daily et as indicated by the nse value of 0 66 moriasi et al 2007 however simulated daily et during december and may exhibited overprediction while it underpredicted daily et during the month of february fig 6 the r2 for the 14 day et running average was 0 94 fig 7 indicating a reasonable agreement between biweekly simulated and measured et the monthly nse of the calibrated model was 0 96 which also indicates a good agreement between simulated and measured monthly et fig 7 the pbias value for the et simulation in the conventional tillage field was 1 at both daily and monthly temporal scales in addition simulated daily biomass closely matched measured biomass values nse 0 91 pbias 21 r2 0 99 fig 5 based on the statistical and graphical performance measures of the calibrated models there were no major differences in the ability of the apex model to simulate et at different temporal scales in conservation and conventional tillage practices this result indicates that if well calibrated using appropriate sensitive parameters apex can simulate well the et in either of these tillage operations overall daily biomass estimation using apex model also showed good correspondence with the measured biomass values in both farming systems however further research using multiyear data and crop type is needed in order to fully investigate the impact of tillage operation on et simulation performance of the apex model 4 conclusions tillage system had an impact on the number and type of the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model parameters sensitive for simulation of evapotranspiration et the total number of sensitive parameters for the conservation and conventional tillage were 10 and 8 respectively soil evaporation plant cover factor root growth soil strength soil evaporation coefficient winter dormancy maximum rain intercept and rain intercept coefficient were sensitive in simulation of et in both conservation tillage and conventional tillage wheat systems the sensitive parameters that were unique to conservation tillage field included three parameters related to curve number that controls the surface runoff infiltration process and the root temperature stress exponent the sensitive parameters unique to simulation of et in the conventional tillage wheat field were water storage n and groundwater storage threshold with higher surface runoff and thereby less infiltration availability of water within the soil profile for et depends on the soil s ability to hold water both of these parameters control the percolation and return flow processes which determine how much water is stored within the soil profile this study indicates that sensitive parameters published in literature for a particular tillage operation in a given study area cannot be adopted and used as model calibration parameters it is therefore essential to perform a sensitivity analysis for study areas with different tillage management practices to determine appropriate parameters for the calibration process overall the daily et simulation had good nash sutcliffe efficiency nse performance values in both tillage systems the nse for the simulated monthly et of the calibrated model was 0 98 and 0 96 for conservation and conventional tillage fields respectively indicating that apex simulated the temporal variability of et during the simulation period well in both fields the percent bias pbias values for the et simulation were 2 and 3 at daily and monthly time scales respectively for the conservation tillage field and 1 at both daily and monthly temporal scales for the conventional tillage field this indicates that the average simulated et values were within 3 of the average measured et values for both conservation and conventional tillage fields the nse for the simulated daily biomass of the calibrated model was 0 91 for both conservation and conventional tillage fields indicating that apex simulated the temporal variability of daily biomass during the simulation period well in both fields the pbias values for daily biomass simulation were 21 and 17 for conventional and conservation tillage fields respectively which implies that apex simulated daily biomass within 25 of measured values in both tillage systems these results indicate that a well calibrated apex model using appropriate sensitive parameters can simulate et and biomass satisfactorily in both tillage systems there were no major differences in ability of the apex model to simulate et at different temporal scales in conservation and conventional tillage practices however further research using multiyear data and crop type is needed in order to fully investigate the impact of tillage operation on et and

1027,the importance of water resources forecasting is growing due to changes in precipitation caused by climate change and with hydrologic models are being used mainly for water resource management calibration and validation through adjustment of parameters are important processes for increasing the reliability of the application of hydrologic models this is different from flow rates that can be estimated in real time through level flow rating curve the reliability of data depends on observation therefore using data with a short can increase the reliability of the results in this study daily loads of suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were generated using three statistical methods general method perfect prognosis method and model output statistics mos fitness of calibration and validation of hydrologic models were then evaluated using correlation r2 and anomaly analysis when these three methods were applied to the geumho and hwang rivers perfect prognosis method and the mos method showed better results than the general method for the geumho river correlation and r2 improved by up to 0 08 for ss 0 04 for tn and 0 12 for tp for hwang river results improved by up to 27 for ss 12 for tn and 15 for tp when the anomaly analysis results were represented by correlation and r2 they showed significant improvements of up to 0 86 in ss 0 62 in tn and 0 57 in tp for the geumho river and up to 0 58 in ss 0 49 in tn and 0 49 in tp for the hwang river the statistical method suggested in this study can be applied when observation for the water quality data is long or data are insufficient keywords swat general method perfect prognosis method model output statistics mos anomaly analysis 1 introduction since the 2000s the frequency and scale of extreme climatic events such as torrential rains and droughts have been increasing kim et al 2017 consequently it is becoming difficult to stably secure and manage water resources due to fluctuations in precipitation and rainfall intensity kim et al 2017 kim et al 2018 furthermore nonpoint source pollution is worsening in watersheds that are strongly affected by rainfall runoff hydrologic models are often used to examine watershed hydrology nonpoint pollution sources and water quality calibration and validation of hydrologic models is generally performed by calibrating parameters for observed data over a long period of time and applying these parameters to other periods kim and kim 2017 securing flow and water quality data especially data with short investigation cycles over a long time period kim et al 2020 is important to enhance the calibration and validation accuracy of hydrologic models the lack of water quality data makes it difficult to determine the exact water quality during rainfall due to the water quality survey interval me 2019 therefore hydrologic models are often used to obtain continuous data the calibration and validation of model parameters is essential for reliable a research of watershed water resources and water quality changes using hydrologic models many studies on calibration and validation have been conducted by estimating optimal parameters using data without continuity or by using optimization methods jung et al 2009 wang et al 2016 koppa et al 2019 kumarasamy and belmont 2018 ledergerber et al 2019 parker et al 2019 among studies conducted in other countries brighenti et al 2019 used the swat model to compare sequential calibration and simultaneous calibration methods for flow rate and suspended solids ss at two or more points of the watershed using the nash sutcliffe ns and king gupta efficiency kge indices the result of the ns index was better for sequential calibration whereas the result of the kge index was better for simultaneous calibration tou et al 2018 analyzed the snow related parameters in the swat model for the alpine mountains in northeastern italy through multi and single objective processes and compared the results between different methods among studies conducted in korea kim et al 2016 used the numeric integration ni method to calculate the ss pollution load using flow rate and ss pollution data measured in eight day intervals and proposed a method of estimating the nonpoint pollution load kim and kim 2017 selected parameters sensitive to drought using the swat model and compared the results before and after an intensive calibration for drought years using r2 rmse and nse indices the result showed improvements as compared to the general calibration the applicability of a hydrologic model to water quality calibration and validation was evaluated in this study by generating continuous load data through this rating curve 2 methods 2 1 study area the watersheds for this study were selected from those along the nakdong river which has most dams 10 multi purpose and 10 for water supply and weirs 8 among the four major rivers in korea among the tributaries of the nakdong river we selected the geumho river and hwang river the geumho river flows through the middle of a city and maintains a constant flow rate and water quality from the water supply dam in the upstream areas and effluent from sewage treatment plants in the midstream and downstream areas in the hwang river the flow rate is adjusted by the hapcheon dam in the upstream region and there are no large pollution sources in the watershed fig 1 the geumho river is the first tributary located in the middle of the nakdong river and many studies have been conducted on long term changes in water quality in this watershed jung et al 2015 jung et al 2016 moreover many hydrologic models have been used to predict runoff or simulate nonpoint pollution sources or soil runoff kim et al 2018 kim et al 2015 cha et al 2017 choi et al 2011 kwon and choi 2017 choi et al 2017 and hwang et al 2010 conducted research to estimate watershed and sediment runoff using a hydrologic model 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 model description for water quality simulations we selected the soil and water assessment tool swat model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture the swat model is a physical based semi distributed long term rainfall runoff model it was developed to predict the impact of land management methods on runoff and sediments and the behavior of agricultural chemicals over a wide range of soils land use and land management conditions in large complex watersheds this model consists of four sub models hydrology soil loss nutrients and channel tracking arnold et al 1996 the hydrological part of the swat model calculates the daily water balance considering the blockage surface runoff side runoff infiltration base runoff waterway loss and evapotranspiration by the storage equation 1 s w t s w o i 0 t r d a y q s u r f e a p e r c q g w where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw0 is the initial soil water content of the ith day

model dem land use map and soil map a dem with 30 30 m resolution was generated and the model was constructed using a precision soil map provided by the rural development administration and a land use map provided by the water resources management information system in koera for weather data rainfalls high low temperatures humidity solar radiation and wind speed provided by the korea meteorological administration were used sensitive parameters were selected and corrected by a trial and error method the parameters sensitive to water quality were selected by referring to kim et al kim 2015 for the flow measurement data the water level data provided by the water resources management information system http www wamis go kr were converted into flow data using the level flow rating curve for water quality measurement data total load measuring network data provided by the water environment information system http water nier go kr in 8 day intervals were used water quality data were collected for suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp table 1 shows the flow and water quality calibration and validation points and durations for the geumho river and hwang river 2 3 model calibration and validation methods statistical methods and numerical models are used for objective forecasts a statistical method may be used alone or together with the results of a numerical model wilks 2006 wilks 2006 proposed three statistical methods for objective forecasts the general method perfect prognosis and model output statistics mos these statistical methods are usually used for weather forecasting in this study however their wide applicability was evaluated by applying them to the calibration and validation of limited water quality data generated continuously for rivers 2 3 1 general method the general method is a typical statistical method using a regression equation to estimate the relationship of variables a regression equation for the linear relationship between two variables such as independent variable x and dependent variable y is developed and predictions based on this regression are made this method is deterministic because the equation produces the same prediction for a particular input or predictor in this study the flow load rating curve was estimated using the flow data qobs moe at eight day intervals and the water quality data of the same locations measured by the ministry of environment moe then the rating curve was interpolated by applying the daily observed flow data derived from the level flow rating curve provided by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport qobs molit fig 2 shows a schematic of the general method 2 3 2 perfect prognosis the perfect prognosis method accepts the predictions for variables as they are without attempting to correct the errors in the model or change its tendency this is similar to the existing regression equation in that it specifies the observed predicted variable using an observed predictor therefore this method uses only past data fig 3 shows a schematic of the perfect prognosis method for rating curve generation 2 3 3 model output statistics mos the mos is a generally

curve the flow load rating curves of the general and perfect prognosis methods were calculated using the observation data of eight day intervals for 2004 2013 from the ministry of environment fig 5 shows the graphs of the calculated rating curves the daily water quality loads were generated by applying the daily loads converted to the level flow rating curves of the water level observation stations of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport corresponding to the calibration and validation period of each tributary to use them as the calibration and validation data of the swat model the flow load rating curve of the mos method was calculated using the swat flow data simulated for the same period and dates as those of the observation data in eight day intervals of the ministry of environment for 2004 2013 as with the introduced method the daily water quality loads were generated by applying the daily flow of the swat model corresponding to the calibration and validation period of each tributary to use them as the calibration and validation data of the swat model fig 6 shows the regression equation calculation graphs 3 2 assessment of the improved adjustment criteria 3 2 1 calibration and validation of swat model flow calibration and validation were performed prior to water quality calibration and validation the appropriate parameters were selected through a parameter sensitivity analysis and the flows were calibrated and validated by trial and error then the actual water quality loads were generated for water quality calibration and validation using the confirmed flow figs 7 to 9 show graphs of the statistical calibration and validation results for the water quality loads of ss tn and tp respectively in the geumho river the above graphs show that because the geumho river has four sewage treatment plants discharging effluents of at least 100 000 tons per day it maintains a constant flow rate in a normal season and the water quality did not show significant variations due to the effect of the effluents however the simulation results did not reflect this tendency well the ss actual values of the perfect prognosis and mos methods were higher than the simulation values between october 2006 and february 2007 which corresponds to a non flood season for tn the actual value of the general method was lower than the simulation value whereas the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed similar trends to the actual value for tp the simulation values were generally lower than the actual values the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed higher simulation values for total load than those of the general method figs 10 12 show graphs of the calibration and validation results for ss tn and tp according to statistical methods in the hwang river as the hapcheon dam is in the upper stream of the hwang river the dam effluent is dominant in the flow of the river but the effect of the watershed effluent is also large during rainfall therefore the differences in effluents between rainfall and non rainfall were large which also caused large variations in the water quality load due to this characteristic of the watershed the hwang river showed greater variations in the water quality load than the geumho river the general method tended to have higher simulated values of ss tn and tp as compared to the actual values whereas the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed similar tendencies between the actual and simulated values for the three items table 2 lists the correlation and r2 values of the calibration and validation for the geumho river and the hwang river in the geumho river the correlations of the general method perfect prognosis method and mos method for the calibration of ss were 0 96 1 00 and 0 99 respectively and r2 values were 0 93 1 00 and 1 00 respectively the correlations of validation were 0 96 1 00 and 1 00 and r2 values were 0 92 0 99 and 1 00 thus the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed slightly higher values than the general method for tn the correlations of calibration of the three methods were 0 96 0 97 and 0 97 respectively and the r2 values were 0 91 0 95 and 0 94 respectively showing increases of 0 01 0 04 the correlations of validation were 0 84 0 94 and 0 94 and the r2 values were 0 70 0 89 and 0 89 showing slight increases of 0 10 0 19 the correlations of calibration for tp were 0 94 0 95 and 0 97 and the r2 values were 0 89 0 91 and 0 94 showing an increase of 0 03 0 05 the correlations of validation were 0 79 0 93 and 0 93 and the r2 values were 0 62 0 86 and 0 87 showing increases of 0 14 0 25 in the hwang river when the three statistical methods were compared for water quality items the correlations of the calibration for ss were 0 67 0 85 and 0 77 respectively and the r2 values were 0 44 0 71 and 0 59 respectively showing increases of 0 10 0 27 however the correlations of validation were 0 67 0 85 and 0 77 and the r2 values were 0 44 0 71 0 59 showing decreases of 0 21 to 0 12 regarding tn the correlations of calibration were 0 87 0 93 and 0 93 and the r2 values were 0 75 0 87 and 0 87 showing increases of 0 06 0

general the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed better calibration and validation results than the general method in the geumho river both the correlation and r2 values of ss tn and tp increased in the hwang river the correlation and r2 values decreased during the validation period of ss and tn while the other values increased the geumho river showed higher correlation and r2 values than the hwang river this seems to reflect the small variations between rainfall and non rainfall due to the constant inflow of pollutants from the sewage treatment plants in the watershed in the hwang river the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed lower correlation and r2 values for ss than the general method during the validation period unlike other water quality items the simulated flow rate showed greater variations than the measured flow rate during the non flood season from winter 2011 to spring 2012 this trend was reflected in the perfect prognosis and mos methods using the simulated flow as interpolation data this tendency was prominent for ss which is greatly influenced by the flow rate 3 2 2 anomaly analysis of model results anomaly analysis was performed using the calibration and validation results from the geumho river and the hwang river discussed in section 3 2 1 the anomaly analysis results were quantitatively evaluated using correlation and r2 indices and the results are outlined in table 3 for the geumho river the correlations of calibration of the three statistical methods for ss were 0 51 0 96 and 0 95 respectively and the r2 values were 0 26 0 92 and 0 90 respectively showing significant increases of 0 45 0 86 the correlations of validation were 0 41 0 98 and 0 99 and the r2 values were 0 17 0 97 and 0 97 respectively showing significant increases of 0 58 0 80 for tn the correlations of calibration were 0 64 0 96 and 0 96 and the r2 values were 0 41 0 92 and 0 91 respectively showing significant increases of 0 32 0 51 the correlations of validation were 0 49 0 92 and 0 92 and the r2 values were 0 24 0 86 and 0 85 respectively showing significant increases of 0 43 0 62 regarding tp the correlations of calibration were 0 68 0 93 and 0 95 and the r2 values were 0 47 0 86 and 0 91 respectively showing significant increases of 0 27 0 44 the correlations of validation were 0 51 0 89 and 0 91 and the r2 values were 0 26 0 80 and 0 83 respectively showing significant increases of 0 40 0 57 in the results for the hwang river the correlations of calibration for ss were 0 32 0 83 and 0 79 respectively and the r2 values were 0 10 0 68 and 0 62 respectively showing significant increases of 0 51 0 58 the correlations of validation were 0 65 0 73 and 0 75 and the r2 values were 0 42 0 53 and 0 57 respectively showing slight increases of 0 10 0 15 for the tn the correlations of calibration were 0 48 0 85 and 0 85 and the r2 values were 0 23 0 72 and 0 72 respectively showing significant increases of 0 37 0 49 the correlations of validation were 0 51 0 74 and 0 74 and the r2 values were 0 26 0 55 and 0 54 respectively showing slight increases of 0 23 0 29 in the case of tp the correlations of calibration were 0 35 0 78 and 0 77 and the r2 values were 0 12 0 61 and 0 60 respectively showing significant increases of 0 43 0 49 the correlations of validation were 0 40 0 61 and 0 61 and the r2 values were 0 16 0 37 and 0 38 respectively showing slight increases of 0 21 0 22 therefore the anomaly analysis results showed similar tendencies of change in the time series mean indicating a high fit 4 discussion and conclusion the united states geological survey usgs has used a regression model load estimator loades to study load forecasting for unmetered stations usgs 1997 2000 2003 2007a 2007b however the loadest model was evaluated based on annual pollution load forecasts and there was no calibration or verification process park 2014 here the water quality calibration and validation methods of hydrologic models were improved by analyzing daily water quality data from eight day or monthly intervals through statistical methods the applicability of the improved calibration and validation methods was evaluated among the target tributaries of the nakdong river the geumho river and the hwang river watersheds the daily loads of ss tn and tp were generated using three statistical methods for the general method the flow load rating curve was calculated using the observed flows measured at eight day intervals and the water quality data and then interpolated with the flow rates from water level observation stations for the perfect prognosis method the flow load rating curve was calculated using the same method and then interpolated with simulated flow rates for the mos method the flow load rating curve was calculated using simulated flow rates and observed water quality data and then interpolated with simulated flow rates the calibration and validation results of each method using the daily loads of ss tn and tp were compared with simulation results and the applicability was evaluated using r2 correlation and anomaly analysis results in the geumho river significant differences were not seen among the different statistical methods for ss in the correlation and r2 results during the calibration and validation period tn and tp did not show significant differences among the methods during the calibration period either however during the validation period the correlations and r2 of the perfect prognosis and mos methods improved slightly by approximately 0 15 and 0 25 compared to those of the general method as with ss tn and tp also showed similar correlation and r2 values among the methods in the hwang river the correlation and r2 values for the calibration of ss increased by approximately 0 10 and 0 25 respectively however the correlation and r2 values of validation decreased by approximately 0 10 and 0 20 respectively during the non flood season from winter 2011 to spring 2012 the simulated flow rates showed greater variations due to rainfall than actual flow rates when the simulated flow rates were applied to the rating curve this was reflected in ss which is greatly influenced by flow rate resulting in decreases of correlation and r2 values tn and tp values also increased for the two other methods as compared to those from the general method like the results for the geumho river when the anomaly analysis results were analyzed using correlation and r2 values greater improvements were observed the correlation and r2 values of calibration and validation in the geumho river increased by up to 0 86 for ss up to 0 62 for tn and up to 0 57 for tn in the hwang river as well the correlation and r2 values of calibration and validation increased up to 0 58 for ss up to 0 49 for tn and up to 0 49 for tp the fact that the comparison of observed and simulated values indicated greater improvements than the comparison of the change in anomaly results suggests similar tendencies of the load time series therefore the daily loads generated by applying the simulated flow to the flow load rating curve are applicable to model calibration and validation however prior to calibration and validation of water quality a good reproduction of the observed flow by the simulated and validated flow should be demonstrated first furthermore the applicability of wide ranging data to calibration and validation should be reviewed through comparison of the method proposed in this study to the automatic monitoring network data that are measured in real time park 2014 compared the predicted load through the load estimator and a genetic algorithm and suggested that this prediction is efficient if the calibration and verification processes are sufficient which is consistent with the results of this study thus the approach in this study can be used as a method to improve the accuracy of hydrologic models in addition if a regression equation is prepared by selecting appropriate variables to predict the loading for an ungaged watershed and time and sufficient corrections and verifications are made it will be possible spare effort and time

1027,the importance of water resources forecasting is growing due to changes in precipitation caused by climate change and with hydrologic models are being used mainly for water resource management calibration and validation through adjustment of parameters are important processes for increasing the reliability of the application of hydrologic models this is different from flow rates that can be estimated in real time through level flow rating curve the reliability of data depends on observation therefore using data with a short can increase the reliability of the results in this study daily loads of suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were generated using three statistical methods general method perfect prognosis method and model output statistics mos fitness of calibration and validation of hydrologic models were then evaluated using correlation r2 and anomaly analysis when these three methods were applied to the geumho and hwang rivers perfect prognosis method and the mos method showed better results than the general method for the geumho river correlation and r2 improved by up to 0 08 for ss 0 04 for tn and 0 12 for tp for hwang river results improved by up to 27 for ss 12 for tn and 15 for tp when the anomaly analysis results were represented by correlation and r2 they showed significant improvements of up to 0 86 in ss 0 62 in tn and 0 57 in tp for the geumho river and up to 0 58 in ss 0 49 in tn and 0 49 in tp for the hwang river the statistical method suggested in this study can be applied when observation for the water quality data is long or data are insufficient keywords swat general method perfect prognosis method model output statistics mos anomaly analysis 1 introduction since the 2000s the frequency and scale of extreme climatic events such as torrential rains and droughts have been increasing kim et al 2017 consequently it is becoming difficult to stably secure and manage water resources due to fluctuations in precipitation and rainfall intensity kim et al 2017 kim et al 2018 furthermore nonpoint source pollution is worsening in watersheds that are strongly affected by rainfall runoff hydrologic models are often used to examine watershed hydrology nonpoint pollution sources and water quality calibration and validation of hydrologic models is generally performed by calibrating parameters for observed data over a long period of time and applying these parameters to other periods kim and kim 2017 securing flow and water quality data especially data with short investigation cycles over a long time period kim et al 2020 is important to enhance the calibration and validation accuracy of hydrologic models the lack of water quality data makes it difficult to determine the exact water quality during rainfall due to the water quality survey interval me 2019 therefore hydrologic models are often used to obtain continuous data the calibration and validation of model parameters is essential for reliable a research of watershed water resources and water quality changes using hydrologic models many studies on calibration and validation have been conducted by estimating optimal parameters using data without continuity or by using optimization methods jung et al 2009 wang et al 2016 koppa et al 2019 kumarasamy and belmont 2018 ledergerber et al 2019 parker et al 2019 among studies conducted in other countries brighenti et al 2019 used the swat model to compare sequential calibration and simultaneous calibration methods for flow rate and suspended solids ss at two or more points of the watershed using the nash sutcliffe ns and king gupta efficiency kge indices the result of the ns index was better for sequential calibration whereas the result of the kge index was better for simultaneous calibration tou et al 2018 analyzed the snow related parameters in the swat model for the alpine mountains in northeastern italy through multi and single objective processes and compared the results between different methods among studies conducted in korea kim et al 2016 used the numeric integration ni method to calculate the ss pollution load using flow rate and ss pollution data measured in eight day intervals and proposed a method of estimating the nonpoint pollution load kim and kim 2017 selected parameters sensitive to drought using the swat model and compared the results before and after an intensive calibration for drought years using r2 rmse and nse indices the result showed improvements as compared to the general calibration the applicability of a hydrologic model to water quality calibration and validation was evaluated in this study by generating continuous load data through this rating curve 2 methods 2 1 study area the watersheds for this study were selected from those along the nakdong river which has most dams 10 multi purpose and 10 for water supply and weirs 8 among the four major rivers in korea among the tributaries of the nakdong river we selected the geumho river and hwang river the geumho river flows through the middle of a city and maintains a constant flow rate and water quality from the water supply dam in the upstream areas and effluent from sewage treatment plants in the midstream and downstream areas in the hwang river the flow rate is adjusted by the hapcheon dam in the upstream region and there are no large pollution sources in the watershed fig 1 the geumho river is the first tributary located in the middle of the nakdong river and many studies have been conducted on long term changes in water quality in this watershed jung et al 2015 jung et al 2016 moreover many hydrologic models have been used to predict runoff or simulate nonpoint pollution sources or soil runoff kim et al 2018 kim et al 2015 cha et al 2017 choi et al 2011 kwon and choi 2017 choi et al 2017 and hwang et al 2010 conducted research to estimate watershed and sediment runoff using a hydrologic model 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 model description for water quality simulations we selected the soil and water assessment tool swat model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture the swat model is a physical based semi distributed long term rainfall runoff model it was developed to predict the impact of land management methods on runoff and sediments and the behavior of agricultural chemicals over a wide range of soils land use and land management conditions in large complex watersheds this model consists of four sub models hydrology soil loss nutrients and channel tracking arnold et al 1996 the hydrological part of the swat model calculates the daily water balance considering the blockage surface runoff side runoff infiltration base runoff waterway loss and

map provided by the water resources management information system in koera for weather data rainfalls high low temperatures humidity solar radiation and wind speed provided by the korea meteorological administration were used sensitive parameters were selected and corrected by a trial and error method the parameters sensitive to water quality were selected by referring to kim et al kim 2015 for the flow measurement data the water level data provided by the water resources management information system http www wamis go kr were converted into flow data using the level flow rating curve for water

suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp table 1 shows the flow and water quality calibration and validation points and durations for the geumho river and hwang river 2 3 model calibration and validation methods statistical methods and numerical models are used for objective forecasts a statistical method may be used alone or together with the results of a numerical model wilks 2006 wilks 2006 proposed three statistical methods for objective forecasts the general method perfect prognosis and model output statistics mos these statistical methods are usually used for weather forecasting in this study however their wide applicability was evaluated by applying them to the calibration and validation of limited water quality data generated continuously for rivers 2 3 1 general method the general method is a typical statistical method using a regression equation to estimate the relationship of variables a regression equation for the linear relationship between two variables such as independent variable x and dependent variable y is developed and predictions based on this regression are made this method is deterministic because the equation produces the same prediction for a particular input or predictor in this study the flow load rating curve was estimated using the flow data qobs moe at eight day intervals and the water quality data of the same locations measured by the ministry of environment moe then the rating curve was interpolated by applying the daily observed flow data derived from the level flow rating curve provided by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport qobs molit fig 2 shows a schematic of the general method 2 3 2 perfect prognosis the perfect prognosis method accepts the predictions for variables as they are without attempting to correct the errors in the model or change its tendency this is similar to the existing regression equation in that it specifies the observed predicted variable using an observed predictor therefore this method uses only past data fig 3 shows a schematic of the perfect prognosis method for rating curve generation 2 3 3 model output statistics mos the mos is a generally preferred statistical prediction method both the perfect prognosis and mos methods use the result of the model as a predictor variable however the perfect prognosis method uses the model result only

general the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed better calibration and validation results than the general method in the geumho river both the correlation and r2 values of ss tn and tp increased in the hwang river the correlation and r2 values decreased during the validation period of ss and tn while the other values increased the geumho river showed higher correlation and r2 values than the hwang river this seems to reflect the small variations between rainfall and non rainfall due to the constant inflow of pollutants from the sewage treatment plants in the watershed in the hwang river the perfect prognosis and mos methods showed lower correlation and r2 values for ss than the general method during the validation period unlike other water quality items the simulated flow rate showed greater variations than the measured flow rate during the non flood season from winter 2011 to spring 2012 this trend was reflected in the perfect prognosis and mos methods using the simulated flow as interpolation data this tendency was prominent for ss which is greatly influenced by the flow rate 3 2 2 anomaly analysis of model results anomaly analysis was performed using the calibration and validation results from the geumho river and the hwang river discussed in section 3 2 1 the anomaly analysis results were quantitatively evaluated using correlation and r2 indices and the results are outlined in table 3 for the geumho river the correlations of calibration of the three statistical methods for ss were 0 51 0 96 and 0 95 respectively and the r2 values were 0 26 0 92 and 0 90 respectively showing significant increases of 0 45 0 86 the correlations of validation were 0 41 0 98 and 0 99 and the r2 values were 0 17 0 97 and 0 97 respectively showing significant increases of 0 58 0 80 for tn the correlations of calibration were 0 64 0 96 and 0 96 and the r2 values were 0 41 0 92 and 0 91 respectively showing significant increases of 0 32 0 51 the correlations of validation were 0 49 0 92 and 0 92 and the r2 values were 0 24 0 86 and 0 85 respectively showing significant increases of 0 43 0 62 regarding tp the correlations of calibration were 0 68 0 93 and 0 95 and the r2 values were 0 47 0 86 and 0 91 respectively showing significant increases of 0 27 0 44 the correlations of validation were 0 51 0 89 and 0 91 and the r2 values were 0 26 0 80 and 0 83 respectively showing significant increases of 0 40 0 57 in the results for the hwang river the correlations of calibration for ss were 0 32 0 83 and 0 79 respectively and the r2 values were 0 10 0 68 and 0 62 respectively showing significant increases of 0 51 0 58 the correlations of validation were 0 65 0 73 and 0 75 and the r2 values were 0 42 0 53 and 0 57 respectively showing slight increases of 0 10 0 15 for the tn the correlations of calibration were 0 48 0 85 and 0 85 and the r2 values were 0 23 0 72 and 0 72 respectively showing significant increases of 0 37 0 49 the correlations of validation were 0 51 0 74 and 0 74 and the r2 values were 0 26 0 55 and 0 54 respectively showing slight increases of 0 23 0 29 in the case of tp the correlations of calibration were 0 35 0 78 and 0 77 and the r2 values were 0 12 0 61 and 0 60 respectively showing significant increases of 0 43 0 49 the correlations of validation were 0 40 0 61 and 0 61 and the r2 values were 0 16 0 37 and 0 38 respectively showing slight increases of 0 21 0 22 therefore the anomaly analysis results showed similar tendencies of change in the time series mean indicating a high fit 4 discussion and conclusion the united states geological survey usgs has used a regression model load estimator loades to study load forecasting for unmetered stations usgs 1997 2000 2003 2007a 2007b however the loadest model was evaluated based on annual pollution load forecasts and there was no calibration or verification process park 2014 here the water quality calibration and validation methods of hydrologic models were improved by analyzing daily water quality data from eight day or monthly intervals through statistical methods the applicability of the improved calibration and validation methods was evaluated among the target tributaries of the nakdong river the geumho river and the hwang river watersheds the daily loads of ss tn and tp were generated using three statistical methods for the general method the flow load rating curve was calculated using the observed flows measured at eight day intervals and the water quality data and then interpolated with the flow rates from water level observation stations for the perfect prognosis method the flow load rating curve was calculated using the same method and then interpolated with simulated flow rates for the mos method the flow load rating curve was calculated using simulated flow rates and observed water quality data and then interpolated with simulated flow rates the calibration and validation results of each method using the daily loads of ss tn and tp were compared with simulation results and the applicability was evaluated using r2 correlation and anomaly analysis results in the geumho river significant differences were not seen among the different statistical methods for ss in the correlation and r2 results during the calibration and validation period tn and tp did not show significant differences among the methods during the calibration period either however during the validation period the correlations and r2 of the perfect prognosis and mos methods improved slightly by approximately 0 15 and 0 25 compared to those of the general method as with ss tn and tp also showed similar correlation and r2 values among the methods in the hwang river the correlation and r2 values for the calibration of ss increased by approximately 0 10 and 0 25 respectively however the correlation and r2 values of validation decreased by approximately 0 10 and 0 20 respectively during the non flood season from winter 2011 to spring 2012 the simulated flow rates showed greater variations due to rainfall than actual flow rates when the simulated flow rates were applied to the rating curve this was reflected in ss which is greatly influenced by flow rate resulting in decreases of correlation and r2 values tn and tp values also increased for the two other methods as compared to those from the general method like the results for the geumho river when the anomaly analysis results were analyzed using correlation and r2 values greater improvements were observed the correlation and r2 values of calibration and validation in the geumho river increased by up to 0 86 for ss up to 0 62 for tn and up to 0 57 for tn in the hwang river as well the correlation and r2 values of calibration and validation increased up to 0 58 for ss up to 0 49 for tn and up to 0 49 for tp the fact that the comparison of observed and simulated values indicated greater improvements than the comparison of the change in anomaly results suggests similar tendencies of the load time series therefore the daily loads generated by applying the simulated flow to the flow load rating curve are applicable to model calibration and validation however prior to calibration and validation of water quality a good reproduction of the observed flow by the simulated and validated flow should be demonstrated first furthermore the applicability of wide ranging data to calibration and validation should be reviewed through comparison of the method proposed in this study to the automatic monitoring network data that are measured in real time park 2014 compared the predicted load through the load estimator and a genetic algorithm and suggested that this prediction is efficient if the calibration and verification processes are sufficient which is consistent with the results of this study thus the approach in this study can be used as a method to improve the accuracy of hydrologic models in addition if a regression equation is prepared by selecting appropriate variables to predict the loading for an ungaged watershed and time and sufficient corrections and verifications are made it will be possible spare effort and time

1028,this study aims to evaluate the impacts of climate change on water balance components mainly precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration and hydrological extremes in three physiographic regions namely the middle mountain region the high mountain region and the high himalayas region of the west seti river basin wsrb in nepal the future climate was projected using the climate data of three regional climate models rcms the projected future climate data was then fed into the hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate hydrologic responses including water balance components under future climate conditions results showed that the middle mountain region of the basin is expected to receive the highest increase of in precipitation 11 2 and in water yield 18 2 as compared to the other two physiographic regions conversely the high himalayas are expected to have the highest increase of evapotranspiration 19 9 as compared to the middle mountain and high mountain regions similarly the low flows in the basin are expected to decrease by 15 5 and 19 3 under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively whereas high flows are expected to increase by 10 7 under both the rcp scenarios the results of this study will be helpful to planners and decision makers to formulate adaptation strategies in water resources development and planning such as irrigation and hydropower development 1 introduction nepalese river basins are highly vulnerable to climate change the west seti river basin wsrb drained by the seti river is one of the most vulnerable basins with regard to the probable effects of climate change gurung et al 2015 several studies reported that the basin is highly sensitive with the coping capacity of the community to react with climate induced hazards such as floods landslides droughts siddiqui et al 2012 due to the varied physiography and topography of the wsrb the water resources planners face difficulties and with the likely climate change deglaciation in the himalayan region will have a prominent consequence in the basin both physical and climatic factors that affect the vulnerability are to be considered for water resources planning and development therefore evaluation of the impact of climate change in different physiographic regions is necessary for water resources planning development and management anthropogenically induced climate change is manifested globally in the past as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns and in sea levels rise these have an impact on hydrological processes which in turn affect all aspects of water management the close relationship that exists between water management and socio economic development proves that achieving sustainable development goals for water food production and poverty alleviation is a major challenge with respect to climate change the 5th assessment report ar5 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that global ocean and land temperatures have increased by 0 85 c over the period of 1880 2012 ipcc 2014 the global average temperature increase is projected to be between 0 3 c to 4 8 c by the end of the century stocker 2014 the quality availability and supply of water may be affected due to the impact of climate change in water resources middelkoop et al 2001 there is a significant variation in the spatial and temporal distribution of water on the earth s surface which will further be aggravated due to the impacts of climate change studies reported the potential fluctuations in precipitation among wet and dry areas and seasons stocker 2014 and himalayan basins are particularly sensitive to the changing climate a rise in streamflow in the future is projected due to changes in precipitation and glaciers melting immerzeel et al 2013 water availability is projected to increase in the 21st century in himalayan basins as the streamflow here is dominated by snow and glacier melt lutz et al 2014 the consequences of increased flows will be experienced as an increase in the frequency of hydro meteorological extremes leading to more frequent and more intense natural disasters hence it is very important to understand the seasonal patterns of precipitation and temperature in mountainous regions and the impacts that they have may on water resources ficklin et al 2009 several studies reported that climate variability and its frequency are reflected by climate models such as general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms the understanding of future climate changes is depicted by these gcms and rcms with the help of physical components of the atmospheric climate system gosling and arnell 2016 since gcms have a coarser resolution rcms have been widely used due to its high spatial resolution for the depiction of future temperature and precipitation in a basin anjum et al 2019 representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios that estimate the radiative forcing rf that are based on the multi model ensembles of coupled model intercomparison phase five cmip5 taylor et al 2012 these rcps are the major source of high resolution climate variation and change studies and different rcp consists of various presumption of population economy land use and energy use tapiador et al 2019 the climate scenarios projected by climate models are often fed into hydrologic models for studying the impact of climate change on water resources these hydrologic models simulate the hydrologic processes in a watershed the geophysical and socio economic conditions of nepal make it more susceptible to climate change aryal and rajkarnikar 2011 with considerable temporal and seasonal variations in key climatic parameters nepal has a diverse climate condition that ranges from the tropical climate in the south to alpine climate in its northern regions shrestha and aryal 2011 these changes can alter the responses of hydrologic systems leading to glacier retreats the disappearance of natural springs loss of or operative changes in wetlands and increased divergence in streamflow these impacts will undermine the livelihoods of the people of nepal particularly the poor aryal and rajkarnikar 2011 the impacts are also expected to be higher at smaller spatial and temporal scales bharati et al 2014 studies reveal a rise up to 5 8 c on the average surface temperature in nepal towards the end of this century bartlett et al 2010 the fluctuations in temperature and precipitation patterns directly alter the hydrological regime of the basins the projected annual increases in flow indicate that parts of nepal such as the bagmati river basin may become wetter in the future babel et al 2014 the ensemble of gcms results predict the increase in future streamflow in bheri river basin which is located in the far western region of nepal the expected increase is between 6 2 to 7 3 and 6 0 to 12 5 in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively mishra et al 2018 in the kaligandagi river basin of nepal the water yield would increase up to 41 to 51 and evapotranspiration will increase 7 to 14 under different scenarios by the end of the century bajracharya et al 2018 the government of nepal is planning to build a hydropower project with a capacity of 750 mw in the wsrb to solve the electricity cutoffs during peak demand as well as to bring economic benefit to the country extreme variability in precipitation due to change in climate will have an adverse effect on such development projects by increasing the risk from flash floods sedimentation and large boulders also as most of the hydroelectric plants are run of the river type which could be threatened due to prolonged drought situations climate induced drought conditions could also affect the ecological flow in the lower physiographic region to fill this knowledge gap this study projected future climate scenarios and their impacts on water balance components in the different physiographic regions in the study basin furthermore this study also analyzed the changes in high and low flows due to the changing climate which will affect the water resources development projects in the basin three selected rcms and two future rcp scenarios for each rcms were used in the study for a baseline of 1986 to 2005 and two future time periods near future nf from 2021 to 2040 and mid future mf from 2041 to 2060 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wsrb fig 1 extends from latitude 30 04 n to 28 56 n and longitude 80 36 e to 81 36 e and has a catchment area of 7 427 km2 facing south with the slant of the himalayas the river in this basin emerges from the glaciers and snowfields around the peaks of api and nampa the elevation varies from 335 meters above sea level m a s l at the basin outlet to 7043 m a s l at the high mountain range that includes the peaks of api and nampa the average elevation of the basin is approximately 2505 m a s l based on the geology elevation climate agriculture industry and people nepal is categorized into five physiographic regions terai the siwalik hills the middle mountain region the high mountain region and the high himalayas these regions cover 14 13 30 20 and 23 of the total area respectively matthews 2001 the elevation ranges of the physiographic regions are terai 100 to 200 m a s l siwalik 700 to 1 500 m a s l middle mountain 1 500 to 2 700 m a s l high mountain 2 000 to 4 000 m a s l and high himalayas are 4 000 to 8 848 m a s l shrestha and aryal 2011 the southernmost terai region is the most fertile area where intensive agriculture is practiced the siwalik region is rough and uneven and is often adversely affected by natural disasters such as floods and landslides the middle mountain region supports a large human population and although most of the area is rugged topography agriculture occupies a substantial part of the region the high mountain region lies under the snow line followed by the northernmost high himalayan region which extends up to the highest summit in the world matthews 2001 although nepal is classified as a subtropical region due to its distinctive physiographical as well as topographical distributions within a short extent of 140 km north to south it has vast climatic and environmental diversity shrestha and aryal 2011 in accordance with the physiographic regions mentioned above the wsrb covers three physiographic regions the middle mountain regions the high mountain region and the high himalayas each region respectively covers an area of 3001 km2 2734 km2 and 1692 km2 in the basin there are ten meteorological stations present in the study area and out of them three lies in the high mountain region and the remaining seven in the middle mountain region since the high himalayas region do not have any monitoring station aphrodite data were used as mentioned in section 2 2 in addition all three hydrological stations in the basin lie in the middle mountain region the average annual rainfall in the basin is 1980 mm 1986 to 2005 rainfall during winter december to february pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to september and post monsoon october and november seasons is 142 mm 262 mm 1518 mm and 57 mm respectively more than 75 of the annual rainfall in this basin is received during the monsoon season the average annual temperature in the basin is 19 c with an average minimum of 12 1 c and an average maximum of 25 8 c the annual average discharge of the west seti river is 296 2 m3 s 2 2 data 2 2 1 topographic soil and land use data the digital elevation model dem in this research was acquired from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model version 2 gdem v2 with a 1 arc second approximately 30 m at the equator resolution http reverb echo nasa gov reverb a major part of the area of the basin has an elevation between 2000 and 6000 m a s l as shown in supplementary fig s1 the maximum elevation is 7043 m a s l and minimum elevation is 335 m a s l in the basin the soil map of the year 1986 was acquired from the national land use project nlup in association with the ministry of land reform and management molrm nepal at scale 1 50 000 a total of 23 soil types are available in the basin the dominant soil types in the middle mountain region of the basin are eutric cambisols and chromic cambisols whereas the dominant soil type in the high mountain region is dystric regosols and in the high himalayas are rocky outcrop and snow cover the land use map of 300 m resolution for the year 2010 was obtained from the european space agency http due esrin esa int globcover ten different land use types are observed in the basin area with the maximum area occupied by deciduous and evergreen forests followed by agricultural land the middle mountain and the high mountain regions are predominantly covered by agricultural land and forests whereas the high himalayas region is mostly covered with snow and hay the dem soil and land use map are presented as in supplementary fig s2 s3 and s4 respectively 2 2 2 observed historical meteorological and hydrological data daily data of minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation from 1980 to 2014 were gathered from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal the upper area of the basin where the station data is not available asian precipitation high resolved observational data integration aphrodite https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards data was used for the base period aphrodite s project on water resources has been conducted since 2006 with a grid size of 0 250 above the monsoon asia region yatagai et al 2012 it is found that the aphrodite dataset could be incorporated in the high himalayan region along with available temperature and precipitation station data depending on the data availability and placement ten meteorological stations were used in the study from dhm and the aphrodite data was used at two locations fig 1 these data have not been corrected to any wind effect in addition the homogeneity test of the observed data was conducted based on cumulative deviations from the mean as suggested by buishand 1982 data from the meteorological stations were spatially interpolated using the thiessen polygon technique and input to the hydrologic model to produce a gridded map of climate input the higher elevation region of the basin is mountainous with peaks and valleys hence the interpolated meteorological data was not able to exactly represent the variability of the mountainous region therefore lapse rates of temperature and precipitation were taken within each sub basin to extrapolate temperature and distribute precipitation based on the different elevations in each band the temperature and precipitation were calculated as a function of lapse rate and the gage and the average elevation variation was specified for each band neitsch et al 2011 based on the availability of temperature stations an average temperature lapse rate of 5 3 c km was calculated similarly depending on the available precipitation stations the average precipitation lapse rate of 200 mm km was calculated table 1 presents the meteorological stations and data available for each specific station with the hydrological stations in and near the study basin the correlation plot between observed station data and aphrodite data is illustrated in supplementary fig s5 it is established that there is a consistent bias between the observed data at the stations and data from aphrodite the monthly bias correlation factor was determined using the aphrodite climate data with observed climate data and based on the factor bias correction was applied to the aphrodite station data that was used in the study three hydrological stations as given in table 1 were considered for calibration and validation of the hydrologic model at outlet the banga station the average annual discharge is 296 2 m3 s 2 2 3 future climate data five rcms developed by csiro marine and atmospheric

mpi esm lr ccsm4 noresm m and cnrm cm5 respectively were initially selected statistical parameters of the observation were considered to evaluate the performance of the models based on the performance statistics namely the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae as presented in supplementary table s1 access gfdl and mpi with a grid size of 0 5 0 5 were chosen for future climate data analysis these rcms were downloaded from the http cccr tropmet res in home index jsp cordex data website daily historical 1970 to 2005 data and future climate data 2006 to 2099 with emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were used for the analysis the rcp 4 5 scenario is a stabilization scenario which means the radiative forcing level stabilizes at 4 5 w m2 before 2100 by the employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions whereas rcp 8 5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions leading to a radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 at the end of the century a total of five grid cells of the selected rcms covered the study basin for the climate change and impact analysis the climate data of baseline bl period of 1985 2005 and the future periods classified as near future nf i e 2021 to 2040 and far future ff i e 2041 to 2060 were taken from the outputs of the selected rcms since gfdl had future data available only till 2070 the period of analysis considered for this study was untill 2060 2 3 methodology the presented study in wsrb evaluated the future climate and its consequences on three major water balance components considering the physiographic regions soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to simulate the hydrology and water balance components in the basin fig 2 presents the overall methodology adopted for the study 2 3 1 future climate projection for this research three rcm models of ccam which are access gdfl and mpi were carefully chosen on the basis of the resolution vintage representativeness and validity smith et al 1998 it is necessary to bias correct the outputs from selected rcms based on the performance statistics r2 for precipitation quantile mapping showed preferable results in comparison to linear scaling while for temperature linear scaling was found to be better than the quantile mapping as stated in section 2 2 3 identified three models were bias corrected using linear scaling and quantile mapping for future climate data rcm simulated temperature data bias were removed using linear scaling fang et al 2015 and precipitation data bias were removed using quantile mapping maraun 2013 2 3 2 hydrological modeling hydrological assessment in the study was conducted by applying a hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat which is a semi distributed physical based model widely used to simulate hydrology and obtain water balance components to analysis different management scenarios neitsch et al 2011 it distributes a watershed into multiple sub watersheds or sub basins for simulation these are additionally apportioned into hydrological response units hrus which are a coalition of land use soil type and management properties neitsch et al 2011 the water balance eq 1 is used to simulate the hydrologic cycle 1 sw c t sw c 0 i 1 n r day q surf ace e a w seep q gw where t time day swc t mm of final water

percolation for i th day qgw mm of return flow for i th day the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith method neitsch et al 2011 the hrus were defined by specifying threshold values of slope soil and land use thresholds used for land use soil and the slope were respectively 0 15 and 10 in the sub basin a total of 598 hrus were defined through this process ten elevation bands were selected within the sub basin to allow disparity in temperature and precipitation with respect to altitude over the basin grusson et al 2015 the hydrological model s performance was evaluated by the calibration and validation results the performance statistics of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias were used the observed streamflow data from three gauging stations were used for the calibration and validation of the hydrological model for daily and monthly flows for stations gopaghat and banga the period of 1986 to 1990 was used for calibration and 1991 to 1995 for validation a 5 year period from 1981 to 1985 was used as the warm up period for the model to reach an optimal state observed streamflow for the period from 2000 to 2003 for calibration and 2004 to 2005 for validation with a warm up period of 1995 to 1999 was used for mangalsen due to lack of availability of data the warm up period helps in stabilizing the initial conditions for groundwater and soil water storage fontaine et al 2002 in this study a manual calibration based on a trial and error approach was used it focused on model parameters that were considered most sensitive as reported by gurung et al 2015 2 3 3 analysis of water balance components water balance in the swat model plays a very crucial role and consists of all the processes happening within the basin neitsch et al 2011 the principal water balance components are precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration ayivi and jha 2018 eq 2 and eq 3 shows the relation of water yield and baseflow 2 water yield surface runoff lateral flow baseflow transmission loss 3 baseflow groundwater shallow aquifer flow groundwater deep aquifer flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate scenarios the performance of bias correction for chainpur station is illustrated in supplementary table s2 the bias corrected temperatures show a very good correlation with the observed temperatures both minimum and maximum temperatures data observed and corrected matched quite well for minimum temperature biases are higher in the winter months whereas for maximum temperature biases are higher in the summer months supplementary fig s6 the quantile mapping method was used for the bias correction of rainfall data bias correction of rcm simulated rainfall data shows correction in the mean as well as an improvement in the rmse mae and r2 values this confirmed the validation of this method the mpi model is more reliable than the other two in simulating precipitation for access and gfdl the biases are higher during the monsoon period supplementary fig s7 fig 3 a and b shows the annual average maximum and minimum temperatures of the selected rcms for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively and their ensembles which is the weighted average giving equal weights to all rcms an increase in both temperatures is projected in the future for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the increase is higher under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 the average rise in maximum temperature lies between 0 5 to 3 2 c under rcp 4 5 and 0 5 to 4 7 c under rcp 8 5 in the case of precipitation also an increase in the future is projected under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 fig 4 a and b and a large inter annual variability is seen in projected precipitation the average annual precipitation is projected to increase by 6 2 under rcp 4 5 and 7 under rcp 8 5 projected seasonal changes in maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation are described in supplementary table s3 s4 and s5 respectively all the rcms project both the temperatures to increase in all the seasons the maximum temperature increase in the summer season mam in the nf is likely to range from 0 4 c to 2 1 c under rcp 4 5 and 0 7 c to 2 8 c under rcp 8 5 similar increases in the range of 0 9 c to 1 5 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 2 c to 2 2 c under rcp 8 5 are projected for the mf the minimum temperature in the winter season dec feb is expected to increase in the range of 0 7 c to 1 7 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 0 c to 2 3 c under rcp 8 5 in the nf the increase in minimum temperature in the mf is in the range of 0 8 c to 1 3 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 2 c to 1 6 c under rcp 8 5 projected seasonal precipitation increase is greater in the post monsoon season oct to nov except for mpi the other two rcms project an increase in post monsoon precipitation by up to 54 3 under rcp 4 5 under rcp 8 5 other than access the two rcms project similar post monsoon increases in precipitation up to 47 for the monsoon season precipitation increases are projected under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by all the rcms except access monsoon precipitation is projected to increase by 32 8 and 31 1 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 3 2 performance of hydrological modeling the calibration and validation outcome for the outlet banga is presented in fig 5 the model simulated hydrological processes in the study basin quite well for both daily calibration and validation periods except for some high flows the model performance for both calibration and validation given in table 2 indicate that it has performed well moriasi et al 2007 and can be used for simulating hydrologic behavior of the basin under future climate conditions the discrepancies in the performance statistics especially in pbias could be due to variation in daily observed and over and under simulated flows at three hydrological gauging stations with different watershed characteristics and areas used for calibration and validation as expected the model s performance is better for monthly flows than for daily flows this stipulates that long term flows are better simulated by the model than short term events the multi site calibration results also show that the flows are simulated better at the upstream stations as compared to the downstream ones the list of sensitive parameters in the model is shown in supplementary table s6 curve number cn2 was found as the most sensitive parameter followed by soil hydraulic conductivity sol k1 the model s results were also sensitive to the precipitation lapse rate plaps snow fall temperature sftmp snowmelt temperature smtmp and the alpha base flow factor alpha b 3 3 water balance in the wsrb the model run for the baseline 1986 to 2005 with the calibrated parameters estimated average annual values of the various components of water balance which are presented in table 3 the water balance components include precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration the annual average precipitation in the basin is 1979 5 mm and out of it only 3 5 of the precipitation is contributed by snowfall in the period of baseline the amount of snow melted and sublimed is more than that which falls surface runoff amounts to 15 9 of the average annual precipitation the average annual evapotranspiration accounts for 36 of the average annual precipitation in the basin 3 4 impact of climate change on water balance components 3 4 1 future precipitation the percentage change in ensemble mean precipitation during different future periods and under different emission scenarios is shown in fig 6 an increase in precipitation in the mf is higher than in the nf with even precipitation increases projected to be more than 15 from the baseline considering the different physiographic regions the middle mountain region will experience changes between 2 to 11 in precipitation in both the nf and the mf under both rcp scenarios under rcp 4 5 in the mf and rcp 8 5 in the nf all regions in the basin will experience an increase in precipitation whereas in the other two scenarios some regions will experience a decrease in precipitation similar results are reported by pandey et al 2019 3 4 2 future water yield in the high himalayas and a major part of the high mountains the water yield is projected to decrease in the nf and it is projected to increase in all the physiographic regions in the mf under rcp 4 5 however under rcp 8 5 more areas will experience a decrease in water yield in the mf than in the nf particularly in the high mountain region in the mid mountain region the areas that will experience a decrease in water yield in the nf under rcp 4 5 are projected to have a similar decreasing trend in the mf under rcp 8 5 under rcp 4 5 in the nf the majority of the basin area will experience a reduction in water yield whereas in the mf the majority of the area in the basin will have a projected increase in water yield in the range of 5 to 10 fig 7 other studies in nepal also show that the water yield is expected to increase in the future bajracharya et al 2018 3 4 3 future evapotranspiration the high himalayan region is expected to have more than a 15 increase in evapotranspiration in the nf as compared to the baseline values and this will further increase by more than 20 in the mf fig 8 similar increases are projected under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 most of the high mountain region is expected to have an increase in evapotranspiration in the range of 10 to 15 in both the nf and the mf under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the middle mountain region a majority of the area will have an et increase is in the range of 0 to 5 in nf and 5 to 10 in the mf bajracharya et al 2018 also reported similar results in the kaligandaki river basin in nepal 3 4 4 future water balance in the physiographic regions precipitation is expected to increase relatively more in the middle mountain region as compared to the other two physiographic regions of the basin table 4 additionally in the mf under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 there is a greater increase in precipitation as compared to the values in the nf in all the physiographic regions following the trend of precipitation water yield will also increase the maximum increase will be in the middle mountain region followed by the high mountain region and then the high himalayas conversely the percentage change in evapotranspiration in the high himalayas is more than in the other two physiographic regions an increase in evapotranspiration in all regions suggests the significant role of warming temperatures in water balance components the changes in evapotranspiration with elevation might result in some phenological shifts or other vegetation responses the precipitation increase in the basin is projected to range from 11 to 37 in the different physiographic regions the high mountain region will experience a slight increase while the middle mountain region a much higher increase alike precipitation water yield is also expected to increase by about 30 to 62 in the three physiographic regions of the basin furthermore evapotranspiration is projected to increase by about 5 2 to 35 in the three physiographic regions of the basin these projected changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration follow a gradual increase from the nf to the mf under both rcp scenarios in all the physiographic regions the findings of this study are in line with the results of pandey et al 2019 the net water yield is expected to rise from the nf to the mf under rcp 4 5 whereas it will decrease from the nf to the mf under rcp 8 5 similar results are shown in the koshi basin of nepal where the precipitation is likely to increase in the upper part of the basin in the nf and mf whereas a decrease in the lower part of the basin in nf similarly evapotranspiration is also expected to increase in the central and upper part of the koshi basin moreover water yield is also expected to intensify in most parts of the basin bharati et al 2014 results further indicate that the flows in the west seti river are expected to increase whereas the flows in the budhi ganga river are expected to decrease the average streamflow in the basin is expected to increase by 5 9 in the nf and by 19 2 in the mf for rcp 4 5 and by 15 in the nf and by 11 8 in the mf under rcp 8 5 similar trends are reported in a study in the purna river basin of india by nilawar and waikar 2019 as well as in the blue nile basin in ethiopia with an increase of 22 to 27 in streamflow wagena et al 2016 in addition under different climate change scenarios the change in river flow up to 36 is reported in the yarmouk river which is a transboundary river basin between jordan and syria abdulla and al shurafat 2020 and between 7 6 to 13 5 increase in the bang pakong prachin buri river basin in thailand okwala et al 2020 table 5 presents the results for the high q5 flow equaled or exceeded at 5 of the time average q50 flow equaled or exceeded at 50 of the time and low q95 flow equaled or exceeded at 95 of the time flows during the near future and mid future periods for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the low flows in the river are expected to decrease whereas the high flows are expected to increase in the future a similar trend of high magnitude flood occurrence is expected in the bang pakong prachin buri river basin in thailand okwala et al 2020 and eight major river basins of eastern china xia et al 2017 in addition increase in dry months resulting in frequent drought occurrence is expected in the pajaro river basin in the u s a bhandari et al 2020 as well as dominancy of dry spells till the end of the century is expected in ankara in turkey danandeh et al 2020 this could result in less water availability in the dry season in contrast during the rainy season the increased flows may result in flooding this however gives an opportunity to harness the river flows during the rainy season by developing water resources which could help in mitigating the scarcity of water in the dry season the natural balance of the basin water s balance components and its ecosystem services may be altered by changes in streamflow which may have an adverse effect on the himalayan catchments khadka et al 2014 analysis of the flow duration curve shows the impact of climate change on different flow regimes in the wsrb fig 9 the low flows also indicate less water in the basin during the dry season which may result in drought and that would affect meeting the water demand as well these variations in the frequency of high flow and scarcity of water will hinder the volume and quality of proper drinking water and agricultural activity as well as ecosystem planning singh and goyal 2017 therefore proper watershed and water management interventions like afforestation on farm conservation infiltration ponds reservoirs operation policies water harvesting measures and water demand management should be promoted in addition provisions for proper drinking water reservoir safety and early warning systems should be considered as preventive measures in the flood prone areas to promote better water resources management in the basin nilawar and waikar 2019 land use changes must also be taken into consideration along with climate change in such hydrologic studies various studies have reported uncertainties in future climate and forecast of streamflow hagemann et al 2013 identified hydrologic model uncertainty as predominant in impact assessment further studies are recommended on analyzing various uncertainties involved in such impact assessment and analysis based on this study s results it is recommended that the expected increase in river flows in the future should be considered as an opportunity by relevant ministries and departments agencies in nepal for better planning and management of water resources in the basin especially considering the climate adapted west seti hydroelectric project which lies in the high mountain region several aspects are to be considered for better watershed management to reduce disaster risk 4 conclusions this research in the west seti river basin wsrb of nepal evaluated the climate change impacts on water balance components and hydrological extremes the swat model was used for the hydrological simulations in the basin the performance of the model was robust in terms of simulating hydrological flow patterns for both daily and monthly time series future climatic conditions were represented by three rcms under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 bias correction of rcms projected temperatures and precipitation was done using quantile mapping and linear scaling methods respectively both maximum and minimum temperatures in the future are projected to increase in the study basin however the minimum temperature will experience a higher increase compared to the maximum temperature a higher fluctuation with an overall rise in precipitation is expected in the wsrb in future periods precipitation is expected to increase more in the mid future period for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 compared to the near future the middle mountain region will experience an increase in average annual precipitation under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in both near future and mid future conditions compared to high mountain and high himalayas as expected due to an increase in precipitation water yield in all physiographic regions and under all future periods is likely to increase with a higher rise in the middle mountain region it is interesting to note that the evapotranspiration in the high himalayas is expected to have a higher increase than the middle mountain and high mountain regions for both rcp scenarios and future periods likewise most part of the basin will experience a rise in streamflow for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in comparison to the baseline reduction in the low flows and increase in the high flows are expected in the study basin which indicates that water resource development such as for irrigation and hydropower could be options to explore and avail the opportunity due to expected climate change in the basin whereas the proposed development project west seti hydropower should consider the climate induced risk at the planning stage similarly the development of other water related infrastructures should also consider climate

1028,this study aims to evaluate the impacts of climate change on water balance components mainly precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration and hydrological extremes in three physiographic regions namely the middle mountain region the high mountain region and the high himalayas region of the west seti river basin wsrb in nepal the future climate was projected using the climate data of three regional climate models rcms the projected future climate data was then fed into the hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate hydrologic responses including water balance components under future climate conditions results showed that the middle mountain region of the basin is expected to receive the highest increase of in precipitation 11 2 and in water yield 18 2 as compared to the other two physiographic regions conversely the high himalayas are expected to have the highest increase of evapotranspiration 19 9 as compared to the middle mountain and high mountain regions similarly the low flows in the basin are expected to decrease by 15 5 and 19 3 under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively whereas high flows are expected to increase by 10 7 under both the rcp scenarios the results of this study will be helpful to planners and decision makers to formulate adaptation strategies in water resources development and planning such as irrigation and hydropower development 1 introduction nepalese river basins are highly vulnerable to climate change the west seti river basin wsrb drained by the seti river is one of the most vulnerable basins with regard to the probable effects of climate change gurung et al 2015 several studies reported that the basin is highly sensitive with the coping capacity of the community to react with climate induced hazards such as floods landslides droughts siddiqui et al 2012 due to the varied physiography and topography of the wsrb the water resources planners face difficulties and with the likely climate change deglaciation in the himalayan region will have a prominent consequence in the basin both physical and climatic factors that affect the vulnerability are to be considered for water resources planning and development therefore evaluation of the impact of climate change in different physiographic regions is necessary for water resources planning development and management anthropogenically induced climate change is manifested globally in the past as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns and in sea levels rise these have an impact on hydrological processes which in turn affect all aspects of water management the close relationship that exists between water management and socio economic development proves that achieving sustainable development goals for water food production and poverty alleviation is a major challenge with respect to climate change the 5th assessment report ar5 by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that global ocean and land temperatures have increased by 0 85 c over the period of 1880 2012 ipcc 2014 the global average temperature increase is projected to be between 0 3 c to 4 8 c by the end of the century stocker 2014 the quality availability and supply of water may be affected due to the impact of climate change in water resources middelkoop et al 2001 there is a significant variation in the spatial and temporal distribution of water on the earth s surface which will further be aggravated due to the impacts of climate change studies reported the potential fluctuations in precipitation among wet and dry areas and seasons stocker 2014 and himalayan basins are particularly sensitive to the changing climate a rise in streamflow in the future is projected due to changes in precipitation and glaciers melting immerzeel et al 2013 water availability is projected to increase in the 21st century in himalayan basins as the streamflow here is dominated by snow and glacier melt lutz et al 2014 the consequences of increased flows will be experienced as an increase in the frequency of hydro meteorological extremes leading to more frequent and more intense natural disasters hence it is very important to understand the seasonal patterns of precipitation and temperature in mountainous regions and the impacts that they have may on water resources ficklin et al 2009 several studies reported that climate variability and its frequency are reflected by climate models such as general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms the understanding of future climate changes is depicted by these gcms and rcms with the help of physical components of the atmospheric climate system gosling and arnell 2016 since gcms have a coarser resolution rcms have been widely used due to its high spatial resolution for the depiction of future temperature and precipitation in a basin anjum et al 2019 representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios that estimate the radiative forcing rf that are based on the multi model ensembles of coupled model intercomparison phase five cmip5 taylor et al 2012 these rcps are the major source of high resolution climate variation and change studies and different rcp consists of various presumption of population economy land use and energy use tapiador et al 2019 the climate scenarios projected by climate models are often fed into hydrologic models for studying the impact of climate change on water resources these hydrologic models simulate the hydrologic processes in a watershed the geophysical and socio economic conditions of nepal make it more susceptible to climate change aryal and rajkarnikar 2011 with considerable temporal and seasonal variations in key climatic parameters nepal has a diverse climate condition that ranges from the tropical climate in the south to alpine climate in its northern regions shrestha and aryal 2011 these changes can alter the responses of hydrologic systems leading to glacier retreats the disappearance of natural springs loss of or operative changes in wetlands and increased divergence in streamflow these impacts will undermine the livelihoods of the people of nepal particularly the poor aryal and rajkarnikar 2011 the impacts are also expected to be higher at smaller spatial and temporal scales bharati et al 2014 studies reveal a rise up to 5 8 c on the average surface temperature in nepal towards the end of this century bartlett et al 2010 the fluctuations in temperature and precipitation patterns directly alter the hydrological regime of the basins the projected annual increases in flow indicate that parts of nepal such as the bagmati river basin may become wetter in the future babel et al 2014 the ensemble of gcms results predict the increase in future streamflow in bheri river basin which is located in the far western region of nepal the expected increase is between 6 2 to 7 3 and 6 0 to 12 5 in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively mishra et al 2018 in the kaligandagi river basin of nepal the water yield would increase up to 41 to 51 and evapotranspiration will increase 7 to 14 under different scenarios by the end of the century bajracharya et al 2018 the government of nepal is planning to build a hydropower project with a capacity of 750 mw in the wsrb to solve the electricity cutoffs during peak demand as well as to bring economic benefit to the country extreme variability in precipitation due to change in climate will have an adverse effect on such development projects by increasing the risk from flash floods sedimentation and large boulders also as most of the hydroelectric plants are run of the river type which could be threatened due to prolonged drought situations climate induced drought conditions could also affect the ecological flow in the lower physiographic region to fill this knowledge gap this study projected future climate scenarios and their impacts on water balance components in the different physiographic regions in the study basin furthermore this study also analyzed the changes in high and low flows due to the changing climate which will affect the water resources development projects in the basin three selected rcms and two future rcp scenarios for each rcms were used in the study for a baseline of 1986 to 2005 and two future time periods near future nf from 2021 to 2040 and mid future mf from 2041 to 2060 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wsrb fig 1 extends from latitude 30 04 n to 28 56 n and longitude 80 36 e to 81 36 e and has a catchment area of 7 427 km2 facing south with the slant of the himalayas the river in this basin emerges from the glaciers and snowfields around the peaks of api and nampa the elevation varies from 335 meters above sea level m a s l at the basin outlet to 7043 m a s l at the high mountain range that includes the peaks of api and nampa the average elevation of the basin is approximately 2505 m a s l based on the geology elevation climate agriculture industry and people nepal is categorized into five physiographic regions terai the siwalik hills the middle mountain region the high mountain region and the high himalayas these regions cover 14 13 30 20 and 23 of the total area respectively matthews 2001 the elevation ranges of the physiographic regions are terai 100 to 200 m a s l siwalik 700 to 1 500 m a s l middle mountain 1 500 to 2 700 m a s l high mountain 2 000 to 4 000 m a s l and high himalayas are 4 000 to 8 848 m a s l shrestha and aryal 2011 the southernmost terai region is the most fertile area where intensive agriculture is practiced the siwalik region is rough and uneven and is often adversely affected by natural disasters such as floods and landslides the middle mountain region supports a large human population and although most of the area is rugged topography agriculture occupies a substantial part of the region the high mountain region lies under the snow line followed by the northernmost high himalayan region which extends up to the highest summit in the world matthews 2001 although nepal is classified as a subtropical region due to its distinctive physiographical as well as topographical distributions within a short extent of 140 km north to south it has vast climatic and environmental diversity shrestha and aryal 2011 in accordance with the physiographic regions mentioned above the wsrb covers three physiographic regions the middle mountain regions the high mountain region and the high himalayas each region respectively covers an area of 3001 km2 2734 km2 and 1692 km2 in the basin there are ten meteorological stations present in the study area and out of them three lies in the high mountain region and the remaining seven in the middle mountain region since the high himalayas region do not have any monitoring station aphrodite data were used as mentioned in section 2 2 in addition all three hydrological stations in the basin lie in the middle mountain region the average annual rainfall in the basin is 1980 mm 1986 to 2005 rainfall during winter december to february pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to september and post monsoon october and november seasons is 142 mm 262 mm 1518 mm and 57 mm respectively more than 75 of the annual rainfall in this basin is received during the monsoon season the average annual temperature in the basin is 19 c with an average minimum of 12 1 c and an average maximum of 25 8 c the annual average discharge of the west seti river is 296 2 m3 s 2 2 data 2 2 1 topographic soil and land use data the digital elevation model dem in this research was acquired from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model version 2 gdem v2 with a 1 arc second approximately 30 m at the equator resolution http reverb echo nasa gov reverb a major part of the area of the basin has an elevation between 2000 and 6000 m a s l as shown in supplementary fig s1 the maximum elevation is 7043 m a s l and minimum elevation is 335 m a s l in the basin the soil map of the year 1986 was acquired from the national land use project nlup in association with the ministry of land reform and management molrm nepal at scale 1 50 000 a total of 23 soil types are available in the basin the dominant soil types in the middle mountain region of the basin are eutric cambisols and chromic cambisols whereas the dominant soil type in the high mountain region is dystric regosols and in the high himalayas are rocky outcrop and snow cover the land use map of 300 m resolution for the year 2010 was obtained from the european space agency http due esrin esa int globcover ten different land use types are observed in the basin area with the maximum area occupied by deciduous and evergreen forests followed by agricultural land the middle mountain and the high mountain regions are predominantly covered by agricultural land and forests whereas the high himalayas region is mostly covered with snow and hay the dem soil and land use map are presented as in supplementary fig s2 s3 and s4 respectively 2 2 2 observed historical meteorological and hydrological data daily data of minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation from 1980 to 2014 were gathered from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal the upper area of the basin where the station data is not available asian precipitation high resolved observational data integration aphrodite https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards data was used for the base period aphrodite s project on water resources has been conducted since 2006 with a grid size of 0 250 above the monsoon asia region yatagai et al 2012 it is found that the aphrodite dataset could be incorporated in the high himalayan region along with available temperature and precipitation station data depending on the data availability and placement ten meteorological stations were used in the study from dhm and the aphrodite data was used at two locations fig 1 these data have not been corrected to any wind effect in addition the homogeneity test of the observed data was conducted based on cumulative deviations from the mean as suggested by buishand 1982 data from the meteorological stations were spatially interpolated using the thiessen polygon technique and input to the hydrologic model to produce a gridded map of climate input the higher elevation region of the basin is mountainous with peaks and valleys hence the interpolated meteorological data was not able to exactly represent the variability of the mountainous region therefore lapse rates of temperature and precipitation were taken within each sub basin to extrapolate temperature and distribute precipitation based on the different elevations in each band the temperature and precipitation were calculated as a function of lapse rate and the gage and the average elevation variation was specified for each band neitsch et al 2011 based on the availability of temperature stations an average temperature lapse rate of 5 3 c km was calculated similarly depending on the available precipitation stations the average precipitation lapse rate of 200 mm km was calculated table 1 presents the meteorological stations and data available for each specific station with the hydrological stations in and near the study basin the correlation plot between observed station data and aphrodite data is illustrated in supplementary fig s5 it is established that there is a consistent bias between the observed data at the stations and data from aphrodite the monthly bias correlation factor was determined using the aphrodite climate data with observed climate data and based on the factor bias correction was applied to the aphrodite station data that was used in the study three hydrological stations as given in table 1 were considered for calibration and validation of the hydrologic model at outlet the banga station the average annual discharge is 296 2 m3 s 2 2 3 future climate data five rcms developed by csiro marine and atmospheric

statistics namely the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae as presented in supplementary table s1 access gfdl and mpi with a grid size of 0 5 0 5 were chosen for future climate data analysis these rcms were downloaded from the http cccr tropmet res in home index jsp cordex data website daily historical 1970 to 2005 data and future climate data 2006 to 2099 with emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were used for the analysis the rcp 4 5 scenario is a stabilization scenario which means the radiative forcing level stabilizes at 4 5 w m2 before 2100 by the employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions whereas rcp 8 5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions leading to a radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 at the end of the century a total of five grid cells of the selected rcms covered the study basin for the climate change and impact analysis the climate data of baseline bl period of 1985 2005 and the future periods classified as near future nf i e 2021 to 2040 and far future ff i e 2041 to 2060 were taken from the outputs of the selected rcms since gfdl had future data available only till 2070 the period of analysis considered for this study was untill 2060 2 3 methodology the presented study in wsrb evaluated the future climate and its consequences on three major water balance components considering the physiographic regions soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to simulate the hydrology and water balance components in the basin fig

the resolution vintage representativeness and validity smith et al 1998 it is necessary to bias correct the outputs from selected rcms based on the performance statistics r2 for precipitation quantile mapping showed preferable results in comparison to linear scaling while for temperature linear scaling was found to be better than the quantile mapping as stated in section 2 2 3 identified three models were bias corrected using linear scaling and quantile mapping for future climate data rcm simulated temperature data bias were removed using linear scaling fang et al 2015 and precipitation data bias were removed using quantile mapping maraun 2013 2 3 2 hydrological modeling hydrological assessment in the study was conducted by applying a hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat which is a semi distributed physical based model widely used to simulate hydrology and obtain water balance components to analysis different management scenarios neitsch et al 2011 it distributes a watershed into multiple sub watersheds or sub basins for simulation these are additionally apportioned into hydrological response units hrus which are a coalition of land use soil type and management properties neitsch et al 2011 the water balance eq 1 is used to simulate the hydrologic cycle 1 sw c t sw c 0 i 1 n r day q surf ace e a w seep q gw where t time day swc t mm of final water

threshold values of slope soil and land use thresholds used for land use soil and the slope were respectively 0 15 and 10 in the sub basin a total of 598 hrus were defined through this process ten elevation bands were selected within the sub basin to allow disparity in temperature and precipitation with respect to altitude over the basin grusson et al 2015 the hydrological model s performance was evaluated by the calibration and validation results the performance statistics of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias were used the observed streamflow data from three gauging stations were used for the calibration and validation of the hydrological model for daily and monthly flows for stations gopaghat and banga the period of 1986 to 1990 was used for calibration and 1991 to 1995 for validation a 5 year period from 1981 to 1985 was used as the warm up period for the model to reach an optimal state observed streamflow for the period from 2000 to 2003 for calibration and 2004 to 2005 for validation with a warm up period of 1995 to 1999 was used for mangalsen due to lack of availability of data the warm up period helps in stabilizing the initial conditions for groundwater and soil water storage fontaine et al 2002 in this study a manual calibration based on a trial and error approach was used it focused on model parameters that were considered most sensitive as reported by gurung et al 2015 2 3 3 analysis of water balance components water balance in the swat model plays a very crucial role and consists of all the processes happening within the basin neitsch et al 2011 the principal water balance components are precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration ayivi and jha 2018 eq 2 and eq 3 shows the

discussion 3 1 future climate scenarios the performance of bias correction for chainpur station is illustrated in supplementary table s2 the bias corrected temperatures show a very good correlation with the observed temperatures both minimum and maximum temperatures data observed and corrected matched quite well for minimum temperature biases are higher in the winter months whereas for maximum temperature biases are higher in the summer months supplementary fig s6 the quantile mapping method was used for the bias correction of rainfall data bias correction of rcm simulated rainfall data shows correction in the mean as well as an improvement in the rmse mae and r2 values this confirmed the validation of this method the mpi model is more reliable than the other two in simulating precipitation for access and gfdl the biases are higher during the monsoon period supplementary fig s7 fig 3 a and b shows the annual average maximum and minimum temperatures of the selected rcms for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively and their ensembles which is the weighted average giving equal weights to all rcms an increase in both temperatures is projected in the future for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the increase is higher under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 the average rise in maximum temperature lies between 0 5 to 3 2 c under rcp 4 5 and 0 5 to 4 7 c under rcp 8 5 in the case of precipitation also an increase in the future is projected under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 fig 4 a and b and a large inter annual variability is seen in projected precipitation the average annual precipitation is projected to increase by 6 2 under rcp 4 5 and 7 under rcp 8 5 projected seasonal changes in maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation are described in supplementary table s3 s4 and s5 respectively all the rcms project both the temperatures to increase in all the seasons the maximum temperature increase in the summer season mam in the nf is likely to range from 0 4 c to 2 1 c under rcp 4 5 and 0 7 c to 2 8 c under rcp 8 5 similar increases in the range of 0 9 c to 1 5 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 2 c to 2 2 c under rcp 8 5 are projected for the mf the minimum temperature in the winter season dec feb is expected to increase in the range of 0 7 c to 1 7 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 0 c to 2 3 c under rcp 8 5 in the nf the increase in minimum temperature in the mf is in the range of 0 8 c to 1 3 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 2 c to 1 6 c under rcp 8 5 projected seasonal precipitation increase is greater in the post monsoon season oct to nov except for mpi the other two rcms project an increase in post monsoon precipitation by up to 54 3 under rcp 4 5 under rcp 8 5 other than access the two rcms project similar post monsoon increases in precipitation up to 47 for the monsoon season precipitation increases are projected under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by all the rcms except access monsoon precipitation is projected to increase by 32 8 and 31 1 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 3 2 performance of hydrological modeling the calibration and validation outcome for the outlet banga is presented in fig 5 the model simulated hydrological processes in the study basin quite well for both daily calibration and validation periods except for some high flows the model performance for both calibration and validation given in table 2 indicate that it has performed well moriasi et al 2007 and can be used for simulating hydrologic behavior of the basin under future climate conditions the discrepancies in the performance statistics especially in pbias could be due to variation in daily observed and over and under simulated flows at three hydrological gauging stations with different watershed characteristics and areas used for calibration and validation as expected the model s performance is better for monthly flows than for daily flows this stipulates that long term flows are better simulated by the model than short term events the multi site calibration results also show that the flows are simulated better at the upstream stations as compared to the downstream ones the list of sensitive parameters in the model is shown in supplementary table s6 curve number cn2 was found as the most sensitive parameter followed by soil hydraulic conductivity sol k1 the model s results were also sensitive to the precipitation lapse rate plaps snow fall temperature sftmp snowmelt temperature smtmp and the alpha base flow factor alpha b 3 3 water balance in the wsrb the model run for the baseline 1986 to 2005 with the calibrated parameters estimated average annual values of the various components of water balance which are presented in table 3 the water balance components include precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration the annual average precipitation in the basin is 1979 5 mm and out of it only 3 5 of the precipitation is contributed by snowfall in the period of baseline the amount of snow melted and sublimed is more than that which falls surface runoff amounts to 15 9 of the average annual precipitation the average annual evapotranspiration accounts for 36 of the average annual precipitation in the basin 3 4 impact of climate change on water balance components 3 4 1 future precipitation the percentage change in ensemble mean precipitation during different future periods and under different emission scenarios is shown in fig 6 an increase in precipitation in the mf is higher than in the nf with even precipitation increases projected to be more than 15 from the baseline considering the different physiographic regions the middle mountain region will experience changes between 2 to 11 in precipitation in both the nf and the mf under both rcp scenarios under rcp 4 5 in the mf and rcp 8 5 in the nf all regions in the basin will experience an increase in precipitation whereas in the other two scenarios some regions will experience a decrease in precipitation similar results are reported by pandey et al 2019 3 4 2 future water yield in the high himalayas and a major part of the high mountains the water yield is projected to decrease in the nf and it is projected to increase in all the physiographic regions in the mf under rcp 4 5 however under rcp 8 5 more areas will experience a decrease in water yield in the mf than in the nf particularly in the high mountain region in the mid mountain region the areas that will experience a decrease in water yield in the nf under rcp 4 5 are projected to have a similar decreasing trend in the mf under rcp 8 5 under rcp 4 5 in the nf the majority of the basin area will experience a reduction in water yield whereas in the mf the majority of the area in the basin will have a projected increase in water yield in the range of 5 to 10 fig 7 other studies in nepal also show that the water yield is expected to increase in the future bajracharya et al 2018 3 4 3 future evapotranspiration the high himalayan region is expected to have more than a 15 increase in evapotranspiration in the nf as compared to the baseline values and this will further increase by more than 20 in the mf fig 8 similar increases are projected under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 most of the high mountain region is expected to have an increase in evapotranspiration in the range of 10 to 15 in both the nf and the mf under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the middle mountain region a majority of the area will have an et increase is in the range of 0 to 5 in nf and 5 to 10 in the mf bajracharya et al 2018 also reported similar results in the kaligandaki river basin in nepal 3 4 4 future water balance in the physiographic regions precipitation is expected to increase relatively more in the middle mountain region as compared to the other two physiographic regions of the basin table 4 additionally in the mf under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 there is a greater increase in precipitation as compared to the values in the nf in all the physiographic regions following the trend of precipitation water yield will also increase the maximum increase will be in the middle mountain region followed by the high mountain region and then the high himalayas conversely the percentage change in evapotranspiration in the high himalayas is more than in the other two physiographic regions an increase in evapotranspiration in all regions suggests the significant role of warming temperatures in water balance components the changes in evapotranspiration with elevation might result in some phenological shifts or other vegetation responses the precipitation increase in the basin is projected to range from 11 to 37 in the different physiographic regions the high mountain region will experience a slight increase while the middle mountain region a much higher increase alike precipitation water yield is also expected to increase by about 30 to 62 in the three physiographic regions of the basin furthermore evapotranspiration is projected to increase by about 5 2 to 35 in the three physiographic regions of the basin these projected changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration follow a gradual increase from the nf to the mf under both rcp scenarios in all the physiographic regions the findings of this study are in line with the results of pandey et al 2019 the net water yield is expected to rise from the nf to the mf under rcp 4 5 whereas it will decrease from the nf to the mf under rcp 8 5 similar results are shown in the koshi basin of nepal where the precipitation is likely to increase in the upper part of the basin in the nf and mf whereas a decrease in the lower part of the basin in nf similarly evapotranspiration is also expected to increase in the central and upper part of the koshi basin moreover water yield is also expected to intensify in most parts of the basin bharati et al 2014 results further indicate that the flows in the west seti river are expected to increase whereas the flows in the budhi ganga river are expected to decrease the average streamflow in the basin is expected to increase by 5 9 in the nf and by 19 2 in the mf for rcp 4 5 and by 15 in the nf and by 11 8 in the mf under rcp 8 5 similar trends are reported in a study in the purna river basin of india by nilawar and waikar 2019 as well as in the blue nile basin in ethiopia with an increase of 22 to 27 in streamflow wagena et al 2016 in addition under different climate change scenarios the change in river flow up to 36 is reported in the yarmouk river which is a transboundary river basin between jordan and syria abdulla and al shurafat 2020 and between 7 6 to 13 5 increase in the bang pakong prachin buri river basin in thailand okwala et al 2020 table 5 presents the results for the high q5 flow equaled or exceeded at 5 of the time average q50 flow equaled or exceeded at 50 of the time and low q95 flow equaled or exceeded at 95 of the time flows during the near future and mid future periods for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the low flows in the river are expected to decrease whereas the high flows are expected to increase in the future a similar trend of high magnitude flood occurrence is expected in the bang pakong prachin buri river basin in thailand okwala et al 2020 and eight major river basins of eastern china xia et al 2017 in addition increase in dry months resulting in frequent drought occurrence is expected in the pajaro river basin in the u s a bhandari et al 2020 as well as dominancy of dry spells till the end of the century is expected in ankara in turkey danandeh et al 2020 this could result in less water availability in the dry season in contrast during the rainy season the increased flows may result in flooding this however gives an opportunity to harness the river flows during the rainy season by developing water resources which could help in mitigating the scarcity of water in the dry season the natural balance of the basin water s balance components and its ecosystem services may be altered by changes in streamflow which may have an adverse effect on the himalayan catchments khadka et al 2014 analysis of the flow duration curve shows the impact of climate change on different flow regimes in the wsrb fig 9 the low flows also indicate less water in the basin during the dry season which may result in drought and that would affect meeting the water demand as well these variations in the frequency of high flow and scarcity of water will hinder the volume and quality of proper drinking water and agricultural activity as well as ecosystem planning singh and goyal 2017 therefore proper watershed and water management interventions like afforestation on farm conservation infiltration ponds reservoirs operation policies water harvesting measures and water demand management should be promoted in addition provisions for proper drinking water reservoir safety and early warning systems should be considered as preventive measures in the flood prone areas to promote better water resources management in the basin nilawar and waikar 2019 land use changes must also be taken into consideration along with climate change in such hydrologic studies various studies have reported uncertainties in future climate and forecast of streamflow hagemann et al 2013 identified hydrologic model uncertainty as predominant in impact assessment further studies are recommended on analyzing various uncertainties involved in such impact assessment and analysis based on this study s results it is recommended that the expected increase in river flows in the future should be considered as an opportunity by relevant ministries and departments agencies in nepal for better planning and management of water resources in the basin especially considering the climate adapted west seti hydroelectric project which lies in the high mountain region several aspects are to be considered for better watershed management to reduce disaster risk 4 conclusions this research in the west seti river basin wsrb of nepal evaluated the climate change impacts on water balance components and hydrological extremes the swat model was used for the hydrological simulations in the basin the performance of the model was robust in terms of simulating hydrological flow patterns for both daily and monthly time series future climatic conditions were represented by three rcms under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 bias correction of rcms projected temperatures and precipitation was done using quantile mapping and linear scaling methods respectively both maximum and minimum temperatures in the future are projected to increase in the study basin however the minimum temperature will experience a higher increase compared to the maximum temperature a higher fluctuation with an overall rise in precipitation is expected in the wsrb in future periods precipitation is expected to increase more in the mid future period for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 compared to the near future the middle mountain region will experience an increase in average annual precipitation under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in both near future and mid future conditions compared to high mountain and high himalayas as expected due to an increase in precipitation water yield in all physiographic regions and under all future periods is likely to increase with a higher rise in the middle mountain region it is interesting to note that the evapotranspiration in the high himalayas is expected to have a higher increase than the middle mountain and high mountain regions for both rcp scenarios and future periods likewise most part of the basin will experience a rise in streamflow for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in comparison to the baseline reduction in the low flows and increase in the high flows are expected in the study basin which indicates that water resource development such as for irrigation and hydropower could be options to explore and avail the opportunity due to expected climate change in the basin whereas the proposed development project west seti hydropower should consider the climate induced risk at the planning stage similarly the development of other water related infrastructures should also consider climate

1029,intensive plantation management can affect catchment conditions especially in large clear cut areas that expose soil thereby encouraging sediment transport to streams harvesting strategies are needed to reduce these effects while enabling commercial logging in this study we examined the effects of harvested areas in suspended sediment production by selecting three catchments covered by eucalyptus spp forests with 15 60 and 88 harvested areas hereafter h15 h60 and h88 respectively and monitoring suspended sediment during two years we compared two approaches of estimating annual suspended sediment weekly grab samples vs weekly grab samples bottle traps proportion harvest and suspended sediment yields were directly related on an annual basis such differences were more notable for h15 and h88 h60 had intermediate values annual suspended sediment yields ranged from 3 0 to 208 2 kg ha 1 year 1 and in addition to harvest proportion presence of buffer riparian forest possibly reduced concentrations of suspended sediments in streams the use of weekly grab samples underestimated tss yields graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword forest management riparian buffer

annual streamflow bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2013 streamflow typically increases with increasing proportion of a catchment harvested hornbeck et al 1993 stednick 1996 the magnitude of streamflow increase is greater in larger clear cut areas jones 2000 forest plantations managed in large scale can present higher clear cut areas which can contribute also to nonpoint source sediment especially at timber harvesting stott and mount 2004 in brazil forest plantations occupy approximately 7 83 million hectares primarily in the south and southeast iba 2019 eucalyptus forests in brazil are considered fast growing plantations since they usually have an optimum rotation period between 6 and 8 years and their productivity ranges from 25 to 60 m³ ha 1 year 1 gonçalves et al 2013 current brazilian environmental law the native vegetation protection law law n 12 651 2012 prohibit all types of plantations near streams and require a buffer zone preferably with native vegetation of at least 30 meters around streams and springs brazil is the leader in eucalyptus pulpwood production creating the largest area of eucalypt forest plantations worldwide brockerhoff et al 2013 however few studies have assessed the effects of harvest especially in suspended sediment yields at catchment scale vital et al 1999 câmara and lima 1999 ranzini and lima 2002 guimarães et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2019 moreover few studies have assessed the effect of the proportion of tropical forest harvest on suspended sediment yields at the catchment scale in the present paper we investigated the effects of the proportion of plantation area harvested on total suspended sediments in forest catchment streams we aimed to answer the following questions i how does the proportion of harvested area affect sediment production and ii is there a within season effect on suspended sediment production in estimating sediment yield the question raised was iii is there an underestimation in weekly sampling of suspended sediment production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in the itatinga forest science station eecfi of the university of são paulo located approximately 200 km west of são paulo city brazil fig 1 the climate is humid temperate with dry winters and hot summers the mean annual rainfall is 1 372 7 mm and the mean annual temperature is 19 7 c with maximum and minimum temperatures of 28 c and 9 c respectively cepagri 2015 the predominant soils in the area were typic and rhodic hapludox following the us soil taxonomy gonçalves et al 2012 the former soil type was loamy sandy to sandy clayey clay 16 silt 2 and sand 82 covering approximately 95 of catchments h60 and h88 the latter soil type in turn had higher clay content clay 32 silt 6 and sand 62 and covered approximately 60 of catchment h15 with the remaining 40 covered by typic hapludox gonçalves et al 2012 our three catchments tinga forquilha and monjolinho were harvested at different proportions 15 60 and 88 respectively table 1 for this reason hereafter they are referred to as h15 h60 and h88 respectively in each catchment native riparian forest was also present but in different proportions table 1 eucalyptus forest was harvested from february to march 2014 using a conventional rubber tire harvester during harvesting no tillage management was adopted and eucalyptus residues such as branches and leaves remained on the soil surface 2 2 hydrological data collection streamflow in all three catchments was measured at 15 minute intervals using an h type flume coupled with hobo water level loggers u20 onset the maximum streamflow of these flumes are 0 15 m³ s ¹ bos 1989 rainfall data were obtained from a rain gauge tr 5251 texas electronics at a meteorological station located in the eefci fig 1 the referred gauge continually recorded rainfall at 30 minute intervals 2 3 total suspended sediment sampling and analysis water samples for the determination of total suspended sediments tsss were collected from the h flumes for two years after harvest from march 2014 to february 2016 tsss were measured by three different procedures i grab samples on a weekly basis 1 liter bottle made of high density polyethylene were sent to the laboratory for analysis following apha standards 2005 ii a rising stage sampler bottle trap was used to collect suspended sediments during storm flow bottle trap samples were collected whenever the water level exceeded 0 12 m which corresponds to 0 008 m³ s ¹ and iii when storm flow was sampled with bottle traps base flow samples or fallen limbs were manually collected at least 3 days after the rainfall events for procedures ii and iii the tss concentrations were obtained by the gravimetric method described in ess 1993 suspended sediment yield kg ha 1 was calculated by multiplying half of the cumulative volume between the preceding and the subsequent tss samples by the tss concentration of the particular sample on a monthly and annual basis as described by hopmans and bren 2007 in addition the same procedure has been repeated including the data from the rising stage sampler 2 4 data analysis data distributions were non normal so the effect of different harvest areas on suspended sediments was assessed through the kruskal wallis test the mann whitney pairwise test was used when a difference was detected in the former test these tests were applied i for all months of the study period ii for the dry and rainy season iii for storm and base flow samples and iv for grab samples suspended sediment estimate vs grab samples bottle traps suspended sediment estimate all statistical tests were carried out using past statistical software with significance at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 hydrological data the total rainfall observed in the first and second year after harvest were 1 241 mm and 2 336 mm respectively annual rainfall was 10 below the mean annual rainfall for the region 1 372 7 mm in the first year whereas in the second year it was 70 above it the total rainfall in the months of june and october in the first year and june in the second year after harvest were below 10 mm which is at least seven times lower than expected fig 2 while in july september november and january of the second year after harvest the total monthly rainfall was at least twice the expected fig 2 we observed 202 and 259 rainfall events in the first year and in the second year after harvest respectively fig 3 a the majority of the rainfall events 87 in the first year and 83 in the second year after harvest were light rainfalls with intensities lower than 5 mm h 1 there were six heavy rainfall events with intensities higher than 15 mm h 1 distributed evenly in the two studied years the highest observed intensity was 24 2 mm h 1 at january 25 2016 daily streamflow varied widely in all catchments fig 3b d the annual streamflow for the first year after harvest were 160 mm 36 mm and 37 mm and for the second year after harvest were 204 mm 81 mm and 120 mm for h15 h60 and h88 respectively 3 2 total suspended sediment although catchment h15 had a streamflow more than four times higher in the first year and 60 higher in the second year than streamflow observed in h60 and h88 it had the lowest variation of tss concentration fig 3b d the tss concentration medians were 1 3 mg l 1 4 3 mg l 1 and 6 3 mg l 1 for the first year and 2 0 mg l 1 5 3 mg l 1 and 7 7 mg l 1 for the second year for catchments h15 h60 and h88 respectively tss concentrations differed significantly between all catchments in both study years significant differences in tss concentrations for both base and storm flow conditions were detected table 2 that is h15 presented tss concentrations lower than those of h60 and h88 which in turn did not present significant differences the tss concentrations during storm flow ranged from 37 5 mg l 1 to 1 377 3 mg l 1 despite temporal differences in streamflow and tss concentrations monthly suspended sediment yields estimated by the weekly grab samples and estimated with the addition of bottle traps from the catchments did not present significant differences when analyzing the whole study period 24 months supplementary material the seasonal analysis of tss yields measured by weekly grab samples indicated no significant difference between the dry april to september and the rainy season from october to march in the catchments fig 4 a however when adding bottle trap data seasonal differences in tss monthly yields were detected in each catchment fig 4b all the catchments presented lower values for the dry season than for the rainy season the medians of monthly suspended sediment yield for the dry season were 0 37 kg ha 1 0 68 kg ha 1 and 0 66 kg ha 1 while for the rainy season were 3 91 kg ha 1 4 90 kg ha 1 and 5 64 kg ha 1 for the catchments h15 h60 and h88 respectively the cumulative suspended sediment yields for the catchments showed differences in total exports between catchments especially during the rainy season fig 5 following the cumulative tss yields data month by month it is possible to notice that catchments had similar tss yields in the first months of monitoring however as soon as the rainfalls started the tss yields differ between catchments being higher for h88 sediment yields followed this order h15 h60 h88 annual tss yields for catchments ranged from 3 0 kg ha 1 year 1 to 13 1 kg ha 1 year 1 for the two years after harvest when using the grab samples data fig 6 although no significant differences were detected between the monthly suspended sediment yields for the overall study period the annual suspended sediment yield of h88 was approximately two times higher than that of h15 in both years of study and also higher than h60 for the first year in the second year h60 was only 40 higher than h15 the addition of bottle traps generated a substantially higher annual suspended sediment yields compared to the weekly grab samples ranging from 12 8 kg ha 1 year 1 to 208 2 kg ha 1 year 1 fig 6 tss yields of catchment h88 was twice the value of h15 for both studied years h60 presented a tss yield more than two times higher of h15 for the first year and 37 higher in the second year despite maintaining the same pattern of difference between catchments the differences in tss yield between both approaches was at least of four times higher in the first year and fifteen times higher in the second year after harvest fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 proportion of harvested area affecting suspended sediment production our annual suspended solid estimates were directly related to harvest proportion given that the higher proportion of forest harvested exposes a larger soil surface area to rainfall increasing the potential to mobilize soil particles and increase sediment yields indeed other studies have reported that vegetation cover was negatively related to erosion jones 2000 slesak et al 2015 our study showed that this response is similar for fast growing eucalyptus plantations our reported annual tss yields from 3 0 to 208 2 kg ha 1 year 1 are in the same range of values from other studies reported for brazilian catchments especially for the catchment with the highest proportion of harvest area h88 brazilian studies reported tss yields from 8 5 to 151 5 kg ha 1 year 1 câmara and lima 1999 ranzini and lima 2002 rodrigues et al 2019 vital et al 1999 the reported suspended sediment annual yields were below 1 000 kg ha 1 year 1 which is the value expected for undisturbed forest catchments in the tropics brujinzeel 2004 furthermore the substantially low range of values in brazil compared to the 560 1 070 kg ha 1 year 1 reported in the usa see fraser et al 2012 can be explained in part by the fact that the tsss in the usa originated from shallower soils and steeper slopes previous studies have also highlighted catchments that show no response to harvesting hancock et al 2017 hatten et al 2018 or forest management on tss hopmans and ben 2007 and catchments that returned to pre harvest tss values in short time macdonald et al 2003 smith et al 2012 webb et al 2012 more studies are needed to understand if the low range of tss values observed in brazil could show that tss yields return to pre harvest values in a relatively short time 8 years suggesting that the quick canopy closure of fast growing forest plantations gonçalves et al 2013 could improve soil protection and reduce the tss effect of forest harvest in brazil comparing h15 and h88 given that these catchments have similar areas of forest plantations showed the effect of the proportion of harvested area where h15 had significantly lower tss concentrations and annual suspended sediment yields these results indicated that despite some soil disturbance that might have been present in the forest plantation catchments see salemi et al 2013 the remaining stands of eucalyptus are a type of forest cover that promotes soil protection put another way the high proportion of soil cover provided by the eucalyptus forest aboveground biomass plus litter similar to any other type of effective soil cover contributed to reducing the tss yields although h15 presented only 8 riparian forest buffer it had 77 forest plantations cover this supports the statement of including stands of different ages in the same catchment ferraz et al 2013 as a strategy to avoid substantial variations in suspended sediment yields and streamflow caused by harvesting catchments h60 and h88 had 100 of their eucalyptus plantations harvested showing the effects of the riparian native forest buffer when analyzing the annual tss yields h88 presented values higher than those of h60 therefore this suggests that the higher the riparian forest buffer area lead to lower the annual suspended sediment yield which is in agreement with a study carried out in chile in watersheds dominated by eucalyptus forest plantations little et al 2015 riparian forest buffers can mitigate some sediment loading by filtering runoff croke and hairsine 2006 however observing the data from the three catchments together showed that the effect of the harvested proportion is apparently greater than the effect of the riparian forest buffer proportion on the tss yields since there is a limitation of riparian buffer to filter sediments depending of land use intensity guidotti et al 2020 we established a ratio between the proportion of harvested area and the proportion of riparian forest buffer area to explain the tss yield differences we observed that the tss response to this relationship becomes more evident when we increase the weight of the harvested area fig 7 thus the mitigation capacity of the riparian forest area is unable to minimize the impact of the large harvested areas this shows the importance of properly planning forest harvests considering the catchment delimitations and the harvest proportion areas considering the adjusted logarithms curves to observed data it is interesting to note an inflection point near proportion of riparian buffer of h60 60 of harvesting below this native proportion maintenance 40 tss yield seems to be more sensitive to variation of native proportion on catchments which corroborate with spavorek et al 2002 also this suggest that the maintenance of native vegetation on catchments in order to reduce sediment loads from harvesting disturbance could follow a threshold around 30 50 similar to that observed on biological conservation studies martensen et al 2012 brejão et al 2018 this requires further investigation to guide forest planning to reduce sediment yields irrespective of the riparian buffer size it has a limited capacity to hold sediment and it is more effective to reduce and control sediment production in the managed areas guidotti et al 2020 thus other forestry practices can minimize the effects of forest plantations such as implementing forest age mosaic planning establishing longer rotations or the reduction of forest plantation proportions within the catchment ferraz et al 2013 we suggest that for plantations with very short harvest cycles that usually harvest large proportions of the catchment such as eucalyptus forests plantations in brazil these forestry practices be adopted even if there is already the presence of riparian forest buffer 4 2 seasonal effect on suspended sediment production there was significant difference between the dry and rainy season in tss yields estimated with the addition of bottle traps in all catchments despite no difference was observed using only weekly grab samples the results demonstrated the effects of soil exposure due to harvest on suspended sediment yields during the first rainy season which has highest potential for suspended sediment detachment and transport borelli and schutt 2014 thus the increase of rainfall besides increases streamflow promote sediment load that consequently increases tss yields and this increase is higher in catchments with larger harvested area at this study site the effects of the rainfall were more pronounced with the increase of rainfall in the second rainy season 4 3 sampling methods on sediment estimates effects we compared two approaches of estimating annual suspended sediment weekly grab samples and weekly grab samples with the addition of bottle traps our reported annual tss yields estimated by weekly grab samples were in the lower range of the spectrum compared to other studies with the same method for example an earlier study carried out in h15 found an annual preharvest tss yield of 44 kg ha 1 year 1 and a postharvest yield of 60 6 kg ha 1 year 1 câmara and lima 1999 in addition two other studies reported values for eucalyptus catchments in sao paulo brazil one reported the value of 41 5 kg ha 1 year 1 vital et al 1999 and a recent study reported values from 8 5 to 151 5 kg ha 1 year 1 for four catchments after harvest rodrigues et al 2019 forestry companies often use the weekly samples to estimate harvest impacts in fast growing forest plantations in brazil however our study showed that this method could greatly underestimate the tss yields the weekly grab samples underestimated the suspended sediment yields with values approximately four to 18 times lower than those with the addition of bottle traps in our study the addition of the bottles in the estimative of tss yield promoted a significant increase demonstrating that most suspended sediments are generated mainly during storm flow the differences of tss concentration in base and storm flow contribute to this find sampling storm flow is important for headwater streams as differences between catchments on a weekly basis sampling are difficult to verify hopmans and bren 2007 currently there are other methods available for suspended sediment yield estimates such as the use of turbidity probes although they require a high initial investment and constant maintenance which restricts their use 5 5 uncertainties as most of the tss in small streams are composed of clay and silt ogden 1996 based on the predominance of soil type in each catchment it would be possible to argue that h15 would generate higher tss yields given that rhodic hapludox 32 and 6 of clay and silt respectively was present in 60 of this catchment and in less than 5 at h60 and h88 however our data revealed the exact opposite pattern h15 had the lowest tss yields probably reflecting the effect of forest cover rather than soil type in this study catchments contained deep soils and low slopes therefore it is necessary to carry out additional studies to observe the relationship between the impact of the proportion of forest

1029,intensive plantation management can affect catchment conditions especially in large clear cut areas that expose soil thereby encouraging sediment transport to streams harvesting strategies are needed to reduce these effects while enabling commercial logging in this study we examined the effects of harvested areas in suspended sediment production by selecting three catchments covered by eucalyptus spp forests with 15 60 and 88 harvested areas hereafter h15 h60 and h88 respectively and monitoring suspended sediment during two years we compared two approaches of estimating annual suspended sediment weekly grab samples vs weekly grab samples bottle traps proportion harvest and suspended sediment yields were directly related on an annual basis such differences were more notable for h15 and h88 h60 had intermediate values annual suspended sediment yields ranged from 3 0 to 208 2 kg ha 1 year 1 and in addition to harvest proportion presence of buffer riparian forest possibly

especially at timber harvesting stott and mount 2004 in brazil forest plantations occupy approximately 7 83 million hectares primarily in the south and southeast iba 2019 eucalyptus forests in brazil are considered fast growing plantations since they usually have an optimum rotation period between 6 and 8 years and their productivity ranges from 25 to 60 m³ ha 1 year 1 gonçalves et al 2013 current brazilian environmental law the native vegetation protection law law n 12 651 2012 prohibit all types of plantations near streams and require a buffer zone preferably with native vegetation of at least 30 meters around streams and springs brazil is the leader in eucalyptus pulpwood production creating the largest area of eucalypt forest plantations worldwide brockerhoff et al 2013 however few studies have assessed the effects of harvest especially in suspended sediment yields at catchment scale vital et al 1999 câmara and lima 1999 ranzini and lima 2002 guimarães et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2019 moreover few studies have assessed the effect of the proportion of tropical forest harvest on suspended sediment yields at the catchment scale in the present paper we investigated the effects of the proportion of plantation area harvested on total suspended sediments in forest catchment streams we aimed to answer the following questions i how does the proportion of harvested area affect sediment production and ii is there a within season effect on suspended sediment production in estimating sediment yield the question raised was iii is there an underestimation in weekly sampling of suspended sediment production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in the itatinga forest science station eecfi of the university of são paulo located approximately 200 km west of são paulo city brazil fig 1 the climate is humid temperate with dry winters and hot summers the mean annual rainfall is 1 372 7 mm and the mean annual temperature is 19 7 c with maximum and minimum temperatures of 28 c and 9 c respectively cepagri 2015 the predominant soils in the area were typic and rhodic hapludox following the us soil taxonomy gonçalves et al 2012 the former soil type was loamy sandy to sandy clayey clay 16 silt 2 and sand 82 covering approximately 95 of catchments h60 and h88 the latter soil type in turn had higher clay content clay 32 silt 6 and sand 62 and covered approximately 60 of catchment h15 with the remaining 40 covered by typic hapludox gonçalves et al 2012 our three catchments tinga forquilha and monjolinho were harvested at different proportions 15 60 and 88 respectively table 1 for this reason hereafter they are referred to as h15 h60 and h88 respectively in each catchment native riparian forest was also present but in different proportions table 1 eucalyptus forest was harvested from february to march 2014 using a conventional rubber tire harvester during harvesting no tillage management was adopted and eucalyptus residues such as branches and leaves remained on the soil surface 2 2 hydrological data collection streamflow in all three catchments was measured at 15 minute intervals using an h type flume coupled with hobo water level loggers u20 onset the maximum streamflow of these flumes are 0 15 m³ s ¹ bos 1989 rainfall data were obtained from a rain gauge tr 5251 texas electronics at a meteorological station located in the eefci fig 1 the referred gauge continually recorded rainfall at 30 minute intervals 2 3 total suspended sediment sampling and analysis water samples for the determination of total suspended sediments tsss were collected from the h flumes for two years after harvest from march 2014 to february 2016 tsss were measured by three different procedures i grab samples on a weekly basis 1 liter bottle made of high density polyethylene were sent to the laboratory for analysis following apha standards 2005 ii a rising stage sampler bottle trap was used to collect suspended sediments during storm flow bottle trap samples were collected whenever the water level exceeded 0 12 m which corresponds to 0 008 m³ s ¹ and iii when storm flow was sampled with bottle traps base flow samples or fallen limbs were manually collected at least 3 days after the rainfall events for procedures ii and iii the tss concentrations were obtained by the gravimetric method described in ess 1993 suspended sediment yield kg ha 1 was calculated by multiplying half of the cumulative volume between the preceding and the subsequent tss samples by the tss concentration of the particular sample on a monthly and annual basis as described by hopmans and bren 2007 in addition the same procedure has been repeated including the data from the rising stage sampler 2 4 data analysis data distributions were non normal so the effect of different harvest areas on suspended sediments was assessed through the kruskal wallis test the mann whitney pairwise test was used when a difference was detected in the former test these tests were applied i for all months of the study period ii for the dry and rainy season iii for storm and base flow samples and iv for grab samples suspended sediment estimate vs grab samples bottle traps suspended sediment estimate all statistical tests were carried out using past statistical software with significance at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 hydrological data the total rainfall observed in the first and second year after harvest were 1 241 mm and 2 336 mm respectively annual rainfall was 10 below the mean annual rainfall for the region 1 372 7 mm in the first year whereas in the second year it was 70 above it the total rainfall in the months of june and october in the first year and june in the second year after harvest were below 10 mm which is at least seven times lower than expected fig 2 while in july september november and january of the second year after harvest the total monthly rainfall was at least twice the expected fig 2 we observed 202 and 259 rainfall events in the first year and in the second year after harvest respectively fig 3 a the majority of the rainfall events 87 in the first year and 83 in the second year after harvest were light rainfalls with intensities lower than 5 mm h 1 there were six heavy rainfall events with intensities higher than 15 mm h 1 distributed evenly in the two studied years the highest observed intensity was 24 2 mm h 1 at january 25 2016 daily streamflow varied widely in all catchments fig 3b d the annual streamflow for the first year after harvest were 160 mm 36 mm and 37 mm and for the second year after harvest were 204 mm 81 mm and 120 mm for h15 h60 and h88 respectively 3 2 total suspended sediment although catchment h15 had a streamflow more than four times higher in the first year and 60 higher in the second year than streamflow observed in h60 and h88 it had the lowest variation of tss concentration fig 3b d the tss concentration medians were 1 3 mg l 1 4 3 mg l 1 and 6 3 mg l 1 for the first year and 2 0 mg l 1 5 3 mg l 1 and 7 7 mg l 1 for the second year for catchments h15 h60 and h88 respectively tss concentrations differed significantly between all catchments in both study years significant differences in tss concentrations for both base and storm flow conditions were detected table 2 that is h15 presented tss concentrations lower than those of h60 and h88 which in turn did not present significant differences the tss concentrations during storm flow ranged from 37 5 mg l 1 to 1 377 3 mg l 1 despite temporal differences in streamflow and tss concentrations monthly suspended sediment yields estimated by the weekly grab samples and estimated with the addition of bottle traps from the catchments did not present significant differences when analyzing the whole study period 24 months supplementary material the seasonal analysis of tss yields measured by weekly grab samples indicated no significant difference between the dry april to september and the rainy season from october to march in the catchments fig 4 a however when adding bottle trap data seasonal differences in tss monthly yields were detected in each catchment fig 4b all the catchments presented lower values for the dry season than for the rainy season the medians of monthly suspended sediment yield for the dry season were 0 37 kg ha 1 0 68 kg ha 1 and 0 66 kg ha 1 while for the rainy season were 3 91 kg ha 1 4 90 kg ha 1 and 5 64 kg ha 1 for the catchments h15 h60 and h88 respectively the cumulative suspended sediment yields for the catchments showed differences in total exports between catchments especially during the rainy season fig 5 following the cumulative tss yields data month by month it is possible to notice that catchments had similar tss yields in the first months of monitoring however as soon as the rainfalls started the tss yields differ between catchments being higher for h88 sediment yields followed this order h15 h60 h88 annual tss yields for catchments ranged from 3 0 kg ha 1 year 1 to 13 1 kg ha 1 year 1 for the two years after harvest when using the grab samples data fig 6 although no significant differences were detected between the monthly suspended sediment yields for the overall study period the annual suspended sediment yield of h88 was approximately two times higher than that of h15 in both years of study and also higher than h60 for the first year in the second year h60 was only 40 higher than h15 the addition of bottle traps generated a substantially higher annual suspended sediment yields compared to the weekly grab samples ranging from 12 8 kg ha 1 year 1 to 208 2 kg ha 1 year 1 fig 6 tss yields of catchment h88 was twice the value of h15 for both studied years h60 presented a tss yield more than two times higher of h15 for the first year and 37 higher in the second year despite maintaining the same pattern of difference between catchments the differences in tss yield between both approaches was at least of four times higher in the first year and fifteen times higher in the second year after harvest fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 proportion of harvested area affecting suspended sediment production our annual suspended solid estimates were directly related to harvest proportion given that the higher proportion of forest harvested exposes a larger soil surface area to rainfall increasing the potential to mobilize soil particles and increase sediment yields indeed other studies have reported that vegetation cover was negatively related to erosion jones 2000 slesak et al 2015 our study showed that this response is similar for fast growing eucalyptus plantations our reported annual tss yields from 3 0 to 208 2 kg ha 1 year 1 are in the same range of values from other studies reported for brazilian catchments especially for the catchment with the highest proportion of harvest area h88 brazilian studies reported tss yields from 8 5 to 151 5 kg ha 1 year 1 câmara and lima 1999 ranzini and lima 2002 rodrigues et al 2019 vital et al 1999 the reported suspended sediment annual yields were below 1 000 kg ha 1 year 1 which is the value expected for undisturbed forest catchments in the tropics brujinzeel 2004 furthermore the substantially low range of values in brazil compared to the 560 1 070 kg ha 1 year 1 reported in the usa see fraser et al 2012 can be explained in part by the fact that the tsss in the usa originated from shallower soils and steeper slopes previous studies have also highlighted catchments that show no response to harvesting hancock et al 2017 hatten et al 2018 or forest management on tss hopmans and ben 2007 and catchments that returned to pre harvest tss values in short time macdonald et al 2003 smith et al 2012 webb et al 2012 more studies are needed to understand if the low range of tss values observed in brazil could show that tss yields return to pre harvest values in a relatively short time 8 years suggesting that the quick canopy closure of fast growing forest plantations gonçalves et al 2013 could improve soil protection and reduce the tss effect of forest harvest in brazil comparing h15 and h88 given that these catchments have similar areas of forest plantations showed the effect of the proportion of harvested area where h15 had significantly lower tss concentrations and annual suspended sediment yields these results indicated that despite some soil disturbance that might have been present in the forest plantation catchments see salemi et al 2013 the remaining stands of eucalyptus are a type of forest cover that promotes soil protection put another way the high proportion of soil cover provided by the eucalyptus forest aboveground biomass plus litter similar to any other type of effective soil cover contributed to reducing the tss yields although h15 presented only 8 riparian forest buffer it had 77 forest plantations cover this supports the statement of including stands of different ages in the same catchment ferraz et al 2013 as a strategy to avoid substantial variations in suspended sediment yields and streamflow caused by harvesting catchments h60 and h88 had 100 of their eucalyptus plantations harvested showing the effects of the riparian native forest buffer when analyzing the annual tss yields h88 presented values higher than those of h60 therefore this suggests that the higher the riparian forest buffer area lead to lower the annual suspended sediment yield which is in agreement with a study carried out in chile in watersheds dominated by eucalyptus forest plantations little et al 2015 riparian forest buffers can mitigate some sediment loading by filtering runoff croke and hairsine 2006 however observing the data from the three catchments together showed that the effect of the harvested proportion is apparently greater than the effect of the riparian forest buffer proportion on the tss yields since there is a limitation of riparian buffer to filter sediments depending of land use intensity guidotti et al 2020 we established a ratio between the proportion of harvested area and the proportion of riparian forest buffer area to explain the tss yield differences we observed that the tss response to this relationship becomes more evident when we increase the weight of the harvested area fig 7 thus the mitigation capacity of the riparian forest area is unable to minimize the impact of the large harvested areas this shows the importance of properly planning forest harvests considering the catchment delimitations and the harvest proportion areas considering the adjusted logarithms curves to observed data it is interesting to note an inflection point near proportion of riparian buffer of h60 60 of harvesting below this native proportion maintenance 40 tss yield seems to be more sensitive to variation of native proportion on catchments which corroborate with spavorek et al 2002 also this suggest that the maintenance of native vegetation on catchments in order to reduce sediment loads from harvesting disturbance could follow a threshold around 30 50 similar to that observed on biological conservation studies martensen et al 2012 brejão et al 2018 this requires further investigation to guide forest planning to reduce sediment yields irrespective of the riparian buffer size it has a limited capacity to hold sediment and it is more effective to reduce and control sediment production in the managed areas guidotti et al 2020 thus other forestry practices can minimize the effects of forest plantations such as implementing forest age mosaic planning establishing longer rotations or the reduction of forest plantation proportions within the catchment ferraz et al 2013 we suggest that for plantations with very short harvest cycles that usually harvest large proportions of the catchment such as eucalyptus forests plantations in brazil these forestry practices be adopted even if there is already the presence of riparian forest buffer 4 2 seasonal effect on suspended sediment production there was significant difference between the dry and rainy season in tss yields estimated with the addition of bottle traps in all catchments despite no difference was observed using only weekly grab samples the results demonstrated the effects of soil exposure due to harvest on suspended sediment yields during the first rainy season which has highest potential for suspended sediment detachment and transport borelli and schutt 2014 thus the increase of rainfall besides increases streamflow promote sediment load that consequently increases tss yields and this increase is higher in catchments with larger harvested area at this study site the effects of the rainfall were more pronounced with the increase of rainfall in the second rainy season 4 3 sampling methods on sediment estimates effects we compared two approaches of estimating annual suspended sediment weekly grab samples and weekly grab samples with the addition of bottle traps our reported annual tss yields estimated by weekly grab samples were in the lower range of the spectrum compared to other studies with the same method for example an earlier study carried out in h15 found an annual preharvest tss yield of 44 kg ha 1 year 1 and a postharvest yield of 60 6 kg ha 1 year 1 câmara and lima 1999 in addition two other studies reported values for eucalyptus catchments in sao paulo brazil one reported the value of 41 5 kg ha 1 year 1 vital et al 1999 and a recent study reported values from 8 5 to 151 5 kg ha 1 year 1 for four catchments after harvest rodrigues et al 2019 forestry companies often use the weekly samples to estimate harvest impacts in fast growing forest plantations in brazil however our study showed that this method could greatly underestimate the tss yields the weekly grab samples underestimated the suspended sediment yields with values approximately four to 18 times lower than those with the addition of bottle traps in our study the addition of the bottles in the estimative of tss yield promoted a significant increase demonstrating that most suspended sediments are generated mainly during storm flow the differences of tss concentration in base and storm flow contribute to this find sampling storm flow is important for headwater streams as differences between catchments on a weekly basis sampling are difficult to verify hopmans and bren 2007 currently there are other methods available for suspended sediment yield estimates such as the use of turbidity probes although they require a high initial investment and constant maintenance which restricts their use 5 5 uncertainties as most of the tss in small streams are composed of clay and silt ogden 1996 based on the predominance of soil type in each catchment it would be possible to argue that h15 would generate higher tss yields given that rhodic hapludox 32 and 6 of clay and silt respectively was present in 60 of this catchment and in less than 5 at h60 and h88 however our data revealed the exact opposite pattern h15 had the lowest tss yields probably reflecting the effect of forest cover rather than soil type in this study catchments contained deep soils and low slopes therefore it is necessary to carry out additional studies to observe the relationship between the impact of the proportion of forest harvest and the mitigation of forest buffer areas and their effects on the tss yields under other physical settings in general many studies are still needed to understand forest and water relation in south america jones et al 2017 roads are usually described as factors contributing to tsss in forested catchments see croke and hairsine 2006 fraser et al 2012 given the low differences regarding road density between our catchments table 1 we assumed tss yields to be a function of the proportion of harvest area and riparian forest buffer finally despite these uncertainties our sites are a representative area of fast growing forest plantation in brazil in 2011 eucalyptus plantations occupied 4 9 million hectares in brazil where 47 9 was located in oxisols with flat to undulating topography gonçalves et al 2013 as our catchments therefore our results may represent a large portion of these plantations drawing up a baseline for future studies 5 conclusions the proportion of forest area subjected to harvest within catchment can increase the suspended sediment yields from planted fast growing forest catchments the use of riparian forest buffers to mitigate suspended sediments from harvesting operations is limited since it is not able to hold all sediments and additional strategies of soil conservation should be adopted at forest plantation management areas
