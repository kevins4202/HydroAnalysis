current turbine moment load blade moment in the shear flow cfd of turbine blade 1 introduction the kuroshio flowing near japan is one of the largest ocean currents and it is considered that this energy possibly be an important energy source for japan the new energy and industrial technology development organization nedo and ihi corporation have developed a 100 kw class ocean current turbine system named kairyu and successfully conducted a sea trial at the tokara islands in 2017 ihi 2017 although the turbine diameter for 100 kw system is about 11m it is expected that the diameter will be 40m for the 1 mw full scale generator at the rated flow speed of 1 5 m s takagi et al 2012 estimation of the blade loads are crucial for the design of such big turbines especially the periodic fluctuation of the blade load is important for fatigue design blade load fluctuations are supposed to be induced by the turbulence wave orbital motion and vertical profile of the inflow in the case of tidal currents a simple two dimensional boundary layer shape based on the assumption of shallow water flow is often used to represent the vertical profile of flows dnv 2015 on the contrary variation of profiles in the inflow for the ocean current turbine is supposed to be complex since the water depth at the sea area where the current turbines will be deployed is deep thus a simple two dimensional boundary layer shape based on the assumption of shallow water flow may not be applicable in addition the influence of internal waves could be expected though this is still under investigation for example kodaira et al 2014 investigated nonlinear internal waves in the kuroshio kiyomatsu et al kiyomatsu et al 2014 measured the vertical profile of the kuroshio near miyake island and they reported that there is a strong shear flow near the free surface thus we focus on the shear flow effect in this paper and the periodic fluctuation of moment loads at the blade root induced by the shear flow is highlighted because the bending moment is one of the important parameters for the structural design of a blade in the field of wind turbines the national renewable energy laboratory nrel summarized test results of the blade load due to the non uniform wind hand et al 2001 and nrel also provide a numerical model for estimation of blade loads jonkman and buhl 2005 literatures on various numerical methods including the cfd are also available for example hansen et al 2006 in the literature dealing with non uniform effects on tidal turbines also can be found for example milne et al 2013 measured blade loads in planar oscillatory flow and in spatially uniform unsteady flow milne et al 2015 faudota et al faudota and dahlhauga 2012 conducted a wave loads measurements blackmore et al 2016 and mycek et al 2014a mycek et al 2014b studied effects of turbulence gaurier et al 2013 measured a turbine blade strain under current and wave loading on the other hand numerical approaches are also found ahmed et al 2017 made a comparison of cfd with field data on fluctuating loads due to velocity shear and turbulence parkinson et al parkinson and collier 2016 conducted a field measurement and compared with results by a commercial software o rourke et al o rourke et al 2015 proposed a mathematical model for the blade element method bem to predict the hydrodynamic performance of a tidal turbine in non uniform inflow conditions in the present work experiments in a circulating water channel where a shear flow was created and in an ocean engineering basin were conducted and numerical estimations of the blade loads were also carried out by a commercial cfd code and compared with the experimental results 2 numerical computation of the blade loads 2 1 blades and hub since the aim of this study is to reveal the effect of shear flow a popular wing section is used and the twisting angle is presented by a simple equation the blade used in the present work is designed by referring to nmri s blade chujo et al 2017 naca0012 is used for the wing section and the plan view of the blade is a trapezoid as shown in fig 1 where the size of the blade is the same as that of experimental model which will be mentioned in section 3 the twisting angle β of the blade is represented as 1 β tan 1 450 11 r tan 1 1 11 where the definition of r is found in fig 1 it is noted that two blades are equipped as a turbine rotor because the kairyu ihi 2017 uses two bladed turbines for better performance in the installation and the maintenance it is also noted that although the experimental model has a boss at the center of rotor the boss is ignored for the numerical calculations to reduce the computational effort it is noted that we focused on the blade moment load in this study as mentioned above the moment about the turbine axis and an axis perpendicular to the r axis and turbine axis are defined as mx and my respectively non dimensional forms of mx and my are defined as 2 c m x m x 1 2 ρ u 2 a r c m y m y 1 2 ρ u 2 a r where u is the inflow velocity at the turbine center a is the projection area of the turbine rotor r is the radius of the turbine rotor and ρ is the water density 2 2 solver and mesh ansys fluent ver 18 0 is used for the numerical computation since the flow is incompressible the conservation of mass is satisfied as 3 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 where the cartesian coordinate system x i is used and u i denotes the fluid velocity the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans equations is solved by the fluent the rans equation is represented as 4 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i x i μ u i x i u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x i x j ρ u i u j where ρ denotes the pressure μ the viscosity δ i j the kronecker delta u i the turbulent component and the over bar denotes the time average the last term is obtained by using a turbulence model in this paper the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1993 is used other important information on the solver is shown in table 1 the reynolds number is 2 2 105 at the tip of the blade when the tip speed ratio tsr is 11 0 and the inflow velocity is 0 5 ms 1 based on this value the numerical mesh is constructed fig 2 shows the size of overall computational domain where d denotes the diameter of rotor it is noted that the sliding mesh is mainly used in the numerical computation on the other hand the multiple reference frame mrf model is used only for the uniform flow case and compared with the result of the sliding mesh computation fig 3 shows the detail of meshing near the blade height of the wall cell is set to be smaller than y 1 the time step is determined so that each time step corresponds to 1 degree of the turbine rotation total number of the mesh is 4 801 511 for the following calculations in order to verify the convergence of results a finer mesh calculation has also performed with 12 133 638 meshes the difference of the power coefficient is 0 88 and 0 1 for the thrust coefficient thus we assumed that the numerical results are converged with 4 801 511 meshes it is noted that a linear variation in z direction is used for a mathematical model of the shear flow at the inlet boundary in the shear flow computation the coefficient of the linear equation is determined based on the measurement of shear flow in the circulating tank as u 0 416 0 045 z ms 1 5 3 experiment 3 1 experimental set up principal dimensions of the turbine is shown in fig 4 the shape and twisting angle are chosen so that the blade shape is represented by simple equations for the convenience of generating the numerical mesh as mentioned above the diameter is chosen to guarantee the accuracy of the moment measurement as a result a free surface effect is observed that will be explained later the rotation of the turbine rotor is controlled to keep the constant rate from tsr 5 to 14 the blade moments are measured by a moment load sensor which is located at the root of one blade the experimental turbine rotor has a boss of 0 12m diameter and a sensor and a dummy sensor are fixed at both sides of the boss while the numerical model ignores the boss and the censors the thrust and moment of the turbine are also measured to check the power coefficient cp and the thrust coefficient ct xia and takagi xia and takagi 2016 created a shear flow in the circulating water channel using screens the screen is a lattice of 15 horizontal bars with diameter of 0 0272m and the bars are extended to the channel wall the same screen is used for creating a shear flow in the circulating water channel fig 5 shows the experimental arrangement of screens velocity meters and the turbine the test section of the circulating water channel has dimensions of 4 9m length x 2 0m width x 1 2m water depth three screens are used to create a shear flow with 10 gradient an electro magnetic velocity meter is installed at the center line of the channel to measure the reference inflow velocity and another one is installed 0 35m off center both meters are located 0 6m in front of the turbine a measurement of vertical profile of the flow was conducted before installing the turbine fig 6 shows the measured vertical profile of shear flow where the velocity is averaged in time although the vertical profile is not perfectly straight the screens induce a linear shear flow with the gradient of 10 8 we also measured the turbulence intensity and it is found that the turbulence intensity for the shear flow is 4 5 while it is less than 2 for the uniform flow 3 2 blockage effects since the width of the test section is only 2 0m a blockage effect is expected thus the same experiment is conducted in the ocean engineering basin of the university of tokyo the basin has dimensions of 50m length x 10m width x 5m water depth we used the same experimental set up while the turbine was towed by a towing carriage it is mentioned that even in the ocean engineering tank the free surface effect cannot be removed though it is supposed to be smaller than the wall effect fig 7 shows an example of time history of my which has a periodic fluctuation it has the same period as the rotation of the turbine and it is supposed to be a free surface effect the amplitude of fluctuation is 2 5 of the average value therefore the average value is supposed to have an inaccuracy of the same order due to the miller effect of the free surface however this inaccuracy is ignored in our experimental results since the inaccuracy is small on the other hand the free surface effect is more serious for the magnitude of fluctuations in the shear flow because the amplitude of periodic fluctuation appearing in fig 7 has almost the same order as the fluctuation in the shear flow thus the fluctuations of mx and my in the shear flow are corrected by subtracting the fluctuation appeared in uniform flow fig 8 shows comparisons of time averaged a mx and b my measured in the circulating water channel and in the ocean engineering basin apparent blockage effect is observed the measured value in the circulating tank is corrected using two values as the blockage effect correction in addition to this the free surface correction is made for the fluctuated part of the measured value in the shear flow as mentioned previously the same blockage correction is made for cp and ct 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the cfd with the experiment in order to verify the numerical procedure comparisons of cp and ct are performed fig 9 shows the numerical results and the measured results of cp and ct the numerical computations for the pitch angle of 2 are performed both by the mrf model and the sliding mesh model the mrf results are almost identical to the sliding mesh results and the mrf computation and the sliding mesh computation both show a fairly good agreement with experimental results thus we concluded that the numerical procedure is appropriate and the numerical results have enough accuracy for the further discussion though the experimental value could have small errors due to the free surface effect as mentioned above we also confirmed that the mrf model gives good approximation for cp and ct and saves the computational time though the model is mathematically not correct for the transient problem it is mentioned that from here on out we discuss on the case of blade pitch angle of 2 since ct is larger than the case of 0 fig 10 a shows an example of time history of my in the shear flow since the turbulent intensity of the inflow is about 4 high frequency fluctuations are observed in the experimental time history however an apparent periodic variation is recognized and its frequency is equal to the rate of turbine rotation on the contrary the cfd result shows an apparent periodicity since the inflow of the cfd does not have a turbulent component in order to clarify this frequency we obtained a periodogram of the time history which is shown in fig 10 b a sharp peek is appearing both for the experiment and the cfd at the frequency of 1 06 hz which is equal to the rotation rate 1 06 rps of the turbine another small peak is also observed in the experiment at the frequency of 2 12 hz which is supposed to be the second harmonic while the cfd result has no second peek it is concluded from these results that the first harmonic component of the fourier series expansion is useful for the discussion on the fluctuations of the load acting on the blade though the inflow contains a turbulent component and its influence is observed in the time history fig 11 shows measured and computed results of cp and ct in the uniform flow and in the shear flow where the sliding mesh is used for the computation since the generated shear in the circulating water channel is not strong the difference between the uniform flow case and the shear flow case is not apparent though the forces in the shear flow is theoretically expected to be larger than it in the uniform flow on the contrary the cfd shows that ct in the shear flow is slightly larger than it in the uniform flow though this tendency is not clear in the case of large tsr this tendency is not simple for cp since the shear flow case is larger only in the middle tsr thus it is concluded that the influence of the shear flow is small if the shear is not strong and the tendency depends on tsr a large shear case will be shown and discussed in the next subsection as an example of the cfd application fig 12 shows a comparison between experimental results and computational results on the time average of mx and my where the sliding mesh is used for numerical computation to represent the shear flow the experimental results are corrected for blockage effects the agreement between the experiment and the cfd is the same as that of cp and ct however the agreement for smaller tsr is not good especially mx at tsr 5 the discrepancy between the cfd and the experiment is big the reason is supposed to be a separation of the flow on the blade the influence of the separation is discussed in the next subsection fig 13 shows the amplitude of the first harmonic component of fluctuation in the time history of a mx and b my in the shear flow and the phase is shown in fig 14 where the amplitude and phase are obtained as the first harmonic component of the fourier expansion the amplitude and the phase are corrected for the blockage effect and the free surface effect as mentioned above it is apparent from these figures that the cfd results are in fairly good agreement with experimental results though the agreement is worse than that of averaged value it is mentioned that the amplitude and the phase of mx and my are not stationary in the experiment as seen in the time history shown in fig 10 since it is difficult to generate perfectly linear shear flow and the inlet flow contains turbulent component it is also noted that mx is more sensitive than my since mx is much smaller than my the phase lag appearing in the small tsr case is observed both in the experiment and cfd this is one of important characteristics of unsteady wing theory though the phase lag is small from these results it is concluded that the cfd can predict the unsteady effects on the turbine blades in the shear flow expect for the case of small tsr where the separation is expected it is noted that although the cfd is a powerful tool to estimate the moment loads as mentioned above it is too time consuming when we calculate the unsteady problem thus in the simulation of the overall turbine system which includes the floating body and the mooring system bem is convenient for the estimation of blade force and moment takagi 2012 the present results are utilized for improving a mathematical model which gives an unsteadiness correction to conventional bem o rourke et al 2015 4 2 application of the cfd although the shear gradient in the experiment is 10 8 a more severe gradient is reported in the measurement of the ocean current kiyomatsu et al 2014 thus a comparison between the small gradient case 10 and a large gradient case 40 was carried out by the cfd fig 15 shows instantaneous value of the cp and ct where the period of turbine rotation is 0 81 s crests in the time history cp correspond to instants when the blade is vertical on the contrary valleys correspond to the horizontal position it is apparent that in the large gradient case cp has large fluctuations while in the small gradient case the fluctuations are small this tendency is explained by the attack angle of the local flow to the blade section when the blade is vertical the shear effect is added to the average inflow of the turbine the additional inflow to the upper blade is positive while that to the lower blade is negative since the magnitude of the blade force is proportional to the square of the inflow speed the summation of upper and lower blade forces is slightly larger in the vertical position compared to the blade force when the blade takes a horizontal position the difference of the blade force between the vertical position and the horizontal position is supposed to be proportional to the square of magnitude of the additional inflow velocity thus the fluctuation of the blade force would be very small if the attack angle of the flow does not change however the attack angle of the flow changes linearly according to the variation of inflow speed on the other hand if the attack angle increases cp would increase and ct would decrease as a result instantaneous cp has the large fluctuation while the fluctuation of ct is small this is the case for the large gradient of shear when the gradient of shear is small the same thing happens however since the influence of attack angle variation due to the shear is small compared to the attack angle without shear and the square of the magnitude of additional inflow is small the fluctuations on both cp and ct are very small this is a qualitative explanation of this phenomenon but the quantitative estimation is difficult without the cfd because the unsteady effect is supposed to be considered fig 16 shows time histories of mx and my in the shear flow time histories apparently have a periodic fluctuation whose period is as the same as the period of turbine rotation it is mentioned that the amplitude is not proportional to the shear gradient and the ratio between amplitude and shear gradient depends on the tsr the reason is supposed to be the same as the cases of cp and ct however since the influence of unsteadiness exists again the quantitative estimation is difficult without the cfd table 2 shows a summary of amplitude for different tsrs it seems that the larger gradient case experiences more sever fluctuations of the load than a linearly expected value from the 10 case this is important information for the fatigue design of the blade one of advantages of the cfd is that we can observe the detail of flow directly from visualized numerical results thus two examples are shown here the fist example is relevant to the separation of the flow on the blade which was mentioned in subsection 4 1 figs 12 14 show that the agreement between the cfd and the experiment is not good when tsr is small tsr 5 0 while the agreement is fairly good in the case of higher tsr since the local attack angle of the blade is large when tsr is small it suggests that the separation on the blade happens fig 17 shows stream lines on the blade in the cases of a tsr 5 0 and b tsr 7 0 since the cp which represents the efficiency of the turbine is high in the case of tsr 7 this case is considered to represent the normal operation condition while the case of tsr 5 0 represents the torque rich condition i e low tsr in the uniform flow fig 17 shows that there are streamlines toward spanwise direction near the tip of the blade when tsr 5 0 these stream lines suggest the flow separation for the case of low tsr on the contrary when tsr is high streamlines toward the spanwise direction are not observed this is confirmed in fig 18 which shows distributions of the skin friction coefficient the skin friction coefficient is defined as 6 τ w 1 2 ρ u 2 where τ w denotes the shear stress it is apparent in fig 18 that the distribution of skin friction in uniform flow is not smooth when tsr is low while it is smooth when tsr is high these tendencies are basically the same in the cases of small and large shear gradient cases however when the shear gradient is large directions of streamline are different from those in the case of uniform flow the reason is supposed to be the unsteadiness of the flow since the two dimensional unsteady wing theory suggests that the separation does not happen even for the large attack angle if the flow is unsteady but the detail of flow is difficult to expect without the cfd although we do not give examples of three dimensional visualization it may be more informative another example is the wake flow behind the turbine which is very important for the design of the farm since the wake affects the inflow of the turbine behind the front turbines in addition in the case of floating type ocean current turbine the wake affects not only the efficiency but also the motion of floating devices in the second row fig 19 shows a contour plot of magnitude of vorticity distribution on the center vertical plane in the shear flow it is noted that the inflow passes through the center of the turbine since the boss is ignored in the cfd computation it is apparent that the wake after the turbine is not symmetry the reason is supposed to be that the downwash induced by spiral trailing vortices is not uniform in a cylindrical region behind the turbine stronger trailing vortex at the upper half decelerate the fluid quicker than that in the lower half as a result the vertical velocity is induced this effect might be important for the design of a turbine array 5 conclusions we focus on the shear flow effect on an ocean current turbine the periodic fluctuation of moment loads at a blade root induced by the shear flow is highlighted because the bending moment is one of important parameters for the structural design of the blade experiments in a circulating water channel and a towing tank were conducted and numerical estimations of the blade loads were also carried out by a commercial cfd code and compared with the experimental results a linear shear flow was created in the circulating water channel with three screens and moment loads at the root of one blade was successfully measured in this shear flow the blockage effect and influence of the free surface was removed from the measured data by utilizing experimental results obtained in the ocean engineering basin ansys fluent was used for the computation and the numerical results were compared with the experiment the meshing size of computational domain and the turbulence model are verified through the comparisons between the numerical result and the experiment for the power coefficient and the thrust coefficient in uniform flow the numerical results of moment load in the shear flow are validated through the comparison with the experimental results of mx and my it is concluded that the time averaged values of mx and my are estimated by the present cfd method very well and the amplitude and phase of the periodic fluctuation of the moment load are estimated with sufficient accuracy though the agreement between the cfd and the experiment is worse than that of time averaged value when tsr is small the agreement between the cfd and the experiment on mx and my is not good the reason considered to be a separation happening on the blade flow visualizations of the cfd result confirm detail of the separation using the same cfd method moment loads on a blade in the shear flow of 40 gradient were computed it is found that the larger gradient case produces more severe fluctuations of the load than a linearly expected value and the wake behind the turbine is not symmetric these phenomena might be useful for the blade design as well as the design of a turbine array acknowledgements this

shear flow because the amplitude of periodic fluctuation appearing in fig 7 has almost the same order as the fluctuation in the shear flow thus the fluctuations of mx and my in the shear flow are corrected by subtracting the fluctuation appeared in uniform flow fig 8 shows comparisons of time averaged a mx and b my measured in the circulating water channel and in the ocean engineering basin apparent blockage effect is observed the measured value in the circulating tank is corrected using two values as the blockage effect correction in addition to this the free surface correction is made for the fluctuated part of the measured value in the shear flow as mentioned previously the same blockage correction is made for cp and ct 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the cfd with the experiment in order to verify the numerical procedure comparisons of cp and ct are performed fig 9 shows the numerical results and the measured results of cp and ct the numerical computations for the pitch angle of 2 are performed both by the mrf model and the sliding mesh model the mrf results are almost identical to the sliding mesh results and the mrf computation and the sliding mesh computation both show a fairly good agreement with experimental results thus we concluded that the numerical procedure is appropriate and the numerical results have enough accuracy for the further discussion though the experimental value could have small errors due to the free surface effect as mentioned above we also confirmed that the mrf model gives good approximation for cp and ct and saves the computational time though the model is mathematically not correct for the transient problem it is mentioned that from here on out we discuss on the case of blade pitch angle of 2 since ct is larger than the case of 0 fig 10 a shows an example of time history of my in the shear flow since the turbulent intensity of the inflow is about 4 high frequency fluctuations are observed in the experimental time history however an apparent periodic variation is recognized and its frequency is equal to the rate of turbine rotation on the contrary the cfd result shows an apparent periodicity since the inflow of the cfd does not have a turbulent component in order to clarify this frequency we obtained a periodogram of the time history which is shown in fig 10 b a sharp peek is appearing both for the experiment and the cfd at the frequency of 1 06 hz which is equal to the rotation rate 1 06 rps of the turbine another small peak is also observed in the experiment at the frequency of 2 12 hz which is supposed to be the second harmonic while the cfd result has no second peek it is concluded from these results that the first harmonic component of the fourier series expansion is useful for the discussion on the fluctuations of the load acting on the blade though the inflow contains a turbulent component and its influence is observed in the time history fig 11 shows measured and computed results of cp and ct in the uniform flow and in the shear flow where the sliding mesh is used for the computation since the generated shear in the circulating water channel is not strong the difference between the uniform flow case and the shear flow case is not apparent though the forces in the shear flow is theoretically expected to be larger than it in the uniform flow on the contrary the cfd shows that ct in the shear flow is slightly larger than it in the uniform flow though this tendency is not clear in the case of large tsr this tendency is not simple for cp since the shear flow case is larger only in the middle tsr thus it is concluded that the influence of the shear flow is small if the shear is not strong and the tendency depends on tsr a large shear case will be shown and discussed in the next subsection as an example of the cfd application fig 12 shows a comparison between experimental results and computational results on the time average of mx and my where the sliding mesh is used for numerical computation to represent the shear flow the experimental results are corrected for blockage effects the agreement between the experiment and the cfd is the same as that of cp and ct however the agreement for smaller tsr is not good especially mx at tsr 5 the discrepancy between the cfd and the experiment is big the reason is supposed to be a separation of the flow on the blade the influence of the separation is discussed in the next subsection fig 13 shows the amplitude of the first harmonic component of fluctuation in the time history of a mx and b my in the shear flow and the phase is shown in fig 14 where the amplitude and phase are obtained as the first harmonic component of the fourier expansion the amplitude and the phase are corrected for the blockage effect and the free surface effect as mentioned above it is apparent from these figures that the cfd results are in fairly good agreement with experimental results though the agreement is worse than that of averaged value it is mentioned that the amplitude and the phase of mx and my are not stationary in the experiment as seen in the time history shown in fig 10 since it is difficult to generate perfectly linear shear flow and the inlet flow contains turbulent component it is also noted that mx is more sensitive than my since mx is much smaller than my the phase lag appearing in the small tsr case is observed both in the experiment and cfd this is one of important characteristics of unsteady wing theory though the phase lag is small from these results it is concluded that the cfd can predict the unsteady effects on the turbine blades in the shear flow expect for the case of small tsr where the separation is expected it is noted that although the cfd is a powerful tool to estimate the moment loads as mentioned above it is too time consuming when we calculate the unsteady problem thus in the simulation of the overall turbine system which includes the floating body and the mooring system bem is convenient for the estimation of blade force and moment takagi 2012 the present results are utilized for improving a mathematical model which gives an unsteadiness correction to conventional bem o rourke et al 2015 4 2 application of the cfd although the shear gradient in the experiment is 10 8 a more severe gradient is reported in the measurement of the ocean current kiyomatsu et al 2014 thus a comparison between the small gradient case 10 and a large gradient case 40 was carried out by the cfd fig 15 shows instantaneous value of the cp and ct where the period of turbine rotation is 0 81 s crests in the time history cp correspond to instants when the blade is vertical on the contrary valleys correspond to the horizontal position it is apparent that in the large gradient case cp has large fluctuations while in the small gradient case the fluctuations are small this tendency is explained by the attack angle of the local flow to the blade section when the blade is vertical the shear effect is added to the average inflow of the turbine the additional inflow to the upper blade is positive while that to the lower blade is negative since the magnitude of the blade force is proportional to the square of the inflow speed the summation of upper and lower blade forces is slightly larger in the vertical position compared to the blade force when the blade takes a horizontal position the difference of the blade force between the vertical position and the horizontal position is supposed to be proportional to the square of magnitude of the additional inflow velocity thus the fluctuation of the blade force would be very small if the attack angle of the flow does not change however the attack angle of the flow changes linearly according to the variation of inflow speed on the other hand if the attack angle increases cp would increase and ct would decrease as a result instantaneous cp has the large fluctuation while the fluctuation of ct is small this is the case for the large gradient of shear when the gradient of shear is small the same thing happens however since the influence of attack angle variation due to the shear is small compared to the attack angle without shear and the square of the magnitude of additional inflow is small the fluctuations on both cp and ct are very small this is a qualitative explanation of this phenomenon but the quantitative estimation is difficult without the cfd because the unsteady effect is supposed to be considered fig 16 shows time histories of mx and my in the shear flow time histories apparently have a periodic fluctuation whose period is as the same as the period of turbine rotation it is mentioned that the amplitude is not proportional to the shear gradient and the ratio between amplitude and shear gradient depends on the tsr the reason is supposed to be the same as the cases of cp and ct however since the influence of unsteadiness exists again the quantitative estimation is difficult without the cfd table 2 shows a summary of amplitude for different tsrs it seems that the larger gradient case experiences more sever fluctuations of the load than a linearly expected value from the 10 case this is important information for the fatigue design of the blade one of advantages of the cfd is that we can observe the detail of flow directly from visualized numerical results thus two examples are shown here the fist example is relevant to the separation of the flow on the blade which was mentioned in subsection 4 1 figs 12 14 show that the agreement between the cfd and the experiment is not good when tsr is small tsr 5 0 while the agreement is fairly good in the case of higher tsr since the local attack angle of the blade is large when tsr is small it suggests that the separation on the blade happens fig 17 shows stream lines on the blade in the cases of a tsr 5 0 and b tsr 7 0 since the cp which represents the efficiency of the turbine is high in the case of tsr 7 this case is considered to represent the normal operation condition while the case of tsr 5 0 represents the torque rich condition i e low tsr in the uniform flow fig 17 shows that there are streamlines toward spanwise direction near the tip of the blade when tsr 5 0 these stream lines suggest the flow separation for the case of low tsr on the contrary when tsr is high streamlines toward the spanwise direction are not observed this is confirmed in fig 18 which shows distributions of the skin friction coefficient the skin friction coefficient is defined as 6 τ w 1 2 ρ u 2 where τ w denotes the shear stress it is apparent in fig 18 that the distribution of skin friction in uniform flow is not smooth when tsr is low while it is smooth when tsr is high these tendencies are basically the same in the cases of small and large shear gradient cases however when the shear gradient is large directions of streamline are different from those in the case of uniform flow the reason is supposed to be the unsteadiness of the flow since the two dimensional unsteady wing theory suggests that the separation does not happen even for the large attack angle if the flow is unsteady but the detail of flow is difficult to expect without the cfd although we do not give examples of three dimensional visualization it may be more informative another example is the wake flow behind the turbine which is very important for the design of the farm since the wake affects the inflow of the turbine behind the front turbines in addition in the case of floating type ocean current turbine the wake affects not only the efficiency but also the motion of floating devices in the second row fig 19 shows a contour plot of magnitude of vorticity distribution on the center vertical plane in the shear flow it is noted that the inflow passes through the center of the turbine since the boss is ignored in the cfd computation it is apparent that the wake after the turbine is not symmetry the reason is supposed to be that the downwash induced by spiral trailing vortices is not uniform in a cylindrical region behind the turbine stronger trailing vortex at the upper half decelerate the fluid quicker than that in the lower half as a result the vertical velocity is induced this effect might be important for the design of a turbine array 5 conclusions we focus on the shear flow effect on an ocean current turbine the periodic fluctuation of moment loads at a blade root induced by the shear flow is highlighted because the bending moment is one of important parameters for the structural design of the blade experiments in a circulating water channel and a towing tank were conducted and numerical estimations of the blade loads were also carried out by a commercial cfd code and compared with the experimental results a linear shear flow was created in the circulating water channel with three screens and moment loads at the root of one blade was successfully measured in this shear flow the blockage effect and influence of the free surface was removed from the measured data by utilizing experimental results obtained in the ocean engineering basin ansys fluent was used for the computation and the numerical results were compared with the experiment the meshing size of computational domain and the turbulence model are verified through the comparisons between the numerical result and the experiment for the power coefficient and the thrust coefficient in uniform flow the numerical results of moment load in the shear flow are validated through the comparison with the experimental results of mx and my it is concluded that the time averaged values of mx and my are estimated by the present cfd method very well and the amplitude and phase of the periodic fluctuation of the moment load are estimated with sufficient accuracy though the agreement between the cfd and the experiment is worse than that of time averaged value when tsr is small the agreement between the cfd and the experiment on mx and my is not good the reason considered to be a separation happening on the blade flow visualizations of the cfd result confirm detail of the separation using the same cfd method moment loads on a blade in the shear flow of 40 gradient were computed it is found that the larger gradient case produces more severe fluctuations of the load than a linearly expected value and the wake behind the turbine is not symmetric these phenomena might be useful for the blade design as well as the design of a turbine array acknowledgements this

23066,clustering analysis is applied extensively in pattern recognition in marine traffic applications the clustering results may exhibit a customary route and traffic volume distribution in order to improve the clustering performance of ship trajectory data which is characterized by a large data volume and distribution complexity a method consisting of douglas peucker dp based compression and density based clustering is proposed in the first part of the proposed method the appropriate parameters for the dp algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories which

evaluation and comparison experiments were conducted based on massive real ship trajectories in the chinese port of beilun zhoushan the results demonstrated that compared to the traditional dtw distance the proposed similarity measurement exhibits superior performance in terms of both time and quality furthermore the results of the comparison experiment demonstrated that the improved dbscan outperforms two existing clustering methods in marine traffic c pattern recognition keywords ship trajectory clustering douglas peucker algorithm dbscan dtw 1 introduction moving object trajectory is a valuable spatio temporal data type which may aid people in understanding the moving object behaviors and provide empirical support for various applications such as path planning and anomaly detection in recent years a large dataset has become available for trajectory data mining in various domains as a result of the improvement in tracking facilities and sensor networks in the maritime domain the automatic identification system ais is an automatic tracking system for identifying and locating ships by means of exchanging data with other nearby ships and ais base stations all ships of 300 gross tons and upwards are engaged in international voyages cargo ships of 500 gross tons and upwards are not engaged in international waters and passenger ships are required to fit an ais transceiver which frequently transmits position updates sequences of massive ais tracking points can be transformed into detailed ship trajectories with the rapid development of shipboard ais in practice and the establishment of ais terminals such as shore based networks and satellites ais ship trajectories have become a popular research topic and an increasing number of scholars in the maritime field have started to investigate ais data mining three main objectives exist in the research concerning ais data collision avoidance anomaly detection and marine traffic pattern recognition regarding collision avoidance statheros et al 2008 provided both a spherical understanding of autonomous ship navigation for collision avoidance and a theoretical background of the reviewed work in their study human cognitive abilities and collision regulations were examined together with water based collision avoidance algorithms based on ais data and linear regression mou et al 2010 identified the correlation of the closest point of approach cpa which is an important index for water collision risks with the ship size speed and course zhang et al 2015 proposed a model for screening maritime traffic data for near miss ship ship encounters which may aid in making statements on maritime safety in relation to collision accidents zhen et al 2017 used a clustering method to obtain clusters of encounter vessels and constructed the semantic and mathematical relationship of the vessel collision risk index for each cluster of encounter vessels using the distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa in terms of maritime anomaly detection pallotta et al 2013 improved the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm and presented an unsupervised approach for extracting maritime movement patterns based on turning points in ais trajectories they regarded the trajectories that were far from the patterns as abnormal trajectories ristic et al 2008 focused on the statistical analysis of vessel motion patterns using ais data and constructed motion anomaly detectors based on adaptive kernel density estimation the bayesian network is another method based on statistics which is widely used for detecting anomalies in ship trajectories mascaro et al 2014 zhen et al 2017 handayani et al 2014a 2014b presented a supervised method for identifying vessel anomaly behavior using support vector machines rhodes et al 2007 2005 presented a neural network classifier known as fuzzy artmap to evaluate vessel behaviors bomberger et al 2006 developed a method based on associative learning and a neural network to predict future vessel behaviors and detect abnormal vessels moreover visualization is a direct means of providing support for anomaly detection in the maritime domain riveiro 2014 two main methods namely mapping and clustering are available for marine traffic pattern recognition which can provide support for route planning and maritime supervision natale et al 2015 developed a method for identifying fish activity based on a high resolution map of fishing efforts chen et al 2015 proposed a quantitative approach for delineating the principal fairways of ships however ais data based clustering has become an increasingly popular method for marine traffic pattern recognition in recent years owing to its favorable performance and easy implementation riveiro 2018 three types of ship trajectories based on form exist in the clustering research individual track points sub trajectories line segments and the entire original trajectory two main algorithms have generally been applied in previous research classification based such as k means and k medoids and density based for example dbscan studies based on individual track points have focused on identifying the region of interest roi in which similar ships are found yan et al 2016 proposed an unsupervised method using density based clustering for identification of the stop and move track points with the extraction of stationary areas of interest from the stops and detection of main traffic routes from the moves liu et al 2014 improved the dbscan algorithm for the extraction of normal ship trajectory patterns by taking into account the non spatial attributes of the track point speed and direction mazzarella et al 2014 proposed a method for discovering fishing areas based on the dbscan algorithm and historical ais data from fishing vessels similar work was conducted by su and chang 2008 however these researchers did not consider the time series characteristics in the clustering research the ship trajectory can be divided into several line segments for local features xiao et al 2015 applied the traclus algorithm lee et al 2007 to ship trajectory clustering in their study the trajectory was divided based on the minimum description length and the sub trajectories were grouped using the dbscan algorithm however the processing method based on partitions may increase computational costs and important information regarding the trajectory as a whole may be lost in order to maintain the integrated knowledge ship trajectories have been viewed as a whole in numerous studies similarity measurement is a necessary step in the clustering process two basic approaches are available for measuring the similarity between unequal length time series hausdorff distance and alignment measures ma et al 2014 applied one way distance lin and su 2008 which is similar to the hausdorff distance to measure vessel trajectory similarities moreover they identified marine traffic patterns based on spectral clustering classification based in terms of clustering research zhen et al 2017 improved the hausdorff distance by considering the course information of track points and clustered ship trajectories based on the k medoids algorithm however these methods focus on the spatial position similarities therefore they are therefore not effective for the similarity of shapes and are sensitive to noise thus various researchers have tended to adopt alignment measures dynamic time warping dtw is a well known alignment measure in a comparison experiment conducted by de vries and van someren 2012 the performances of various alignment based measures demonstrated that the dtw distance and edit distance ed were appropriate for measuring ship trajectories li et al 2017 proposed a multi step trajectory clustering method for robust ais trajectory clustering based on dtw distance principal component analysis pca and the k medoids algorithm because an ais message is transmitted by the ship at frequent intervals of approximately 3 10 s the number of track points in a ship trajectory and dataset size are both large moreover every similarity between trajectories needs to be computed in the clustering process however researchers have seldom been aware of the problem of efficiency in measuring similarity the douglas peucker dp algorithm exhibits effective performance in compressing the vessel trajectory zhang et al 2016 mou et al 2018 but the determination of the dp algorithm parameters remains a problem in various applications furthermore a ship has freedom of movement in the majority of water areas massive ship trajectories exist that cannot present the traffic pattern characteristics consequently a density based clustering method that can recognize noise data appears to be the most appropriate approach for pattern recognition however the application of this method exhibits certain problems for example the manner in which to determine the clustering algorithm parameters yan et al 2016 adopted a heuristic approach based on k nearest neighbor distances to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters however this approach requires numerous human interventions pan et al 2014 used the entropy theory shannon 2014 to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters however the calculation in this approach is highly complex in order to address the above mentioned issues we propose a method based on similarity measurement using dp compression and the dbscan algorithm for extracting marine traffic patterns the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 for the compression process we propose a method to determine the threshold value by observing the shape stability of all vessel trajectories in the compression strength change 2 for the dbscan clustering process we propose a method to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters based on the statistical characteristics of the dataset 3 based on the massive amount of real ais data in the chinese zhoushan islands a comparison experiment between the proposed method and other clustering methods is conducted for the purpose of verification the results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective performance in marine traffic pattern recognition and outperforms two existing clustering methods the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the new method is proposed in section 3 the results of the compression experiment are provided section 4 demonstrates the clustering results of the comparison experiment and the paper is concluded in section 5 2 proposed clustering methods a clustering method consists of two major parts similarity measurements of the data elements and grouping of similar data as described in the previous section considering the overall ship trajectory and spatial distributive characteristics the dtw and dbscan algorithms are the most appropriate approaches for clustering ship trajectories these two approaches were improved in the proposed method in order to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the similarity measurement using dtw we applied the dp algorithm to extract the feature track points computed the similarity between the compressed trajectories and conducted data analysis to determine the appropriate threshold moreover in the grouping part we used the statistical method to determine the dbscan parameters 2 1 similarity measurement based on dtw and dp algorithm 2 1 1 theory of dtw and dp algorithm dtw is an algorithm for measuring the similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed it has been applied to temporal sequences of video audio and graphics data dtw calculates an optimal match between two given sequences by means of warping in the time dimension by repeating the previous recording point as illustrated in fig 1 certain track points such as b 2 and a 3 are reused to determine the optimal match and mr i represents an example of an optimal point pair for two point based trajectories represented by a a 1 a n and b b 1 b m their dtw distance is calculated as follows 1 dtw a b 0 i f m n 0 i f m 0 o r n 0 i f m 0 o r n 0 d i s t a 1 b 1 min dtw re s t a r e s t b dtw re s t a b dtw a re s t b o t h e r w i s e where n and m represent the numbers of track points in a and b respectively dist a b represents the geographical distance between track points a and b rest a and rest b represent the trajectory segments of a and b after removing their first track points respectively as described previously all track points are involved in the calculation of the dtw distance however certain characteristics of vessel trajectory may exert a negative influence on the similarity measurement firstly an ais message is transmitted by a ship at frequent intervals of approximately 3 10 s such a high sample rate makes the data size of the vessel trajectory very large and most vessel movements on the water are relatively steady which means that the shape of a vessel trajectory can be represented by only several track points therefore most track points that are insignificant for the similarity measurement may increase unnecessary calculations moreover the position information packaged in an ais message contains random accuracy errors caused by the communication or devices themselves therefore if numerous track points with accuracy errors are involved in the calculation the similarity will be more likely to exhibit great errors furthermore in the clustering process a distance matrix for computing the similarity between every ship trajectory is necessary consequently we believed that it was reasonable for the similarity measurement to discard track points that are not relatively characteristic of trajectory shape or accurate we believe that the compressed trajectories consisting of several feature track points can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining the similarity accuracy in order to compress the ship trajectory data in an improved manner while preserving the information quality we used the dp algorithm in our method the dp algorithm was first presented by douglas and peucker in 1973 the algorithm can split the line data recursively and control the compression quality by means of the threshold which is commonly used in simplifying the trajectory of moving objects the algorithm theory is illustrated in fig 2 an ais trajectory is represented as a point set d p 1 p i the greatest distance d max between each point p i of the trajectory and its projection p i on the line between the start point p s and end point p e was calculated as indicated in the second part of fig 2 if the distance d max exceeded a threshold the trajectory was split at that position p max as illustrated in the third part of fig 2 the algorithm was recursively applied to both trajectory subparts if the distance d max was smaller than the threshold only points p s and p e were retained as illustrated in the fourth part of fig 2 however ship trajectory data which are usually based on the geographic coordinate system cannot be used directly for calculating distance in the 2d cartesian coordinate system in order to address this issue we applied the measurement method provided in the mercator chart we considered the research area as a mercator chart and λ pt φ pt were the geographical coordinates of a track point the mercator projection coordinates of this track point x pt y pt were calculated as follows 2 m p 7915 704471 g t g π 4 φ 2 1 e sin φ 1 e sin φ e 2 3 x p t λ p t λ o r i g i n 60 4 y p t m p p t m p o r i g i n where φ and λ are latitude and longitude respectively λ origin φ origin are the geographical bottom left coordinates in the research area and mp pt and mp origin are the meridional parts of φ pt and φ origin respectively we supposed that euclidean was the distance calculated based on the mercator projection coordinates and its geographical distance d was calculated as follows 5 u m p φ h i g h m p φ l o w φ h i g h φ l o w 60 6 d e u c l i d e a n u where φ high and φ low are the highest and lowest latitude of the research area respectively and u is the geographical distance nm per unit distance in this mercator chart as described previously the only dp algorithm parameter that should be determined by the user is the threshold in general a larger threshold value results in lower quality of the simplified data consequently determination of the threshold is important for the similarity measurement 2 1 2 determination of compression threshold the threshold value may vary according to different purposes for example for route planning zhang et al 2016 selected the value of ship domain in navigational situations as the threshold value this is the maximum value that can ensure that the track point of the simplified trajectory is within the safety scope of the corresponding original track point however for clustering it is believed that as many compressed trajectories as possible should be within the same compression degree in this paper the compression degree refers to the compression effect on the trajectory shape although the threshold value provides an approximate indication of the compression degree the same threshold value may have different effects on the shapes of different vessel trajectories owing to their individual detailed shapes for illustration fig 3 presents an example showing the compression effects with different threshold values in fig 3 two trajectories are marked with red and blue the corresponding threshold ranges are displayed below the trajectories and d is the critical length if the threshold is larger than the trajectory critical length the corresponding feature point will be discarded therefore with an increase in the threshold value the feature points in a trajectory decrease following compression as can be observed from fig 3b d and f under the same threshold value the changes in the trajectory shapes differ which means that they are not within the same compression degree different compression degrees may lead to a deviation in the similarity measurement between two trajectories therefore in our method we attempted to determine a threshold range within which the compressed trajectories were prone to the same compression degree in the case illustrated in fig 3 we found that in the process of increasing the threshold value with a fixed step set as indicated in fig 4 the reduced track point and total length between two consecutive track points in each step could vary in our method we calculated the track length reduction in each fixed step and regarded this value as the rate of change in the trajectory shape for the range in which the rate of change in the trajectory shape was relatively high the trajectories had been compressed significantly so we referred to this type of range as the change stage for the range in which the rate of change in the trajectory shape dropped below a certain level even zero the trajectories remained relatively unchanged so we referred to this as the stable stage the results of each step are displayed in table 1 from table 1 it can be observed that the compressed trajectories in the change stage may exhibit different shapes as critical lengths exist during this stage such as the range of 2 5 see fig 3c f moreover the critical lengths of the different trajectories were not exactly the same as a result in the change stage compressed trajectories that are not within the same compression degree are likely to be obtained that is in the change stage the trajectories may exhibit different degrees of shape variations which may have a negative effect on the similarity measurement in contrast in the stable stage compressed trajectories that are within the same compression degree are likely to be obtained which is beneficial to the similarity measurement consequently we selected the stable stage as the range for the appropriate threshold in our method it is worth mentioning that in general we did not select the threshold that only maintained the terminal track points see fig 3h furthermore the change stage and stable stage are relative concepts in practice their recognition may be influenced by the step selection and complexity of the real data a detailed example based on the real trajectory data is presented in section 3 2 2 improved dbscan algorithm 2 2 1 theory of dbscan algorithm the dbscan algorithm is a data clustering algorithm that was proposed in 1996 ester 1996 the two parameters minlns and ε are used in the dbscan algorithm for the process of clustering line segments the lines are classified as core lines density connected lines and outliers line l is a core line if at least minlns lines are within a distance ε thereof based on the parameters the lines that are density connected with one another are grouped into a cluster while all lines that are not density connected with any other line are outliers the concept of dbscan involves recognizing all of the density connected line segments and grouping them into a cluster only one part of the algorithm requires human intervention namely the two parameters ε and minlns which is important for the clustering result 2 2 2 determination of dbscan parameters in our method the parameter determination consisted of two steps the first step was calculating all of the parameter combinations based on the statistical relationship between two parameters which transformed the problem of two parameter determination into the problem of parameter combination selection the second step was the selection of the parameter combination based on clustering performances initially we applied the concept of core distance in the optics algorithm ankerst et al 1999 in our method the core distance of an object p was the distance to the minlnsth closest point expressed as dist minlns in density based clustering data in the high density area should be grouped so that the cluster density can reach its maximum for single line data in local clustering with the center data by itself fixed minlns the value of its dist minlns can precisely meet the conditions of being core line data as well as cluster forming therefore we believed that for a fixed minlns the value of the core distance that can enable the most line data to be core lines mode value was the appropriate parameter ε moreover based on all of the dist minlns values of the line data we used the inverse gaussian distribution to determine the appropriate parameter ε when minlns was provided as illustrated in fig 5 the formula for the probability density function of the inverse gaussian distribution and its mode value mode are as follows 7 p x λ 2 π x 3 1 2 e λ x μ 2 2 μ 2 x 8 m o d e μ 1 9 μ 2 4 λ 2 1 2 3 μ 2 λ where λ and μ can be obtained by the maximum likelihood estimate mle as we know the range of minlns in the experiment was from 1 to the dataset consequently we obtained all parameter combinations based on the above approach in the second step in order to select the optimum parameter combination we regarded the number of clusters as the clustering performance a parameter combination of minlns and its ε corresponded to a certain degree of strength that could aggregate the elements into clusters in multiple dbscan experiments the change in the clustering performance during the process of increasing the value of minlns can be viewed as a process in which each cluster absorbs the data around it at the beginning of the process each data was output as a cluster prior to achieving ideal clustering performance the clusters were combined with one another to a significant degree which led to a sharp decrease in the number of clusters however thereafter the data around the clusters were sparser and the distances between clusters were larger hence the reduction rate of the number of clusters decreased which meant that the number of clusters became stable consequently we believed that the position of the optimal parameter of minlns was the critical point of the transition from the stage of quickly combining clusters to the stage of slowly combining clusters in our method this point was determined based on the line graph of the number of clusters in ascending order of minlns values by means of the massive experiments we found that the critical point was usually near the farthest point from the connection line between the first and end points on the graph thus we used that point as the critical point for determining the optimum parameter combination it is worth mentioning that the scales of the axes in the graph should be the same fig 6 provides an example in which a to f display the clustering results with different parameter combinations in ascending order the dotted line circle represents the area of the corresponding ε value the colored dots indicate the data in the clusters while the black dots in the clustering results are the noise data the numbers of clusters are plotted on the line graph blue lines as illustrated in fig 6g the red dotted line is the connection line between the first and end points on the graph the point with an arrow is regarded as the critical point based on the geometric relationship furthermore it is demonstrated that the clustering result with the corresponding parameter combination fig 6c exhibited precisely the optimal clustering performance 3 similarity measurement experiment 3 1 experimental setup our data were collected from the ais base station in the area of the zhoushan islands january to february 2015 the research area is outside the port of beilun zhoushan which is one of the most important ports in china based on practical knowledge of popular routes in this water area we selected 425 trajectories that could represent the traffic patterns as our experimental data source we labeled these and created a dataset consisting of 17 ship trajectory classes the detailed experimental data source is illustrated in fig 7 and table 2 the trajectories in the different clusters are marked with different colors and numbers as described previously in order to improve the performance in terms of time and quality we compressed the trajectories prior to calculating the dtw distance therefore in the experiment we compared the performances of these two parts we regarded the time required for calculating the distance matrix as the similarity measurement performance in terms of time the compression time was concluded in our similarity measurement in terms of quality we conducted contrast experiments with several thresholds we applied the dtw distance without compression and the method with different compression thresholds to the classification task which was a supervised task based on the same labeled dataset and classification based clustering algorithm k medoids we regarded the clustering result accuracy as the similarity measurement performance in terms of quality in order to avoid random errors every clustering experiment was repeated 1000 times the detailed equation for calculating the accuracy is expressed as follows where r is the clustering result which consisted of k number of clusters r and l is the dataset which consisted of k number of classes of labeled trajectories l 9 a c c u r a c y r l 1 k i 1 k max 1 j k 2 r i l j r i l j 3 2 results table 3 displays the experimental results in terms of time from which it can be observed that with a very small compression threshold the time required for calculating the distance matrix could be reduced sharply furthermore even when the compression time was included the improvement in the time performance was clear in terms of quality we firstly applied the proposed method in order to determine the appropriate threshold as described in section 2 1 2 table 4 and fig 8 illustrate the reduced lengths of all trajectories in each step when the step was 0 5 nm in the experiment when the threshold was larger than 10 0 nm none of the trajectory shapes changed further moreover it was two ranges were observed within which the rate of change in the trajectory shape was relatively low therefore we selected 1 5 2 5 and 6 0 7 5 as the stable stages as indicated in fig 8 thereafter we conducted clustering experiments to demonstrate the similarity measurement quality with each compression threshold fig 9 illustrates the results in the form of a box plot the quality performances according to the compression thresholds in the stable stage are marked with red dashed boxes in fig 9 it can be observed that the quality performances with the compression thresholds in the stable stages were superior to those in the other stages change stage furthermore the quality performances were superior to those without compression this proved that our method could determine the appropriate compression threshold and improve the similarity measurement performance in terms of quality overall compared to the traditional dtw distance the proposed similarity measurement based on compression with the appropriate threshold exhibited superior performance in terms of both time and quality 4 ship trajectory clustering experiment 4 1 experimental setup it is well known that clustering analysis can identify similar data elements in order to obtain valuable distribution information hidden in large volumes of complex data in order to demonstrate the ability of the clustering method massive raw ship trajectories based on the ais data were applied in this experiment as illustrated in fig 10 the research area was the same as that described in section 3 and the dataset contained 3227 trajectories of 1932 vessels we selected two existing clustering methods as comparison objects and conducted the clustering experiment based on the same data source and similarity measurement as those proposed in section 2 1 the first method was the multi step trajectory clustering method based on pca and the k medoids algorithm li et al 2017 which is a classification based method these authors applied pca to determine the number of clusters and proposed a method for selecting the cluster centers the second method was that proposed by rodriguez and laio 2014 which is based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities cluster analysis is one of the unsupervised machine learning tasks in this experiment the cluster performance in the unlabeled data was evaluated by means of empirical knowledge and observation 4 2 experimental results 4 2 1 results of multi step trajectory clustering method based on pca and k medoids algorithm in this case the number of clusters was set as 4 according to pca and the clustering result is illustrated in fig 11 a the poor clustering performance could not recognize the marine traffic patterns moreover no clear ship route was identified as can be seen in the chart obviously pca was not appropriate for determining the number of clusters in the massive ship trajectory data in order to demonstrate the ability of the improved center clustering algorithm in the multi step method further we conducted a clustering experiment with a parameter k of 20 as illustrated in fig 11b only several clusters could indicate clear ship routes 11 12 and 13 in fig 11b the majority of cluster results could not distinguish the ship trajectories that differed in distribution characteristics furthermore clusters consisting of few trajectories existed which also could not demonstrate the traffic patterns 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 in fig 11b ship trajectory data collected from a ship moving freely on water is more scattered and complex in distribution than general data therefore not all ship trajectories in the dataset could reflect the traffic pattern characteristics only a small proportion of ship trajectories in the dataset were valuable for representing traffic patterns identifying these valuable trajectories was important in the ship trajectory cluster analysis that is it was necessary to judge whether a ship trajectory could be output as part of the traffic pattern the classification based clustering method obviously does not possess this ability as it regards all trajectories as part of the traffic pattern consequently this method cannot satisfy the traffic pattern recognition requirements based on massive complex ship trajectories 4 2 2 results of clustering by fast search and find of density peaks the density based clustering method can filter trajectories that are not highly characteristic of marine traffic therefore we conducted a clustering experiment using fast search and find of density peaks which was proposed by rodriguez and laio in 2014 the concept of this method forms the basis of a clustering procedure where the number of clusters arises intuitively and outliers are automatically identified and excluded from the analysis the results are illustrated in fig 12 the parameter was set as 1 0 according to the rule of thumb density peaks of the different clusters are marked with different colors and numbers and the triangles on the track points indicate the trajectory directions eight density peaks formed the center data of each cluster as can be observed in fig 12b the method could recognize the approximate distribution of certain traffic flows however the result cluster still could not clearly represent the characteristic traffic patterns 4 2 3 results of improved dbscan as described in section 2 2 for the process of determining the parameter combination the line graph of the number of clusters is illustrated in fig 13 in order to demonstrate the critical point clearly fig 13 only indicates the number of clusters within the range of 2 147 the value of minln in the parameter combination based on the critical point marked with an arrow we determined the parameter combination minlns 10 ε 0 861 the results of the improved dbscan are illustrated in fig 14 where the triangles on the track points indicate the trajectory directions fifteen clusters containing ship trajectories were output compared to the results of the other two methods increased detailed traffic patterns were clearly represented in the results clusters 1 2 3 6 7 8 11 and 14 represent the traffic patterns of leaving or entering the port through the shrimp main gate waterway broom gate waterway and fuli gate waterway clusters 4 5 9 10 12 13 and 15 represent the traffic patterns of the ship passing through the water area outside the port consequently it was proven that the proposed improved dbscan method exhibited effective performance in terms of marine traffic pattern recognition based on massive ship trajectories and outperformed the two existing clustering methods discussed above 5 conclusion clustering analysis is applied extensively in pattern recognition in marine traffic applications the huge data volume and complex distribution of ship trajectories influence the clustering effect in order to achieve improved recognition of marine traffic patterns from the massive ship trajectory data a novel clustering method based on compression and density was proposed in the first step of our method the appropriate threshold for the dp algorithm was determined following which the trajectories were compressed by the dp algorithm prior to calculating the dtw distance matrix the experimental results based on a real dataset demonstrated that the proposed similarity measurement could improve the clustering performance in terms of quality and time in the second step of our method we improved the dbscan algorithm in terms of parameter determination based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution the appropriate parameters for dbscan could be determined adaptively moreover a comparison of the experimental results based on massive ship trajectories in the chinese port of beilun zhoushan indicated that the proposed method exhibits effective performance in marine traffic pattern recognition and outperforms two existing clustering methods acknowledgements this work was

23066,clustering analysis is applied extensively in pattern recognition in marine traffic applications the clustering results may exhibit a customary route and traffic volume distribution in order to improve the clustering performance of ship trajectory data which is characterized by a large data volume and distribution complexity a method consisting of douglas peucker dp based compression and density based clustering is proposed in the first part of the proposed method the appropriate parameters for the dp algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories which were used to compress the trajectories prior to calculating the dynamic time warping dtw distance matrix in the second part the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm was improved in terms of determining the parameters based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution the appropriate dbscan parameters could be determined adaptively evaluation and comparison experiments were conducted based on massive real ship trajectories in the chinese port of beilun zhoushan the results demonstrated that compared to the traditional dtw distance the proposed similarity measurement exhibits superior performance in terms of both time and quality furthermore the results of the comparison experiment demonstrated that the improved dbscan outperforms two existing clustering methods in marine traffic c pattern recognition keywords ship trajectory clustering douglas peucker algorithm dbscan dtw 1 introduction moving object trajectory is a valuable spatio temporal data type which may aid people in understanding the moving object behaviors and provide empirical support for various applications such as path planning and anomaly detection in recent years a large dataset has become available for trajectory data mining in various domains as a result of the improvement in tracking facilities and sensor networks in the maritime domain the automatic identification system ais is an automatic tracking system for identifying and locating ships by means of exchanging data with other nearby ships and ais base stations all ships of 300 gross tons and upwards are engaged in international voyages cargo ships of 500 gross tons and upwards are not engaged in international waters and passenger ships are required to fit an ais transceiver which frequently transmits position updates sequences of massive ais tracking points can be transformed into detailed ship trajectories with the rapid development of shipboard ais in practice and the establishment of ais terminals such as shore based networks and satellites ais ship trajectories have become a popular research topic and an increasing number of scholars in the maritime field have started to investigate ais data mining three main objectives exist in the research concerning ais data collision avoidance anomaly detection and marine traffic pattern recognition regarding collision avoidance statheros et al 2008 provided both a spherical understanding of autonomous ship navigation for collision avoidance and a theoretical background of the reviewed work in their study human cognitive abilities and collision regulations were examined together with water based collision avoidance algorithms based on ais data and linear regression mou et al 2010 identified the correlation of the closest point of approach cpa which is an important index for water collision risks with the ship size speed and course zhang et al 2015 proposed a model for screening maritime traffic data for near miss ship ship encounters which may aid in making statements on maritime safety in relation to collision accidents zhen et al 2017 used a clustering method to obtain clusters of encounter vessels and constructed the semantic and mathematical relationship of the vessel collision risk index for each cluster of encounter vessels using the distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa in terms of maritime anomaly detection pallotta et al 2013 improved the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm and presented an unsupervised approach for extracting maritime movement patterns based on turning points in ais trajectories they regarded the trajectories that were far from the patterns as abnormal trajectories ristic et al 2008 focused on the statistical analysis of vessel motion patterns using ais data and constructed motion anomaly detectors based on adaptive kernel density estimation the bayesian network is another method based on statistics which is widely used for detecting anomalies in ship trajectories mascaro et al 2014 zhen et al 2017 handayani et al 2014a 2014b presented a supervised method for identifying vessel anomaly behavior using support vector machines rhodes et al 2007 2005 presented a neural network classifier known as fuzzy artmap to evaluate vessel behaviors bomberger et al 2006 developed a method based on associative learning and a neural network to predict future vessel behaviors and detect abnormal vessels moreover visualization is a direct means of providing support for anomaly detection in the maritime domain riveiro 2014 two main methods namely mapping and clustering are available for marine traffic pattern recognition which can provide support for route planning and maritime supervision natale et al 2015 developed a method for identifying fish activity based on a high resolution map of fishing efforts chen et al 2015 proposed a quantitative approach for delineating the principal fairways of ships however ais data based clustering has become an increasingly popular method for marine traffic pattern recognition in recent years owing to its favorable performance and easy implementation riveiro 2018 three types of ship trajectories based on form exist in the clustering research individual track points sub trajectories line segments and the entire original trajectory two main algorithms have generally been applied in previous research classification based such as k means and k medoids and density based for example dbscan studies based on individual track points have focused on identifying the region of interest roi in which similar ships are found yan et al 2016 proposed an unsupervised method using density based clustering for identification of the stop and move track points with the extraction of stationary areas of interest from the stops and detection of main traffic routes from the moves liu et al 2014 improved the dbscan algorithm for the extraction of normal ship trajectory patterns by taking into account the non spatial attributes of the track point speed and direction mazzarella et al 2014 proposed a method for discovering fishing areas based on the dbscan algorithm and historical ais data from fishing vessels similar work was conducted by su and chang 2008 however these researchers did not consider the time series characteristics in the clustering research the ship trajectory can be divided into several line segments for local features xiao et al 2015 applied the traclus algorithm lee et al 2007 to ship trajectory clustering in their study the trajectory was divided based on the minimum description length and the sub trajectories were grouped using the dbscan algorithm however the processing method based on partitions may increase computational costs and important information regarding the trajectory as a whole may be lost in order to maintain the integrated knowledge ship trajectories have been viewed as a whole in numerous studies similarity measurement is a necessary step in the clustering process two basic approaches are available for measuring the similarity between unequal length time series hausdorff distance and alignment measures ma et al 2014 applied one way distance lin and su 2008 which is similar to the hausdorff distance to measure vessel trajectory similarities moreover they identified marine traffic patterns based on spectral clustering classification based in terms of clustering research zhen et al 2017 improved the hausdorff distance by considering the course information of track points and clustered ship trajectories based on the k medoids algorithm however these methods focus on the spatial position similarities therefore they are therefore not effective for the similarity of shapes and are sensitive to noise thus various researchers have tended to adopt alignment measures dynamic time warping dtw is a well known alignment measure in a comparison experiment conducted by de vries and van someren 2012 the performances of various alignment based measures demonstrated that the dtw distance and edit distance ed were appropriate for measuring ship trajectories li et al 2017 proposed a multi step trajectory clustering method for robust ais trajectory clustering based on dtw distance principal component analysis pca and the k medoids algorithm because an ais message is transmitted by the ship at frequent intervals of approximately 3 10 s the number of track points in a ship trajectory and dataset size are both large moreover every similarity between trajectories needs to be computed in the clustering process however researchers have seldom been aware of the problem of efficiency in measuring similarity the douglas peucker dp algorithm exhibits effective performance in compressing the vessel trajectory zhang et al 2016 mou et al 2018 but the determination of the dp algorithm parameters remains a problem in various applications furthermore a ship has freedom of movement in the majority of water areas massive ship trajectories exist that cannot present the traffic pattern characteristics consequently a density based clustering method that can recognize noise data appears to be the most appropriate approach for pattern recognition however the application of this method exhibits certain problems for example the manner in which to determine the clustering algorithm parameters yan et al 2016 adopted a heuristic approach based on k nearest neighbor distances to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters however this approach requires numerous human interventions pan et al 2014 used the entropy theory shannon 2014 to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters however the calculation in this approach is highly complex in order to address the above mentioned issues we propose a method based on similarity measurement using dp compression and the dbscan algorithm for extracting marine traffic patterns the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 for the compression process we propose a method to determine the threshold value by observing the shape stability of all vessel trajectories in the compression strength change 2 for the dbscan clustering process we propose a method to determine the dbscan algorithm parameters based on the statistical characteristics of the dataset 3 based on the massive amount of real ais data in the chinese zhoushan islands a comparison experiment between the proposed method and other clustering methods is conducted for the purpose of verification the results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective performance in marine traffic pattern recognition and outperforms two existing clustering methods the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the new method is proposed in section 3 the results of the compression experiment are provided section 4 demonstrates the clustering results of the comparison experiment and the paper is concluded in section 5 2 proposed clustering methods a clustering method consists of two major parts similarity measurements of the data elements and grouping of similar data as described in the previous section considering the overall ship trajectory and spatial distributive characteristics the dtw and dbscan algorithms are the most appropriate approaches for clustering ship trajectories these two approaches were improved in the proposed method in order to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the similarity measurement using dtw we applied the dp algorithm to extract the feature track points computed the similarity between the compressed trajectories and conducted data analysis to determine the appropriate threshold moreover in the grouping part we used the statistical method to determine the dbscan parameters 2 1 similarity measurement based on dtw and dp algorithm 2 1 1 theory of dtw and dp algorithm dtw is an algorithm for measuring the similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed it has been applied to temporal sequences of video audio and graphics data dtw calculates an optimal match between two given sequences by means of warping in the time dimension by repeating the previous recording point as illustrated in fig 1 certain track points such as b 2 and a 3 are reused to determine the optimal match and mr i represents an example of an optimal point pair for two point based trajectories represented by a a 1 a n and b b 1 b m their dtw distance is calculated as follows 1 dtw a b 0 i f m n 0 i f m 0 o r n 0 i f m 0 o r n 0 d i s t a 1 b 1 min dtw re s t a r e s t b dtw re s t a b dtw a re s t b o t h e r w i s e where n and m represent the numbers of track points in a and b respectively dist a b represents the geographical distance between track points a and b rest a and rest b represent the trajectory segments of a and b after removing their first track points respectively as described previously all track points are involved in the calculation of the dtw distance however certain characteristics of vessel trajectory may exert a negative influence on the similarity measurement firstly an ais message is transmitted by a ship at frequent intervals of approximately 3 10 s such a high sample rate makes the data size of the vessel trajectory very large and most vessel movements on the water are relatively steady which means that the shape of a vessel trajectory can be represented by only several track points therefore most track points that are insignificant for the similarity measurement may increase unnecessary calculations moreover the position information packaged in an ais message contains random accuracy errors caused by the communication or devices themselves therefore if numerous track points with accuracy errors are involved in the calculation the similarity will be more likely to exhibit great errors furthermore in the clustering process a distance matrix for computing the similarity between every ship trajectory is necessary consequently we believed that it was reasonable for the similarity measurement to discard track points that are not relatively characteristic of trajectory shape or accurate we believe that the compressed trajectories consisting of several feature track points can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining the similarity accuracy in order to compress the ship trajectory data in an improved manner while preserving the information quality we used the dp algorithm in our method the dp algorithm was first presented by douglas and peucker in 1973 the algorithm can split the line data recursively and control the compression quality by means of the threshold which is commonly used in simplifying the trajectory of moving objects the algorithm theory is illustrated in fig 2 an ais trajectory is represented as a point set d p 1 p i the greatest distance d max between each point p i of the trajectory and its projection p i on the line between the start point p s and end point p e was calculated as indicated in the second part of fig 2 if the distance d max exceeded a threshold the trajectory was split at that position p max as illustrated in the third part of fig 2 the algorithm was recursively applied to both trajectory subparts if the distance d max was smaller than the threshold only points p s and p e were retained as illustrated in the fourth part of fig 2 however ship trajectory data which are usually based on the geographic coordinate system cannot be used directly for calculating distance in the 2d cartesian coordinate system in order to address this issue we applied the measurement method provided in the mercator chart we considered the research area as a mercator chart and λ pt φ pt were the geographical coordinates of a track point the mercator projection coordinates of this track point x pt y pt were calculated as follows 2 m p 7915 704471 g t g π 4 φ 2 1 e sin φ 1 e sin φ e 2 3 x p t λ p t λ o r i g i n 60 4 y p t m p p t m p o r i g i n where φ and λ are latitude and longitude respectively λ origin φ origin are the geographical bottom left coordinates in the research area and mp pt and mp origin are the meridional parts of φ pt and φ origin respectively we supposed that euclidean was the distance calculated based on the mercator projection coordinates and its geographical distance d was calculated as follows 5 u m p φ h i g h m p φ l o w φ h i g h φ l o w 60 6 d e u c l i d e a n u where φ high and φ low are the highest and lowest latitude of the research area respectively and u is the geographical distance nm per unit distance in this mercator chart as described previously the only dp algorithm parameter that should be determined by the user is the threshold in general a larger threshold value results in lower quality of the simplified data consequently determination of the threshold is important for the similarity measurement 2 1 2 determination of compression threshold the threshold value may vary according to different purposes for example for route planning zhang et al 2016 selected the value of ship domain in navigational situations as the threshold value this is the maximum value that can ensure that the track point of the simplified trajectory is within the safety scope of the corresponding original track point however for clustering it is believed that as many compressed trajectories as possible should be within the same compression degree in this paper the compression degree refers to the compression effect on the trajectory shape although the threshold value provides an approximate indication of the compression degree the same threshold value may have different effects on the shapes of different vessel trajectories owing to their individual detailed shapes for illustration fig 3 presents an example showing the compression effects with different threshold values in fig 3 two trajectories are marked with red and blue the corresponding threshold ranges are displayed below the trajectories and d is the critical length if the threshold is larger than the trajectory critical length the corresponding feature point will be discarded therefore with an increase in the threshold value the feature points in a trajectory decrease following compression as can be observed from fig 3b d and f under the same threshold value the changes in the trajectory shapes differ which means that they are not within the same compression degree different compression degrees may lead to a deviation in the similarity measurement between two trajectories therefore in our method we attempted to determine a threshold range within which the compressed trajectories were prone to the same compression degree in the case illustrated in fig 3 we found that in the process of increasing the threshold value with a fixed step set as indicated in fig 4 the reduced track point and total length between two consecutive track points in each step could vary in our method we calculated the track length reduction in each fixed step and regarded this value as the rate of change in the trajectory shape for the range in which the rate of change in the trajectory shape was relatively high the trajectories had been compressed significantly so we referred to this type of range as the change stage for the range in which the rate of change in the trajectory shape dropped below a certain level even zero the trajectories remained relatively unchanged so we referred to this as the stable stage the results of each step are displayed in table 1 from table 1 it can be observed that the compressed trajectories in the change stage may exhibit different shapes as critical lengths exist during this stage such as the range of 2 5 see fig 3c f moreover the critical lengths of the different trajectories were not exactly the same as a result in the change stage compressed trajectories that are not within the same compression degree are likely to be obtained that is in the change stage the trajectories may exhibit different degrees of shape variations which may have a negative effect on the similarity measurement in contrast in the stable stage compressed trajectories that are within the same compression degree are likely to be obtained which is beneficial to the similarity measurement consequently we selected the stable stage as the range for the appropriate threshold in our method it is worth mentioning that in general we did not select the threshold that only maintained the terminal track points see fig 3h furthermore the change stage and stable stage are relative concepts in practice their recognition may be influenced by the step selection and complexity of the real data a detailed example based on the real trajectory data is presented in section 3 2 2 improved dbscan algorithm 2 2 1 theory of dbscan algorithm the dbscan algorithm is a data clustering algorithm that was proposed in 1996 ester 1996 the two parameters minlns and ε are used in the dbscan algorithm for the process of clustering line segments the lines are classified as core lines density connected lines and outliers line l is a core line if at least minlns lines are within a distance ε thereof based on the parameters the lines that are density connected with one another are grouped into a cluster while all lines that are not density connected with any other line are outliers the concept of dbscan involves recognizing all of the density connected line segments and grouping them into a cluster only one part of the algorithm requires human intervention namely the two parameters ε and minlns which is important for the clustering result 2 2 2 determination of dbscan parameters in our method the parameter determination consisted of two steps the first step was calculating all of the parameter combinations based on the statistical relationship between two parameters which transformed the problem of two parameter determination into the problem of parameter combination selection the second step was the selection of the parameter combination based on clustering performances initially we applied the concept of core distance in the optics algorithm ankerst et al 1999 in our method the core distance of an object p was the distance to the minlnsth closest point expressed as dist minlns in density based clustering data in the high density area should be grouped so that the cluster density can reach its maximum for single line data in local clustering with the center data by itself fixed minlns the value of its dist minlns can precisely meet the conditions of being core line data as well as cluster forming therefore we believed that for a fixed minlns the value of the core distance that can enable the most line data to be core lines mode value was the appropriate parameter ε moreover based on all of the dist minlns values of the line data we used the inverse gaussian distribution to determine the appropriate parameter ε when minlns was provided as illustrated in fig 5 the formula for the probability density function of the inverse gaussian distribution and its mode value mode are as follows 7 p x λ 2 π x 3 1 2 e λ x μ 2 2 μ 2 x 8 m o d e μ 1 9 μ 2 4 λ 2 1 2 3 μ 2 λ where λ and μ can be obtained by the maximum likelihood estimate mle as we know the range of minlns in the experiment was from 1 to the dataset consequently we obtained all parameter combinations based on the above approach in the second step in order to select the optimum parameter combination we regarded the number of clusters as the clustering performance a parameter combination of minlns and its ε corresponded to a certain degree of strength that could aggregate the elements into clusters in multiple dbscan experiments the change in the clustering performance during the process of increasing the value of minlns can be viewed as a process in which each cluster absorbs the data around it at the beginning of the process each data was output as a cluster prior to achieving ideal clustering performance the clusters were combined with one another to a significant degree which led to a sharp decrease in the number of clusters however thereafter the data around the clusters were sparser and the distances between clusters were larger hence the reduction rate of the number of clusters decreased which meant that the number of clusters became stable consequently we believed that the position of the optimal parameter of minlns was the critical point of the transition from the stage of quickly combining clusters to the stage of slowly combining clusters in our method this point was determined based on the line graph of the number of clusters in ascending order of minlns values by means of the massive experiments we found that the critical point was usually near the farthest point from the connection line between the first and end points on the graph thus we used that point as the critical point for determining the optimum parameter combination it is worth mentioning that the scales of the axes in the graph should be the same fig 6 provides an example in which a to f display the clustering results with different parameter combinations in ascending order the dotted line circle represents the area of the corresponding ε value the colored dots indicate the data in the clusters while the black dots in the clustering results are the noise data the numbers of clusters are plotted on the line graph blue lines as illustrated in fig 6g the red dotted line is the connection line between the first and end points on the graph the point with an arrow is regarded as the critical point based on the geometric relationship furthermore it is demonstrated that the clustering result with the corresponding parameter combination fig 6c exhibited precisely the optimal clustering performance 3 similarity measurement experiment 3 1 experimental setup our data were collected from the ais base station in the area of the zhoushan islands january to february 2015 the research area is outside the port of beilun zhoushan which is one of the most important ports in china based on practical knowledge of popular routes in this water area we selected 425 trajectories that could represent the traffic patterns as our experimental data source we labeled these and created a dataset consisting of 17 ship trajectory classes the detailed experimental data source is illustrated in fig 7 and table 2 the trajectories in the different clusters are marked with different colors and numbers as described previously in order to improve the performance in terms of time and quality we compressed the trajectories prior to calculating the dtw distance therefore in the experiment we compared the performances of these two parts we regarded the time required for calculating the distance matrix as the similarity measurement performance in terms of time the compression time was concluded in our similarity measurement in terms of quality we conducted contrast experiments with several thresholds we applied the dtw distance without compression and the method with different compression thresholds to the classification task which was a supervised task based on the same labeled dataset and classification based clustering algorithm k medoids we regarded the clustering result accuracy as the similarity measurement performance in terms of quality in order to avoid random errors every clustering experiment was repeated 1000 times the detailed equation for calculating the accuracy is expressed as follows where r is the clustering result which consisted of k number of clusters r and l is the dataset which consisted of k number of classes of labeled trajectories l 9 a c c u r a c y r l 1 k i 1 k max 1 j k 2 r i l j r i l j 3 2 results table 3 displays the experimental results in terms of time from which it can be observed that with a very small compression threshold the time required for calculating the distance matrix could be reduced sharply furthermore even when the compression time was included the improvement in the time performance was clear in terms of quality we firstly applied the proposed method in order to determine the appropriate threshold as described in section 2 1 2 table 4 and fig 8 illustrate the reduced lengths of all trajectories in each step when the step was 0 5 nm in the experiment when the threshold was larger than 10 0 nm none of the trajectory shapes changed further moreover it was two ranges were observed within which the rate of change in the trajectory shape was relatively low therefore we selected 1 5 2 5 and 6 0 7 5 as the stable stages as indicated in fig 8 thereafter we conducted clustering experiments to demonstrate the similarity measurement quality with each compression threshold fig 9 illustrates the results in the form of a box plot the quality performances according to the compression thresholds in the stable stage are marked with red dashed boxes in fig 9 it can be observed that the quality performances with the compression thresholds in the stable stages were superior to those in the other stages change stage furthermore the quality performances were superior to those without compression this proved that our method could determine the appropriate compression threshold and improve the similarity measurement performance in terms of quality overall compared to the traditional dtw distance the proposed similarity measurement based on compression with the appropriate threshold exhibited superior performance in terms of both time and quality 4 ship trajectory clustering experiment 4 1 experimental setup it is well known that clustering analysis can identify similar data elements in order to obtain valuable distribution information hidden in large volumes of complex data in order to demonstrate the ability of the clustering method massive raw ship trajectories based on the ais data were applied in this experiment as illustrated in fig 10 the research area was the same as that described in section 3 and the dataset contained 3227 trajectories of 1932 vessels we selected two existing clustering methods as comparison objects and conducted the clustering experiment based on the same data source and similarity measurement as those proposed in section 2 1 the first method was the multi step trajectory clustering method based on pca and the k medoids algorithm li et al 2017 which is a classification based method these authors applied pca to determine the number of clusters and proposed a method for selecting the cluster centers the second method was that proposed by rodriguez and laio 2014 which is based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities cluster analysis is one of the unsupervised machine learning tasks in this experiment the cluster performance in the unlabeled data was evaluated by means of empirical knowledge and observation 4 2 experimental results 4 2 1 results of multi step trajectory clustering method based on pca and k medoids algorithm in this case the number of clusters was set as 4 according to pca and the clustering result is illustrated in fig 11 a the poor clustering performance could not recognize the marine traffic patterns moreover no clear ship route was identified as can be seen in the chart obviously pca was not appropriate for determining the number of clusters in the massive ship trajectory data in order to demonstrate the ability of the improved center clustering algorithm in the multi step method further we conducted a clustering experiment with a parameter k of 20 as illustrated in fig 11b only several clusters could indicate clear ship routes 11 12 and 13 in fig 11b the majority of cluster results could not distinguish the ship trajectories that differed in distribution characteristics furthermore clusters consisting of few trajectories existed which also could not demonstrate the traffic patterns 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 in fig 11b ship trajectory data collected from a ship moving freely on water is more scattered and complex in distribution than general data therefore not all ship trajectories in the dataset could reflect the traffic pattern characteristics only a small proportion of ship trajectories in the dataset were valuable for representing traffic patterns identifying these valuable trajectories was important in the ship trajectory cluster analysis that is it was necessary to judge whether a ship trajectory could be output as part of the traffic pattern the classification based clustering method obviously does not possess this ability as it regards all trajectories as part of the traffic pattern consequently this method cannot satisfy the traffic pattern recognition requirements based on massive complex ship trajectories 4 2 2 results of clustering by fast search and find of density peaks the density based clustering method can filter trajectories that are not highly characteristic of marine traffic therefore we conducted a clustering experiment using fast search and find of density peaks which was proposed by rodriguez and laio in 2014 the concept of this method forms the basis of a clustering procedure where the number of clusters arises intuitively and outliers are automatically identified and excluded from the analysis the results are illustrated in fig 12 the parameter was set as 1 0 according to the rule of thumb density peaks of the different clusters are marked with different colors and numbers and the triangles on the track points indicate the trajectory directions eight density peaks formed the center data of each cluster as can be observed in fig 12b the method could recognize the approximate distribution of certain traffic flows however the result cluster still could not clearly represent the characteristic traffic patterns 4 2 3 results of improved dbscan as described in section 2 2 for the process of determining the parameter combination the line graph of the number of clusters is illustrated in fig 13 in order to demonstrate the critical point clearly fig 13 only indicates the number of clusters within the range of 2 147 the value of minln in the parameter combination based on the critical point marked with an arrow we determined the parameter combination minlns 10 ε 0 861 the results of the improved dbscan are illustrated in fig 14 where the triangles on the track points indicate the trajectory directions fifteen clusters containing ship trajectories were output compared to the results of the other two methods increased detailed traffic patterns were clearly represented in the results clusters 1 2 3 6 7 8 11 and 14 represent the traffic patterns of leaving or entering the port through the shrimp main gate waterway broom gate waterway and fuli gate waterway clusters 4 5 9 10 12 13 and 15 represent the traffic patterns of the ship passing through the water area outside the port consequently it was proven that the proposed improved dbscan method exhibited effective performance in terms of marine traffic pattern recognition based on massive ship trajectories and outperformed the two existing clustering methods discussed above 5 conclusion clustering analysis is applied extensively in pattern recognition in marine traffic applications the huge data volume and complex distribution of ship trajectories influence the clustering effect in order to achieve improved recognition of marine traffic patterns from the massive ship trajectory data a novel clustering method based on compression and density was proposed in the first step of our method the appropriate threshold for the dp algorithm was determined following which the trajectories were compressed by the dp algorithm prior to calculating the dtw distance matrix the experimental results based on a real dataset demonstrated that the proposed similarity measurement could improve the clustering performance in terms of quality and time in the second step of our method we improved the dbscan algorithm in terms of parameter determination based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution the appropriate parameters for dbscan could be determined adaptively moreover a comparison of the experimental results based on massive ship trajectories in the chinese port of beilun zhoushan indicated that the proposed method exhibits effective performance in marine traffic pattern recognition and outperforms two existing clustering methods acknowledgements this work was

spanwise vortices shedding at different phases keywords vortex induced vibration viv strip theory based discrete vortex method sdvm finite element method fem standing wave travelling wave 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of the structures with bluff cross section is encountered in a great variety of engineering fields especially in the offshore oil exploration and production risers as a consequence of significant interactions of the vortex shedding and structural dynamics viv has the considerable potential to cause severe fatigue or stability failures on these structures which leads to sustainable attentions on the prediction and suppression of viv of these structures within the last decade the studies of viv are mainly based on the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the model experiments provided significant discoveries on viv and good benchmarks for verifying numerical prediction model feng 1968 reported the occurrence of resonance would last over a regime of normalized velocity by studying the viv of rigid cylinder at high mass ratios khalak and williamson 1996 studied the hydrodynamic forces and responses associated with viv of a rigid cylinder with low mass and damping three response branches of viv were found govardhan and williamson 2000 further investigated the vortex wake modes associated with these branches jauvtis and williamson 2004 investigated the effect of two degrees of freedom on viv at low mass and damping it was reported that the vibration of in line has a significant effect on that of cross flow when the mass ratio is reduced below 6 moving from the rigid to the long and flexible cylinders lehn 2003 performed the viv model tests on a flexible riser of 9 63m long with length to diameter ratio of 482 the reynolds number in the experiments reaches up to 16800 a comprehensive experimental data on the viv behavior of bare riser fairings installed riser and strakes installed riser was acquired in their study chapin et al 2005 studied the viv of a vertical tensioned riser of 13 12m long with a mass ratio of 3 0 and aspect ratio of 468 in a water tunnel the riser was placed in a stepped current consisting of the uniform flow in the lower part and still water upper trim et al 2005 carried out the viv tests on a model riser of 1400 diameters long in uniform and linearly sheared flow they obtained benchmark information from the viv test on a bare riser and studied the performance of strakes with different geometrics on viv suppression huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b studied the wake structures and viv responses of a flexible riser with aspect ratio 94 the riser is submitted to the uniform flow over the lower 40 of its length the reynolds number ranges from 1200 to 12000 vandiver et al 2009 reported the viv filed experiment on a very long flexible cylinder with the aspect ratio reaching up to 4200 the dominance of travelling wave rather than standing wave structural response was observed they proposed that travelling wave dominates the viv response when the ideal motion trajectories exist along the cylinder span due to the scale or cost limitations of model test the numerical ways including the empirical or semi empirical method and computational fluid dynamics cfd method are widely applied in the viv studies the empirical or semi empirical methods account for structural dynamic response but avoid direct computation of the flow field one group involving the viva triantafyllou 2003 vivana larsen et al 2001 shear 7 vandiver et al 2005 et al variously uses hydrodynamic data from vortex induced or forced vibrations experiment on a rigid cylinder in another group of models such as the wake oscillator model violette et al 2007 wu et al 2008 xu et al 2008 more pragmatic method is adopted to calculate the fluid force where the wake dynamics is represented by a wake oscillator equation these empirical methods generally provide prediction on structural cross flow viv response only with the in line response ignored due to the flow field characteristics of viv cannot be descried by the empirical method cfd methods are widely applied in the simulation and investigation of viv by means of direct numerical simulations dns evangelinos and karniadakis 1999 studied the viv of a flexible cylinder of aspect ratio 12 6 in the lock in regime at a reynolds number 1000 huang et al 2011 presented the numerical simulations of the flexible risers with aspect ratio ranging from 482 to 3350 using a finite analytical navier stokes code integrated with structural motion solver bourguet et al 2011 a b using a three dimensional 3d direct numerical simulation numerically studied the viv of an extensible tensioned riser with length to diameter ratio 200 placed in three different linear sheared incoming flow with reynolds number ranging from 110 to 1100 by means of a commercial ansys mfx multi filed solver and using a k ω turbulence model coupled reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans wang et al 2012 2017 carried out fully 3d simulation on the viv of a drilling riser of actual sizes in the critical fluid flow region the length of simulated drilling riser reaches up to 800m wang et al 2016 used a fully 3d cfd approach simulating the viv of a model riser in the configuration of lehn 2003 a large eddy simulation les wall adapted local eddy viscosity wale model was adopted to solve the flow filed and the structural dynamics is solved by the finite element analysis fea the fsi system is also constructed by the ansys mfx multi filed solver their predicted results show good agreement with the experimental data belonging to the eulerian description these methods mentioned above are numerically implemented based on millions of grids on the flow field which means that a large percentage of the computational efforts is expended on technical details connecting with meshing and numerous computing resources are demanded for grid computing these are among the reasons that interest in so called meshless method has grown rapidly in recent years discrete vortex method dvm originally proposed by chorin 1973 is an efficient and simplified meshless numerical method it discretizes the continuously distributed vorticity flied of fluid into a series of vortex elements and solves the vorticity transport equation to trace the motion of these vortex elements the flow field is understood by integrating the information of whole vortex elements implementing the boundary conditions by the stream function discrete vortex method is well adapted to the simulation of flow field having complex geometric boundaries where the grid of high quality would be guaranteed with the numerical methods in euler frame employed on the other hand solving the motion of thousands of vortex element in lagrangain reference frame discrete vortex method is high efficient in computation of flow field at a relatively high reynolds number based on these characteristics discrete vortex method has been well applied in the numerical simulation of a series of two dimensional flow problems in many previous studies langthjem and olhoff 2004 presented a simulation of the flow induced noise in a two dimensional centrifugal pump using discrete vortex method it reported that discrete vortex method is capable of capturing the essential features of this kind of rotational flow and well estimates the unsteady impeller blade surface forces bimbato et al 2011 studied the vortex shedding flow around a body near a moving ground using discrete vortex method the reynolds number of flow reaches 1 0 10 5 ramesh et al 2014 applied discrete vortex method to the simulation of novel shedding criterion for unsteady aero foil flows compared with experimental and computational results for several aerofoils and reynolds numbers discrete vortex method well simulated the leading edge vortex shedding pang et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients and wake patterns of flow around two circular cylinders in side by side arrangements at a high reynolds number r e 6 10 4 with the pure lagrangian vortex method applied saltara et al 2003 simulated the viv of a rigid cylinder free to vibrate in transverse direction the simulation well captured the initial and lower branches and corresponding wake patterns it is an innovative practice that developing a numerical algorithm integration with the dvm predicts the viv of long flexible risers yamamoto et al 2004 carried out a numerical study on the viv of a marine riser submitted to the uniform and shear flow with discrete vortex method used the simulations are conducted in a wide reynolds numbers region from 4 0 10 4 to 2 3 10 5 structural vibration mode from 1st to 4th excited by varying incoming velocities was presented in the uniform flow cases in the case of riser submitted to the shear flow the numerical results in structural cross flow response were compared with those obtained by quasi steady theory good agreement was observed in these comparisons sun et al 2012 presented the viv simulations of a rigid cylinder and a flexible riser they reported a relatively good agreement between numerical results with the experimental results where a rigid cylinder of single degree of freedom and two degrees of freedom are considered respectively these studies provided conclusive validation against two dimensional discrete vortex method employed in the viv simulation of a rigid cylinder however referring to the benchmark of typical viv model experiment with a flexible riser of high aspect ratio few numerical simulation have been carried out to validate the discrete vortex method in the viv prediction of long and flexible risers for the viv of slender and flexible risers the vortex induced forces experience significant variation in the direction of cylinder span it is an effective practice to use the strip method simplifying the solution of three dimensional flow field into solving a series of two dimensional flow strips to accelerate the solution of flow filed newman and karniadakis 1996 willden and graham 2001 2004 bao et al 2016 duan et al 2018 here coupling the strip theory based discrete vortex method with the finite element method we develop a quasi three dimensional q3d numerical procedure to simulate the viv of a long and flexible riser coupling the strip theory with the discrete vortex method present numerical method accelerates the solution of flow field of viv exponentially compared to the fully three dimensional cfd methods the algorithm developed in this paper is especially efficient in cases with very long risers in addition that computation is implemented independent of grid means a certain advantage in the numerical convenience and flexibility it is ideally suited to the cases where there are two or more cylinders involved referring to two typical experimental configurations the viv simulations of a long vertical riser subjected to a stepped and uniform flow are carried out in this paper the in line and cross flow viv responses of the riser are obtained detailed comparisons are carried out between the present numerical prediction and the experimental data in both the in line and cross flow viv responses involving the structural viv response mode amplitude as well as the dominant frequency the wake vortex patterns are also presented and investigated on the basis of scattered vortex elements some further findings based on the simulation are also presented 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equation for flow field for the incompressible viscous flow the equation governing the flow filed can be formulated by the continuity equation of eq 1 and the navier stokes ns equation of eq 2 1 v 0 2 v t v v 1 ρ p v 2 v where v is the velocity vector of fluid ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity considering that the vorticity can be expressed by the curl of the velocity ω v and assuming that the flow is two dimensional eq 1 can be rewritten as the vorticity stream function form of eq 3 and eq 2 can be rewritten as the vorticity transport equation of eq 4 3 ω 2 φ 4 ω t v ω v 2 ω where φ is the stream function with the operator splitting method employed eq 4 can be divided into two parts the convection equation of eq 5 and the diffusion equation of eq 6 these two parts are solved sequentially 5 ω t v ω 0 6 ω t v 2 ω eq 5 indicates that the discretization of the vorticity field generates the vortex particles having a constant circulation for computing the convection velocities of these particles the biot savart law is introduced to compute the stream function φ from the poisson equation of eq 3 by taking the curl of the computed stream function the general expression of the convection velocity field is given as eq 7 7 v r t 1 2 π r r i ω r i t r r i 2 d v v where r and r i are the position vectors v represents the velocity vector at infinity and ω r i t is the vorticity at r i for the diffusion equation it has the same form as the one dimensional heat conduction equation its fundamental solution is the green s function referring to the quantum field theory chorin 1973 introduced a random walk method to simulate the viscous diffusion of vorticity this random walk motion of vortex elements produce the exact solution in general but inherently leading to the random fluctuation in numerical results based on the theory of boundary layer diffusion a vortex element of growing core model is introduced to simulate the viscous diffusion of vortex park and higuchi 1989 obeying an exponential law given by eq 8 the growing core of vortex elements approximately simulate the viscous diffusion 8 σ n 1 σ n 2 4 946 v δ t where δ t is the time increment in computation σ n is the core size of vortex element at n th time step in early discrete vortex methods a point vortex model is used to discretize the continuous vorticity field this point vortex inducing the velocity field becomes unbounded near the vortex element core this unbounded induced velocity easily causes the divergence in numerical implementation to avoid the velocity singularity induced by point vortex element a vortex model of so called vortex blob the vortex element with finite core radius having more realistic vorticity distribution and bounded induced velocity is introduced chorin 1973 using the vortex blob model we have the expression of velocity field induced by vortex element as eq 9 9 u θ i γ i 2 π r r 2 σ i 2 where u θ i is the velocity vector at the position vector r induced by the i th vortex element γ i is the circulation of i th vortex element and σ i is the core size of i th vortex element modeling the continuously distributed vorticity field by a series of vortex elements the velocities at position r can obtained by the superposition of the induced velocities by the vortex elements in whole flow field then the discrete solution of eq 7 can be expressed as follows 10 u r u i 1 n γ i 2 π y r y i r r i 2 σ i 2 11 v r i 1 n γ i 2 π x r x i r r i 2 σ i 2 where u r and v r is the in line and cross flow velocities at radius vector r n is the number of vortex elements in flow field u denotes the in line velocity of incoming flow and r i is the radius vector of i th vortex element 2 2 numerical implementation of discrete vortex method in the discrete vortex method the essential ideal is that the continuous vorticity field is discretized into a series of vortex elements for the flow around a circular cylinder the viscous effect is considered to concentrate on the thin boundary layer near body and the karman vortex in the wake is formed by the boundary layer shedding so the discrete vortex elements are firstly generated around the cylinder surface to represent the vorticity in boundary layer which can be called surface vortex element see fig 1 then the convection and diffusion of the vorticity from the boundary layer can be simulated by the motion of surface vortex elements the induced stream function ψ i can be derived from the induced velocity field equation 9 which can be expressed as eq 12 12 ψ i γ i 4 π ln r 2 σ i 2 accumulating the stream function values induced three parts the uniform flow at infinity the n s surface vortex elements and the n w vortex elements in wake the stream function of flow field can be determined as eq 13 13 ψ k u y k 1 4 π i 1 n s γ i ln r k r i 2 σ i 2 1 4 π j 1 n w γ j ln r k r j 2 σ j 2 to determine the circulation of surface vortex elements in second item of eq 13 the impermeability boundary condition on cylinder wall would be satisfied by the mean of that the difference of stream function between two points on the body is equal to the volume flowrate between these two points for the moving cylinder it generates eq 14 14 ψ i 1 ψ i u c n δ s where ψ i is the steam function at i th surface element u c is the velocity vector of cylinder and δ s is the distance of two control points considering that n s vortex elements are generated around cylinder at each time step the wall of cylinder can be divided into n s surface elements corresponding to the surface vortex elements then n s stream function equations contented with the boundary condition can be formulated to solve the circulations of these new generated vortex elements after rearranging these equations a system of linear equations can be formulated as eq 15 15 a γ β where the element of coefficient matrix a is expressed as eq 16 16 a k i 1 4 π ln r k 1 r i 2 σ i 2 r k r i 2 σ i 2 and the element of vector b is expressed as eq 17 17 b k u u c r k 1 r k 1 4 π i 1 n w γ i ln r k 1 r i 2 σ i 2 r k r i 2 σ i 2 by solving eq 14 the circulation γ of each surface vortex element are determined which indicates that the wall boundary condition is constantly satisfied at the time when the surface vortex elements are generated governed by the vorticity transport equation the motion of vortex elements are traced in the lagrangian reference frame each vortex element motion involves two processes the convection motion and the core growing motion the convection motion of vortex elements are solved by the upwind difference format which can be formulated by eq 18 18 r i n 1 r i n u i n δ t the velocity vector of vortex element u i n can be obtained by substituting current position vector r i n into the convection velocity equations acquiring the motion of whole vortex elements then the flow field can be understood by integrating the information of these vortex elements in numerical implementation the number of vortex elements will increase rapidly with the surface vortex elements generated at each time step leading to computational time consuming proportionally growing so a method of vortex element mergence introduced by spalart and leonard 1981 is used to control the vortex elements number in the wake the mergence condition of two vortex elements is expressed as eq 19 19 γ i γ j γ i γ j r i r j 2 v s d i 3 v s d j 3 v w where v s determines the number of vortex elements near body and v w determines the number of vortex elements in flow field d i and d j indicate the distance of two vortex elements to the cylinder surface the location r and circulation γ of new vortex element are determined by eqs 20 and 21 20 r γ i r i γ j r j γ i γ j 21 γ γ i γ j the fluid force acting on the cylinder is derived from the integration of the stress that are induced by the whole vortex elements the pressure f n and viscous friction f τ on the moving cylinder can be expressed as eqs 22 and 23 respectively 22 f n i 1 n ρ δ γ s i δ t δ s i e n i ρ π r 2 a c 23 f τ i 1 n μ v s i 2 σ 0 δ s i e τ i where δ s i is the area of i th surface element r is the radius of the cylinder a c is the acceleration vector of the cylinder μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid σ 0 is the initial core size of vortex element δ γ s i is the vorticity variation on the i th surface element and v s i is the tangential velocity of i th surface element decomposing the pressure and viscous friction on each surface elements into the in line and cross flow direction the components of drag force and lift force are obtained adding the force components in same direction then non dimensionalized by cylinder diameter d and incoming velocity u we have the numerical drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l expressions as eqs 24 and 25 24 c d i 1 n γ i u i sin 2 θ i v i cos 2 θ i r i r c 2 π r a x u 2 25 c l i 1 n γ i v i sin 2 θ i u i cos 2 θ i r i r c 2 π r a y u 2 where u i and v i are the in line and cross flow velocity of i th vortex element r i and r c are the radius vector of i th vortex element and cylinder respectively θ i is the polar angle of i th vortex element respected to cylinder a x and a y are the acceleration of cylinder in in line and cross flow directions 2 3 numerical solution of structural dynamics the riser a long and flexile structure can be modelled as an extensible tensioned bernoulli euler beam and the shear deformation can be ignored compared to the bending deformation in the viv response considering the internal fluid mass and the pre tension loaded at top the dynamical governing equations of riser can be expressed as follows 26 m 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t 2 z 2 e i z 2 x z t z 2 z t z t x z t z f x z t where z is the non deformation riser axis m is structural mass per unit length x z t is the structural displacement having in line and cross flow components c is structural damping e i z is the bending stiffness t z t is the axial tension of section and f x is the hydrodynamic forces including the drag and lift forces applying the weak formulation of the galerkin method to the differential equation of eq 26 the corresponding finite element equation of structural dynamics is obtained as eq 27 27 m x b x k e k g x q t the mass matrix m can be derived from the first term on left side of eq 26 28 m m e 0 l n i z

is the length of beam element n z is the shape function matrix of beam element the structural dynamics equation is solved by the newmark method in time domain where the integration factor α and β are set at 0 5 and 0 25 respectively the viv response of riser is obtained at each time step 2 4 fluid structure interaction the fsi system is constructed by the weak coupling method the governing equations of the fluid and structure are explicitly solved separately the data exchanging between the flow field computation and the structural response calculation is performed one time within each time step in the computation of the flow filed based on the strip theory the three dimensional flow field around the flexible cylinder is approximately simulated by a series of two dimensional flow strips placed along the cylinder span the hydrodynamic forces obtained from the flow filed computation are passed in the load matrix of the structural dynamic calculation the structural responses are send back to update the boundary of the flow strips at next time step the numerical process of viv simulation using discrete vortex method can be described as fig 2 and the strip theory based numerical model is sketched as fig 3 3 viv simulation of a rigid cylinder to validate the numerical algorithm presented in this paper the numerical simulation have been carried out on the viv of a rigid cylinder that was experimentally studied by khalak and williamson 1996 the cylinder is constrained to oscillate in the transverse direction the mass ratio between the cylinder and the displaced fluid is 2 4 the damping and natural frequency of system in air are set equal to 5 42 10 3 and 0 5 hz respectively the amplitude response of the cylinder as a function of the reduced velocity obtained from the present numerical study is shown in fig 4 compared to the experimental results denoted by the square symbol the peak of vibration amplitude obtained by the present simulations reaches up to 0 86d corresponding to the reduced velocity of 5 51 which is lower than the peak value of 0 95d at the reduced velocity about 5 0 in the experiment in the experimental study the curve of vibration amplitude versus the reduced velocity is divided into three branches which involves the initial branch at reduced velocities below 4 0 the upper branch at reduced velocities between 4 0 and 6 0 and the lower branch in the region of 6 5 ur 12 0 these three branches are well captured in our present simulations here we also present the numerical results of pan et al 2007 by means of the rans code coupled with the sst k ω turbulence model and numerical results of saltara et al 2003 in fig 4 the results of pan et al and saltara et al failed to capture the upper branch around ur 5 0 in saltara s simulations the discrete vortex method was employed with the diffusion part solved by random walk method which indicates that the vortex core growing method is relatively more appropriate than random walk method in simulating the diffusion part fig 5 presents the comparison of the experimental and present numerical cylinder cross flow displacement time series at three representative reduced velocities 3 92 5 73 and 7 86 it is observed that the oscillation amplitudes reach 0 21d 0 66d and 0 52d in the figures by numerical simulations which well correspond with the experimental values of 0 19d 0 69d and 0 51d respectively these comparisons show that the cylinder viv response obtained by present numerical simulations well coincide with the experimental results previous studies revealed the existence of different wake vortex patterns that are associated with the response branches govardhan and williamson 2000 here we present the vorticity field within the regimes of three branches from the study of govardhan and williamson 2000 which were measured by the dpiv technique by the discrete vortex method the vorticity field is similarly represented by the distribution of the vortex elements where the vortex structures in the wake are identified in fig 6 the figures a b and c are the vorticity contours obtained by dpiv and the figures d e and f are the point clouds of vortex elements obtained by discrete vortex method fig 6 a and d present the vortex pattern in the regime of initial branch fig 6 b and e present the vortex pattern in the regime of upper branch and fig 6 c and f present the vortex patterns corresponding to the lower branch in each pair of figures the point clouds of vortex elements have the similar vorticity distribution as the vorticity contours where the vortex shedding pattern resembles a 2s mode that is characterized by two single vortices shedding per oscillation cycle in the initial branch and resembles a mode of 2p in the upper and lower branches characterized by two pairs of vortices shedding per oscillation cycle the above comparisons illustrate that the cylinder dynamic response and wake vortex shedding pattern can be well captured by present numerical simulations which confirms the capacity of present two dimensional discrete vortex method code in the simulation of viv of a rigid cylinder 4 viv simulation of a flexible riser based on the strip theory the three dimensional flow filed is modelled into a series of two dimensional flow strips each flow strip is numerically solved by the discrete vortex method we generate the computational flow field strip at each beam element node of the structure to obtain the hydrodynamic force along the cylinder span coupled with the structural finite element model this method is applied to solve the viv of the flexible cylinder here two typical viv experiments are referred to in our simulations the experiments were performed by lehn 2003 and chaplin et al 2005 considering a long flexible cylinder placed within a uniform flow and a stepped flow respectively both two cylinders are hinge pinned at both ends with a top tension applied and free to move in the in line and cross flow directions 4 1 in line and cross flow viv simulation in stepped flow chaplin et al 2005 carried out a comprehensive measurement on the viv of a vertical tensioned riser with length to diameter ratio of 468 and mass ratio of 3 0 the riser was placed within a stepped flow with the lower 45 of cylinder span exposed to a uniform flow the high wavenumber vibrations of riser were excited in their experiment in this section referring to the experimental configuration of chaplin et al we carried out the numerical simulation on the viv of a same riser at a reynolds number 2 38 104 in the simulation the riser is meshed into 120 beam elements in the spanwise direction 54 computational flow field strips are employed to simulate the incoming flow at the lower 45 the main parameters of riser are summarized in table 1 fig 7 presents the typical instantaneous displacement shapes of riser in the in line and cross flow directions measured in the experiment and relevant numerical results are shown in fig 8 from the time averaged in line deflection of the riser presented in figs 7 a and fig 8 a it is observed that the riser exhibits an asymmetric in line bending deflection where the maximum in line displacement occurs at 35 of the span and reaches approximately 11 2d in experiment and 10 8d in present simulation comparing the envelopes of riser in line and cross flow vibrations in fig 7 b c with those in fig 8 b c the experimental envelope of structural motion indicates that the viv response of riser is dominated by the 12th and 7th modes in in line and cross flow directions while the riser vibrating in the 13th and 7th modes in two directions are observed in present simulation there is a slight over prediction in the in line viv modes by present numerical simulation the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental in line response envelopes is caused by the structural in line response exhibiting two frequencies two frequencies correspond to a wavenumber of 12th and 13th respectively this multi mode response is illustrated by fig 10 a and it was also reported in the experiment of chaplin et al 2005 because of the combination of 12th and 13th wavenumbers in the in line response the numerical and experimental envelopes covering different time span exhibit the mode difference in fig 9 the structural in line and cross flow vibrational maximum amplitudes along the cylinder span are compared concerning the envelope shape of structural displacement the distribution of wave nodes minima of the amplitude envelope and anti nodes maxima of the amplitude envelope obtained by the simulation well coincides with the experimental curve the maximum amplitudes of in line and cross flow response reaching 0 29d and 0 87d in experiment are closely predicted by present numerical simulation where two amplitudes reach 0 23d and 0 82d respectively the spectral analysis is performed on the numerical structural response and fluid force coefficients and corresponding spanwise distributions of the power spectral densities psd are presented in fig 10 as observed from fig 10 a b both the in line and cross flow responses exhibit several distinct spectral peaks which is referred to herein as multi frequency response in structural in line motion two response frequencies are presented around 10 0 hz the cross flow motion presents three spectral peaks corresponding to the frequencies of 4 61 5 12 and 5 83 hz the well defined cells exhibited on the spanwise psd indicate the excitation of specific structural wavenumbers the in line two frequencies correspond to the 12th and 13th wavenumbers and cross flow three frequencies correspond to the 6th 7th and 8th wavenumbers the in line two frequencies of relatively equal amplitude indicate two response modes competing the cross flow second frequency dominating among several peaks indicates the dominance of 6th mode these multiple mode responses agree with the experimental modal weights the in line predominant frequency of 10 29 hz respected to the cross flow predominant frequency of 5 12 hz leads to a ratio of 2 01 this is associated with the dual resonance between in line and cross flow response the similar analysis carried out on the fluid force show that the drag and lift coefficients present similar multiple frequencies corresponding to those of in line and cross flow responses respectively to investigate the response wave pattern fig 11 presents the selected time series evolution of structural cross flow displacement associated with the 7th mode the standing character leads to the formation of defined cells along the span the travelling wave component modulates the partitioning of spanwise cells into band it can be found that the structural cross flow response exhibits a combination of standing and travelling wave pattern the structural response exhibits a more distinct travelling wave character within the span exposed to the current and turn to a pronounced standing wave pattern in still water the oblique evolution denotes that the travelling waves are oriented from the open flow region towards the still water region as the propagation of travelling wave is related to the energy transfer it is expected that the structural vibration in open flow region transfers the energy from the uniform flow to sustain the motion in still water region by the travelling wave component in the discrete vortex method the continuously distributed vorticity flied of fluid is discretized into a series of vortex elements the red and blue points represent the positive and negative vortex elements respectively the clockwise and counter clockwise vortices are identified by the gathering of the vortex elements in blue and red respectively based on the distribution of vortex elements the wake vortex pattern is identifiable in fig 12 the riser displacement contours and spanwise vortex pattern are plotted in fig 13 the instantaneous shedding pattern at planes of z l 0 075 0 15 and 0 225 are presented the plane z l 0 075 is located in the first standing wave crest of response and the plane z l 0 15 and 0 225 are in the second standing response wave the cylinder motion direction is indicated by the short arrow fig 13 a b c present the wake patterns in a vibration period at z l 0 075 it is observed that a pair of vortices in the opposite direction shed from the cylinder in per half vibration cycle which resembles a canonical shedding pattern in 2p mode when the cylinder moves upward downward respectively a clockwise counter clockwise respectively vortex sheds from the cylinder as the cylinder moving the single vortex structure is stretched and splits into two separated smaller vortices which illustrates that the 2p shedding mode is generated from the vortex splitting of 2s mode fig 13 d e f and g h i present the wake patterns at z l 0 15 and 0 225 respectively the vortex shedding in a 2s and 2p mode can be identified at these two planes comparing the vortex shedding at these two planes at same instant when a vortex sheds from the plane of z l 0 15 there is an opposite vortex formed in the wake of plane of z l 0 225 the phase difference in the vortex shedding at these two planes is observed in the case of pure standing wave response in uniform flow newman and karniadakis 1997 reported that the vortex rows present a spanwise symmetry about the standing nodes of response when structural response comes to the travelling wave the spanwise vortices shedding are not symmetrical and the vortex rows present an oblique patterns it is expected that present spanwise different vortex shedding phase is associated with the travelling wave component of the structural response 4 2 in line and cross flow viv simulation in uniform flow lehn 2003 performed the viv model tests on a large aspect ratio riser at marintek s ocean basin laboratory and acquired high quality data on the viv behaviors of riser the experimental data referred to in this paper is acquired from the viv data repository hosted by mit http web mit edu towtank www vivdr referring to the experimental configuration of lehn we carried out the viv simulation on the same riser model in a uniform flow two incoming velocities of 0 42 m s and 0 84 m s are considered corresponding to the reynolds numbers of 8400 and 16800 respectively in this case the flow field around the vertical riser is modelled into 160 computational flow field strips which is equal to the element number applied to the structure the main properties of the vertical riser model are provided in table 2 fig 14 a b and c d present the instantaneous shape of structural in line and cross flow vibrations obtained in experiment and present simulation at the incoming velocity of 0 42 m s fig 14 e and f show the experimental and numerical instantaneous deflected shape of structural cross flow response at the incoming velocity of and 0 84 m s respectively as shown in both the numerical and experimental results the structural viv response exhibits a 2th mode in the crossflow direction and 3th mode in the in line direction at the incoming velocity of 0 42 m s as the incoming velocity increasing to the 0 84 m s structural cross flow response is dominated by the 4th mode for the experiment measured the structural responses at only 8 spanwise sections the deflected shapes of experimental structural in line response cannot be plotted based on eight points the structural in line instantaneous shape in the case of incoming velocity 0 84 m s are not compared in particular the spanwise envelopes exhibit larger amplitude at upper part in both the experimental and numerical results this asymmetry deflection of viv is arisen by the varying geometric stiffness along the span the comparison of the root mean square rms values of structural in line and cross flow response amplitudes along the cylinder are carried out in fig 15 in addition to the experimental rms amplitudes of eight sections the numerical results of huang et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 are referred to using a fully 3d large eddy simulation les wall adapted local eddy viscosity wale model wang et al 2016 simulated the same case of u 0 42 m s uniform flow the same cases of u 0 42 and 0 84 m s uniform flow were also simulated by huang et al 2011 using a 3d finite analytic navier stokes fans code and only cross flow response was considered for the case at incoming velocity of 0 42 m s three numerical rms curves well depict the trend of the points measured from experiment the two peaks of experimental cross flow rms amplitudes reach 0 74d and 0 37d present simulation predicts these two peaks reaching 0 56d and 0 36d the results of huang et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 correspond to the values of 0 83d 0 55d and 0 83d 0 40d respectively the experimental rms amplitudes are slightly under predicted by present q3d model while over predicted by other two fully 3d models for the in line rms amplitudes both the simulations of present model and wang et al 2016 f under predict the experimental values for the case at incoming velocity of 0 84 m s as the high structural modes are excited in both directions the limited experimental measure points hardly depict the rms amplitudes shape but similar rms amplitudes shape and values can be observed between present simulation and huang et al 2011 in fig 15 d the numerically predicted in line rms amplitudes curve is compared with the experimental points the experimental points are generally captured by present simulation figs 16 and 17 present the experimental and numerical temporal evolutions of structural in line and cross flow displacement along the cylinder span respectively the distribution of cells that correspond to alternating response nodes and antinode the formation of defined cells along the span is associated with the standing character of structural response both the numerical and experimental evolutions indicate the dominance of the standing wave pattern in the in line and cross flow responses the comparison of the distribution of cells show that the experimental structural response are well predicted by present simulation in time domain the spanwise distribution of psd of the structural motions in the present simulation are plotted in fig 18 the experimental frequency spectrums of the response at eight spanwise locations are presented in fig 19 both the numerical and experimental results show a single frequency dominating structural in line and cross flow response along the entire span which is associated with a single structural wavenumber excited there is a weaker spectral peak corresponding to the first natural frequency identified in numerical results in detail at the incoming velocity of 0 42 m s the dominant frequencies of in line and cross flow viv responses are 3 02 hz and 5 85 hz corresponding to the values of 2 78 hz and 5 52 hz in experiment respectively in the case at incoming velocity of 0 84 m s the in line and cross flow dominant frequencies obtained in present simulation are 6 71 hz and 12 56 hz which are close to the values of 5 88 hz and 11 70 hz obtained in experiment the predicted frequencies by present simulation are slightly higher than those of experiment the discrepancy might be due to the fact that the experimental displacements are derived from the accelerations while present simulation obtain the displacements directly the uncertainties arise by the different data processing in two cases the occurrence of synchronization between in line and cross flow viv responses is defined by the ratio between in line and cross flow dominant frequencies approximately equal to 2 when the synchronization of the in line and cross flow vibrations occurs which is characterized by the in line vibration at approximately twice the frequency of cross flow vibration the trajectory of structure can be plotted as a figure eight orbit the specific shape and travelling direction of these trajectories are determined by the phase difference between the in line and cross flow motions which indicates the positive or negative effect on the viv as suggested by bourguet et al 2011 b the trajectories where the cylinder motion is opposed to or coincide with the flow at the cross flow maxima are referred to as the counter clockwise or clockwise respectively the trajectories in a counter clockwise clockwise respectively are related to the positive negative energy transfer where the significant viv is excited damped respectively by the flow here the representative trajectories at different spanwise locations in the case of viv at 0 84 m s are presented in fig 20 the moving direction of trajectory is denoted by the arrow the alternating counter clockwise and clockwise of trajectories can be identified at different sections which is related to that the alternant distribution of the favorable and unfavorable viv zones when the structural response is dominated by a standing wave pattern in both the in line and cross flow directions the wake patterns along the cylinder span and the structural displacement contours in cross flow direction under two incoming velocities are presented in fig 21 two principle vortex shedding patterns can be identified in the near wake region it is observed that the vortex pattern resembling a 2s mode can be identified in the region close to the response nodes while a shedding pattern in a 2p mode is excited in the region of response anti nodes associated with the distinct standing character of structure response the similar shedding phase of wake vortices in a standing wave crest is observed in discrete vortex method the viscous diffusion of vortex is numerical simulated by vortex core growing with the circulation of each vortex element constant so it is observed that the vortex elements are equally scattered but not vanish in far wake where the wake vortices dissipate 5 conclusion coupling the strip theory based discrete vortex method with the structure finite element method a quasi three dimensional fsi simulation methodology is developed and employed on the vortex induced vibration of a vertical tensioned riser two riser models in an experimental configurations of chaplin et al 2005 and lehn 2003 are considered in present simulation respectively structural in line and cross flow viv responses and the wake patterns are obtained and studied the numerical simulation in the two dimensional discrete vortex method code is firstly carried out on the viv of a rigid cylinder previously experimentally investigated by khalak and williamson 1996 the cylinder viv response are well predicted by the present numerical simulations three response resonant regimes that involve the initial upper and lower branches are well captured two canonical wake patterns resembling a 2s and 2p modes that correspond to the initial branch and lower branch respectively are visualized by the vortex elements scattered in wake these comparisons demonstrate the validation of present discrete vortex method code in the numerical simulation of the two dimensional flow field associated with viv simulation in the experimental configuration of chaplin et al 2005 the in line and cross flow viv of a long tensioned riser placed within a stepped incoming flow is numerically simulated the mean in line deflection and the instantaneous in line and cross flow oscillation envelopes obtained in present simulation are compared with those measured in experiment good agreement is observed in the comparison of structural maximum in line displacement dominant mode of structure vibration and oscillation amplitude along the cylinder span present numerical results show that the structural response exhibits a mixed standing travelling wave pattern and multiple frequencies correspond to different modes the travelling component of response is developed in open flow region and moves to the still water region visualized by the distribution of vortex elements the wake patterns at different spanwise locations are identified associated with the travelling wave that spanwise vortices shed at different phases is observed simulation in the experimental configuration of lehn 2003 the viv of a vertical riser placed within a uniform incoming flowing is simulated compared with the experimental results present simulation well predicts the main features of structural response involving the in line and cross flow viv responses mode rms amplitude temporal evolution as well as the dominant frequency the structural response in both the in line and cross flow directions is dominated by a standing wave pattern the occurrence of dual resonance between in line and cross flow motions and figure eight trajectory are simulated the varying trajectories in counter clockwise and clockwise indicates that the favorable and unfavorable viv regions are alternately distributed in the standing wave dominant response associated with the cylinder oscillation amplitude two principle vortex shedding patterns that resemble a 2s and 2p modes are excited it is expected that the standing wave component of structural response determines the vortex shedding pattern these numerical simulations carried out on the experimental models reasonably predict the main features of the structural responses and the wake patterns associated with viv proving that this sdvm fem coupled method is an efficient grid independent numerical algorithm in the

spanwise vortices shedding at different phases keywords vortex induced vibration viv strip theory based discrete vortex method sdvm finite element method fem standing wave travelling wave 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of the structures with bluff cross section is encountered in a great variety of engineering fields especially in the offshore oil exploration and production risers as a consequence of significant interactions of the vortex shedding and structural dynamics viv has the considerable potential to cause severe fatigue or stability failures on these structures which leads to sustainable attentions on the prediction and suppression of viv of these structures within the last decade the studies of viv are mainly based on the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the model experiments provided significant discoveries on viv and good benchmarks for verifying numerical prediction model feng 1968 reported the occurrence of resonance would last over a regime of normalized velocity by studying the viv of rigid cylinder at high mass ratios khalak and williamson 1996 studied the hydrodynamic forces and responses associated with viv of a rigid cylinder with low mass and damping three response branches of viv were found govardhan and williamson 2000 further investigated the vortex wake modes associated with these branches jauvtis and williamson 2004 investigated the effect of two degrees of freedom on viv at low mass and damping it was reported that the vibration of in line has a significant effect on that of cross flow when the mass ratio is reduced below 6 moving from the rigid to the long and flexible cylinders lehn 2003 performed the viv model tests on a flexible riser of 9 63m long with length to diameter ratio of 482 the reynolds number in the experiments reaches up to 16800 a comprehensive experimental data on the viv behavior of bare riser fairings installed riser and strakes installed riser was acquired in their study chapin et al 2005 studied the viv of a vertical tensioned riser of 13 12m long with a mass ratio of 3 0 and aspect ratio of 468 in a water tunnel the riser was placed in a stepped current consisting of the uniform flow in the lower part and still water upper trim et al 2005 carried out the viv tests on a model riser of 1400 diameters long in uniform and linearly sheared flow they obtained benchmark information from the viv test on a bare riser and studied the performance of strakes with different geometrics on viv suppression huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b studied the wake structures and viv responses of a flexible riser with aspect ratio 94 the riser is submitted to the uniform flow over the lower 40 of its length the reynolds number ranges from 1200 to 12000 vandiver et al 2009 reported the viv filed experiment on a very long flexible cylinder with the aspect ratio reaching up to 4200 the dominance of travelling wave rather than standing wave structural response was observed they proposed that travelling wave dominates the viv response when the ideal motion trajectories exist along the cylinder span due to the scale or cost limitations of model test the numerical ways including the empirical or semi empirical method and computational fluid dynamics cfd method are widely applied in the viv studies the empirical or semi empirical methods account for structural dynamic response but avoid direct computation of the flow field one group involving the viva triantafyllou 2003 vivana larsen et al 2001 shear 7 vandiver et al 2005 et al variously uses hydrodynamic data from vortex induced or forced vibrations experiment on a rigid cylinder in another group of models such as the wake oscillator model violette et al 2007 wu et al 2008 xu et al 2008 more pragmatic method is adopted to calculate the fluid force where the wake dynamics is represented by a wake oscillator equation these empirical methods generally provide prediction on structural cross flow viv response only with the in line response ignored due to the flow field characteristics of viv cannot be descried by the empirical method cfd methods are widely applied in the simulation and investigation of viv by means of direct numerical simulations dns evangelinos and karniadakis 1999 studied the viv of a flexible cylinder of aspect ratio 12 6 in the lock in regime at a reynolds number 1000 huang et al 2011 presented the numerical simulations of the flexible risers with aspect ratio ranging from 482 to 3350 using a finite analytical navier stokes code integrated with structural motion solver bourguet et al 2011 a b using a three dimensional 3d direct numerical simulation numerically studied the viv of an extensible tensioned riser with length to diameter ratio 200 placed in three different linear sheared incoming flow with reynolds number ranging from 110 to 1100 by means of a commercial ansys mfx multi filed solver and using a k ω turbulence model coupled reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans wang et al 2012 2017 carried out fully 3d simulation on the viv of a drilling riser of actual sizes in the critical fluid flow region the length of simulated drilling riser reaches up to 800m wang et al 2016 used a fully 3d cfd approach simulating the viv of a model riser in the configuration of lehn 2003 a large eddy simulation les wall adapted local eddy viscosity wale model was adopted to solve the flow filed and the structural dynamics is solved by the finite element analysis fea the fsi system is also constructed by the ansys mfx multi filed solver their predicted results show good agreement with the experimental data belonging to the eulerian description these methods mentioned above are numerically implemented based on millions of grids on the flow field which means that a large percentage of the computational efforts is expended on technical details connecting with meshing and numerous computing resources are demanded for grid computing these are among the reasons that interest in so called meshless method has grown rapidly in recent years discrete vortex method dvm originally proposed by chorin 1973 is an efficient and simplified meshless numerical method it discretizes the continuously distributed vorticity flied of fluid into a series of vortex elements and solves the vorticity transport equation to trace the motion of these vortex elements the flow field is understood by integrating the information of whole vortex elements implementing the boundary conditions by the stream function discrete vortex method is well adapted to the simulation of flow field having complex geometric boundaries where the grid of high quality would be guaranteed with the numerical methods in euler frame employed on the other hand solving the motion of thousands of vortex element in lagrangain reference frame discrete vortex method is high efficient in computation of flow field at a relatively high reynolds number based on these characteristics discrete vortex method has been well applied in the numerical simulation of a series of two dimensional flow problems in many previous studies langthjem and olhoff 2004 presented a simulation of the flow induced noise in a two dimensional centrifugal pump using discrete vortex method it reported that discrete vortex method is capable of capturing the essential features of this kind of rotational flow and well estimates the unsteady impeller blade surface forces bimbato et al 2011 studied the vortex shedding flow around a body near a moving ground using discrete vortex method the reynolds number of flow reaches 1 0 10 5 ramesh et al 2014 applied discrete vortex method to the simulation of novel shedding criterion for unsteady aero foil flows compared with experimental and computational results for several aerofoils and reynolds numbers discrete vortex method well simulated the leading edge vortex shedding pang et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients and wake patterns of flow around two circular cylinders in side by side arrangements at a high reynolds number r e 6 10 4 with the pure lagrangian vortex method applied saltara et al 2003 simulated the viv of a rigid cylinder free to vibrate in transverse direction the simulation well captured the initial and lower branches and corresponding wake patterns it is an innovative practice that developing a numerical algorithm integration with the dvm predicts the viv of long flexible risers yamamoto et al 2004 carried out a numerical study on the viv of a marine riser submitted to the uniform and shear flow with discrete vortex method used the simulations are conducted in a wide reynolds numbers region from 4 0 10 4 to 2 3 10 5 structural vibration mode from 1st to 4th excited by varying incoming velocities was presented in the uniform flow cases in the case of riser submitted to the shear flow the numerical results in structural cross flow response were compared with those obtained by quasi steady theory good agreement was observed in these comparisons sun et al 2012 presented the viv simulations of a rigid cylinder and a flexible riser they reported a relatively good agreement between numerical results with the experimental results where a rigid cylinder of single degree of freedom and two degrees of freedom are considered respectively these studies provided conclusive validation against two dimensional discrete vortex method employed in the viv simulation of a rigid cylinder however referring to the benchmark of typical viv model experiment with a flexible riser of high aspect ratio few numerical simulation have been carried out to validate the discrete vortex method in the viv prediction of long and flexible risers for the viv of slender and flexible risers the vortex induced forces experience significant variation in the direction of cylinder span it is an effective practice to use the strip method simplifying the solution of three dimensional flow field into solving a series of two dimensional flow strips to accelerate the solution of flow filed newman and karniadakis 1996 willden and graham 2001 2004 bao et al 2016 duan et al 2018 here coupling the strip theory based discrete vortex method with the finite element method we develop a quasi three dimensional q3d numerical procedure to simulate the viv of a long and flexible riser coupling the strip theory with the discrete vortex method present numerical method accelerates the solution of flow field of viv exponentially compared to the fully three dimensional cfd methods the algorithm developed in this paper is especially efficient in cases with very long risers in addition that computation is implemented independent of grid means a certain advantage in the numerical convenience and flexibility it is ideally suited to the cases where there are two or more cylinders involved referring to two typical experimental configurations the viv simulations of a long vertical riser subjected to a stepped and uniform flow are carried out in this paper the in line and cross flow viv responses of the riser are obtained detailed comparisons are carried out between the present numerical prediction and the experimental data in both the in line and cross flow viv responses involving the structural viv response mode amplitude as well as the dominant frequency the wake vortex patterns are also presented and investigated on the basis of scattered vortex elements some further findings based on the simulation are also presented 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equation for flow field for the incompressible viscous flow the equation governing the flow filed can be formulated by the continuity equation of eq 1 and the navier stokes ns equation of eq 2 1 v 0 2 v t v v 1 ρ p v 2 v where v is the velocity vector of fluid ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity considering that the vorticity can be expressed by the curl of the velocity ω v and assuming that the flow is two dimensional eq 1 can be rewritten as the vorticity stream function form of eq 3 and eq 2 can be rewritten as the vorticity transport equation of eq 4 3 ω 2 φ 4 ω t v ω v 2 ω where φ is the stream function with the operator splitting method employed eq 4 can be divided into two parts the convection equation of eq 5 and the diffusion equation of eq 6 these two parts are solved sequentially 5 ω t v ω 0 6 ω t v 2 ω eq 5 indicates that the discretization of the vorticity field generates the vortex particles having a constant circulation for computing the convection velocities of these particles the biot savart law is introduced to compute the stream function φ from the poisson equation of eq 3 by taking the curl of the computed stream function the general expression of the convection velocity field is given as eq 7 7 v r t 1 2 π r r i ω r i t r r i 2 d v v where r and r i are the position vectors v represents the velocity vector at infinity and ω r i t is the vorticity at r i for the diffusion equation it has the same form as the one dimensional heat conduction equation its fundamental solution is the green s function referring to the quantum field theory chorin 1973 introduced a random walk method to simulate the viscous diffusion of vorticity this random walk motion of vortex elements produce the exact solution in general but inherently leading to the random fluctuation in numerical results based on the theory of boundary layer diffusion a vortex element of growing core model is introduced to simulate the viscous diffusion of vortex park and higuchi 1989 obeying an exponential law given by eq 8 the growing core of vortex elements approximately simulate the viscous diffusion 8 σ n 1 σ n 2 4 946 v δ t where δ t is the time increment in computation σ n is the core size of vortex element at n th time step in early discrete vortex methods a point vortex model is used to discretize the continuous vorticity field this point vortex inducing the velocity field becomes unbounded near the vortex element core this unbounded induced velocity easily causes the divergence in numerical implementation to avoid the velocity singularity induced by point vortex element a vortex model of so called vortex blob the vortex element with finite core radius having more realistic vorticity distribution and bounded induced velocity is introduced chorin 1973 using the vortex blob model we have the expression of velocity field induced by vortex element as eq 9 9 u θ i γ i 2 π r r 2 σ i 2 where u θ i is the velocity vector at the position vector r induced by the i th vortex element γ i is the circulation of i th vortex element and σ i is the core size of i th vortex element modeling the continuously distributed vorticity field by a series of vortex elements the velocities at position r can obtained by the superposition of the induced velocities by the vortex elements in whole flow field then the discrete solution of eq 7 can be expressed as follows 10 u r u i 1 n γ i 2 π y r y i r r i 2 σ i 2 11 v r i 1 n γ i 2 π x r x i r r i 2 σ i 2 where u r and v r is the in line and cross flow velocities at radius vector r n is the number of vortex elements in flow field u denotes the in line velocity of incoming flow and r i is the radius vector of i th vortex element 2 2 numerical implementation of discrete vortex method in the discrete vortex method the essential ideal is that the continuous vorticity field is discretized into a series of vortex elements for the flow around a circular cylinder the viscous effect is considered to concentrate on the thin boundary layer near body and the karman vortex in the wake is formed by the boundary layer shedding so the discrete vortex elements are firstly generated around the cylinder surface to represent the vorticity in boundary layer which can be called surface vortex element see fig 1 then the convection and diffusion of the vorticity from the boundary layer can be simulated by the motion of surface vortex elements the induced stream function ψ i can be derived from the induced velocity field equation 9 which can be expressed as eq 12 12 ψ i γ i 4 π ln r 2 σ i 2 accumulating the stream function values induced three parts the uniform flow at infinity the n s surface vortex elements and the n w vortex elements in wake the stream function of flow field can be determined as eq 13 13 ψ k u y k 1 4 π i 1 n s γ i ln r k r i 2 σ i 2 1 4 π j 1 n w γ j ln r k r j 2 σ j 2 to determine the circulation of surface vortex elements in second item of eq 13 the impermeability boundary condition on cylinder wall would be satisfied by the mean of that the difference of stream function between two points on the body is equal to the volume flowrate between these two points for the moving cylinder it generates eq 14 14 ψ i 1 ψ i u c n δ s where ψ i is the steam function at i th surface element u c is the velocity vector of cylinder and δ s is the distance of two control points considering that n s vortex elements are generated around cylinder at each time step the wall of cylinder can be divided into n s surface elements corresponding to the surface vortex elements then n s stream function equations contented with the boundary condition can be formulated to solve the circulations of these new generated vortex elements after rearranging these equations a system of linear equations can be formulated as eq 15 15 a γ β where the element of coefficient matrix a is expressed as eq 16 16 a k i 1 4 π ln r k 1 r i 2 σ i 2 r k r i 2 σ i 2 and the element of vector b is expressed as eq 17 17 b k u u c r k 1 r k 1 4 π i 1 n w γ i ln r k 1 r i 2 σ i 2 r k r i 2 σ i 2 by solving eq 14 the circulation γ of each surface vortex element are determined which indicates that the wall boundary condition is constantly satisfied at the time when the surface vortex elements are generated governed by the vorticity transport equation the motion of vortex elements are traced in the lagrangian reference frame each vortex element motion involves two processes the convection motion and the core growing motion the convection motion of vortex elements are solved by the upwind difference format which can be formulated by eq 18 18 r i n 1 r i n u i n δ t the velocity vector of vortex element u i n can be obtained by substituting current position vector r i n into the convection velocity equations acquiring the motion of whole vortex elements then the flow field can be understood by integrating the information of these vortex elements in numerical implementation the number of vortex elements will increase rapidly with the surface vortex elements generated at each time step leading to computational time consuming proportionally growing so a method of vortex element mergence introduced by spalart and leonard 1981 is used to control the vortex elements number in the wake the mergence condition of two vortex elements is expressed as eq 19 19 γ i γ j γ i γ j r i r j 2 v s d i 3 v s d j 3 v w where v s determines the number of vortex elements near body and v w determines the number of vortex elements in flow field d i and d j indicate

respected to cylinder a x and a y are the acceleration of cylinder in in line and cross flow directions 2 3 numerical solution of structural dynamics the riser a long and flexile structure can be modelled as an extensible tensioned bernoulli euler beam and the shear deformation can be ignored compared to the bending deformation in the viv response considering the internal fluid mass and the pre tension loaded at top the dynamical governing equations of riser can be expressed as follows 26 m 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t 2 z 2 e i z 2 x z t z 2 z t z t x z t z f x z t where z is the non

is the length of beam element n z is the shape function matrix of beam element the structural dynamics equation is solved by the newmark method in time domain where the integration factor α and β are set at 0 5 and 0 25 respectively the viv response of riser is obtained at each time step 2 4 fluid structure interaction the fsi system is constructed by the weak coupling method the governing equations of the fluid and structure are explicitly solved separately the data exchanging between the flow field computation and the structural response calculation is performed one time within each time step in the computation of the flow filed based on the strip theory the three dimensional flow field around the flexible cylinder is approximately simulated by a series of two dimensional flow strips placed along the cylinder span the hydrodynamic forces obtained from the flow filed computation are passed in the load matrix of the structural dynamic calculation the structural responses are send back to update the boundary of the flow strips at next time step the numerical process of viv simulation using discrete vortex method can be described as fig 2 and the strip theory based numerical model is sketched as fig 3 3 viv simulation of a rigid cylinder to validate the numerical algorithm presented in this paper the numerical simulation have been carried out on the viv of a rigid cylinder that was experimentally studied by khalak and williamson 1996 the cylinder is constrained to oscillate in the transverse direction the mass ratio between the cylinder and the displaced fluid is 2 4 the damping and natural frequency of system in air are set equal to 5 42 10 3 and 0 5 hz respectively the amplitude response of the cylinder as a function of the reduced velocity obtained from the present numerical study is shown in fig 4 compared to the experimental results denoted by the square symbol the peak of vibration amplitude obtained by the present simulations reaches up to 0 86d corresponding to the reduced velocity of 5 51 which is lower than the peak value of 0 95d at the reduced velocity about 5 0 in the experiment in the experimental study the curve of vibration amplitude versus the reduced velocity is divided into three branches which involves the initial branch at reduced velocities below 4 0 the upper branch at reduced velocities between 4 0 and 6 0 and the lower branch in the region of 6 5 ur 12 0 these three branches are well captured in our present simulations here we also present the numerical results of pan et al 2007 by means of the rans code coupled with the sst k ω turbulence model and numerical results of saltara et al 2003 in fig 4 the results of pan et al and saltara et al failed to capture the upper branch around ur 5 0 in saltara s simulations the discrete vortex method was employed with the diffusion part solved by random walk method which indicates that the vortex core growing method is relatively more appropriate than random walk method in simulating the diffusion part fig 5 presents the comparison of the experimental and present numerical cylinder cross flow displacement time series at three representative reduced velocities 3 92 5 73 and 7 86 it is observed that the oscillation amplitudes reach 0 21d 0 66d and 0 52d in the figures by numerical simulations which well correspond with the experimental values of 0 19d 0 69d and 0 51d respectively these comparisons show that the cylinder viv response obtained by present numerical simulations well coincide with the experimental results previous studies revealed the existence of different wake vortex patterns that are associated with the response branches govardhan and williamson 2000 here we present the vorticity field within the regimes of three branches from the study of govardhan and williamson 2000 which were measured by the dpiv technique by the discrete vortex method the vorticity field is similarly represented by the distribution of the vortex elements where the vortex structures in the wake are identified in fig 6 the figures a b and c are the vorticity contours obtained by dpiv and the figures d e and f are the point clouds of vortex elements obtained by discrete vortex method fig 6 a and d present the vortex pattern in the regime of initial branch fig 6 b and e present the vortex pattern in the regime of upper branch and fig 6 c and f present the vortex patterns corresponding to the lower branch in each pair of figures the point clouds of vortex elements have the similar vorticity distribution as the vorticity contours where the vortex shedding pattern resembles a 2s mode that is characterized by two single vortices shedding per oscillation cycle in the initial branch and resembles a mode of 2p in the upper and lower branches characterized by two pairs of vortices shedding per oscillation cycle the above comparisons illustrate that the cylinder dynamic response and wake vortex shedding pattern can be well captured by present numerical simulations which confirms the capacity of present two dimensional discrete vortex method code in the simulation of viv of a rigid cylinder 4 viv simulation of a flexible riser based on the strip theory the three dimensional flow filed is modelled into a series of two dimensional flow strips each flow strip is numerically solved by the discrete vortex method we generate the computational flow field strip at each beam element node of the structure to obtain the hydrodynamic force along the cylinder span coupled with the structural finite element model this method is applied to solve the viv of the flexible cylinder here two typical viv experiments are referred to in our simulations the experiments were performed by lehn 2003 and chaplin et al 2005 considering a long flexible cylinder placed within a uniform flow and a stepped flow respectively both two cylinders are hinge pinned at both ends with a top tension applied and free to move in the in line and cross flow directions 4 1 in line and cross flow viv simulation in stepped flow chaplin et al 2005 carried out a comprehensive measurement on the viv of a vertical tensioned riser with length to diameter ratio of 468 and mass ratio of 3 0 the riser was placed within a stepped flow with the lower 45 of cylinder span exposed to a uniform flow the high wavenumber vibrations of riser were excited in their experiment in this section referring to the experimental configuration of chaplin et al we carried out the numerical simulation on the viv of a same riser at a reynolds number 2 38 104 in the simulation the riser is meshed into 120 beam elements in the spanwise direction 54 computational flow field strips are employed to simulate the incoming flow at the lower 45 the main parameters of riser are summarized in table 1 fig 7 presents the typical instantaneous displacement shapes of riser in the in line and cross flow directions measured in the experiment and relevant numerical results are shown in fig 8 from the time averaged in line deflection of the riser presented in figs 7 a and fig 8 a it is observed that the riser exhibits an asymmetric in line bending deflection where the maximum in line displacement occurs at 35 of the span and reaches approximately 11 2d in experiment and 10 8d in present simulation comparing the envelopes of riser in line and cross flow vibrations in fig 7 b c with those in fig 8 b c the experimental envelope of structural motion indicates that the viv response of riser is dominated by the 12th and 7th modes in in line and cross flow directions while the riser vibrating in the 13th and 7th modes in two directions are observed in present simulation there is a slight over prediction in the in line viv modes by present numerical simulation the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental in line response envelopes is caused by the structural in line response exhibiting two frequencies two frequencies correspond to a wavenumber of 12th and 13th respectively this multi mode response is illustrated by fig 10 a and it was also reported in the experiment of chaplin et al 2005 because of the combination of 12th and 13th wavenumbers in the in line response the numerical and experimental envelopes covering different time span exhibit the mode difference in fig 9 the structural in line and cross flow vibrational maximum amplitudes along the cylinder span are compared concerning the envelope shape of structural displacement the distribution of wave nodes minima of the amplitude envelope and anti nodes maxima of the amplitude envelope obtained by the simulation well coincides with the experimental curve the maximum amplitudes of in line and cross flow response reaching 0 29d and 0 87d in experiment are closely predicted by present numerical simulation where two amplitudes reach 0 23d and 0 82d respectively the spectral analysis is performed on the numerical structural response and fluid force coefficients and corresponding spanwise distributions of the power spectral densities psd are presented in fig 10 as observed from fig 10 a b both the in line and cross flow responses exhibit several distinct spectral peaks which is referred to herein as multi frequency response in structural in line motion two response frequencies are presented around 10 0 hz the cross flow motion presents three spectral peaks corresponding to the frequencies of 4 61 5 12 and 5 83 hz the well defined cells exhibited on the spanwise psd indicate the excitation of specific structural wavenumbers the in line two frequencies correspond to the 12th and 13th wavenumbers and cross flow three frequencies correspond to the 6th 7th and 8th wavenumbers the in line two frequencies of relatively equal amplitude indicate two response modes competing the cross flow second frequency dominating among several peaks indicates the dominance of 6th mode these multiple mode responses agree with the experimental modal weights the in line predominant frequency of 10 29 hz respected to the cross flow predominant frequency of 5 12 hz leads to a ratio of 2 01 this is associated with the dual resonance between in line and cross flow response the similar analysis carried out on the fluid force show that the drag and lift coefficients present similar multiple frequencies corresponding to those of in line and cross flow responses respectively to investigate the response wave pattern fig 11 presents the selected time series evolution of structural cross flow displacement associated with the 7th mode the standing character leads to the formation of defined cells along the span the travelling wave component modulates the partitioning of spanwise cells into band it can be found that the structural cross flow response exhibits a combination of standing and travelling wave pattern the structural response exhibits a more distinct travelling wave character within the span exposed to the current and turn to a pronounced standing wave pattern in still water the oblique evolution denotes that the travelling waves are oriented from the open flow region towards the still water region as the propagation of travelling wave is related to the energy transfer it is expected that the structural vibration in open flow region transfers the energy from the uniform flow to sustain the motion in still water region by the travelling wave component in the discrete vortex method the continuously distributed vorticity flied of fluid is discretized into a series of vortex elements the red and blue points represent the positive and negative vortex elements respectively the clockwise and counter clockwise vortices are identified by the gathering of the vortex elements in blue and red respectively based on the distribution of vortex elements the wake vortex pattern is identifiable in fig 12 the riser displacement contours and spanwise vortex pattern are plotted in fig 13 the instantaneous shedding pattern at planes of z l 0 075 0 15 and 0 225 are presented the plane z l 0 075 is located in the first standing wave crest of response and the plane z l 0 15 and 0 225 are in the second standing response wave the cylinder motion direction is indicated by the short arrow fig 13 a b c present the wake patterns in a vibration period at z l 0 075 it is observed that a pair of vortices in the opposite direction shed from the cylinder in per half vibration cycle which resembles a canonical shedding pattern in 2p mode when the cylinder moves upward downward respectively a clockwise counter clockwise respectively vortex sheds from the cylinder as the cylinder moving the single vortex structure is stretched and splits into two separated smaller vortices which illustrates that the 2p shedding mode is generated from the vortex splitting of 2s mode fig 13 d e f and g h i present the wake patterns at z l 0 15 and 0 225 respectively the vortex shedding in a 2s and 2p mode can be identified at these two planes comparing the vortex shedding at these two planes at same instant when a vortex sheds from the plane of z l 0 15 there is an opposite vortex formed in the wake of plane of z l 0 225 the phase difference in the vortex shedding at these two planes is observed in the case of pure standing wave response in uniform flow newman and karniadakis 1997 reported that the vortex rows present a spanwise symmetry about the standing nodes of response when structural response comes to the travelling wave the spanwise vortices shedding are not symmetrical and the vortex rows present an oblique patterns it is expected that present spanwise different vortex shedding phase is associated with the travelling wave component of the structural response 4 2 in line and cross flow viv simulation in uniform flow lehn 2003 performed the viv model tests on a large aspect ratio riser at marintek s ocean basin laboratory and acquired high quality data on the viv behaviors of riser the experimental data referred to in this paper is acquired from the viv data repository hosted by mit http web mit edu towtank www vivdr referring to the experimental configuration of lehn we carried out the viv simulation on the same riser model in a uniform flow two incoming velocities of 0 42 m s and 0 84 m s are considered corresponding to the reynolds numbers of 8400 and 16800 respectively in this case the flow field around the vertical riser is modelled into 160 computational flow field strips which is equal to the element number applied to the structure the main properties of the vertical riser model are provided in table 2 fig 14 a b and c d present the instantaneous shape of structural in line and cross flow vibrations obtained in experiment and present simulation at the incoming velocity of 0 42 m s fig 14 e and f show the experimental and numerical instantaneous deflected shape of structural cross flow response at the incoming velocity of and 0 84 m s respectively as shown in both the numerical and experimental results the structural viv response exhibits a 2th mode in the crossflow direction and 3th mode in the in line direction at the incoming velocity of 0 42 m s as the incoming velocity increasing to the 0 84 m s structural cross flow response is dominated by the 4th mode for the experiment measured the structural responses at only 8 spanwise sections the deflected shapes of experimental structural in line response cannot be plotted based on eight points the structural in line instantaneous shape in the case of incoming velocity 0 84 m s are not compared in particular the spanwise envelopes exhibit larger amplitude at upper part in both the experimental and numerical results this asymmetry deflection of viv is arisen by the varying geometric stiffness along the span the comparison of the root mean square rms values of structural in line and cross flow response amplitudes along the cylinder are carried out in fig 15 in addition to the experimental rms amplitudes of eight sections the numerical results of huang et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 are referred to using a fully 3d large eddy simulation les wall adapted local eddy viscosity wale model wang et al 2016 simulated the same case of u 0 42 m s uniform flow the same cases of u 0 42 and 0 84 m s uniform flow were also simulated by huang et al 2011 using a 3d finite analytic navier stokes fans code and only cross flow response was considered for the case at incoming velocity of 0 42 m s three numerical rms curves well depict the trend of the points measured from experiment the two peaks of experimental cross flow rms amplitudes reach 0 74d and 0 37d present simulation predicts these two peaks reaching 0 56d and 0 36d the results of huang et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 correspond to the values of 0 83d 0 55d and 0 83d 0 40d respectively the experimental rms amplitudes are slightly under predicted by present q3d model while over predicted by other two fully 3d models for the in line rms amplitudes both the simulations of present model and wang et al 2016 f under predict the experimental values for the case at incoming velocity of 0 84 m s as the high structural modes are excited in both directions the limited experimental measure points hardly depict the rms amplitudes shape but similar rms amplitudes shape and values can be observed between present simulation and huang et al 2011 in fig 15 d the numerically predicted in line rms amplitudes curve is compared with the experimental points the experimental points are generally captured by present simulation figs 16 and 17 present the experimental and numerical temporal evolutions of structural in line and cross flow displacement along the cylinder span respectively the distribution of cells that correspond to alternating response nodes and antinode the formation of defined cells along the span is associated with the standing character of structural response both the numerical and experimental evolutions indicate the dominance of the standing wave pattern in the in line and cross flow responses the comparison of the distribution of cells show that the experimental structural response are well predicted by present simulation in time domain the spanwise distribution of psd of the structural motions in the present simulation are plotted in fig 18 the experimental frequency spectrums of the response at eight spanwise locations are presented in fig 19 both the numerical and experimental results show a single frequency dominating structural in line and cross flow response along the entire span which is associated with a single structural wavenumber excited there is a weaker spectral peak corresponding to the first natural frequency identified in numerical results in detail at the incoming velocity of 0 42 m s the dominant frequencies of in line and cross flow viv responses are 3 02 hz and 5 85 hz corresponding to the values of 2 78 hz and 5 52 hz in experiment respectively in the case at incoming velocity of 0 84 m s the in line and cross flow dominant frequencies obtained in present simulation are 6 71 hz and 12 56 hz which are close to the values of 5 88 hz and 11 70 hz obtained in experiment the predicted frequencies by present simulation are slightly higher than those of experiment the discrepancy might be due to the fact that the experimental displacements are derived from the accelerations while present simulation obtain the displacements directly the uncertainties arise by the different data processing in two cases the occurrence of synchronization between in line and cross flow viv responses is defined by the ratio between in line and cross flow dominant frequencies approximately equal to 2 when the synchronization of the in line and cross flow vibrations occurs which is characterized by the in line vibration at approximately twice the frequency of cross flow vibration the trajectory of structure can be plotted as a figure eight orbit the specific shape and travelling direction of these trajectories are determined by the phase difference between the in line and cross flow motions which indicates the positive or negative effect on the viv as suggested by bourguet et al 2011 b the trajectories where the cylinder motion is opposed to or coincide with the flow at the cross flow maxima are referred to as the counter clockwise or clockwise respectively the trajectories in a counter clockwise clockwise respectively are related to the positive negative energy transfer where the significant viv is excited damped respectively by the flow here the representative trajectories at different spanwise locations in the case of viv at 0 84 m s are presented in fig 20 the moving direction of trajectory is denoted by the arrow the alternating counter clockwise and clockwise of trajectories can be identified at different sections which is related to that the alternant distribution of the favorable and unfavorable viv zones when the structural response is dominated by a standing wave pattern in both the in line and cross flow directions the wake patterns along the cylinder span and the structural displacement contours in cross flow direction under two incoming velocities are presented in fig 21 two principle vortex shedding patterns can be identified in the near wake region it is observed that the vortex pattern resembling a 2s mode can be identified in the region close to the response nodes while a shedding pattern in a 2p mode is excited in the region of response anti nodes associated with the distinct standing character of structure response the similar shedding phase of wake vortices in a standing wave crest is observed in discrete vortex method the viscous diffusion of vortex is numerical simulated by vortex core growing with the circulation of each vortex element constant so it is observed that the vortex elements are equally scattered but not vanish in far wake where the wake vortices dissipate 5 conclusion coupling the strip theory based discrete vortex method with the structure finite element method a quasi three dimensional fsi simulation methodology is developed and employed on the vortex induced vibration of a vertical tensioned riser two riser models in an experimental configurations of chaplin et al 2005 and lehn 2003 are considered in present simulation respectively structural in line and cross flow viv responses and the wake patterns are obtained and studied the numerical simulation in the two dimensional discrete vortex method code is firstly carried out on the viv of a rigid cylinder previously experimentally investigated by khalak and williamson 1996 the cylinder viv response are well predicted by the present numerical simulations three response resonant regimes that involve the initial upper and lower branches are well captured two canonical wake patterns resembling a 2s and 2p modes that correspond to the initial branch and lower branch respectively are visualized by the vortex elements scattered in wake these comparisons demonstrate the validation of present discrete vortex method code in the numerical simulation of the two dimensional flow field associated with viv simulation in the experimental configuration of chaplin et al 2005 the in line and cross flow viv of a long tensioned riser placed within a stepped incoming flow is numerically simulated the mean in line deflection and the instantaneous in line and cross flow oscillation envelopes obtained in present simulation are compared with those measured in experiment good agreement is observed in the comparison of structural maximum in line displacement dominant mode of structure vibration and oscillation amplitude along the cylinder span present numerical results show that the structural response exhibits a mixed standing travelling wave pattern and multiple frequencies correspond to different modes the travelling component of response is developed in open flow region and moves to the still water region visualized by the distribution of vortex elements the wake patterns at different spanwise locations are identified associated with the travelling wave that spanwise vortices shed at different phases is observed simulation in the experimental configuration of lehn 2003 the viv of a vertical riser placed within a uniform incoming flowing is simulated compared with the experimental results present simulation well predicts the main features of structural response involving the in line and cross flow viv responses mode rms amplitude temporal evolution as well as the dominant frequency the structural response in both the in line and cross flow directions is dominated by a standing wave pattern the occurrence of dual resonance between in line and cross flow motions and figure eight trajectory are simulated the varying trajectories in counter clockwise and clockwise indicates that the favorable and unfavorable viv regions are alternately distributed in the standing wave dominant response associated with the cylinder oscillation amplitude two principle vortex shedding patterns that resemble a 2s and 2p modes are excited it is expected that the standing wave component of structural response determines the vortex shedding pattern these numerical simulations carried out on the experimental models reasonably predict the main features of the structural responses and the wake patterns associated with viv proving that this sdvm fem coupled method is an efficient grid independent numerical algorithm in the viv simulation of flexible riser as this paper mainly focusses on the introduction and validation of this method some further investigation can be carried out on the viv of actual marine risers and

23068,it is known that the seepage force has a significant impact on the mobility of bed particles to assess the effect of seepage force on the sediment transport around a suspended pipeline a series of numerical tests have been carried out utilising the commercial software comsol in the simulation the shear stress transport turbulence model was used to simulate the upper turbulence flow field and the porous medium model was adopted to describe the dynamic response of the underlying seabed both the fluid flow and the seepage flow within the seabed were modelled the effect of the vertical seepage force on the shields number was investigated the simulation results indicate that seepage plays a vital role in the process of tunnel scour but becomes quite weak with the form of a scour hole beneath the pipeline with an increase in scour depth vortices shed from the pipe lead to a fluctuating fluid pressure inducing significant upward seepage and thus influencing the stability of bed particles if sagging of the pipeline appears the fluctuation of fluid pressure becomes weak and the seepage effect is minor keywords turbulent flow porous seabed seepage flow shields number excess pore pressure 1 introduction pipelines are widely utilised to transport oil and gas in offshore engineering in the field free spans may develop along a pipeline lying on the seabed owing to local scour posing a risk to the safety of the pipeline it is pivotal to understand the inner mechanism of local scour around pipelines laid on the seabed chiew 1990 conducted a series of typical experiments and noted that the piping created the primary inducement of the onset of local scour which was generally called tunnel scour once tunnel scour began a scour hole appeared and became deeper and deeper until reaching an equilibrium depth many efforts were made to predict the maximum scour depth under the current condition chao and hennessy 1972 kjeldsen et al 1973 mao 1986 sumer and fredsøe 1990 chiew 1991 to judge when the maximum scour depth is reached it is necessary to determine the threshold condition for sediment incipient motion it is mostly recommended to use the shields diagram shields 1936 the shields diagram was further modified to apply to not only unidirectional flows and horizontal beds but also oscillatory flows madsen and grant 1976 and non horizontal slopes whitehouse and hardisty 1988 in essence the sediment particle on the bed surface is subjected to driving and resisting forces the driving force induced by the flow near the bed tends to drive the particle to move the resisting force is a type of coulomb friction force that is proportional to the net submerged weight of the particle the net submerged weight can be considered as the submerged weight subtracting the other upward external forces such as seepage force cheng and chiew 1998a 1999 conducted analytical and experimental research to study the effect of seepage on the bed shear stress and critical condition of sediment incipient motion in open channel flow liu and chiew 2012 further studied the effect of suction and injection on the critical shear stress and found that upward seepage injection could decrease the critical shear velocity while downward seepage suction would increase it previous research li and cheng 1999 cheng and li 2003 liang and cheng 2005a b involving numerical simulation of local scour around pipelines has ignored the seepage effect for simplicity therefore this paper aims to investigate the effect of the seepage force on the mobility of particles at different stages of local scour around a pipeline based on bed profiles data from mao s 1986 experiments a series of numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the responses of flow and seepage fields then by including the vertical seepage force a modified shields number was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the effect of seepage flow on shields number around a fixed and sagging pipeline 2 basic theories and numerical modelling 2 1 fluid flow model the governing equations for the turbulent flow are the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which are expressed

detailed here 2 2 seabed model with seepage flow sumer and fredsøe 2006 noted that alternate vortex formation and shedding would happen when water flows around a cylinder for a typical range of reynolds number the alternate vortex formation and shedding can induce fluctuating water pressure inside the seabed just like the waves a porous medium model for wave seabed interaction is used in

pipe seabed numerical model a two dimensional numerical model as shown in fig 1 was established in comsol to simulate the local flow around a pipeline comsol is commercial software that can model and solve many kinds of scientific and engineering problems comsol multiphysics reference manual 2016 using comsol it is easy to define the relevant physical quantities such as material properties loads constraints etc in this study the flow field and the seabed model are simulated by the fluid dynamics module and user defined partial differential equations respectively the upper domain is the flow field around the pipeline and the lower domain is the porous seabed the bed profiles represented by boundary ab in fig 1 and pipe positions at different moments from mao 1986 work were used as the bed and pipe boundaries in the numerical models so the sediment motion was considered based on the coupling of numerical simulation with experimental results this is a kind of physical numerical coupling analysis which aims to reveal the inner mechanisms of local scouring that cannot be investigated merely through experiments the first type of experiment considered the scouring around a fixed pipe laid on the seabed in a current with the conditions of w 0 d 0 and θ 0 098 w 0 d is the initial gap ratio and θ is the shields number in the far field the other type of experiment considered the sagging of the pipe by keeping the pipe moving down towards the bed at a constant speed of 0 62 mm s with the initial conditions of w 0 d 0 1 and θ 0 098 the simulations aimed to study the response of seepage flow inside the seabed and its effects on the incipient motion of sediment during different scouring stages key parameters such as the diameter of the pipe and sand features are the same as those used by mao 1986 the length and height of the computational domain were equal to 30d and 8d respectively the distance between the pipeline and the inlet boundary was 10d fig 2 shows typical finite element meshes near the pipe structured triangular elements are mainly used to simulate the flow and seabed domains while the regions close to the pipe surface and the seabed surface are simulated by boundary layer meshes all of which are quadrangular elements the distance of the boundary element next to the pipe or seabed surfaces δy is 0 0002d with a growth factor of 1 15 in the normal direction the non dimensional mesh size y δy u υ where u is the friction velocity thus the value of δy is smaller than 1 for all the simulation cases the computational time step δt 2 10 4 s the courant number c uδt δx where δx is the grid resolution in this study the values of c in the normal and tangential directions of boundary layers are about 0 5754 and 0 0063 respectively which is much less than 1 2 3 1 boundary conditions boundary ad is the inlet of the flow where a fully developed hydraulically smooth turbulent velocity profile is applied as 7 u x y u y u υ y u υ 11 63 u x y u 1 κ ln 9 0 y u υ y u υ 11 63 8 u y y 0 where u is the friction velocity and κ is the von kármán constant 0 42 the profiles of turbulence quantities are specified as 9 k y max c μ 1 2 1 z δ 2 u 2 0 0005 u

turbulence quantities are implemented a reference pressure of p y 0 is given at the outlet boundary a no slip condition is imposed on boundary ab and the pipe surface which means that the velocities there in both the x and y directions are zero the turbulent kinetic energy k is zero and the turbulence specific dissipation rate ω can be obtained by ω 10 6 υ β 1 δ y 2 where υ is the kinematic viscosity of water and δy is the distance between the nearest grid point and the surface boundary cd is a frictionless slip wall where the vertical velocity and the gradients of horizontal velocities

in the seabed firstly the fluid model is solved to obtain the velocities of flow field bed shear stress and pressure acting on the seabed then the seabed model is solved with the calculated pressure on the seabed to obtain the seepage field both in the simulations of upper flow field and seepage field the pipe position and seabed profile are updated according to mao s 1986 experimental data finally the shields number is modified by considering the effect of seepage force the coupling method of flow field and seepage field is illustrated in fig 3 it can be seen that the simulation only considers how the upper flow affects the seepage field and ignores the effects of seepage on the upper flow field it must be noted that many researchers have studied the seepage effects on turbulent flow and sediment entrainment on a porous bed lu et al 2008 reviewed and summarised these studies it has been verified that the presence of seepage can cause a deviation to the logarithmic law of the wall willetts and drossos 1975 schlichting 1979 maclean 1991 cheng and chiew 1998a b chen and chiew 2004 cao and chiew 2015 but there is still conflict on how the seepage force affects the bed shear stress therefore this paper only revises the resistance term through seepage force and does not consider the seepage effect on the shear stress 3 physics behind the incipient motion of a bed particle the seepage can cause a modification to the forces applied to sediment particles as has been stated in cheng and chiew 1999 a cohesionless sediment particle resting on a porous bed experiences its submerged weight force w drag force f d lift force f l and seepage force f s as is shown in fig 4 assuming all bed particles are spheres with a uniform diameter of d 50 these forces can be expressed as 13 w ρ d ρ w g π d 50 3 6 14 f d c d π d 50 2 4 ρ w u b 2 2 15 f l c l π d 50 2 4 ρ w u b 2 2 where ρ d and ρ w are the densities of sediment particles and water respectively g is the gravitational acceleration c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients respectively u b is the approach flow velocity of the particle at the bed surface and d 50 stands for the mean diameter of sediment particles it has been demonstrated in cheng and chiew 1999 that the seepage force f s is induced by vertical variation of nonhydrostatic pressure p at the seabed surface and is expressed as 16 f s p y π d 50 3 6 1 n s a seepage scaling factor e s is defined as the ratio of the seepage force to the submerged particle weight and is given by 17 e s f s w p y 1 n s ρ d ρ w g p y ρ s g and the modified submerged weight w can be expressed as 18 w w f s 1 e s w 1 e s ρ d ρ w g π d 50 3 6 in most previous works the dimensionless shields number θ has been defined as 19 θ τ b ρ d ρ w g d 50 where τ b is the bed shear stress here the effect of seepage force is ignored f s 0 however the seepage flow may make considerable modifications to the submerged weight of sediment particles the modified shields number θ considers the seepage effect and becomes as follows 20 θ τ b 1 e s ρ d ρ w g d 50 1 1 e s θ the factor e s 0 means that the seepage flow is downward to stabilise the sediment particles at the bed surface an upward seepage flow makes 0 e s 1 which tends to lift the bed particles the scaling factor cannot be larger than 1 because in that case the particle would have been suspended in the fluid and washed away it should be noted that in real conditions the bed shear stress τ b will be also affected by the seepage flow thus the revised shields number expressed in eq 20 will overestimate the seepage effect this kind of seepage effect is not considered in this paper and should be investigated through well designed experiments in the future 4 validation of the numerical model validations were conducted to assess the reliability of the sst model adopting a gap ratio of 0 37 and reynolds number of 7000 which were the same as those used in jensen 1987 experiments the calculated flow velocities were compared with the experimental results the simulated time averaged horizontal and vertical velocity components at different cross sections downstream of the pipe are given in figs 5 and 6 together with jensen s experimental results 1987 it is shown that the time averaged horizontal u x and vertical u y velocities calculated by the sst model are roughly consistent with the experimental data there are only a few differences at the cross sections near the pipe x 2 5d figs 7 and 8 show a comparison between the calculated velocity fluctuation components and the experimental results from jensen s 1987 work the velocity fluctuations are defined as the root mean square rms of the deviation of velocity samples to the long time averaged value 21 δ u x i 1 n u x i u x 2 n 22 δ u y i 1 n u y i u y 2 n where n is the total number of velocity samples u xi and u yi are the velocity samples and u x and u y are the time averaged velocities in the x and y directions respectively good agreement is found in the near cross sections x 1 0d 1 5d 2 5d and 4 5d it can be seen that the fluctuations are underestimated in the cross sections further downstream x 8 5d 16 5d however these regions are not of concern for this study it can therefore be considered that the sst model captures the main characteristics of flow velocities accurately fig 9 shows the development of the drag and lift coefficients with dimensionless time the drag and lift coefficients are defined respectively as 23 c d f d 0 5 ρ w d u 0 2 24 c l f l 0 5 ρ w d u 0 2 where f d and f l are the forces acting on the pipe due to the flow in the streamwise and upward directions respectively the results predicted by this model show good agreement with previous works sumer et al 1991 sumer and fredsøe 2006 fuhrman et al 2014 which predicted that the maximum lift coefficient is 1 2 and the minimum value is 1 0 the dimensionless period of the drag and lift coefficients is approximately 5 suggesting that the strouhal number is around 0 2 which is supported by lei et al 1999 fig 10 shows a comparison between the predicted mean pressure coefficients along the seabed surface and the measurements by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 the dimensionless pressure coefficient is defined as 25 c p p p 0 0 5 ρ w u 0 2 where p 0 is the reference pressure the simulation adopts the same gap ratio 0 4 and similar reynolds number 45000 as those used in the experiment it can be seen that the predicted mean pressure coefficients coincide closely with the measured values 5 numerical results as the scouring around the pipe develops the bed profile changes continuously the varying bed profile and pipe position result in different flow fields as well as seepage fields this section presents the simulation results with different bed boundaries at different moments for two cases of fixed pipe and sagging pipe to discuss the variation of seepage effect on the shields number of sediment during the scouring process the simulation results discussed as follows 5 1 seabed response for a fixed pipe in this section the dynamic response of the seabed with a fixed pipe is simulated through four cases adopting the bed profiles at four typical moments after scour begins t 1 5 min 5 min 30 min 217 min where t 0 min means that the scour is about to start from mao s experiment 1986 with θ 0 098 therefore the four different bed profiles extracted from his experimental data are used as the bed boundaries in the numerical models table 1 shows the main soil parameters in the numerical model which are the same as those in mao s experiment 5 1 1 simulation results at t 1 5 min fig 11 a shows the flow velocity and seepage flow fields at t 1 5 min because the seepage flow is quite weak compared to the fluid flow the real magnitude of the seepage flow cannot be reflected in the figure which just indicates its direction the seepage flow in other cases is also shown in a similar way it is found that there is no obvious vortex shedding and the flow and seepage fields are relatively stable the seepage flow in the soil goes downward upstream of the pipe and upward downstream of the pipe a dune is formed in the downstream zone the direction of seepage flow means that the seepage force tends to stabilise the bed particles upstream of the pipe and raise the particles distributed around the dune this can be verified in the distribution of pressure shown in fig 11 b it is indicated that the flow compacts the bed particles in front of the pipe and tends to push the dune behind the pipe backwards it can be seen in fig 11 c that there are a large scale vortex and a small scale vortex behind the pipe and the large vortex is closer to the bed than the smaller one the two vortices are deflected upward which is consistent with the direction of the uphill dune according to soulsby and whitehouse 1997 the threshold shields number θ cro on a horizontal bed can be calculated by 26 θ cro 0 30 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 e 0 020 d where d is the dimensionless grain size defined as 27 d g s 1 ν 2 1 3 d 50 according to allen 1982 the threshold shields parameter θ cr for a sloping bed has been modified as 28 θ cr θ cro cos α sin α tan φ where α is the slope angle between the seabed surface and horizontal plane and φ is the angle of repose of sand it should be noted that the critical shields number in normal conditions is adopted in this paper i e the effect of seepage flow is not considered in fact the seepage flow will affect the critical shields number more or less but the critical shields number considering seepage flow is still not resolved and is actually beyond the topic of this study it can be seen in fig 11 d that there are some small fluctuations of e s upstream of the pipe around zero generally between 0 1 and 0 1 according to eq 17 the deduction of seepage flow to the submerged weight of sediment particles can be up to 20 downstream of the pipe fig 11 e demonstrates that the shields number becomes larger significantly through modification between x 0 and x 1 6d where the uphill dune is located however comparing the importance of seepage on the incipient motion at this stage with that in the first moment of erosion when tunnel scour dominates the seepage effect seems to be much less significant at this moment this indicated that the seepage effect is not very obvious during the early stage of scour 5 1 2 simulation results at t 5 min at t 5 min the characteristics of the flow velocity field and pressure distribution are similar to that at t 1 5 min and the seepage flow inside the downstream dune is still obvious which is shown in fig 12 a and b fig 12 c shows two large scale vortices behind the pipe this indicated that as the scour hole gets deeper the influence of gap flow under the pipe becomes less significant it can be seen in fig 12 d that the fluctuation of the seepage scaling factor e s becomes more acute along the bed meanwhile the influence of seepage on the shields number is notable in a wider range behind the pipe compared to that at t 1 5 min the largest e s is over 0 3 there are several peaks along the shields number curves both original and modified ones around the pipe fig 12 e implying that the flow around the pipe becomes more complicated it is known that the incipient motion of sediment below a pipe located on the seabed firstly occurs entirely due to the difference in pressure induced by the seepage flow once a scour hole appears the influence of seepage becomes much weaker and the gap flow between the pipe and the seabed becomes dominant in the incipient motion of sediment below the pipeline 5 1 3 simulation results at t 30 min figs 13 and 14 present flow field and seabed response respectively at t 30 min it can be seen that with an increase in scour depth vortices form behind the pipe and are shed alternatively downstream the magnitude of flow velocities varies in a typical period denoted as t the vortex shedding leads to a fluctuating flow field which can induce the fluctuation of seepage flow in the seabed as shown in fig 14 when a vortex is shed and moves close to the seabed the negative pressure inside the vortex will induce an upward seepage on the seabed fig 15 shows the distribution of seepage scaling factor e s and shields numbers along the bed surface near the pipe at t 30 min the value of e s varies continuously because of the fluctuating flow thus the maximum and minimum values are given it is shown that the general maximum for e s is greater than 0 2 and it can reach up to 0 5 behind the pipe this means that the seepage can reduce the effective weight of the particle by 50 downstream of the pipe which can promote scour significantly the maximum value of shields number becomes much larger after considering the seepage effect especially at x 1 3d this is because the varying flow field can induce a kind of fluctuating shear stress which has been stated by li and cheng 2001 5 1 4 simulation results at t 217 min as the scouring develops the bed profile becomes almost unchangeable which means that scour equilibrium has been obtained fig 16 it is found that the bed profile seems to be very smooth and the seepage flow at the bed surface generally goes downwards or parallel to the bed surface however it can be seen that when a vortex shed downward to the bed propagates forward the negative pressure at the centre of the vortex can induce upward seepage at the bed surface the upward pressure gradient induced by the vortex propagation can be found in fig 17 the maximum value of the seepage scaling factor e s exceeds 0 6 between x 2d and x 6d and can even be up to 1 which is shown in fig 18 a this means that the particles can only be lifted up under the action of the seepage force this indicates that as the scour process reaches the equilibrium state the upward seepage flow can become very strong it is shown in fig 18 b that the modified shields number can become much larger than the original one in order to show the data more clearly values exceeding 0 8 are not shown in the figure therefore it can be deduced that although the scour hole looks relatively unchangeable at t 217 min incipient motion of particles can still occur it should be noted that a large value of shields number does not mean a large erosion quantity because the flow field varies periodically figs 15 and 18 give the maximum values of shields number during the scouring when a vortex acts on the seabed the induced upward seepage can lead to a sudden increase of shields number which indicates that the sediment can be lifted more rapidly however when the vortex fades away the seepage flow becomes much weaker and the upper flow is still the dominant factor affecting the shields number 5 2 seabed response for a sagging pipe if the scour hole below a pipe is large enough that the suspended span of the pipe is too long or if the pipe is too flexible the pipe segment will gradually sag down and eventually touch the seabed in this section the dynamic response of the seabed with a sagging pipe is simulated through four cases adopting the bed profiles and the positions of the pipe at four typical moments during scouring t 0 min 35 min 90 min 158 min where t 0 min means that the sagging and scour are about to start from mao s experiment 1986 with θ 0 098 and the sagging velocity is 0 62 mm s downwards the four different bed profiles and pipe positions extracted from his experimental results are used as the bed and pipe boundaries in the numerical models the soil parameters in table 1 are also used in this simulation 5 2 1 simulation results at t 0 min fig 19 presents the characteristics of the flow field pressure field and seabed response at t 0 min fig 19 a shows the seepage path inside the soil and it can be seen that the seepage flow beneath the pipe is obvious which can be verified by the pressure distribution fig 19 b this indicates that the onset of scour tends to occur just behind the pipe the distribution of the streamlines illustrated in fig 19 c shows two large scale vortices downstream of the pipe fig 19 d shows that the seepage scaling factor e s can be up to 0 6 near the pipe which may be attributed to the gap flow under the pipe as a result the modified shields number is much larger than the original one fig 19 e indicating a faster occurring of incipient motion of particles 5 2 2 simulation results at t 35 min it can be seen in fig 20 that the vortex shedding occurs at t 35 min the fluctuating flow leads to a more complicated response of seabed as the vortex propagates forward along the seabed the negative pressure inside it induces upward seepage along the bed surface which weakens the effective weight of bed particles the strength and direction of seepage inside the soil can be verified by the pressure distribution shown in fig 21 the maximum of the seepage scaling factor is approximately 0 5 around the pipe fig 22 a according to eq 20 this is nearly double the original shields number the shields number curve shown in fig 22 b illustrates that the shields number around x 3 6d is also significantly affected by the seepage flow except for the zone around the pipe this may be because this position is near the top of the slope downstream of the pipe 5 2 3 simulation results at t 90 min it is illustrated in fig 23 a that the pipeline is about 45 8 of its diameter below the original seabed surface it can be seen that the flow becomes much weaker when the pipe sags into the scour hole and that vortex shedding is totally suppressed this is because the flow below the pipe is almost completely blocked by the pipe when approximately half of the pipe is under the original seabed surface cheng and li 2003 the pressure distribution that induces this weak seepage is shown in fig 23 b two standing vortices are observed in fig 23 c downstream of the pipe the seepage scaling factor e s is very small and its maximum value is less than 0 1 shown in fig 23 d the modified shields number is almost equal to the original value in most areas except a small zone around x 1d fig 23 e this indicates that when the pipe sags a certain depth the seepage effect on the shields number of sediment particles becomes less obvious 5 2 4 simulation results at t 158 min finally the pipe touches the seabed at this point the sagging process terminates and the fluid flow around the pipe is significantly suppressed fig 24 a the seepage flow path is along the edge of the pipe similar to a pipe placed on a flat seabed with a little embedment and the seepage strength can be obtained from the pressure gradient shown in fig 24 b fig 24 c shows that there is one vortex upstream and one vortex downstream of the pipe the seepage effect is generally small along the bed except at the rear end the pipe fig 24 d the modified and original shields number curves almost coincide with each other fig 24 e it can be deduced that when the pipe sags onto the seabed the seepage effect can almost be ignored this indicates that with the pipe sags vortex shedding will appear in the early stages of scouring and disappear when the pipe is very close to the seabed as a result the influence of seepage on the shields number downstream of the pipe firstly becomes stronger when the scour starts and then turns weaker as the pipe approaches the seabed finally when the pipe touches the seabed the flow field does not fluctuate and the seepage effect becomes minor 6 conclusions this paper aims to study the seepage effect on the shields number around a fixed and sagging pipeline numerical simulations have been conducted using the sst turbulent model and porous seabed model based on two types of scour experiments with a fixed pipe and a sagging pipe respectively the seepage flow field and excess pore pressure distribution along the seabed were investigated in detail the traditional shields number was modified by considering the effect of seepage flow some useful conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the initial scour hole called tunnel scour is caused entirely by the seepage force below the pipe once the scour hole forms the influence of seepage becomes minor and gap flow between the pipe and the seabed becomes the dominant factor for the incipient motion of sediment 2 as the scouring hole becomes deeper and wider vortices shed from the fixed pipe onto the seabed can induce an upward seepage flow in its corresponding region owing to the negative pressure inside them this can be double the original shields number value however as vortex shedding is periodical the influence of seepage flow on the scour varies alternatively and is not directly related to the erosion quantity 3 when considering the sagging of the pipe the seepage effect on the shields number of sediments is minor in the beginning of scour and becomes stronger when vortex shedding occurs which is similar to the results of a fixed pipe however in the later stage of sagging the flow fluid does not fluctuate and the seepage effect is minor 4 it should be mentioned that the innovation of this paper is to investigate the effects of seepage force on the shields number and the effects of seepage flow on the bed shear stress and critical shields number have not been considered due to the lack of related researches this is also beyond the topic of this study and needs more well designed experimental works in the future acknowledgements the authors would like to

23068,it is known that the seepage force has a significant impact on the mobility of bed particles to assess the effect of seepage force on the sediment transport around a suspended pipeline a series of numerical tests have been carried out utilising the commercial software comsol in the simulation the shear stress transport turbulence model was used to simulate the upper turbulence flow field and the porous medium model was adopted to describe the dynamic response of the underlying seabed both the fluid flow and the seepage flow within the seabed were modelled the effect of the vertical seepage force on the shields number was investigated the simulation results indicate that seepage plays a vital role in the process of tunnel scour but becomes quite weak with the form of a scour hole beneath the pipeline with an increase in scour depth vortices shed from the pipe lead to a fluctuating fluid pressure inducing significant upward seepage and thus influencing the stability of bed particles if sagging of the pipeline appears the fluctuation of fluid pressure becomes weak and the seepage effect is minor keywords turbulent flow porous seabed seepage flow shields number excess pore pressure 1 introduction pipelines are widely utilised to transport oil and gas in offshore engineering in the field free spans may develop along a pipeline lying on the seabed owing to local scour posing a risk to the safety of the pipeline it is pivotal to understand the inner mechanism of local scour around pipelines laid on the seabed chiew 1990 conducted a series of typical experiments and noted that the piping created the primary inducement of the onset of local scour which was generally called tunnel scour once tunnel scour began a scour hole appeared and became deeper and deeper until reaching an equilibrium depth many efforts were made to predict the maximum scour depth under the current condition chao and hennessy 1972 kjeldsen et al 1973 mao 1986 sumer and fredsøe 1990 chiew 1991 to judge when the maximum scour depth is reached it is necessary to determine the threshold condition for sediment incipient motion it is mostly recommended to use the shields diagram shields 1936 the shields diagram was further modified to apply to not only unidirectional flows and horizontal beds but also oscillatory flows madsen and grant 1976 and non horizontal slopes whitehouse and hardisty 1988 in essence the sediment particle on the bed surface is subjected to driving and resisting forces the driving force induced by the flow near the bed tends to drive the particle to move the resisting force is a type of coulomb friction force that is proportional to the net submerged weight of the particle the net submerged weight can be considered as the submerged weight subtracting the other upward external forces such as seepage force cheng and chiew 1998a 1999 conducted analytical and experimental research to study the effect of seepage on the bed shear stress and critical condition of sediment incipient motion in open channel flow liu and chiew 2012 further studied the effect of suction and injection on the critical shear stress and found that upward seepage injection could decrease the critical shear velocity while downward seepage suction would increase it previous research li and cheng 1999 cheng and li 2003 liang and cheng 2005a b involving numerical simulation of local scour around pipelines has ignored the seepage effect for simplicity therefore this paper aims to investigate the effect of the seepage force on the mobility of particles at different stages of local scour around a pipeline based on bed profiles data from mao s 1986 experiments a series of numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the responses of flow and seepage fields then by including the vertical seepage force a modified shields number was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the effect of seepage flow on shields number around a fixed and sagging pipeline 2 basic theories and numerical modelling 2 1 fluid flow model the governing equations for the turbulent flow are the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which are expressed in cartesian coordinate system as 1 ρ w t x i ρ w u i 0 2 ρ w d u i d t p w x i x i μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x i x j ρ w u i u j where ρ w is the water density t is time x i is the cartesian

turbulent energy the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model is adopted for the calculation of μ t and k it introduces a blending function which can transform the k ω formulation to the k ε model in different regions leading to great improvements in the prediction of adverse pressure gradient flows the specific formulae of the k ω turbulence model can be found in menter 1994 and is not detailed here 2 2 seabed model with seepage flow sumer and fredsøe 2006 noted that alternate vortex formation and shedding would happen when water flows around a cylinder for a typical range of reynolds number the alternate vortex formation and shedding can induce fluctuating water pressure inside the seabed just like the waves a porous medium model for wave seabed interaction is used in this study to describe the dynamic response of the seabed the sandy seabed is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and the governing equations for oscillatory soil response in plane strain

pipe seabed numerical model a two dimensional numerical model as shown in fig 1 was established in comsol to simulate the local flow around a pipeline comsol is commercial software that can model and solve many kinds of scientific and engineering problems comsol multiphysics reference manual 2016 using comsol it is easy to define the relevant physical quantities such as material properties loads constraints etc in this study the flow field and the seabed model are simulated by the fluid dynamics module and user defined partial differential equations respectively the upper domain is the flow field around the pipeline and the lower domain is the porous seabed the bed profiles represented by boundary ab in fig 1 and pipe positions at different moments from mao 1986 work were used as the bed and pipe boundaries in the numerical models so the sediment motion was considered based on the coupling of numerical simulation with experimental results this is a kind of physical numerical coupling analysis which aims to reveal the inner mechanisms of local scouring that cannot be investigated merely through experiments the first type of experiment considered the scouring around a fixed pipe laid on the seabed in a current with the conditions of w 0 d 0 and θ 0 098 w 0 d is the initial gap ratio and θ is the shields number in the far field the other type of experiment considered the sagging of the pipe by keeping the pipe moving down towards the bed at a constant speed of 0 62 mm s with the initial conditions of w 0 d 0 1 and θ 0 098 the simulations aimed to study the response of seepage flow inside the seabed and its effects on the incipient motion of sediment during different scouring stages key parameters such as the diameter of the pipe and sand features are the same as those used by mao 1986 the length and height of the computational domain were equal to 30d and 8d respectively the distance between the pipeline and the inlet boundary was 10d fig 2 shows typical finite element meshes near the pipe structured triangular elements are mainly used to simulate the flow and seabed domains while the regions close to the pipe surface and the seabed surface are simulated by boundary layer meshes all of which are quadrangular elements the distance of the boundary element next to the pipe or seabed surfaces δy is 0 0002d with a growth factor of 1 15 in the normal direction the non dimensional mesh size y δy u υ where u is the friction velocity thus the value of δy is smaller than 1 for all the simulation cases the computational time step δt 2 10 4 s the courant number c uδt δx where δx is the grid resolution in this study the values of c in the normal and tangential directions of boundary layers are about 0 5754 and 0 0063 respectively which is much less than 1 2 3 1 boundary conditions boundary ad is the inlet of the flow where a fully developed hydraulically smooth turbulent velocity profile is applied as 7 u x y u y u υ y u υ 11 63 u x y u 1 κ ln 9 0 y u υ y u υ 11 63 8 u y y 0 where u is the friction velocity and κ is the von kármán constant 0 42 the profiles of turbulence quantities are specified as 9 k y max c μ 1 2 1 z δ 2 u 2 0 0005 u

turbulence quantities are implemented a reference pressure of p y 0 is given at the outlet boundary a no slip condition is imposed on boundary ab and the pipe surface which means that the velocities

in the seabed firstly the fluid model is solved to obtain the velocities of flow field bed shear stress and pressure acting on the seabed then the seabed model is solved with the calculated pressure on the seabed to obtain the seepage field both in the simulations of upper flow field and seepage field the pipe position and seabed profile are updated according to mao s 1986 experimental data finally the shields number is modified by considering the effect of seepage force the coupling method of flow field and seepage field is illustrated in fig 3 it can be seen that the simulation only considers how the upper flow affects the seepage field and ignores the effects of seepage on the upper flow field it must be noted that many researchers have studied the seepage effects on turbulent flow and sediment entrainment on a porous bed lu et al 2008 reviewed and summarised these studies it has been verified that the presence of seepage can cause a deviation to the logarithmic law of the wall willetts and drossos 1975 schlichting 1979 maclean 1991 cheng and chiew 1998a b chen and chiew 2004 cao and chiew 2015 but there is still conflict on how the seepage force affects the bed shear stress therefore this paper only revises the resistance term through seepage force and does not consider the seepage effect on the shear stress 3 physics behind the incipient motion of a bed particle the seepage can cause a modification to the forces applied to sediment particles as has been stated in cheng and chiew 1999 a cohesionless sediment particle resting on a porous bed experiences its submerged weight force w drag force f d lift force f l and seepage force f s as is shown in fig 4 assuming all bed particles are spheres with a uniform diameter of d 50 these forces can be expressed as 13 w ρ d ρ w g π d 50 3 6 14 f d c d π d 50 2 4 ρ w u b 2 2 15 f l c l π d 50 2 4 ρ w u b 2 2 where ρ d and ρ w are the densities of sediment particles and water respectively g is the gravitational acceleration c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients respectively u b is the approach flow velocity of the particle at the bed surface and d 50 stands for the mean diameter of sediment particles it has been demonstrated in cheng and chiew 1999 that the seepage force f s is induced by vertical variation of nonhydrostatic pressure p at the seabed surface and is expressed as 16 f s p y π d 50 3 6 1 n s a seepage scaling factor e s is defined as the ratio of the seepage force to the submerged particle weight and is given by 17 e s f s w p y 1 n s ρ d ρ w g p y ρ s g and the modified submerged weight w can be expressed as 18 w w f s 1 e s w 1 e s ρ d ρ w g π d 50 3 6 in most previous works the dimensionless shields number θ has been defined as 19 θ τ b ρ d ρ w g d 50 where τ b is the bed shear stress here the effect of seepage force is ignored f s 0 however the seepage flow may make considerable modifications to the submerged weight of sediment particles the modified shields number θ considers the seepage effect and becomes as follows 20 θ τ b 1 e s ρ d ρ w g d 50 1 1 e s θ the factor e s 0 means that the seepage flow is downward to stabilise the sediment particles at the bed surface an upward seepage flow makes 0 e s 1 which tends to lift the bed particles the scaling factor cannot be larger than 1 because in that case the particle would have been suspended in the fluid and washed away it should be noted that in real conditions the bed shear stress τ b will be also affected by the seepage flow thus the revised shields number expressed in eq 20 will overestimate the seepage effect this kind of seepage effect is not considered in this paper and should be investigated through well designed experiments in the future 4 validation of the numerical model validations were conducted to assess the reliability of the sst model adopting a gap ratio of 0 37 and reynolds number of 7000 which were the same as those used in jensen 1987 experiments the calculated flow velocities were compared with the experimental results the simulated time averaged horizontal and vertical velocity components at different cross sections downstream of the pipe are given in figs 5 and 6 together with jensen s experimental results 1987 it is shown that the time averaged horizontal u x and vertical u y velocities calculated by the sst model are roughly consistent with the experimental data there are only a few differences at the cross sections near the pipe x 2 5d figs 7 and 8 show a comparison between the calculated velocity fluctuation components and the experimental results from jensen s 1987 work the velocity fluctuations are defined as the root mean square rms of the deviation of velocity samples to the long time averaged value 21 δ u x i 1 n u x i u x 2 n 22 δ u y i 1 n u y i u y 2 n where n is the total number of velocity samples u xi and u yi are the velocity samples and u x and u y are the time averaged velocities in the x and y directions respectively good agreement is found in the near cross sections x 1 0d 1 5d 2 5d and 4 5d it can be seen that the fluctuations are underestimated in the cross sections further downstream x 8 5d 16 5d however these regions are not of concern for this study it can therefore be considered that the sst model captures the main characteristics of flow velocities accurately fig 9 shows the development of the drag and lift coefficients with dimensionless time the drag and lift coefficients are defined respectively as 23 c d f d 0 5 ρ w d u 0 2 24 c l f l 0 5 ρ w d u 0 2 where f d and f l are the forces acting on the pipe due to the flow in the streamwise and upward directions respectively the results predicted by this model show good agreement with previous works sumer et al 1991 sumer and fredsøe 2006 fuhrman et al 2014 which predicted that the maximum lift coefficient is 1 2 and the minimum value is 1 0 the dimensionless period of the drag and lift coefficients is approximately 5 suggesting that the strouhal number is around 0 2 which is supported by lei et al 1999 fig 10 shows a comparison between the predicted mean pressure coefficients along the seabed surface and the measurements by bearman and zdravkovich 1978 the dimensionless pressure coefficient is defined as 25 c p p p 0 0 5 ρ w u 0 2 where p 0 is the reference pressure the simulation adopts the same gap ratio 0 4 and similar reynolds number 45000 as those used in the experiment it can be seen that the predicted mean pressure coefficients coincide closely with the measured values 5 numerical results as the scouring around the pipe develops the bed profile changes continuously the varying bed profile and pipe position result in different flow fields as well as seepage fields this section presents the simulation results with different bed boundaries at different moments for two cases of fixed pipe and sagging pipe to discuss the variation of seepage effect on the shields number of sediment during the scouring process the simulation results discussed as follows 5 1 seabed response for a fixed pipe in this section the dynamic response of the seabed with a fixed pipe is simulated through four cases adopting the bed profiles at four typical moments after scour begins t 1 5 min 5 min 30 min 217 min where t 0 min means that the scour is about to start from mao s experiment 1986 with θ 0 098 therefore the four different bed profiles extracted from his experimental data are used as the bed boundaries in the numerical models table 1 shows the main soil parameters in the numerical model which are the same as those in mao s experiment 5 1 1 simulation results at t 1 5 min fig 11 a shows the flow velocity and seepage flow fields at t 1 5 min because the seepage flow is quite weak compared to the fluid flow the real magnitude of the seepage flow cannot be reflected in the figure which just indicates its direction the seepage flow in other cases is also shown in a similar way it is found that there is no obvious vortex shedding and the flow and seepage fields are relatively stable the seepage flow in the soil goes downward upstream of the pipe and upward downstream of the pipe a dune is formed in the downstream zone the direction of seepage flow means that the seepage force tends to stabilise the bed particles upstream of the pipe and raise the particles distributed around the dune this can be verified in the distribution of pressure shown in fig 11 b it is indicated that the flow compacts the bed particles in front of the pipe and tends to push the dune behind the pipe backwards it can be seen in fig 11 c that there are a large scale vortex and a small scale vortex behind the pipe and the large vortex is closer to the bed than the smaller one the two vortices are deflected upward which is consistent with the direction of the uphill dune according to soulsby and whitehouse 1997 the threshold shields number θ cro on a horizontal bed can be calculated by 26 θ cro 0 30 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 e 0 020 d where d is the dimensionless grain size defined as 27 d g s 1 ν 2 1 3 d 50 according to allen 1982 the threshold shields parameter θ cr for a sloping bed has been modified as 28 θ cr θ cro cos α sin α tan φ where α is the slope angle between the seabed surface and horizontal plane and φ is the angle of repose of sand it should be noted that the critical shields number in normal conditions is adopted in this paper i e the effect of seepage flow is not considered in fact the seepage flow will affect the critical shields number more or less but the critical shields number considering seepage flow is still not resolved and is actually beyond the topic of this study it can be seen in fig 11 d that there are some small fluctuations of e s upstream of the pipe around zero generally between 0 1 and 0 1 according to eq 17 the deduction of seepage flow to the submerged weight of sediment particles can be up to 20 downstream of the pipe fig 11 e demonstrates that the shields number becomes larger significantly through modification between x 0 and x 1 6d where the uphill dune is located however comparing the importance of seepage on the incipient motion at this stage with that in the first moment of erosion when tunnel scour dominates the seepage effect seems to be much less significant at this moment this indicated that the seepage effect is not very obvious during the early stage of scour 5 1 2 simulation results at t 5 min at t 5 min the characteristics of the flow velocity field and pressure distribution are similar to that at t 1 5 min and the seepage flow inside the downstream dune is still obvious which is shown in fig 12 a and b fig 12 c shows two large scale vortices behind the pipe this indicated that as the scour hole gets deeper the influence of gap flow under the pipe becomes less significant it can be seen in fig 12 d that the fluctuation of the seepage scaling factor e s becomes more acute along the bed meanwhile the influence of seepage on the shields number is notable in a wider range behind the pipe compared to that at t 1 5 min the largest e s is over 0 3 there are several peaks along the shields number curves both original and modified ones around the pipe fig 12 e implying that the flow around the pipe becomes more complicated it is known that the incipient motion of sediment below a pipe located on the seabed firstly occurs entirely due to the difference in pressure induced by the seepage flow once a scour hole appears the influence of seepage becomes much weaker and the gap flow between the pipe and the seabed becomes dominant in the incipient motion of sediment below the pipeline 5 1 3 simulation results at t 30 min figs 13 and 14 present flow field and seabed response respectively at t 30 min it can be seen that with an increase in scour depth vortices form behind the pipe and are shed alternatively downstream the magnitude of flow velocities varies in a typical period denoted as t the vortex shedding leads to a fluctuating flow field which can induce the fluctuation of seepage flow in the seabed as shown in fig 14 when a vortex is shed and moves close to the seabed the negative pressure inside the vortex will induce an upward seepage on the seabed fig 15 shows the distribution of seepage scaling factor e s and shields numbers along the bed surface near the pipe at t 30 min the value of e s varies continuously because of the fluctuating flow thus the maximum and minimum values are given it is shown that the general maximum for e s is greater than 0 2 and it can reach up to 0 5 behind the pipe this means that the seepage can reduce the effective weight of the particle by 50 downstream of the pipe which can promote scour significantly the maximum value of shields number becomes much larger after considering the seepage effect especially at x 1 3d this is because the varying flow field can induce a kind of fluctuating shear stress which has been stated by li and cheng 2001 5 1 4 simulation results at t 217 min as the scouring develops the bed profile becomes almost unchangeable which means that scour equilibrium has been obtained fig 16 it is found that the bed profile seems to be very smooth and the seepage flow at the bed surface generally goes downwards or parallel to the bed surface however it can be seen that when a vortex shed downward to the bed propagates forward the negative pressure at the centre of the vortex can induce upward seepage at the bed surface the upward pressure gradient induced by the vortex propagation can be found in fig 17 the maximum value of the seepage scaling factor e s exceeds 0 6 between x 2d and x 6d and can even be up to 1 which is shown in fig 18 a this means that the particles can only be lifted up under the action of the seepage force this indicates that as the scour process reaches the equilibrium state the upward seepage flow can become very strong it is shown in fig 18 b that the modified shields number can become much larger than the original one in order to show the data more clearly values exceeding 0 8 are not shown in the figure therefore it can be deduced that although the scour hole looks relatively unchangeable at t 217 min incipient motion of particles can still occur it should be noted that a large value of shields number does not mean a large erosion quantity because the flow field varies periodically figs 15 and 18 give the maximum values of shields number during the scouring when a vortex acts on the seabed the induced upward seepage can lead to a sudden increase of shields number which indicates that the sediment can be lifted more rapidly however when the vortex fades away the seepage flow becomes much weaker and the upper flow is still the dominant factor affecting the shields number 5 2 seabed response for a sagging pipe if the scour hole below a pipe is large enough that the suspended span of the pipe is too long or if the pipe is too flexible the pipe segment will gradually sag down and eventually touch the seabed in this section the dynamic response of the seabed with a sagging pipe is simulated through four cases adopting the bed profiles and the positions of the pipe at four typical moments during scouring t 0 min 35 min 90 min 158 min where t 0 min means that the sagging and scour are about to start from mao s experiment 1986 with θ 0 098 and the sagging velocity is 0 62 mm s downwards the four different bed profiles and pipe positions extracted from his experimental results are used as the bed and pipe boundaries in the numerical models the soil parameters in table 1 are also used in this simulation 5 2 1 simulation results at t 0 min fig 19 presents the characteristics of the flow field pressure field and seabed response at t 0 min fig 19 a shows the seepage path inside the soil and it can be seen that the seepage flow beneath the pipe is obvious which can be verified by the pressure distribution fig 19 b this indicates that the onset of scour tends to occur just behind the pipe the distribution of the streamlines illustrated in fig 19 c shows two large scale vortices downstream of the pipe fig 19 d shows that the seepage scaling factor e s can be up to 0 6 near the pipe which may be attributed to the gap flow under the pipe as a result the modified shields number is much larger than the original one fig 19 e indicating a faster occurring of incipient motion of particles 5 2 2 simulation results at t 35 min it can be seen in fig 20 that the vortex shedding occurs at t 35 min the fluctuating flow leads to a more complicated response of seabed as the vortex propagates forward along the seabed the negative pressure inside it induces upward seepage along the bed surface which weakens the effective weight of bed particles the strength and direction of seepage inside the soil can be verified by the pressure distribution shown in fig 21 the maximum of the seepage scaling factor is approximately 0 5 around the pipe fig 22 a according to eq 20 this is nearly double the original shields number the shields number curve shown in fig 22 b illustrates that the shields number around x 3 6d is also significantly affected by the seepage flow except for the zone around the pipe this may be because this position is near the top of the slope downstream of the pipe 5 2 3 simulation results at t 90 min it is illustrated in fig 23 a that the pipeline is about 45 8 of its diameter below the original seabed surface it can be seen that the flow becomes much weaker when the pipe sags into the scour hole and that vortex shedding is totally suppressed this is because the flow below the pipe is almost completely blocked by the pipe when approximately half of the pipe is under the original seabed surface cheng and li 2003 the pressure distribution that induces this weak seepage is shown in fig 23 b two standing vortices are observed in fig 23 c downstream of the pipe the seepage scaling factor e s is very small and its maximum value is less than 0 1 shown in fig 23 d the modified shields number is almost equal to the original value in most areas except a small zone around x 1d fig 23 e this indicates that when the pipe sags a certain depth the seepage effect on the shields number of sediment particles becomes less obvious 5 2 4 simulation results at t 158 min finally the pipe touches the seabed at this point the sagging process terminates and the fluid flow around the pipe is significantly suppressed fig 24 a the seepage flow path is along the edge of the pipe similar to a pipe placed on a flat seabed with a little embedment and the seepage strength can be obtained from the pressure gradient shown in fig 24 b fig 24 c shows that there is one vortex upstream and one vortex downstream of the pipe the seepage effect is generally small along the bed except at the rear end the pipe fig 24 d the modified and original shields number curves almost coincide with each other fig 24 e it can be deduced that when the pipe sags onto the seabed the seepage effect can almost be ignored this indicates that with the pipe sags vortex shedding will appear in the early stages of scouring and disappear when the pipe is very close to the seabed as a result the influence of seepage on the shields number downstream of the pipe firstly becomes stronger when the scour starts and then turns weaker as the pipe approaches the seabed finally when the pipe touches the seabed the flow field does not fluctuate and the seepage effect becomes minor 6 conclusions this paper aims to study the seepage effect on the shields number around a fixed and sagging pipeline numerical simulations have been conducted using the sst turbulent model and porous seabed model based on two types of scour experiments with a fixed pipe and a sagging pipe respectively the seepage flow field and excess pore pressure distribution along the seabed were investigated in detail the traditional shields number was modified by considering the effect of seepage flow some useful conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the initial scour hole called tunnel scour is caused entirely by the seepage force below the pipe once the scour hole forms the influence of seepage becomes minor and gap flow between the pipe and the seabed becomes the dominant factor for the incipient motion of sediment 2 as the scouring hole becomes deeper and wider vortices shed from the fixed pipe onto the seabed can induce an upward seepage flow in its corresponding region owing to the negative pressure inside them this can be double the original shields number value however as vortex shedding is periodical the influence of seepage flow on the scour varies alternatively and is not directly related to the erosion quantity 3 when considering the sagging of the pipe the seepage effect on the shields number of sediments is minor in the beginning of scour and becomes stronger when vortex shedding occurs which is similar to the results of a fixed pipe however in the later stage of sagging the flow fluid does not fluctuate and the seepage effect is minor 4 it should be mentioned that the innovation of this paper is to investigate the effects of seepage force on the shields number and the effects of seepage flow on the bed shear stress and critical shields number have not been considered due to the lack of related researches this is also beyond the topic of this study and needs more well designed experimental works in the future acknowledgements the authors would like to

23069,this paper presents an active control method for reducing the lateral vibration transmission in a shaft hull coupled system of submerged vehicles under the excitation of propeller forces in this method a 6 dof degree of freedom active stern support and the local velocity feedback control strategy are employed to suppress vibration transmission from the shaft to the hull the dynamic model of the shaft hull system embedded with the active stern support is established with the frf frequency response function based synthesis method and the fem bem finite element method boundary element method the six channel local velocity feedback control strategy is employed to suppress vibrations of the strut hull interface numerical results indicate that a noticeable attenuation of vibration and sound radiation can be achieved by the active stern support in addition the combination control at the stern support and the thrust bearing is able to obtain better attenuation at some critical frequencies suppression of the mean square velocity and radiated sound power of the hull surface are observed keywords shaft hull coupled system lateral vibration stern support active control velocity feedback 1 introduction in marine propulsion systems rotation of the propeller in a non uniform wake results in fluctuating forces these forces will transmit through the shaft to the hull and finally lead to significant low frequency underwater sound radiation caresta and kessissoglou 2010 merz et al 2009 reducing the transmission of fluctuating forces from the shaft to the hull structure is a feasible measure to control low frequency vibration and sound radiation hu et al 2012 even though the sound radiation from a submerged vehicle due to propeller forces dominantly depend on the longitudinal fluctuating forces the influence of lateral fluctuating forces cannot be ignored cao and zhang 2007 in addition the bearings which connect the shafting system and the hull serve as transmission paths of vibration and forces hu et al 2012 passive vibration isolation at these bearings is difficult because the lowest isolation frequency cannot be arbitrarily low which is determined by the requirement of shafting alignment and running safety therefore investigation on new methods is necessary to reduce the transmission of vibration and forces from the shaft to the hull structure the potential of passive isolation methods in reducing low frequency vibration transmission is limited due to the inherent resonance of isolation in comparison active methods can achieve more suppression at low frequencies by incorporating actuators sensors and controllers there are already investigations on active control of the longitudinal vibration of shafting systems dylejko et al 2007 merz et al 2010 pan et al 2008 caresta 2011 used inertial actuators which were attached to the cone structure and arranged in a circumferential array to reduce sound radiation of a submarine hull under the excitation of the propeller qin et al 2017 theoretically investigated the application of magnetic bearings in the control of lateral vibration transmission from the propeller to the hull which attempts to reduce force transmissibility at different shaft speeds by changing the equivalent stiffness of bearings however current work on active control of lateral vibration transmission in marine shaft hull systems is not yet sufficient for rotor bearing systems active units in lateral vibration control are usually built upon bearings and vibration control is realized by modifying bearing properties according to disturbances and operation conditions a variety of bearings such as magnetic bearings lusty et al 2016 fluid film bearings chasalevris and dohnal 2015 and actuators such as electromagnetic actuators koroishi et al 2014 piezoelectric actuators zhao et al 2015 pneumatic actuators pierart and santos 2016 and hydraulic actuators salazar and santos 2017a are combined to form active bearings salazar and santos 2017b used an active tilting pad journal bearing to control the lateral vibration of a flexible rotor bearing system where the active forces were provided by a hydraulic actuator yao et al 2017 presented a method to control periodic vibrations in rotor bearing systems by using magnetic actuators roy et al 2016 investigated the suspension of a rotor shaft system with active magnetic bearings and the pd proportion integral control law pierart and santos 2016 proposed an active gas bearing and combined control methods to increase the damping ratio of a high speed rotor system the results showed that the vibration level was reduced and the flexible rotor was able to run safely across the critical speeds zhao et al 2015 investigated a piezo based inertial actuator which was mounted on a rotational shaft and employed the fx lms filtered x least mean square algorithm to reduce vibration and noise radiation of a rotor system the propulsion shaft is supported by multiple bearings in which the stern bearing is the dominant channel to transmit lateral vibrations and forces from the propeller to the hull structure therefore the stern bearing is a preferred position to control transmission via active methods for vibration suppression active control strategies have been explored the fundamental methods such as the direct force feedback and velocity feedback are effective in vibration transmission control the direct force feedback is able to lower the equivalent stiffness at the interface of the two contact parts and consequently reduce the transmission of high frequency vibration while the directly velocity feedback is able to increase the equivalent damping of a system and resultantly suppress its resonance benassi and elliott 2004 benassi et al 2004 munoa et al 2013 preumont et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 this investigation is focused on the mechanism of active control of the lateral vibration of a shafting system since the stern bearing is usually a water lubricated rubber bearing the marine environment and the limited installation space should be considered in the construction of active control by taking these aspects into consideration a new concept of rear bearing support is proposed for active control of vibration transmission in the new scenario six active struts are utilized in the stern bearing and the direct local velocity feedback is adopted to reduce vibration transmission through the six struts the following discussion is organized in six sections first a shaft hull system embedded with a 6 dof active stern support is presented in section 2 next a numerical model of the shaft hull system with the active stern support is established in section 3 by combining the frf based synthesis method and the fem bem the local velocity feedback control strategy on the basis of the established dynamic model is given in section 4 then the performance of vibration and acoustic radiation control is presented in section 5 and finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 the shaft hull coupled system the shaft hull coupled system embedded with a 6 dof active stern support is shown in fig 1 in this system the propeller and the flexible coupling are simplified and represented by disks the hull is modeled with stiffened conical and cylindrical shells while the shaft is simplified to a beam the stern bearing which supports the shaft is represented by five equispaced springs due to its large length to diameter ratio the 6 dof active stern support connects the stern bearing housing and the hull through spherical joints and each strut is modeled by a beam the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing are both represented by springs which connect the shaft and the hull 3 computation of the coupled vibration and acoustics a considerable number of methods have been proposed to investigate dynamics of underwater structures such as analytical methods caresta and kessissoglou 2010 chen et al 2015 qu et al 2013 numerical methods merz et al 2007 as well as experimental methods leader et al 2013 analytical methods are of high computational efficiency and can be readily employed to analyze physical parameters in a shaft hull coupled system but they are applicable for simple structures only meanwhile experimental methods are more superior in dealing with complicated real systems but they are usually inconvenient and costly in comparison the fem bem method is powerful and effective in evaluating vibration and sound radiation of complicated systems wang et al 2017 in this paper for the convenience of analyzing parameters of the active struts the structural vibration characteristics are evaluated by fem and the frf based synthesis method while the acoustic radiation characteristics are evaluated by bem 3 1 modeling of the shaft hull system the shaft hull system is treated as an elastic system and its dynamic model is built by the frf based synthesis method the system is divided into four parts i e the shaft denoted by the superscript shaft the stern bearing denoted by the superscript housing the six active struts denoted by the superscript struts and the hull denoted by the superscript hull as shown in figs 1 and 2 the shaft and the stern bearing are connected by five equispaced springs the stern bearing and the hull are connected by six active struts the shaft and the hull are connected by the equivalent springs of the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing 3 1 1 frfs of the shaft the stern bearing and the hull the fem is adopted at first to build the frf models of the shaft the stern bearing pedestal as well as the hull because these structures are of fixed parameters or complicated fabrication the shaft is modeled by a circular beam while the propeller and the flexible coupling are modeled as points with inertial mass and rotational inertia the stern bearing pedestal is modeled by a cylindrical shell and the model of the hull is

rotation matrix t is therefore necessary to map the force and displacement vectors in the local coordinate system o x y z to those in the global coordinate system oxyz and it can be obtained by using the rodrigues rotation formula koks 2006 as a result the frfs of the six active struts can be given as follows 8 x i s t r u t s 18 1 x o s t r u t s 18 1 t 1 h i i s t r u t s t t 1 h i o s t r u t s

to evaluate the sound radiation characteristics 3 2 computation of sound radiation with the nodal velocity responses of the hull surface obtained the boundary element method is adopted to calculate the acoustic radiation characteristics in an ideal acoustic medium the relationship between the sound pressure and the velocity can be given according to the bem wu 2000 12 b p c v n where b and c are the boundary element coefficient matrices p is the vector of sound pressure at field points v n is the vector of normal velocities at the fluid structure interface the mean square velocity of the hull structures can be obtained as follows fahy and gardonio 2007 13 v 2 1 s s v n 2 d s where ds is the element area associated with the normal velocity s is the surface area of the hull structure the radiated sound power of the hull structure can be evaluated on a closed surface that contains the structure fahy and gardonio 2007 14 p 1 2 s re p v n d s 4 active control strategy in this section the performance of lateral vibration transmission control for the shaft hull coupled system is investigated since local velocity feedback is able to increase the equivalent damping ratios of natural modes this simple method is adopted here to evaluate the performance of the proposed active configuration variations of vibration in the hull induced by the excitation force at the propeller are analyzed and the mean square velocities are used to compare the results before and after active control 4 1 single channel local velocity feedback the equivalent damping of the coupled system can be changed by local velocity feedback and accordingly the magnitudes at resonance frequencies can be reduced the principle of local velocity feedback for a single strut is shown in fig 3 and the corresponding definition of symbols is listed in table 1 according to fig 3 the following equations can be derived 15 v a h a a 1 k h a a f a h p a 1 k h a a f p 16 v s h p s f p h a s e h p s f p h a s f a k v a h

eq 17 the transmissibility function between the velocity responses of the hull and the disturbance force at the propeller can be obtained 4 2 six channel local velocity feedback when the single channel control strategy is expanded to six channels the coupling of six channels should be considered fig 4 shows the relationship between the first channel and the ith channel different from the derivation in the single channel control strategy the control errors of the closed loop system e i and the velocity responses of the application points of the active control forces v ai can be expressed as follows 18 e i f a i k i v a i 19 v a i h p a i f p k 1 6 h a k a i e k where the symbols are the same as those in table 1 and the indices i k 1 2 3 4 5 6 correspond to the six struts respectively h ak ai stands for the frequency response of the strut i to the active control force of the strut k thus the coupling effects of six channels are reflected in eq 19 further the following

before and after control are evaluated to reveal the effectiveness of the active control the excitation and control forces are applied at the same time and v a are reduced by the control forces finally the velocity responses of the points on the hull v s are obtained 22 v s h p s f p i 1 6 h a i s k i v a i 5 analysis of the active control performance in order to calculate the active control performance the shaft hull coupled system with the proposed active stern support and the local velocity feedback control strategy is evaluated parameters of the shaft hull system fig 1 are listed in table 2 the finite element method is used to derive the frfs of the shaft the stern bearing pedestal and the hull respectively the finite element models of these substructures which are generated by the software abaqus consist of 144 1860 and 67833 elements respectively with the structural vibration responses of the hull surface obtained the boundary element method is adopted to calculate the acoustic radiation the acoustic surface is shown in fig 5 which consists of 5818 four node discontinuous linear boundary elements 5 1 force transmission before evaluating the performance of active control force transmission at each support is analyzed according to the dynamic model built in section 3 1 and applying the unit lateral excitation force 1n at the propeller the forces at the interfaces between the hull and the stern bearing the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing are computed in the analysis the frequency range is 0 200 hz and the step size is 0 5 hz as can be seen in fig 6 force transmission from the propeller to the hull is mainly attributed to the stern bearing although the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing cannot be neglected at certain frequencies therefore the stern bearing is the main channel for the lateral fluctuating forces to induce vibrations in the hull by suppressing the transmission of fluctuating forces via the stern support it is possible to reduce low frequency vibrations in the hull theoretically active control is more effective in reducing low frequency vibration than passive control methods the mode shapes corresponding to the resonance peaks are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the modes at ω1 ω3 ω4 ω5 ω7 and ω8 are coupled bending modes of the shaft hull system while the modes at ω2 and ω6 are dominated by the bending modes of the shaft 5 2 variation in vibration characteristics in order to avoid large variation in the characteristics of the shaft hull system caused by the change of the stern support the influence of the 6 dof stern support on the whole system should be evaluated hence the system embedded with the 6 dof stern support is compared with that having a traditional stern support referred to as reference model the velocity responses of the hull to the unit force applied on the propeller are computed for the two systems respectively and the results are shown in fig 7 as can be seen there is only a slight change in the characteristics when the traditional stern support is replaced by the passive 6 dof stern support therefore the 6 dof stern support is as rigid as the traditional support in the following section the performance of active control is analyzed on the basis of this 6 dof stern support 5 3 active control performance the performance of lateral vibration transmission control is evaluated according to the strategy in section 4 2 the frfs of h ai ai h pi ai h ai si and h pi ai i 1 2 3 4 5 6 are calculated in terms of the model established in section 3 1 notice that the model is symmetric about the xoy plane and the field point on the hull is also in the xoy plane the local velocity responses of the struts h a a in the left half plane l1 l2 l3 are respectively the same as those in the right half plane r1 r2 r3 so are the responses of the field point to the struts h a s and the responses of the struts to the propeller h p a the local velocity responses of the struts l1 l2 l3 are plotted in fig 8 when the struts l1 l2 and l3 are controlled individually variations of the local frequency responses with the increase of feedback gain are shown in fig 9 as can be seen the resonance peaks are reduced obviously and the equivalent damping increases as the feedback gain goes up it is worth noting that the measurement and control is realized at the same point for the direct local velocity feedback and this method is unconditionally stable in theory in practice however due to the limited response speed of actuators local velocity feedback still needs careful design and the feedback gain cannot be arbitrarily large according to the control strategy in fig 4 and the calculation process in eq 17 eq 21 the performance of six channel control is evaluated and the results are shown in fig 10 as can be seen vibration of the field point on the hull is suppressed over 0 200 hz attenuations of the closed loop are 7 5db 44 5hz and 5db 68 5hz in fact the local velocity feedback along the direction of each strut can guarantee that vibrations in the x y and z directions are all suppressed this will be demonstrated by the radiated sound power of the hull moreover attenuations at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are not so much as those at other frequencies this is attributed to the fact that the modes at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are respectively bending modes of the shaft hull coupled system as illustrated in table 3 as well as the weak controllability implied by the curves in fig 11 according to the responses of the field point to the control force of the struts l1 l2 l3 and the excitation force of the propeller as shown in fig 11 influences of struts l1 and l2 on the field point are almost the same but larger than strut l3 compared with the response induced by the excitation force of the propeller the responses by struts l1 and l2 are about 10 db smaller at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz but larger at frequencies greater than 100 hz this property implies that the two coupled modes are relatively more difficult to control than those over 100 hz 5 4 combination control at the active stern support and the thrust bearing due to the weak controllability at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz as illustrated in fig 11 active control forces are also applied to the thrust bearing base in the y direction according to the local velocity feedback control strategy the combination control at the thrust bearing and the stern support is evaluated as shown in fig 12 vibrations at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are reduced and more attenuations are achieved as the feedback gain increases comparison of the control at the stern support the control at the thrust bearing and their combination is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the attenuations at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are respectively 7 5 db and 6 5 db for the control at the thrust bearing support which are nearly the same as those for the control at the active stern support when the control at the stern support and the thrust bearing support is exerted simultaneously the attenuations become better therefore the advantage of combination control is obvious particularly at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz it should be pointed out that the influence of the change in the stern bearing support on the longitudinal vibration of the shaft is unimportant although there exists lateral longitudinal coupling vibrations of the shafting system will be reduced after active control the influence is negligible when the struts are symmetrically mounted in the vertical and horizontal planes respectively 5 5 vibration and sound radiation of the hull the mean square velocity level is defined as fahy and gardonio 2007 23 l v 10 log 10 v 2 v r e f 2 where the reference normal velocity v ref is 1 10 9m s the acoustic power level is defined as 24 l p 10 log 10 p p r e f where the reference power p ref is 1 10 12w the mean square velocity and radiated sound power of the hull surface are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively as illustrated in figs 14 and 15 the mean square velocity and the radiated sound power of the hull surface are suppressed substantially the mean square velocity at three frequencies 17 5 hz 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are reduced by more than 10 db with the combination control at the stern support and the thrust bearing the mode at 17 5 hz table 3 is a coupled bending mode of the shaft hull system which contributes most to the mean square velocity of the hull surface the radiated sound power is attenuated prominently at resonance frequencies especially at the first four frequencies 17 5 hz 29 5 hz 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz about 10 db attenuation is achieved moreover the performance is further promoted with the combination control at the active stern support and the thrust bearing as compared with the control at the active stern support only and the suppression at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz is improved prominently which is coincident with that in fig 13 6 conclusions an active control method that uses active stern support and local velocity feedback is proposed to suppress the transmission of lateral vibration from the shafting system to the hull structure in order to analyze vibration characteristics of the system under control the frf based synthesis method in combination with the finite element method is adopted the control performance is evaluated by vibration responses and sound radiation of the hull structure i e the mean square velocity and radiated sound power of the hull surface are used numerical results indicate that amplitudes of resonances are suppressed by the stern support and the velocity feedback combination control at the stern support and the thrust bearing support is able to achieve better attenuations of vibration and sound radiation over the analysis frequency band acknowledgements this work was partly support by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11672180 and the shanghai rising star program

23069,this paper presents an active control method for reducing the lateral vibration transmission in a shaft hull coupled system of submerged vehicles under the excitation of propeller forces in this method a 6 dof degree of freedom active stern support and the local velocity feedback control strategy are employed to suppress vibration transmission from the shaft to the hull the dynamic model of the shaft hull system embedded with the active stern support is established with the frf frequency response function based synthesis method and the fem bem finite element method boundary element method the six channel local velocity feedback control strategy is employed to suppress vibrations of the strut hull interface numerical results indicate that a noticeable attenuation of vibration and sound radiation can be achieved by the active stern support in addition the combination control at the stern support and the thrust bearing is able to obtain better attenuation at some critical frequencies suppression of the mean square velocity and radiated sound power of the hull surface are observed keywords shaft hull coupled system lateral vibration stern support active control velocity feedback 1 introduction in marine propulsion systems rotation of the propeller in a non uniform wake results in fluctuating forces these forces will transmit through the shaft to the hull and finally lead to significant low frequency underwater sound radiation caresta and kessissoglou 2010 merz et al 2009 reducing the transmission of fluctuating forces from the shaft to the hull structure is a feasible measure to control low frequency vibration and sound radiation hu et al 2012 even though the sound radiation from a submerged vehicle due to propeller forces dominantly depend on the longitudinal fluctuating forces the influence of lateral fluctuating forces cannot be ignored cao and zhang 2007 in addition the bearings which connect the shafting system and the hull serve as transmission paths of vibration and forces hu et al 2012 passive vibration isolation at these bearings is difficult because the lowest isolation frequency cannot be arbitrarily low which is determined by the requirement of shafting alignment and running safety therefore investigation on new methods is necessary to reduce the transmission of vibration and forces from the shaft to the hull structure the potential of passive isolation methods in reducing low frequency vibration transmission is limited due to the inherent resonance of isolation in comparison active methods can achieve more suppression at low frequencies by incorporating actuators sensors and controllers there are already investigations on active control of the longitudinal vibration of shafting systems dylejko et al 2007 merz et al 2010 pan et al 2008 caresta 2011 used inertial actuators which were attached to the cone structure and arranged in a circumferential array to reduce sound radiation of a submarine hull under the excitation of the propeller qin et al 2017 theoretically investigated the application of magnetic bearings in the control of lateral vibration transmission from the propeller to the hull which attempts to reduce force transmissibility at different shaft speeds by changing the equivalent stiffness of bearings however current work on active control of lateral vibration transmission in marine shaft hull systems is not yet sufficient for rotor bearing systems active units in lateral vibration control are usually built upon bearings and vibration control is realized by modifying bearing properties according to disturbances and operation conditions a variety of bearings such as magnetic bearings lusty et al 2016 fluid film bearings chasalevris and dohnal 2015 and actuators such as electromagnetic actuators koroishi et al 2014 piezoelectric actuators zhao et al 2015 pneumatic actuators pierart and santos 2016 and hydraulic actuators salazar and santos 2017a are combined to form active bearings salazar and santos 2017b used an active tilting pad journal bearing to control the lateral vibration of a flexible rotor bearing system where the active forces were provided by a hydraulic actuator yao et al 2017 presented a method to control periodic vibrations in rotor bearing systems by using magnetic actuators roy et al 2016 investigated the suspension of a rotor shaft system with active magnetic bearings and the pd proportion integral control law pierart and santos 2016 proposed an active gas bearing and combined control methods to increase the damping ratio of a high speed rotor system the results showed that the vibration level was reduced and the flexible rotor was able to run safely across the critical speeds zhao et al 2015 investigated a piezo based inertial actuator which was mounted on a rotational shaft and employed the fx lms filtered x least mean square algorithm to reduce vibration and noise radiation of a rotor system the propulsion shaft is supported by multiple bearings in which the stern bearing is the dominant channel to transmit lateral vibrations and forces from the propeller to the hull structure therefore the stern bearing is a preferred position to control transmission via active methods for vibration suppression active control strategies have been explored the fundamental methods such as the direct force feedback and velocity feedback are effective in vibration transmission control the direct force feedback is able to lower the equivalent stiffness at the interface of the two contact parts and consequently reduce the transmission of high frequency vibration while the directly velocity feedback is able to increase the equivalent damping of a system and resultantly suppress its resonance benassi and elliott 2004 benassi et al 2004 munoa et al 2013 preumont et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 this investigation is focused on the mechanism of active control of the lateral vibration of a shafting system since the stern bearing is usually a water lubricated rubber bearing the marine environment and the limited installation space should be considered in the construction of active control by taking these aspects into consideration a new concept of rear bearing support is proposed for active control of vibration transmission in the new scenario six active struts are utilized in the stern bearing and the direct local velocity feedback is adopted to reduce vibration transmission through the six struts the following discussion is organized in six sections first a shaft hull system embedded with a 6 dof active stern support is presented in section 2 next a numerical model of the shaft hull system with the active stern support is established in section 3 by combining the frf based synthesis method and the fem bem the local velocity feedback control strategy on the basis of the established dynamic model is given in section 4 then the performance of vibration and acoustic radiation control is presented in section 5 and finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 the shaft hull coupled system the shaft hull coupled system embedded with a 6 dof active stern support is shown in fig 1 in this system the propeller and the flexible coupling are simplified and represented by disks the hull is modeled with stiffened conical and cylindrical shells while the shaft is simplified to a beam the stern bearing which supports the shaft is represented by five equispaced springs due to its large length to diameter ratio the 6 dof active stern support connects the stern bearing housing and the hull through spherical joints and each strut is modeled by a beam the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing are both represented by springs which connect the shaft and the hull 3 computation of the coupled vibration and acoustics a considerable number of methods have been proposed to investigate dynamics of underwater structures such as analytical methods caresta and kessissoglou 2010 chen et al 2015 qu et al 2013 numerical methods merz et al 2007 as well as experimental methods leader et al 2013 analytical methods are of high computational efficiency and can be readily employed to analyze physical parameters in a shaft hull coupled system but they are applicable for simple structures only meanwhile experimental methods are more superior in dealing with complicated real systems but they are usually inconvenient and costly in comparison the fem bem method is powerful and effective in evaluating vibration and sound radiation of complicated systems wang et al 2017 in this paper for the convenience of analyzing parameters of the active struts the structural vibration characteristics are evaluated by fem and the frf based synthesis method while the acoustic radiation characteristics are evaluated by bem 3 1 modeling of the shaft hull system the shaft hull system is treated as an elastic system and its dynamic model is built by the frf based synthesis method the system is divided into four parts i e the shaft denoted by the superscript shaft the stern bearing denoted by the superscript housing the six active struts denoted by the superscript struts and the hull denoted by the superscript hull as shown in figs 1 and 2 the shaft and the stern bearing are connected by five equispaced springs the stern bearing and the hull are connected by six active struts the shaft and the hull are connected by the equivalent springs of the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing 3 1 1 frfs of the shaft the stern bearing and the hull the fem is adopted at first to build the frf models of the shaft the stern bearing pedestal as well as the hull because these structures are of fixed parameters or complicated fabrication the shaft is modeled by a circular beam while the propeller and the flexible coupling are modeled as points with inertial mass and rotational inertia the stern bearing pedestal is modeled by a cylindrical shell and the model of the hull is composed of a conical shell a cylindrical shell a hemispherical shell an end plate a bulkhead and ring stiffeners frfs of each substructure in free boundary condition are initially obtained and the

for the driving point the subscripts in parentheses indicate the number of elements for example the dimension of x s shaft in eq 1 is 15 1 since there are five points connecting the stern bearing and the shaft and each point contains three directions 3 1 2 frfs of the stern support the six active struts are simplified and modeled by uniform timoshenko beam elements in the local coordinate system o

to evaluate the sound radiation characteristics 3 2 computation of sound radiation with the nodal velocity responses of the hull surface obtained the boundary element method is adopted to calculate the acoustic radiation characteristics in an ideal acoustic medium the relationship between the sound pressure and the velocity can be given according to the bem wu 2000 12 b p c v n where b and c are the boundary element coefficient matrices p is the vector of sound pressure at field points v n is the vector of normal velocities at the fluid structure interface the mean square velocity of the hull structures can be obtained as follows fahy and gardonio 2007 13 v 2 1 s s v n 2 d s where ds is the element area associated with the normal velocity s is the surface area of the hull structure the radiated sound power of the hull structure can be evaluated on a closed surface that contains the structure fahy and gardonio 2007 14 p 1 2 s re p v n d s 4 active control strategy in this section the performance of lateral vibration transmission control for the shaft hull coupled system is investigated since local velocity feedback is able to increase the equivalent damping ratios of natural modes this simple method is adopted here to evaluate the performance of the proposed active configuration variations of vibration in the hull induced by the excitation force at the propeller are analyzed and the mean square velocities are used to compare the results before and after active control 4 1 single channel local velocity feedback the equivalent damping of the coupled system can be changed by local velocity feedback and accordingly the magnitudes at resonance frequencies can be reduced the principle of local velocity feedback for a single strut is shown in fig 3 and the corresponding definition of symbols is listed in table 1 according to fig 3 the following equations can be derived 15 v a h a a 1 k h a a f a h p a 1 k h a a f p 16 v s h p s f p h a s e h p s f p h a s f a k v a h

eq 17 the transmissibility function between the velocity responses of the hull and the disturbance force at the propeller can be obtained 4 2 six channel local velocity feedback when the single channel control strategy is expanded to six channels the coupling of six channels should be considered fig 4 shows the relationship between the first channel and the ith channel different from the derivation in the single channel control strategy the control errors of the closed loop system e i and the velocity responses of the application points of the active control forces v ai can be expressed as follows 18 e i f a i k i v a i 19 v a i h p a i f p k 1 6 h a k a i e k where the symbols are the same as those in table 1 and the indices i k 1 2 3 4 5 6 correspond to the six struts respectively h ak ai stands for the frequency response of the strut i to the active control force of the strut k thus the coupling effects of six channels are reflected in eq 19 further the following equations can be derived 20 v a 1 v a 2 v a 6 h p a 1 h p a 2 h p a 6 f p h a 1 a 1 h a 2 a 1 h a 6 a 1 h a 1 a 2 h a 2 a 2 h a 1 a 6 h a 6 a 6 f a 1 f a 2 f a 6 v a 1 v a 2 v a 6 let f a1 f a2 f a6 t

before and after control are evaluated to reveal the effectiveness of the active control the excitation and control forces are applied at the same time and v a are reduced by the control forces finally the velocity responses of the points on the hull v s are obtained 22 v s h p s f p i 1 6 h a i s k i v a i 5 analysis of the active control performance in order to calculate the active control performance the shaft hull coupled system with the proposed active stern support and the local velocity feedback control strategy is evaluated parameters of the shaft hull system fig 1 are listed in table 2 the finite element method is used to derive the frfs of the shaft the stern bearing pedestal and the hull respectively the finite element models of these substructures which are generated by the software abaqus consist of 144 1860 and 67833 elements respectively with the structural vibration responses of the hull surface obtained the boundary element method is adopted to calculate the acoustic radiation the acoustic surface is shown in fig 5 which consists of 5818 four node discontinuous linear boundary elements 5 1 force transmission before evaluating the performance of active control force transmission at each support is analyzed according to the dynamic model built in section 3 1 and applying the unit lateral excitation force 1n at the propeller the forces at the interfaces between the hull and the stern bearing the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing are computed in the analysis the frequency range is 0 200 hz and the step size is 0 5 hz as can be seen in fig 6 force transmission from the propeller to the hull is mainly attributed to the stern bearing although the intermediate bearing and the thrust bearing cannot be neglected at certain frequencies therefore the stern bearing is the main channel for the lateral fluctuating forces to induce vibrations in the hull by suppressing the transmission of fluctuating forces via the stern support it is possible to reduce low frequency vibrations in the hull theoretically active control is more effective in reducing low frequency vibration than passive control methods the mode shapes corresponding to the resonance peaks are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the modes at ω1 ω3 ω4 ω5 ω7 and ω8 are coupled bending modes of the shaft hull system while the modes at ω2 and ω6 are dominated by the bending modes of the shaft 5 2 variation in vibration characteristics in order to avoid large variation in the characteristics of the shaft hull system caused by the change of the stern support the influence of the 6 dof stern support on the whole system should be evaluated hence the system embedded with the 6 dof stern support is compared with that having a traditional stern support referred to as reference model the velocity responses of the hull to the unit force applied on the propeller are computed for the two systems respectively and the results are shown in fig 7 as can be seen there is only a slight change in the characteristics when the traditional stern support is replaced by the passive 6 dof stern support therefore the 6 dof stern support is as rigid as the traditional support in the following section the performance of active control is analyzed on the basis of this 6 dof stern support 5 3 active control performance the performance of lateral vibration transmission control is evaluated according to the strategy in section 4 2 the frfs of h ai ai h pi ai h ai si and h pi ai i 1 2 3 4 5 6 are calculated in terms of the model established in section 3 1 notice that the model is symmetric about the xoy plane and the field point on the hull is also in the xoy plane the local velocity responses of the struts h a a in the left half plane l1 l2 l3 are respectively the same as those in the right half plane r1 r2 r3 so are the responses of the field point to the struts h a s and the responses of the struts to the propeller h p a the local velocity responses of the struts l1 l2 l3 are plotted in fig 8 when the struts l1 l2 and l3 are controlled individually variations of the local frequency responses with the increase of feedback gain are shown in fig 9 as can be seen the resonance peaks are reduced obviously and the equivalent damping increases as the feedback gain goes up it is worth noting that the measurement and control is realized at the same point for the direct local velocity feedback and this method is unconditionally stable in theory in practice however due to the limited response speed of actuators local velocity feedback still needs careful design and the feedback gain cannot be arbitrarily large according to the control strategy in fig 4 and the calculation process in eq 17 eq 21 the performance of six channel control is evaluated and the results are shown in fig 10 as can be seen vibration of the field point on the hull is suppressed over 0 200 hz attenuations of the closed loop are 7 5db 44 5hz and 5db 68 5hz in fact the local velocity feedback along the direction of each strut can guarantee that vibrations in the x y and z directions are all suppressed this will be demonstrated by the radiated sound power of the hull moreover attenuations at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are not so much as those at other frequencies this is attributed to the fact that the modes at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are respectively bending modes of the shaft hull coupled system as illustrated in table 3 as well as the weak controllability implied by the curves in fig 11 according to the responses of the field point to the control force of the struts l1 l2 l3 and the excitation force of the propeller as shown in fig 11 influences of struts l1 and l2 on the field point are almost the same but larger than strut l3 compared with the response induced by the excitation force of the propeller the responses by struts l1 and l2 are about 10 db smaller at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz but larger at frequencies greater than 100 hz this property implies that the two coupled modes are relatively more difficult to control than those over 100 hz 5 4 combination control at the active stern support and the thrust bearing due to the weak controllability at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz as illustrated in fig 11 active control forces are also applied to the thrust bearing base in the y direction according to the local velocity feedback control strategy the combination control at the thrust bearing and the stern support is evaluated as shown in fig 12 vibrations at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are reduced and more attenuations are achieved as the feedback gain increases comparison of the control at the stern support the control at the thrust bearing and their combination is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the attenuations at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are respectively 7 5 db and 6 5 db for the control at the thrust bearing support which are nearly the same as those for the control at the active stern support when the control at the stern support and the thrust bearing support is exerted simultaneously the attenuations become better therefore the advantage of combination control is obvious particularly at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz it should be pointed out that the influence of the change in the stern bearing support on the longitudinal vibration of the shaft is unimportant although there exists lateral longitudinal coupling vibrations of the shafting system will be reduced after active control the influence is negligible when the struts are symmetrically mounted in the vertical and horizontal planes respectively 5 5 vibration and sound radiation of the hull the mean square velocity level is defined as fahy and gardonio 2007 23 l v 10 log 10 v 2 v r e f 2 where the reference normal velocity v ref is 1 10 9m s the acoustic power level is defined as 24 l p 10 log 10 p p r e f where the reference power p ref is 1 10 12w the mean square velocity and radiated sound power of the hull surface are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively as illustrated in figs 14 and 15 the mean square velocity and the radiated sound power of the hull surface are suppressed substantially the mean square velocity at three frequencies 17 5 hz 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz are reduced by more than 10 db with the combination control at the stern support and the thrust bearing the mode at 17 5 hz table 3 is a coupled bending mode of the shaft hull system which contributes most to the mean square velocity of the hull surface the radiated sound power is attenuated prominently at resonance frequencies especially at the first four frequencies 17 5 hz 29 5 hz 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz about 10 db attenuation is achieved moreover the performance is further promoted with the combination control at the active stern support and the thrust bearing as compared with the control at the active stern support only and the suppression at 44 5 hz and 68 5 hz is improved prominently which is coincident with that in fig 13 6 conclusions an active control method that uses active stern support and local velocity feedback is proposed to suppress the transmission of lateral vibration from the shafting system to the hull structure in order to analyze vibration characteristics of the system under control the frf based synthesis method in combination with the finite element method is adopted the control performance is evaluated by vibration responses and sound radiation of the hull structure i e the mean square velocity and radiated sound power of the hull surface are used numerical results indicate that amplitudes of resonances are suppressed by the stern support and the velocity feedback combination control at the stern support and the thrust bearing support is able to achieve better attenuations of vibration and sound radiation over the analysis frequency band acknowledgements this work was partly support by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11672180 and the shanghai rising star program
