10140,soil mulching can effectively modify the crop growth environment and increase crop productivity in rainfed agriculture accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration et especially its transpiration t component is crucial for understanding the crop water use and predicting crop yield in agricultural ecosystems nevertheless direct measurement of t in the field is often difficult expensive destructive and time consuming daily rainfed maize t under four mulching methods nm non mulching sm straw mulching rpbf plastic mulched ridge with bare furrow and rpsf plastic mulched ridge with straw mulched furrow was obtained from sap flow measurements over four maize growing seasons 2015 2018 in northwest china a modified jarvis stewart model mjs and a support vector machine model optimized by the whale optimization algorithm svm woa were further proposed to estimate daily maize t based on solar radiation rs vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content swc and leaf area index lai which were compared to the simple multiple linear regression model mlr the three models were calibrated using data obtained in 2015 and 2017 and validated using data from 2016 and 2018 the measured seasonal t under sm rpbf and rpsf was increased by 6 9 19 1 12 1 31 3 and 15 3 36 7 compared to that under nm respectively the svm woa model r2 0 83 0 89 rmse 0 55 0 73 mm d 1 mae 0 42 0 53 mm d 1 was superior to the mjs model r2 0 61 0 79 rmse 0 75 1 12 mm d 1 mae 0 58 0 88 mm d 1 during validation both of which greatly outperformed the mlr model r2 0 57 0 60 rmse 1 28 1 41 mm d 1 mae 0 99 1 09 mm d 1 under various mulching methods the prediction accuracy of the svm woa and mjs models was improved by 47 57 and 19 41 in terms of rmse compared with that of the mlr model respectively although the physically based mjs model satisfactorily described the dynamics of rainfed maize t under various mulching methods the blackbox type svm woa model was more suitable for estimating daily maize t after a careful calibration with adequate experimental data due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between t and its driving variables keywords transpiration mulching modified jarvis stewart model support vector machine whale optimization algorithm 1 introduction rainfed agriculture accounts for about 80 of the total arable land on the loess plateau of china huang et al 2011 li et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a maize zea mays l is one of the main cereal crops cultivated in spring or summer seasons in this area zheng et al 2018 soil mulching has been widely applied to effectively improve soil water and temperature regimes especially to regulate the crop water consumption from non productive to productive and enhance the water use efficiency feng et al 2017a gu et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2014 mo et al 2016 rhebergen et al 2020 welde and gebremariam 2016 zheng et al 2018b water use by maize plants i e sap flow or transpiration t appears to be a critical indicator for evaluating agricultural management practices in water limited regions because maize productivity is closely related to water availability a useful method for determining maize t is the measurement of sap flow using heat balance based sensors gonzalez dugo et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 2016 nevertheless sap flow measurements are often expensive difficult destructive and time consuming transpiration can be also determined as the difference between crop evapotranspiration et and soil evaporation e et can be estimated by the soil water balance method zheng et al 2021 eddy covariance feng et al 2017a and remote sensing van der laan et al 2019 while e is usually determined by measuring the change in weight of micro lysimeters however the equipment availability and costs in estimating et differ and there are also measurement errors in et and e which may result in errors in estimated t therefore empirical physically based or blackbox type models have been established to estimate plant transpiration using readily available variables plant transpiration is influenced by both the environmental and biophysical processes at the soil vegetation atmosphere interface therefore t is commonly estimated by establishing multiple linear regression mlr between t and its driving variables such as meteorological variables soil water content and crop parameters jiang et al 2016 tu et al 2019 however simple mlr models have no physical meanings and can not be directly applied to other regions the penman monteith equation pm is a well known one layer model for estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 penman 1948 monteith 1965 plant transpiration can be further obtained by multiplying et0 by a water stress coefficient ks and a basal crop coefficient kcb allen et al 1998 er raki et al 2010 ding et al 2013a however ks and kcb are empirical and can vary greatly depending on climate and surface conditions even for the same crop shuttleworth and wallace 1985 designed a two layer model sw which can be adopted to quantify the amount of water losses from the soil and plant separately kato et al 2004 li et 2013 other models have also been proposed for partitioning et into e and t kool et a 2014 however the applications of sw model and other et partitioning models are still limited because they require a large number of variables and are sensitive to the errors of these variables besides some of the variables can not be easily obtained e g aerodynamic stomatal and soil surface resistance based on the physically based pm model jarvis 1976 and stewart 1988 developed an analytical model to describe the canopy conductance which is generally called the jarvis stewart model recently this model has been modified to directly determine t avoiding the requirement for canopy conductance which is termed as the modified jarvis stewart model mjs whitley et al 2008 2013 a set of functions linking the responses of t to its driving variables are introduced to limit the maximum t which are reduction factors and vary from 0 to 1 guyot et al 2017 whitley et al 2009 compared the pm and mjs models for estimating daily stand scale t in an australian native forest they found that both models performed well in summer but the pm model failed in winter when t was high li et al 2016a compared the mlr and mjs models for estimating the stand scale t of a desert riparian forest in the heihe river basin of china the results indicated that the mjs model estimated the seasonal t variation more accurately in comparison with the mlr model xu et al 2017 assessed the applicability of the mjs model for estimating daily t of three desert shrubs near the linze inland river basin of china they found that the simplified process based model was insignificantly better than the mjs model the mjs model can be implemented over a range of climatic conditions and growth conditions once the model parameters are calibrated because this model considers the main drivers of t and its parameters have physical meanings li et al 2016b the estimation of t is a complicated and nonlinear regression process that depends on several meteorological soil and vegetation variables it is difficult to establish precise empirical or process based models representing all these underlying processes thus machine learning models e g artificial neural network ann have been proposed for estimating sap flow or t based on meteorological variables and soil moisture conditions because they do not need the knowledge of internal factors and can provide easy solutions for the linear nonlinear and multivariate functions liu et al 2009 whitley et al 2009 kisi 2015 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 feng et al 2017b fan et al 2018 tu et al 2019 fan et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of studies that evaluate the performances of the mjs model and machine learning models for estimating the transpiration of crops e g maize in addition leaf area index lai or a function expressing the response of t to lai has not been considered in the mjs model when estimating t of shrubs and forests but this can be problematic when estimating maize t as lai varies greatly over the growing season the effects of management practices nutrient application biotic and abiotic stresses and climatic conditions in different growing seasons on plant growth can be directly reflected by lai although ann models have been widely applied for sap flow or t estimation the applicability of other commonly used machine learning models has been seldom investigated e g support vector machine svm which has shown great superiority over the ann model in hydrological and agricultural applications shrestha and shukla 2015 tang et al 2018 fan et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the variations of daily rainfed maize t in northwest china under various mulching methods during 2015 2018 using heat balance sap flow sensors 2 explore the applicability of physically based mjs model for estimating maize t by incorporating the effect of lai and 3 develop a blackbox type svm model hybridized with a novel bio inspired optimization algorithm i e the whale optimization algorithm woa for estimating daily maize t under various mulching methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site information and experimental design a four season field experiment was carried out in rainfed maize fields at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid area sponsored by the ministry of education 34 18 n 108 24 e northwest a f university yangling china during 2015 2018 the climate in this region is semi humid but drought prone with an average annual rainfall of 560 mm over the past 20 years an average annual temperature of 12 9 and an average annual pan evaporation of 1500 mm the annual sunshine hour is 2196 h and the frost free period is 220 d the soil is classified as medium loam which has a bulk density of 1 40 g cm3 water holding capacity of 24 and a permanent wilting point of 8 5 gravimetric in the soil layer of 0 30 cm the depth of ground water table is greater than 50 m four mulching methods were applied in a randomized complete block design in this study non mulching nm straw mulching sm plastic mulched ridge with bare furrow rpbf and plastic mulched ridge with straw mulched furrow rpsf zheng et al 2020 the experiments were replicated three times with each plot of 15 m2 and 1 5 m apart between two plots summer maize zhengdan 958 was planted at a planting density of 67 500 plants ha 1 60 cm 25 cm on 15 june 2015 12 june 2016 14 june 2017 and 17 june 2018 and harvested on 30 september 2015 4 october 2016 6 october 2017 and 1 october 2018 respectively urea n 46 180 kg n ha 1 superphosphate p 7 52 kg p ha 1 and potassium chloride k 42 50 kg k ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizers before sowing all plots received no irrigation and additional fertilizer over the entire growing seasons weeds were controlled to avoid the competition of water and nutrients with maize as far as possible during each growing season weeds growth on the ridges covered with plastic film was inhibited due to the high temperature and lack of adequate oxygen weeds in the furrows non mulching and straw mulching treatments were controlled manually as required other agronomic measures e g spraying pesticides were undertaken to control pests and diseases to minimize their adverse effects on maize growth 2 2 micrometeorology solar radiation rs was measured at hourly intervals with an nr01 radiometer hukseflux inc the netherlands mounted on a bowen ratio energy balance system breb campbell scientific inc usa at a distance of 100 m daily rainfall air temperature and relative humidity were monitored by the yangling national meteorological observing station situated 30 m away from our experimental plots which were recorded at hourly intervals vapor pressure deficit vpd was inferred from average air temperature and relative humidity data following campbell and norman 1998 2 3 leaf area index leaf area index lai was determined every 5 10 days during the maize growing seasons specifically lai was measured on 15 july 23 july 3 august 12 august 4 september 17 september and 29 september in 2015 on 12 july 19 july 25 july 1 august 25 august 9 september and 26 september in 2016 on 5 july 13 july 23 july 4 august 15 august 25 august 10 september and 27 september in 2017 and on 6 july 16 july 26 july 6 august 19 august 3 september and 29 september in 2018 respectively three representative plants were randomly selected at each experimental plot and their total green leaf areas were attained by summing leaf length multiplied by the maximal leaf width and a converting coefficient of 0 75 mckee 1964 lai was then obtained by dividing the total green leaf area of each plant by the soil surface available for each plant because the transpiration models required daily lai data in this study continuous daily lai values were obtained from the fitted equation lai a dasb exp 0 077 das where a and b are fitted coefficients using spss nonlinear regressions between observed lai and the day after sowing das ding et al 2013b zheng et al 2021 2 4 soil water content soil water content swc was monitored by soil water sensors ech2o 5te decagon devices usa at 15 min intervals which was calibrated and validated periodically using the oven drying method by taking soil samples near the sensors fan et al 2015 maize growth is largely sensitive to upper soil water because most maize fine roots are distributed within the 0 50 cm soil layer therefore these soil water sensors were arranged at 10 20 30 and 50 cm below the ground surface the mean swc at each depth was calculated from two locations for flat cultivation row and interrow and three positions for cultivation with ridge and furrow central ridge central furrow and ridge side for data analysis presented in the present study mean soil water content in the 0 50 cm soil layer was used 2 5 transpiration measurement sap flow rates of maize plants were measured using the dynagage flow32 1 k system dynamax inc usa sakuratani 1981 for each treatment three representative maize plants were chosen and instrumented with gauges at the second internode of the stem for sap flow measurements from 1 july 16 19 17 and 14 days after sowing respectively over the four growing seasons sap flow sensors were insulated using silica gel and covered with aluminum foil for reducing energy exchange with the surrounding air and preventing the entire system against rainwater the uninstallation and reinstallation of gauges on other maize plants were performed about every 10 15 days because continuous heating from the heater can lead to the plant dryness sap flow rates were obtained every 60 s and 30 min average data were recorded by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa the measured sap flow rates were corrected using the calibration equation t 0 65 v 0 39 v is sap flow rate g plant 1 h 1 t is transpiration rate g plant 1 h 1 proposed by wang et al 2017 daily plant water use was the sum of t within a day l plant 1 day 1 daily plant water use of individual plant was scaled up to stand scale t mm day 1 by multiplying the average daily sap flow rate of the three sample plants by the average ground area of individual plant 2 6 models for estimating maize transpiration in this study a multiple linear regression model mlr a modified jarvis stewart model mjs and a support vector machine model optimized by the whale optimization algorithm svm woa were developed to estimate maize t based on rs vpd swc and lai 2 6 1 multiple linear regression model the mlr model for estimating transpiration is expressed as follows 1 t e s t c r s d v p d e s w c f l a i g where test is the estimated maize transpiration c d e f and g are fitted coefficients using spss nonlinear regressions 2 6 2 modified jarvis stewart model similar to previous studies it is assumed that maize transpiration is well related to the canopy and atmosphere the mjs model for modeling transpiration is expressed as follows 2 t est t max f 1 r s f 2 vpd f 3 swc f 4 lai where tmax is the maximum rate of maize transpiration which is proportionally modified by each driving variable the functional relationships are the independent responses of maize t to solar radiation f1 rs vapor pressure deficit f2 vpd soil water content f3 swc and leaf area index f4 lai each of which is a reduction factor ranging 0 1 the expression for f1 rs relationship is described by eq 3 3 f 1 r s r s 400 400 k 1 r s k 1 where 400 describes an asymptotic saturating soil radiation and k1 is a fitted parameter representing the curvature of the t rs relationship the expression of f2 vpd relationship is described by eq 4 4 f 2 vpd e k 2 vpd k 3 vpd vpd max 2 where vpdmax is the maximum vpd k2 and k3 are fitted parameters the expression of f3 swc relationship is described by eq 5 5 f 3 swc 0 swc swc w swc c swc w 1 where swcw and swcc describe the soil wilting point and critical point respectively lai is also an important factor influencing plant transpiration besides meteorological variables and soil moisture conditions therefore the function of lai was added into the mjs model to improve the accuracy of estimated t in this study however a detailed function for lai has not been proposed previously in the present study t was found to increase quickly with increasing lai but the increasing rate started to slow down similar to the function of f1 rs therefore the expression of f4 lai relationship is described using the equation below 6 f 4 lai lai lai max lai max k 4 lai k 4 where laimax is the maximum lai set as 7 m2 m 2 in this study based on field measurements and k4 is a fitted parameter 2 6 3 support vector machines the svm model was developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 which is a supervised soft computing model minimizing the estimation error and model complexity at the same time vapnik 1999 the svm model predicts the regression based on several kernel functions implicitly transforming the low dimensional inputs to a high dimensional feature space the regression function in svm is approximated as 7 f x ω φ x b where φ x is the high dimensional feature space transformed from the input vector x ω is the weight vector and b is a bias and the regularized risk function below is minimized to determine the two parameters 8 r c c 1 n i 1 n l d i y i 1 2 ω 2 9 l ε d y d y ε d y ε 0 otherwise where c is a penalty parameter 1 2 ω 2 is the regularization term di is the wanted value n is the observation number and c 1 n i 1 n l d i y i is the error ɛ is the tube size of svm in lɛ eq 7 is eventually described explicitly using introduced lagrange multipliers α i and α i and exploited optimal constraint 10 f x α i α i i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where k x x i is the kernel function the radial basis function kernel function was applied in the present study considering its good prediction accuracy and model stability in hydrological and agricultural applications relative to the linear kernel function chen et al 2013 quej et al 2017 fan et al 2018 11 k rbf x x i exp x x i 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of observation data xi eq 11 can be further expressed as 12 k rbf x x i exp γ x x i 2 where γ is the kernel parameter defined as 1 2 σ 2 2 7 model implementation and parameter optimization the mlr mjs and svm woa models were calibrated using daily rs vpd swc lai and t data measured in 2015 and 2017 and validated using data from 2016 and 2018 under each mulching method and further using the pooled data from all mulching methods to explore whether t under various mulching methods could be estimated with only one parameter set of the three models in view of the requirements of the svm model the raw data were normalized ranging from 0 to 1 as per fan et al 2018 the mlr models were obtained using the spss statistical software the calibration of the mjs model included the parameterization of the four stress functions limiting to 0 f 1 and tmax the values of k1 k2 k3 swcc swcw and k4 were fitted with the equation solver in microsoft excel to minimize root mean square error rmse between the observed and estimated t matsumoto et al 2005 2008 bastidas obando et al 2017 to optimize the calibration process and improve the prediction accuracy of the svm model its main parameters of penalty parameter cost and kernel parameter gamma were optimized by a novel and powerful bio inspired algorithm i e whale optimization algorithm woa which was established by mirjalili and lewis 2016 and simulated the behavior of humpback whale detailed information of the woa algorithm can be found in mirjalili and lewis 2016 the optimization of the svm model by the woa algorithm was implemented in the r program version 3 6 2 2 8 statistical indicators the performances of the mlr mjs and svm woa models for estimating daily maize t were assessed by three statistical indicators including coefficient of determination r2 rmse and mean absolute error mae 13 r 2 i 1 n t i obs t obs t i est t est 2 i 1 n t i obs t obs 2 i 1 n t i est t est 2 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n t i obs t i est 2 15 mae 1 n i 1 n t i obs t i est where ti obs ti est t obs t est and n are the observed estimated the average of observed and estimated maize transpiration and the observation number respectively high values of r2 closer to 1 and lower values of rmse and mae mean good prediction accuracy of transpiration models 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological variables soil water content and leaf area index mean daily meteorological variables rs vpd and rainfall over the maize growing seasons of 2015 2018 are given in fig 1 mean daily rs ranged from 83 1 to 329 7 w m 2 in 2015 from 83 7 to 338 4 w m 2 in 2016 from 79 9 to 392 6 w m 2 in 2017 and from 85 0 to 326 4 w m 2 in 2018 the mean daily vpd varied 0 07 2 07 kpa in 2015 0 12 2 17 kpa in 2016 0 04 2 64 kpa in 2017 and 0 08 1 85 kpa in 2018 total rainfall from planting to harvest was 269 9 261 1 287 4 and 410 0 mm over the four growing seasons respectively in 2015 the rainfall from seedling to late june accounted for 29 9 while the rainfall in july august and september was 2 2 33 3 and 34 6 respectively there was abundant rainfall from seedling to late july 59 4 in 2016 but only 5 8 of the total rainfall occurred in august causing severe drought during critical period of maize growth relatively less rainfall from seedling to late july 16 8 and more rainfall from september to harvest 55 9 were observed in 2017 seasonal rainfall distribution was more uniform in 2018 with 12 5 32 7 39 4 and 15 4 of the total rainfall in june july august and september respectively averaged soil water content swc in the 0 50 cm soil layer changed greatly over the four maize growing seasons the variation of swc was largely dependent on the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall since it was the only source for replenishing the soil water in this study fig 1 swc increased following each stronger rainfall event and declined progressively until the next rainfall while small rainfall events had little effect on swc to a depth of 50 cm generally swc with soil mulching was greater than that of nm with mean swc values under nm sm rpbf and rpsf of 23 1 23 7 23 4 and 23 2 in 2015 20 4 21 2 21 9 and 22 0 in 2016 22 1 22 9 23 3 and 23 4 in 2017 and 22 5 22 6 23 3 and 22 8 in 2018 respectively previous studies have concluded that soil mulching inhibited the exchange of soil water between the soil and air to reduce soil water evaporation thereby providing more favorable soil water conditions for maize growth gao et al 2019 ramakrishna et al 2006 leaf area index lai exhibited an obvious one peak pattern rising rapidly after sowing and reaching the peak in mid august and then declining the maximum lai under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 3 56 4 14 4 42 and 5 09 m2 m 2 in 2015 5 33 5 58 6 00 and 6 24 m2 m 2 in 2016 3 46 4 11 4 60 and 5 00 m2 m 2 in 2017 and 3 98 4 41 4 83 and 4 92 m2 m 2 in 2018 respectively fig 2 better soil water and temperature conditions promoted the maize growth and development which resulted in higher lai values in the mulching treatments zheng et al 2020 sufficient rainfall at the jointing stage of summer maize in 2016 caused the rapid stem elongation and leaf expansion and thus higher lai compared to the other three years however the accelerated leaf senescence and remarkable decrease of lai at the late growth stage were observed in 2016 resulting from the severe atmospheric and soil water stress in august this result was consistent with jia et al 2018 who concluded that remarkable water stress could lead to premature leaf senescence and decrease in lai 3 2 variation of maize transpiration under various mulching methods variations of daily maize t were similar under different mulching methods over the four growing seasons of 2015 2018 fig 3 the measured sap flow rates have been corrected using the linear equation proposed by wang et al 2017 whose maize variety and sap flow sensor were the same as those in our study the corrected sap flow rates were thus considered to be close to the real values besides in our previous study zheng et al 2021 the total et obtained from micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements were comparable to those from the soil water balance method relative errors ranging 9 3 16 1 these indicated the applicability and reliability of sap flow systems in measuring maize t after correction in the present study daily t increased rapidly from early july and reached higher values in early august and then decreased gradually till late september over the four seasons similar to the variation of lai variations of t showed an increasing and then declining trend throughout the maize growing seasons cumulative t under the four mulching methods varied 155 5 209 9 mm in 2015 126 7 155 5 mm in 2016 168 3 230 0 mm in 2017 and 246 8 284 5 mm in 2018 cumulative t values obtained in 2018 were consistent with the values of 222 1 293 3 mm estimated by yan et al 2017 based on the simdualkc model for drip irrigated summer maize located in the same study region and also similar to the range of 254 3 320 5 mm observed by chen et al 2019 for rainfed maize in shenyang of northeast china 398 0 mm rainfall input however cumulative t values were relatively lower during the other three seasons which was mainly resulted from less seasonal rainfall input on average 272 8 mm compared to that in 2018 410 0 mm in addition differences in cumulative t among the four seasons were attributed to differences in temporal rainfall distribution brito et al 2015 the much less rainfall and severe soil water stress in august of 2016 led to the irreversible leaf drying and yellowing extensively this resulted in much lower cumulative t in 2016 than that in 2015 and 2017 despite there was a similar total rainfall amount among the three seasons fig 1 environmental factors affected the short term variation of t but lai determined its long term variation jiang et al 2016 generally measured seasonal maize t was significantly enhanced by soil mulching which was 7 1 36 7 higher than that of nm increased soil temperature under rpbf was conductive to the seedling establishment and plant extension although no significant soil temperature increase was detected under rpsf because of the trade off effects of the increased temperature from plastic mulching on ridges and decreased temperatures from straw mulching in furrows the improved soil water conditions promoted maize leaf growth as for sm low temperature was observed but it was still sufficient for the maize emergence and even helped alleviate the high temperature stress during the hot summer and better soil water retention also increased maize lai zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2019 found that film mulching enhanced plant height and lai and improved maize t by 3 5 32 0 hu et al 2019 concluded that the application of soil mulching straw and plastic film tended to increase productive transpiration for the wheat maize cropping system because of the favorable soil water and temperature conditions for plant growth 3 3 parameters of mlr mjs and svm woa models the fitted mlr models between t and the four driving variables using data measured in 2015 and 2017 under different mulching methods are given in table 1 it can be seen that t was positively related to rs vpd swc and lai which was in a good agreement with the findings of chen et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 previous studies indicated that t was also positively related to air temperature and negatively related to relative humidity but they were not considered in this study since they were closely associated with vpd all the mlr models reached significant levels of p 0 01 with r2 of 0 62 0 65 during calibration the parameters of svm model optimized by the woa algorithm under various mulching methods are presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 the optimized gamma was similar 0 1 but cost varied between 87 and 256 under various mulching methods fig 4 presents the functional dependencies of maize t to rs vpd swc in the 0 50 cm soil layer and lai under various mulching methods these boundary lines showed that maize t was enhanced from zero to the maximal value as rs increased whilst increasing vpd caused the increase in t at low values of vpd it showed minimal change within a narrow intermediate range of vpd 1 0 1 5 kpa and then declined with increasing vpd beyond this range the hyperbolic saturation of plant water use to increasing rs has been extensively identified granier et al 2000 whitley et al 2008 2009 guyot et al 2017 because t is mainly limited by energy supply at low levels of rs while high levels of rs can limit the stomatal conductance li et al 2017 han et al 2019 although the asymptotic increase in t with increasing rs was obtained its curvature was not obvious this may be due to the fact that no value was recorded in the range of saturated solar radiation about 1000 w m 2 for woodland reported by whitley et al 2008 2009 the response of t to vpd was complex which was also largely attributed to the stomatal and canopy resistance canopy stomatal conductance decreased with the increasing vpd oren et al 2001 resulting in declined t when vpd surpassed a threshold the threshold value of daily vpd was 1 5 kpa in the study of jiang et al 2016 and varied with plant type geographical location and environmental conditions hernandez santana et al 2011 chen et al 2014 decreased t at high rs and vpd was also attributed to the low swc which was accompanied with high rs and vpd due to the rainfed condition in our study maize t showed a three phase response to swc with a linearly declining trend when swc was below the field capacity and maintaining relatively constant when swc was above this value when swc dropped below a critical threshold maize plants reduced the stomatal opening in the leaves leading to lower transpiration guyot et al 2017 meanwhile rs and vpd could be high when swc was low in our rainfed maize fields which further aggravated the closure of stomatal and the decrease of t when swc ranged from the critical point and field capacity there was no water stress for maize growth and t mainly depended on meteorological factors like vpd fu et al 2016 t was positively related to lai schmidt walter et al 2014 qin et al 2019 and increased rapidly with the increase in lai and asymptotically to a maximum value in our study table 3 shows the optimized parameters for the functional descriptions of solar radiation k1 vapor pressure deficit vpdmax k2 and k3 soil water content swcc and swcw and leaf area index k4 in the mjs model under various mulching methods tmax was ranked in the order of nm sm rpbf rpsf ranging 5 9 6 6 mm d 1 these estimated maximal values were lower than the observed values of 6 6 7 5 8 3 and 8 6 mm d 1 respectively suggesting that the model may slightly underestimate daily maize t at high transpiration rates the response of t to rs did not differ obviously among the mulching methods fig 4 although k1 under nm was lower than that of the other treatments the vpd parameters k2 k3 and vpdmax and lai parameter k4 were in the similar ranges however there were little differences in the swc parameters especially swcw ranging from 14 4 to 16 9 the results indicated that the maximal t and the response characteristics of t to driving factors did not vary largely except for swcw under various mulching methods in the study of matsumoto et al 2008 significant differences were found in the response properties of canopy conductance to swc in different regions because swc differed markedly among the three locations but the data from all sites complemented each other and the prediction accuracy of the pooled model was similar to that of the site specific model these function boundaries captured most data points from all mulching treatments in the study of guyot et al 2017 the swc parameters coverred a wide range under all scenarios and showed relatively large standard errors but the model showed better performance when pooling all data the three models with pooled data in this study also exhibited satisfactory prediction accuracy compared with the mulching specific models fig 4 table 3 with r2 of 0 58 0 67 and 0 85 during validation respectively table 4 soil mulching directly influenced swc and lai and subsequent t both swc and lai were considered in the three models therefore it was reliable to predict plant daily t using pooled data from different mulching methods 3 4 comparisons of mlr mjs and svm woa models in estimating daily maize transpiration the statistical results r2 rmse and mae of the mlr mjs and svm woa models in estimating daily t under various mulching methods during calibration and validation are given in table 4 as seen in table 4 estimated t differed greatly among the three transpiration models the svm woa model showed the largest r2 smallest rmse and mae during both calibration 0 86 0 91 0 43 0 68 and 0 35 0 49 mm d 1 respectively and validation 0 83 0 89 0 55 0 73 and 0 42 0 53 mm d 1 respectively under the four mulching methods highlighting its best performance among the three models the mjs model also showed satisfactory prediction accuracy in estimating daily maize t with average r2 rmse and mae of 0 77 0 80 0 72 0 94 0 56 0 72 mm d 1 during calibration 0 61 0 79 0 75 1 12 and 0 58 0 88 mm d 1 during validation respectively however the mlr model showed the worst performance with average r2 rmse and mae of 0 62 0 65 1 14 1 34 0 82 0 98 mm d 1 during calibration 0 57 0 60 1 28 1 41 and 0 99 1 09 mm d 1 during validation respectively compared to the mlr model the prediction accuracy of the svm woa model increased by 48 53 and 55 in terms of average r2 rmse and mae across various mulching methods during validation while the corresponding values of the mjs model were 23 33 and 36 respectively our study suggested that the performances of the mjs and svm woa models were greatly improved by incorporating the effect of lai suggesting that this factor needed to be considered in addition to rs vpd and swc for more accurate estimation of daily maize transpiration the scatter plots of observed and estimated daily maize transpiration by the three models under nm sm rpbf and rpsf during validation 2016 and 2018 are given in fig 5 daily t values estimated by the svm woa and mjs models were more closer to the observed values under various mulching methods with fewer scattered estimates around the 1 1 line relative to the mlr model all these results confirmed the best prediction accuracy of the svm woa model in estimating daily maize t among the three models followed by the mjs model the deviations from those data points where the observed t was smaller than 5 mm d 1 were much reduced showing an nearly 1 1 line between observed and estimated t values fig 5 this indicated that those days with high transpiration were not easy to fit by the models the mlr and mjs models tended to underestimate large transpiration values compared with the svm woa model the satisfactory accuracy of the mjs model in estimating transpiration has also been revealed by whitley et al 2008 2009 indicating that the mjs model was able to replicate observed stand scale transpiration of a woodland throughout the year compared to the pm equation guyot et al 2017 found that better t estimates of a conifer forest were obtained by the mjs model when incorporating with water content data at different soil depths xu et al 2017 also concluded that the mjs model performed better than the simplified process based model in estimating t of desert shrubs the statistical mlr model assumes that t and its driving factors follow linear relationships which is simple to use in practice tu et al 2019 however field observations revealed obvious nonlinear relationships between t and various driving factors therefore undesired prediction accuracy was obtained by the mlr model for estimating daily maize t in this study although the mjs model satisfactorily described the dynamics of daily maize t it did not outperform the blackbox type svm model overall poor performance was obtained by the mjs model during and immediately after great rainfall events where large increases in the observed t rates were not captured by the model this could be due to that low vpd values in this model had a negative impact on t vpd values were low after rainfall resulting in small gradients between the leaf and atmosphere leading to the underestimation of t although swc was not a limiting factor under this condition the best t estimates were produced by the svm woa model as a result of its capability of capturing the nonlinear relations between t and its influencing variables fan et al 2018 the hybrid svm model with the bio inspired woa algorithm effectively improved the performance of the standalone svm model because it deducted the optimal solutions and improved the computational efficiency fan et al 2020a wu et al 2019 yan et al 2021 although the svm woa model has many obvious advantages it has no explicit expression and is unable to provide a detailed explanation of the physical processes between maize transpiration and its environmental drivers besides the blackbox type approaches like the svm model often require a large amount of training data to obtain robust performance féret et al 2019 fan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the mjs model may be more preferable to the svm woa model under data limited conditions in the present study the proposed svm model optimized by the woa algorithm was proved to outperform the mjs and mlr models for estimating maize transpiration after a careful calibration with adequate experimental data however the proposed models need to be further validated for other agricultural crop and soil conditions 4 conclusions compared to non mulching soil mulching increased the maize transpiration by 6 9 19 1 12 1 31 3 and 15 3 36 7 under sm rpbf and rpsf respectively the svm woa model outperformed the mjs model both of which produced much better daily maize transpiration estimates than the mlr model under various mulching methods during 2015 2018 the prediction accuracy of the svm woa and mjs models was improved by 47 57 and 19 41 in terms of rmse compared with that of the mlr model respectively although the physically based mjs model was important for understanding the crop water use and satisfactorily described the dynamics of transpiration of rainfed maize under various mulching methods the blackbox type svm woa model was recommended for daily maize transpiration estimation with a careful calibration due to its high prediction accuracy despite that it can not explain the physical processes in detail these findings help to better understand the agricultural water cycle and sustainable management of rainfed maize in northwest china

10140,soil mulching can effectively modify the crop growth environment and increase crop productivity in rainfed agriculture accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration et especially its transpiration t component is crucial for understanding the crop water use and predicting crop yield in agricultural ecosystems nevertheless direct measurement of t in the field is often difficult expensive destructive and time consuming daily rainfed maize t under four mulching methods nm non mulching sm straw mulching rpbf plastic mulched ridge with bare furrow and rpsf plastic mulched ridge with straw mulched furrow was obtained from sap flow measurements over four maize growing seasons 2015 2018 in northwest china a modified jarvis stewart model mjs and a support vector machine model optimized by the whale optimization algorithm svm woa were further proposed to estimate daily maize t based on solar radiation rs vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content swc and leaf area index lai which were compared to the simple multiple linear regression model mlr the three models were calibrated using data obtained in 2015 and 2017 and validated using data from 2016 and 2018 the measured seasonal t under sm rpbf and rpsf was increased by 6 9 19 1 12 1 31 3 and 15 3 36 7 compared to that under nm respectively the svm woa model r2 0 83 0 89 rmse 0 55 0 73 mm d 1 mae 0 42 0 53 mm d 1 was superior to the mjs model r2 0 61 0 79 rmse 0 75 1 12 mm d 1 mae 0 58 0 88 mm d 1 during validation both of which greatly outperformed the mlr model r2 0 57 0 60 rmse 1 28 1 41 mm d 1 mae 0 99 1 09 mm d 1 under various mulching methods the prediction accuracy of the svm woa and mjs models was improved by 47 57 and 19 41 in terms of rmse compared with that of the mlr model respectively although the physically based mjs model satisfactorily described the dynamics of rainfed maize t under various mulching methods the blackbox type svm woa model was more suitable for estimating daily maize t after a careful calibration with adequate experimental data due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between t and its driving variables keywords transpiration mulching modified jarvis stewart model support vector machine whale optimization algorithm 1 introduction rainfed agriculture accounts for about 80 of the total arable land on the loess plateau of china huang et al 2011 li et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a maize zea mays l is one of the main cereal crops cultivated in spring or summer seasons in this area zheng et al 2018 soil mulching has been widely applied to effectively improve soil water and temperature regimes especially to regulate the crop water consumption from non productive to productive and enhance the water use efficiency feng et al 2017a gu et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2014 mo et al 2016 rhebergen et al 2020 welde and gebremariam 2016 zheng et al 2018b water use by maize plants i e sap flow or transpiration t appears to be a critical indicator for evaluating agricultural management practices in water limited regions because maize productivity is closely related to water availability a useful method for determining maize t is the measurement of sap flow using heat balance based sensors gonzalez dugo et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 2016 nevertheless sap flow measurements are often expensive difficult destructive and time consuming transpiration can be also determined as the difference between crop evapotranspiration et and soil evaporation e et can be estimated by the soil water balance method zheng et al 2021 eddy covariance feng et al 2017a and remote sensing van der laan et al 2019 while e is usually determined by measuring the change in weight of micro lysimeters however the equipment availability and costs in estimating et differ and there are also measurement errors in et and e which may result in errors in estimated t therefore empirical physically based or blackbox type models have been established to estimate plant transpiration using readily available variables plant transpiration is influenced by both the environmental and biophysical processes at the soil vegetation atmosphere interface therefore t is commonly estimated by establishing multiple linear regression mlr between t and its driving variables such as meteorological variables soil water content and crop parameters jiang et al 2016 tu et al 2019 however simple mlr models have no physical meanings and can not be directly applied to other regions the penman monteith equation pm is a well known one layer model for estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 penman 1948 monteith 1965 plant transpiration can be further obtained by multiplying et0 by a water stress coefficient ks and a basal crop coefficient kcb allen et al 1998 er raki et al 2010 ding et al 2013a however ks and kcb are empirical and can vary greatly depending on climate and surface conditions even for the same crop shuttleworth and wallace 1985 designed a two layer model sw which can be adopted to quantify the amount of water losses from the soil and plant separately kato et al 2004 li et 2013 other models have also been proposed for partitioning et into e and t kool et a 2014 however the applications of sw model and other et partitioning models are still limited because they require a large number of variables and are sensitive to the errors of these variables besides some of the variables can not be easily obtained e g aerodynamic stomatal and soil surface resistance based on the physically based pm model jarvis 1976 and stewart 1988 developed an analytical model to describe the canopy conductance which is generally called the jarvis stewart model recently this model has been modified to directly determine t avoiding the requirement for canopy conductance which is termed as the modified jarvis stewart model mjs whitley et al 2008 2013 a set of functions linking the responses of t to its driving variables are introduced to limit the maximum t which are reduction factors and vary from 0 to 1 guyot et al 2017 whitley et al 2009 compared the pm and mjs models for estimating daily stand scale t in an australian native forest they found that both models performed well in summer but the pm model failed in winter when t was high li et al 2016a compared the mlr and mjs models for estimating the stand scale t of a desert riparian forest in the heihe river basin of china the results indicated that the mjs model estimated the seasonal t variation more accurately in comparison with the mlr model xu et al 2017 assessed the applicability of the mjs model for estimating daily t of three desert shrubs near the linze inland river basin of china they found that the simplified process based model was insignificantly better than the mjs model the mjs model can be implemented over a range of climatic conditions and growth conditions once the model parameters are calibrated because this model considers the main drivers of t and its parameters have physical meanings li et al 2016b the estimation of t is a complicated and nonlinear regression process that depends on several meteorological soil and vegetation variables it is difficult to establish precise empirical or process based models representing all these underlying processes thus machine learning models e g artificial neural network ann have been proposed for estimating sap flow or t based on meteorological variables and soil moisture conditions because they do not need the knowledge of internal factors and can provide easy solutions for the linear nonlinear and multivariate functions liu et al 2009 whitley et al 2009 kisi 2015 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 feng et al 2017b fan et al 2018 tu et al 2019 fan et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of studies that evaluate the performances of the mjs model and machine learning models for estimating the transpiration of crops e g maize in addition leaf area index lai or a function expressing the response of t to lai has not been considered in the mjs model when estimating t of shrubs and forests but this can be problematic when estimating maize t as lai varies greatly over the growing season the effects of management practices nutrient application biotic and abiotic stresses and climatic conditions in different growing seasons on plant growth can be directly reflected by lai although ann models have been widely applied for sap flow or t estimation the applicability of other commonly used machine learning models has been seldom investigated e g support vector machine svm which has shown great superiority over the ann model in hydrological and agricultural applications shrestha and shukla 2015 tang et al 2018 fan et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the variations of daily rainfed maize t in northwest china under various mulching methods during 2015 2018 using heat balance sap flow sensors 2 explore the applicability of physically based mjs model for estimating maize t by incorporating the effect of lai and 3 develop a blackbox type svm model hybridized with a novel bio inspired optimization algorithm i e the whale optimization algorithm woa for estimating daily maize t under various mulching methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site information and experimental design a four season field experiment was carried out in rainfed maize fields at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid area sponsored by the ministry of education 34 18 n 108 24 e northwest a f university yangling china during 2015 2018 the climate in this region is semi humid but drought prone with an average annual rainfall of 560 mm over the past 20 years an average annual temperature of 12 9 and an average annual pan evaporation of 1500 mm the annual sunshine hour is 2196 h and the frost free period is 220 d the soil is classified as medium loam which has a bulk density of 1 40 g cm3 water holding capacity of 24 and a permanent wilting point of 8 5 gravimetric in the soil layer of 0 30 cm the depth of ground water table is greater than 50 m four mulching methods were applied in a randomized complete block design in this study non mulching nm straw mulching sm plastic mulched ridge with bare furrow rpbf and plastic mulched ridge with straw mulched furrow rpsf zheng et al 2020 the experiments were replicated three times with each plot of 15 m2 and 1 5 m apart between two plots summer maize zhengdan 958 was planted at a planting density of 67 500 plants ha 1 60 cm 25 cm on 15 june 2015 12 june 2016 14 june 2017 and 17 june 2018 and harvested on 30 september 2015 4 october 2016 6 october 2017 and 1 october 2018 respectively urea n 46 180 kg n ha 1 superphosphate p 7 52 kg p ha 1 and potassium chloride k 42 50 kg k ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizers before sowing all plots received no irrigation and additional fertilizer over the entire growing seasons weeds were controlled to avoid the competition of water and nutrients with maize as far as possible during each growing season weeds growth on the ridges covered with plastic film was inhibited due to the high temperature and lack of adequate oxygen weeds in the furrows non mulching and straw mulching treatments were controlled manually as required other agronomic measures e g spraying pesticides were undertaken to control pests and diseases to minimize their adverse effects on maize growth 2 2 micrometeorology solar radiation rs was measured at hourly intervals with an nr01 radiometer hukseflux inc the netherlands mounted on a bowen ratio energy balance system breb campbell scientific inc usa at a distance of 100 m daily rainfall air temperature and relative humidity were monitored by the yangling national meteorological observing station situated 30 m away from our experimental plots which were recorded at hourly intervals vapor pressure deficit vpd was inferred from average air temperature and relative humidity data following campbell and norman 1998 2 3 leaf area index leaf area index lai was determined every 5 10 days during the maize growing seasons specifically lai was measured on 15 july 23 july 3 august 12 august 4 september 17 september and 29 september in 2015 on 12 july 19 july 25 july 1 august 25 august 9 september and 26 september in 2016 on 5 july 13 july 23 july 4 august 15 august 25 august 10 september and 27 september in 2017 and on 6 july 16 july 26 july 6 august 19 august 3 september and 29 september in 2018 respectively three representative plants were randomly selected at each experimental plot and their total green leaf areas were attained by summing leaf length multiplied by the maximal leaf width and a converting coefficient of 0 75 mckee 1964 lai was then obtained by dividing the total green leaf area of each plant by the soil surface available for each plant because the transpiration models required daily lai data in this study continuous daily lai values were obtained from the fitted equation lai a dasb exp 0 077 das where a and b are fitted coefficients using spss nonlinear regressions between observed lai and the day after sowing das ding et al 2013b zheng et al 2021 2 4 soil water content soil water content swc was monitored by soil water sensors ech2o 5te decagon devices usa at 15 min intervals which was calibrated and validated periodically using the oven drying method by taking soil samples near the sensors fan et al 2015 maize growth is largely sensitive to upper soil water because most maize fine roots are distributed within the 0 50 cm soil layer therefore these soil water sensors were arranged at 10 20 30 and 50 cm below the ground surface the mean swc at each depth was calculated from two locations for flat cultivation row and interrow and three positions for cultivation with ridge and furrow central ridge central furrow and ridge side for data analysis presented in the present study mean soil water content in the 0 50 cm soil layer was used 2 5 transpiration measurement sap flow rates of maize plants were measured using the dynagage flow32 1 k system dynamax inc usa sakuratani 1981 for each treatment three representative maize plants were chosen and instrumented with gauges at the second internode of the stem for sap flow measurements from 1 july 16 19 17 and 14 days after sowing respectively over the four growing seasons sap flow sensors were insulated using silica gel and covered with aluminum foil for reducing energy exchange with the surrounding air and preventing the entire system against rainwater the uninstallation and reinstallation of gauges on other maize plants were performed about every 10 15 days because continuous heating from the heater can lead to the plant dryness sap flow rates were obtained every 60 s and 30 min average data were recorded by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa the measured sap flow rates were corrected using the calibration equation t 0 65 v 0 39 v is sap flow rate g plant 1 h 1 t is transpiration rate g plant 1 h 1 proposed by wang et al 2017 daily plant water use was the sum of t within a day l plant 1 day 1 daily plant water use of individual plant was scaled up to stand scale t mm day 1 by multiplying the average daily sap flow rate of the three sample plants by the average ground area of individual plant 2 6 models for estimating maize transpiration in this study a multiple linear regression model mlr a modified jarvis stewart model mjs and a support vector machine model optimized by the whale optimization algorithm svm woa were developed to estimate maize t based on rs vpd swc and lai 2 6 1 multiple linear regression model the mlr model for estimating transpiration is expressed as follows 1 t e s t c r s d v p d e s w c f l a i g where test is the estimated maize transpiration c d e f and g are fitted coefficients using spss nonlinear regressions 2 6 2 modified jarvis stewart model similar to previous studies it is assumed that maize transpiration is well related to the canopy and atmosphere the mjs model for modeling transpiration is expressed as follows 2 t est t max f 1 r s f 2 vpd f 3 swc f 4 lai where tmax is the maximum rate of maize transpiration which is proportionally modified by each driving variable the functional relationships are the independent responses of maize t to solar radiation f1 rs vapor pressure deficit f2 vpd soil water content f3 swc and leaf area index f4 lai each of which is a reduction factor ranging 0 1 the expression for f1 rs relationship is described by eq 3 3 f 1 r s r s 400 400 k 1 r s k 1 where 400 describes an asymptotic saturating soil radiation and k1 is a fitted parameter representing the curvature of the t rs relationship the expression of f2 vpd relationship is described by eq 4 4 f 2 vpd e k 2 vpd k 3 vpd vpd max 2 where vpdmax is the maximum vpd k2 and k3 are fitted parameters the expression of f3 swc relationship is described by eq 5 5 f 3 swc 0 swc swc w swc c swc w 1 where swcw and swcc describe the soil wilting point and critical point respectively lai is also an important factor influencing plant transpiration besides meteorological variables and soil moisture conditions therefore the function of lai was added into the mjs model to improve the accuracy of estimated t in this study however a detailed function for lai has not been proposed previously in the present study t was found to increase quickly with increasing lai but the increasing rate started to slow down similar to the function of f1 rs therefore the expression of f4 lai relationship is described using the equation below 6 f 4 lai lai lai max lai max k 4 lai k 4 where laimax is the maximum lai set as 7 m2 m 2 in this study based on field measurements and k4 is a fitted parameter 2 6 3 support vector machines the svm model was developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 which is a supervised soft computing model minimizing the estimation error and model complexity at the same time vapnik 1999 the svm model predicts the regression based on several kernel functions implicitly transforming the low dimensional inputs to a high dimensional feature space the regression function in svm is approximated as 7 f x ω φ x b where φ x is the high dimensional feature space transformed from the input vector x ω is the weight vector and b is a bias and the regularized risk function below is minimized to determine the two parameters 8 r c c 1 n i 1 n l d i y i 1 2 ω 2 9 l ε d y d y ε d y ε 0 otherwise where c is a penalty parameter 1 2 ω 2 is the regularization term di is the wanted value n is the observation number and c 1 n i 1 n l d i y i is the error ɛ is the tube size of svm in lɛ eq 7 is eventually described explicitly using introduced lagrange multipliers α i and α i and exploited optimal constraint 10 f x α i α i i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where k x x i is the kernel function the radial basis function kernel function was applied in the present study considering its good prediction accuracy and model stability in hydrological and agricultural applications relative to the linear kernel function chen et al 2013 quej et al 2017 fan et al 2018 11 k rbf x x i exp x x i 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of observation data xi eq 11 can be further expressed as 12 k rbf x x i exp γ x x i 2 where γ is the kernel parameter defined as 1 2 σ 2 2 7 model implementation and parameter optimization the mlr mjs and svm woa models were calibrated using daily rs vpd swc lai and t data measured in 2015 and 2017 and validated using data from 2016 and 2018 under each mulching method and further using the pooled data from all mulching methods to explore whether t under various mulching methods could be estimated with only one parameter set of the three models in view of the requirements of the svm model the raw data were normalized ranging from 0 to 1 as per fan et al 2018 the mlr models were obtained using the spss statistical software the calibration of the mjs model included the parameterization of the four stress functions limiting to 0 f 1 and tmax the values of k1 k2 k3 swcc swcw and k4 were fitted with the equation solver in microsoft excel to minimize root mean square error rmse between the observed and estimated t matsumoto et al 2005 2008 bastidas obando et al 2017 to optimize the calibration process and improve the prediction accuracy of the svm model its main parameters of penalty parameter cost and kernel parameter gamma were optimized by a novel and powerful bio inspired algorithm i e whale optimization algorithm woa which was established by mirjalili and lewis 2016 and simulated the behavior of humpback whale detailed information of the woa algorithm can be found in mirjalili and lewis 2016 the optimization of the svm model by the woa algorithm was implemented in the r program version 3 6 2 2 8 statistical indicators the performances of the mlr mjs and svm woa models for estimating daily maize t were assessed by three statistical indicators including coefficient of determination r2 rmse and mean absolute error mae 13 r 2 i 1 n t i obs t obs t i est t est 2 i 1 n t i obs t obs 2 i 1 n t i est t est 2 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n t i obs t i est 2 15 mae 1 n i 1 n t i obs t i est where ti obs ti est t obs t est and n are the observed estimated the average of observed and estimated maize transpiration and the observation number respectively high values of r2 closer to 1 and lower values of rmse and mae mean good prediction accuracy of transpiration models 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological variables soil water content and leaf area index mean daily meteorological variables rs vpd and rainfall over the maize growing seasons of 2015 2018 are given in fig 1 mean daily rs ranged from 83 1 to 329 7 w m 2 in 2015 from 83 7 to 338 4 w m 2 in 2016 from 79 9 to 392 6 w m 2 in 2017 and from 85 0 to 326 4 w m 2 in 2018 the mean daily vpd varied 0 07 2 07 kpa in 2015 0 12 2 17 kpa in 2016 0 04 2 64 kpa in 2017 and 0 08 1 85 kpa in 2018 total rainfall from planting to harvest was 269 9 261 1 287 4 and 410 0 mm over the four growing seasons respectively in 2015 the rainfall from seedling to late june accounted for 29 9 while the rainfall in july august and september was 2 2 33 3 and 34 6 respectively there was abundant rainfall from seedling to late july 59 4 in 2016 but only 5 8 of the total rainfall occurred in august causing severe drought during critical period of maize growth relatively less rainfall from seedling to late july 16 8 and more rainfall from september to harvest 55 9 were observed in 2017 seasonal rainfall distribution was more uniform in 2018 with 12 5 32 7 39 4 and 15 4 of the total rainfall in june july august and september respectively averaged soil water content swc in the 0 50 cm soil layer changed greatly over the four maize growing seasons the variation of swc was largely dependent on the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall since it was the only source for replenishing the soil water in this study fig 1 swc increased following each stronger rainfall event and declined progressively until the next rainfall while small rainfall events had little effect on swc to a depth of 50 cm generally swc with soil mulching was greater than that of nm with mean swc values under nm sm rpbf and rpsf of 23 1 23 7 23 4 and 23 2 in 2015 20 4 21 2 21 9 and 22 0 in 2016 22 1 22 9 23 3 and 23 4 in 2017 and 22 5 22 6 23 3 and 22 8 in 2018 respectively previous studies have concluded that soil mulching inhibited the exchange of soil water between the soil and air to reduce soil water evaporation thereby providing more favorable soil water conditions for maize growth gao et al 2019 ramakrishna et al 2006 leaf area index lai exhibited an obvious one peak pattern rising rapidly after sowing and reaching the peak in mid august and then declining the maximum lai under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 3 56 4 14 4 42 and 5 09 m2 m 2 in 2015 5 33 5 58 6 00 and 6 24 m2 m 2 in 2016 3 46 4 11 4 60 and 5 00 m2 m 2 in 2017 and 3 98 4 41 4 83 and 4 92 m2 m 2 in 2018 respectively fig 2 better soil water and temperature conditions promoted the maize growth and development which resulted in higher lai values in the mulching treatments zheng et al 2020 sufficient rainfall at the jointing stage of summer maize in 2016 caused the rapid stem elongation and leaf expansion and thus higher lai compared to the other three years however the accelerated leaf senescence and remarkable decrease of lai at the late growth stage were observed in 2016 resulting from the severe atmospheric and soil water stress in august this result was consistent with jia et al 2018 who concluded that remarkable water stress could lead to premature leaf senescence and decrease in lai 3 2 variation of maize transpiration under various mulching methods variations of daily maize t were similar under different mulching methods over the four growing seasons of 2015 2018 fig 3 the measured sap flow rates have been corrected using the linear equation proposed by wang et al 2017 whose maize variety and sap flow sensor were the same as those in our study the corrected sap flow rates were thus considered to be close to the real values besides in our previous study zheng et al 2021 the total et obtained from micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements were comparable to those from the soil water balance method relative errors ranging 9 3 16 1 these indicated the applicability and reliability of sap flow systems in measuring maize t after correction in the present study daily t increased rapidly from early july and reached higher values in early august and then decreased gradually till late september over the four seasons similar to the variation of lai variations of t showed an increasing and then declining trend throughout the maize growing seasons cumulative t under the four mulching methods varied 155 5 209 9 mm in 2015 126 7 155 5 mm in 2016 168 3 230 0 mm in 2017 and 246 8 284 5 mm in 2018 cumulative t values obtained in 2018 were consistent with the values of 222 1 293 3 mm estimated by yan et al 2017 based on the simdualkc model for drip irrigated summer maize located in the same study region and also similar to the range of 254 3 320 5 mm observed by chen et al 2019 for rainfed maize in shenyang of northeast china 398 0 mm rainfall input however cumulative t values were relatively lower during the other three seasons which was mainly resulted from less seasonal rainfall input on average 272 8 mm compared to that in 2018 410 0 mm in addition differences in cumulative t among the four seasons were attributed to differences in temporal rainfall distribution brito et al 2015 the much less rainfall and severe soil water stress in august of 2016 led to the irreversible leaf drying and yellowing extensively this resulted in much lower cumulative t in 2016 than that in 2015 and 2017 despite there was a similar total rainfall amount among the three seasons fig 1 environmental factors affected the short term variation of t but lai determined its long term variation jiang et al 2016 generally measured seasonal maize t was significantly enhanced by soil mulching which was 7 1 36 7 higher than that of nm increased soil temperature under rpbf was conductive to the seedling establishment and plant extension although no significant soil temperature increase was detected under rpsf because of the trade off effects of the increased temperature from plastic mulching on ridges and decreased temperatures from straw mulching in furrows the improved soil water conditions promoted maize leaf growth as for sm low temperature was observed but it was still sufficient for the maize emergence and even helped alleviate the high temperature stress during the hot summer and better soil water retention also increased maize lai zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2019 found that film mulching enhanced plant height and lai and improved maize t by 3 5 32 0 hu et al 2019 concluded that the application of soil mulching straw and plastic film tended to increase productive transpiration for the wheat maize cropping system because of the favorable soil water and temperature conditions for plant growth 3 3 parameters of mlr mjs and svm woa models the fitted mlr models between t and the four driving variables using data measured in 2015 and 2017 under different mulching methods are given in table 1 it can be seen that t was positively related to rs vpd swc and lai which was in a good agreement with the findings of chen et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 previous studies indicated that t was also positively related to air temperature and negatively related to relative humidity but they were not considered in this study since they were closely associated with vpd all the mlr models reached significant levels of p 0 01 with r2 of 0 62 0 65 during calibration the parameters of svm model optimized by the woa algorithm under various mulching methods are presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 the optimized gamma was similar 0 1 but cost varied between 87 and 256 under various mulching methods fig 4 presents the functional dependencies of maize t to rs vpd swc in the 0 50 cm soil layer and lai under various mulching methods these boundary lines showed that maize t was enhanced from zero to the maximal value as rs increased whilst increasing vpd caused the increase in t at low values of vpd it showed minimal change within a narrow intermediate range of vpd 1 0 1 5 kpa and then declined with increasing vpd beyond this range the hyperbolic saturation of plant water use to increasing rs has been extensively identified granier et al 2000 whitley et al 2008 2009 guyot et al 2017 because t is mainly limited by energy supply at low levels of rs while high levels of rs can limit the stomatal conductance li et al 2017 han et al 2019 although the asymptotic increase in t with increasing rs was obtained its curvature was not obvious this may be due to the fact that no value was recorded in the range of saturated solar radiation about 1000 w m 2 for woodland reported by whitley et al 2008 2009 the response of t to vpd was complex which was also largely attributed to the stomatal and canopy resistance canopy stomatal conductance decreased with the increasing vpd oren et al 2001 resulting in declined t when vpd surpassed a threshold the threshold value of daily vpd was 1 5 kpa in the study of jiang et al 2016 and varied with plant type geographical location and environmental conditions hernandez santana et al 2011 chen et al 2014 decreased t at high rs and vpd was also attributed to the low swc which was accompanied with high rs and vpd due to the rainfed condition in our study maize t showed a three phase response to swc with a linearly declining trend when swc was below the field capacity and maintaining relatively constant when swc was above this value when swc dropped below a critical threshold maize plants reduced the stomatal opening in the leaves leading to lower transpiration guyot et al 2017 meanwhile rs and vpd could be high when swc was low in our rainfed maize fields which further aggravated the closure of stomatal and the decrease of t when swc ranged from the critical point and field capacity there was no water stress for maize growth and t mainly depended on meteorological factors like vpd fu et al 2016 t was positively related to lai schmidt walter et al 2014 qin et al 2019 and increased rapidly with the increase in lai and asymptotically to a maximum value in our study table 3 shows the optimized parameters for the functional descriptions of solar radiation k1 vapor pressure deficit vpdmax k2 and k3 soil water content swcc and swcw and leaf area index k4 in the mjs model under various mulching methods tmax was ranked in the order of nm sm rpbf rpsf ranging 5 9 6 6 mm d 1 these estimated maximal values were lower than the observed values of 6 6 7 5 8 3 and 8 6 mm d 1 respectively suggesting that the model may slightly underestimate daily maize t at high transpiration rates the response of t to rs did not differ obviously among the mulching methods fig 4 although k1 under nm was lower than that of the other treatments the vpd parameters k2 k3 and vpdmax and lai parameter k4 were in the similar ranges however there were little differences in the swc parameters especially swcw ranging from 14 4 to 16 9 the results indicated that the maximal t and the response characteristics of t to driving factors did not vary largely except for swcw under various mulching methods in the study of matsumoto et al 2008 significant differences were found in the response properties of canopy conductance to swc in different regions because swc differed markedly among the three locations but the data from all sites complemented each other and the prediction accuracy of the pooled model was similar to that of the site specific model these function boundaries captured most data points from all mulching treatments in the study of guyot et al 2017 the swc parameters coverred a wide range under all scenarios and showed relatively large standard errors but the model showed better performance when pooling all data the three models with pooled data in this study also exhibited satisfactory prediction accuracy compared with the mulching specific models fig 4 table 3 with r2 of 0 58 0 67 and 0 85 during validation respectively table 4 soil mulching directly influenced swc and lai and subsequent t both swc and lai were considered in the three models therefore it was reliable to predict plant daily t using pooled data from different mulching methods 3 4 comparisons of mlr mjs and svm woa models in estimating daily maize transpiration the statistical results r2 rmse and mae of the mlr mjs and svm woa models in estimating daily t under various mulching methods during calibration and validation are given in table 4 as seen in table 4 estimated t differed greatly among the three transpiration models the svm woa model showed the largest r2 smallest rmse and mae during both calibration 0 86 0 91 0 43 0 68 and 0 35 0 49 mm d 1 respectively and validation 0 83 0 89 0 55 0 73 and 0 42 0 53 mm d 1 respectively under the four mulching methods highlighting its best performance among the three models the mjs model also showed satisfactory prediction accuracy in estimating daily maize t with average r2 rmse and mae of 0 77 0 80 0 72 0 94 0 56 0 72 mm d 1 during calibration 0 61 0 79 0 75 1 12 and 0 58 0 88 mm d 1 during validation respectively however the mlr model showed the worst performance with average r2 rmse and mae of 0 62 0 65 1 14 1 34 0 82 0 98 mm d 1 during calibration 0 57 0 60 1 28 1 41 and 0 99 1 09 mm d 1 during validation respectively compared to the mlr model the prediction accuracy of the svm woa model increased by 48 53 and 55 in terms of average r2 rmse and mae across various mulching methods during validation while the corresponding values of the mjs model were 23 33 and 36 respectively our study suggested that the performances of the mjs and svm woa models were greatly improved by incorporating the effect of lai suggesting that this factor needed to be considered in addition to rs vpd and swc for more accurate estimation of daily maize transpiration the scatter plots of observed and estimated daily maize transpiration by the three models under nm sm rpbf and rpsf during validation 2016 and 2018 are given in fig 5 daily t values estimated by the svm woa and mjs models were more closer to the observed values under various mulching methods with fewer scattered estimates around the 1 1 line relative to the mlr model all these results confirmed the best prediction accuracy of the svm woa model in estimating daily maize t among the three models followed by the mjs model the deviations from those data points where the observed t was smaller than 5 mm d 1 were much reduced showing an nearly 1 1 line between observed and estimated t values fig 5 this indicated that those days with high transpiration were not easy to fit by the models the mlr and mjs models tended to underestimate large transpiration values compared with the svm woa model the satisfactory accuracy of the mjs model in estimating transpiration has also been revealed by whitley et al 2008 2009 indicating that the mjs model was able to replicate observed stand scale transpiration of a woodland throughout the year compared to the pm equation guyot et al 2017 found that better t estimates of a conifer forest were obtained by the mjs model when incorporating with water content data at different soil depths xu et al 2017 also concluded that the mjs model performed better than the simplified process based model in estimating t of desert shrubs the statistical mlr model assumes that t and its driving factors follow linear relationships which is simple to use in practice tu et al 2019 however field observations revealed obvious nonlinear relationships between t and various driving factors therefore undesired prediction accuracy was obtained by the mlr model for estimating daily maize t in this study although the mjs model satisfactorily described the dynamics of daily maize t it did not outperform the blackbox type svm model overall poor performance was obtained by the mjs model during and immediately after great rainfall events where large increases in the observed t rates were not captured by the model this could be due to that low vpd values in this model had a negative impact on t vpd values were low after rainfall resulting in small gradients between the leaf and atmosphere leading to the underestimation of t although swc was not a limiting factor under this condition the best t estimates were produced by the svm woa model as a result of its capability of capturing the nonlinear relations between t and its influencing variables fan et al 2018 the hybrid svm model with the bio inspired woa algorithm effectively improved the performance of the standalone svm model because it deducted the optimal solutions and improved the computational efficiency fan et al 2020a wu et al 2019 yan et al 2021 although the svm woa model has many obvious advantages it has no explicit expression and is unable to provide a detailed explanation of the physical processes between maize transpiration and its environmental drivers besides the blackbox type approaches like the svm model often require a large amount of training data to obtain robust performance féret et al 2019 fan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the mjs model may be more preferable to the svm woa model under data limited conditions in the present study the proposed svm model optimized by the woa algorithm was proved to outperform the mjs and mlr models for estimating maize transpiration after a careful calibration with adequate experimental data however the proposed models need to be further validated for other agricultural crop and soil conditions 4 conclusions compared to non mulching soil mulching increased the maize transpiration by 6 9 19 1 12 1 31 3 and 15 3 36 7 under sm rpbf and rpsf respectively the svm woa model outperformed the mjs model both of which produced much better daily maize transpiration estimates than the mlr model under various mulching methods during 2015 2018 the prediction accuracy of the svm woa and mjs models was improved by 47 57 and 19 41 in terms of rmse compared with that of the mlr model respectively although the physically based mjs model was important for understanding the crop water use and satisfactorily described the dynamics of transpiration of rainfed maize under various mulching methods the blackbox type svm woa model was recommended for daily maize transpiration estimation with a careful calibration due to its high prediction accuracy despite that it can not explain the physical processes in detail these findings help to better understand the agricultural water cycle and sustainable management of rainfed maize in northwest china

10141,water saving technologies have long been seen as an effective method to reduce irrigation water use and alleviate regional water shortage however growing reports of more severe water shortage and increasing application of water saving technologies across the world have necessitated reassessment of agricultural water saving this study develops a simple method based on satellite based et partitions to estimate water withdrawal water consumption and return flow from the 1980s to 2010s and quantifies water savings across globe and four hot spot irrigated areas at both field and regional scales based on water accounting framework the results show that global irrigation water flows keep increasing from the 1980s to 2010s with over 50 increase from the expansion in irrigated lands while water saving technologies are found mainly applied in originally old irrigated lands traditional flooding irrigation is still dominant in newly developed irrigated lands non beneficial water consumption soil evaporation is effectively reduced by water saving technologies but return flow has increased at the same time at field scale water saving technologies fail to save water because the accumulated increased return flow is more than the accumulated decreased non beneficial water consumption at regional scale however water is saved because the return flow percolated to fresh aquifers is seen as beneficial rather than loss at the same time the accumulated increase of beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeds regional water savings which explains the paradox between wide application of water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage this study provides key new evidence for the paradox of irrigation efficiency and helps reconsidering water saving technologies and their impacts on regional water resources keywords paradox of irrigation efficiency water accounting framework water savings estimation satellite based et partitions data availability global gridded data used in this study are openly available as indicated in section 2 1 1 introduction irrigation is widely considered a major contributor to water scarcity as it is the largest freshwater user with a long criticism of low efficiency especially in water scarce regions perry et al 2009 thus water saving irrigation that aims to reduce inefficient water use and maximizes beneficial crop water use is seen as a basic solution to water scarcity perry et al 2017 paradoxically increase in water scarcity has become common with the growing application of water saving irrigation in recent decades due to the reuse of saved water in the cultivation of more areas higher crop density and more water intensive crops kendy et al 2004 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 scott et al 2014 fishman et al 2015 molle and tanouti 2017 berbel et al 2018 grafton et al 2018 this has changed the current understanding of water saving and moved water saving calculations from field scale to region scale thus a scheme called water accounting has been proposed to reassess irrigation water saving at regional scale based on the new definition of water flows perry 2007 gleick et al 2011 batchelor et al 2017 in water accounting framework irrigation water use is divided into four parts i the beneficial water consumption such as transpiration for crop growth ii the non beneficial water consumption such as evaporation from bare soil and weed transpiration iii the recoverable return flow including water re entering river reservoirs and fresh aquifers iv the non recoverable return flow such as percolation to saline aquifers or outflow to the ocean perry 2007 at region scale recoverable return flow can be reused by other users thus only non beneficial water consumption and non recoverable return flow can be seen as a loss compared to traditional field scale framework in that all return flow is seen as loss the new framework takes more water users into consideration thus calls for a regional scale reassessment of water savings for irrigation although this framework has been successfully applied in some case studies vardon et al 2007 karimi et al 2013a b however global assessment of irrigation water saving at region scale that is based on water accounting framework has not been conducted so far agro hydrological models have traditionally been used to estimate global irrigation water use shiklomanov 2000 wada et al 2011 2014 kummu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 however it is hard to analyze global irrigation water saving at region scale that is based on water accounting framework through traditional agro hydrological models this is because 1 a lot of studies estimate global irrigation in a certain year or a short time period for a fixed irrigated area which hampers assessment of the effect of land expansion on irrigation hanasaki et al 2006 2010 siebert and dӧll 2010 2 most agro hydrological models only calculate net irrigation requirements without accounting for return flow which is critical for assessing regional water saving dӧll and siebert 2002 haddeland et al 2006 siebert and dӧll 2010 haddeland et al 2014 müller et al 2019 3 for those models that do consider deep percolation irrigation systems surface sprinkler and drip are insufficiently represented due to the coarse knowledge on irrigation systems despite their large impact on return flow and groundwater recharge hanasaki et al 2010 wada et al 2014 chen et al 2019 recent boom in partitioned satellite based evapotranspiration et products those partitioning et into evaporation and transpiration provides a chance to assess water saving at both field and region scales based on water accounting framework stoy et al 2019 in this study a simple approach was proposed to estimate irrigation water use water withdrawal water consumption and return flow and divide them into four components beneficial and non beneficial water consumption recoverable and non recoverable return flow using satellite based et partitions and other agricultural datasets jӓgermeyr et al 2015 siebert et al 2015 the novelties of this study include 1 solving the difficulty of return flow estimation from irrigation using a simple method and 2 answering how much irrigation water is saved across the globe at both field and region scales for solving these issues we setup in this study the following objectives 1 estimation of water withdrawal water consumption and return flow from the 1980s to 2010s across the globe and four hot spot irrigation areas and 2 investigation of water saving from irrigation at field and region scales in the past four decades the results of the study will strengthen our understanding about the change in irrigation across the globe and provide different perspectives on water governance 2 data and methodology 2 1 data three partitioned satellite based et products two precipitation datasets the extent of irrigated lands hid and beneficial irrigation

gridded products of time series of aei from 1900 to 2005 here the final version from hyde source involving only irrigated lands was used hid is available at https mygeohub org publications 8 2 the validation of hid dataset through comparison with other products was given in appendix b 2 1 2 2 beneficial irrigation efficiency bie jӓgermeyr et al 2015 produced a global spatial distribution map of beneficial irrigation efficiency which considers the impacts of both crop types 14 crop functional types and irrigation systems three types including surface sprinkler and drip averaged from 1980 to 2009 using lpjml model taking crop transpiration as beneficial beneficial irrigation efficiency was defined as the ratio of transpiration to withdrawal sharing the same definition with irrigation efficiency brouwer et al 1989 all the datasets were converted to 0 25 spatial resolution and annual time scale across the globe for the following calculation and analysis 2 2 method 2 2 1 water withdrawal water consumption and return flow estimation water withdrawal was estimated as satellite based transpiration e t divided by beneficial irrigation efficiency bie water consumption was calculated from the difference between satellite based et and precipitation p with et aggregated from transpiration e t soil evaporation e s and canopy interception e i return flow was estimated as the difference between water withdrawal and water consumption all irrigation related variables were estimated in major irrigation areas mia defined as cells where more than 20 of the land area is equipped for irrigation siebert et al 2015 water withdrawal w w km3 water consumption w c km3 and return flow w rf km3 were estimated as 1 w w e t irr f eff b a h 2 w c et irr p a h 3 w rf w w w c where e t irr and et irr mm represent crop transpiration and total actual evapotranspiration from irrigated lands respectively f denotes precipitation related adjustment coefficient and is calculated as et p et to exclude precipitation induced transpiration eff b is beneficial irrigation efficiency a h ha is the area equipped for irrigation aei p mm is precipitation from cru and gpcc satellite based gridded et and its components however came from mixed land use including not only irrigated crops but also other vegetation and bare soil therefore et e t from irrigated land was estimated using an irrigation contribution factor which could be obtained through the comparison between mia cells and non mia cells fig 2a 4 e t i r r i e t m i a i e t n o n m i a 1 θ i r r i θ i r r i where e t i r r i e t m i a i and θ i r r i are et value from irrigated crops et value from mixed land use and irrigation contribution factor of the ith mia cell in a domain see fig 1 for the definition respectively e t n o n m i a denotes average et value from all non mia cells in the same domain 5 θ i r r i e t m i a i e t n o n m i a e t m i a i where etmia i and θirr i are the et value and irrigation contribution factor of the ith mia cell in a domain respectively etnon mia with average mark denotes the average et value of all non mia cells in the same domain n is the number of mia cells in the domain the calculation of et irr was the same as that of etirr for the conditions that θirr 0 we assumed that all et et came from irrigated crop and soil thus etirr et irr was calculated as et et divided by the proportion of aei in a cell given the dispersed geographic locations of mia and high heterogeneity in climate the calculations were conducted in different domains then aggregated to global scale for avoiding improper comparison between mia and non mia cells from extremely different climates fig 1 what is more four hot spot irrigated areas western united states wus northwest india ni north china plain ncp and central asia ca were selected for detailed analysis 2 2 2 the theory of water savings calculation under traditional flooding irrigation there exists linear relationship between crop yield transpiration and irrigation water use despite the relationships differ from place to place due to varying soil nutrition climate and management conditions howell 1990 burt et al 2001 liao et al 2008 di et al 2019 given the knowledge the increase of crop transpiration is necessarily complying with the increase of irrigation water use meanwhile soil evaporation and return flow are increasing at the same time because water is evenly applied to crop and soil therefore it is reasonable to assume that under traditional flooding irrigation crop transpiration beneficial water consumption w b is positively and linearly related to soil evaporation non beneficial water consumption w nb and return flow w rf fig 2b under water saving irrigation however the relationship between crop transpiration and soil evaporation return flow is probably different with that under traditional flooding irrigation on one hand the correlation between crop transpiration and soil evaporation hereafter called w b w nb relationship would be much weaker on the other hand the linear relationship between crop transpiration and return flow hereafter called w b w rf relationship is largely uncertain and waiting for investigation this is because 1 some water saving technologies mainly work on reducing soil evaporation rather than return flow e g soil mulching lots of literatures documented that soil mulching is the most widely used water saving technologies in some regions such as china and india qin et al 2015 sun et al 2020 other water saving technologies can reduce soil evaporation and return flow simultaneously e g sprinkler and drip irrigation but their application is quite limited due to high capital investment polak et al 1997 2 water is also heavily percolated in the process of transportation from river to the field it is reported that canals waste up 30 50 of total volume of water transported according to different locations and management mohammadi et al 2019 additionally improper management such as more irrigation times inadequate maintenance and emitter clogging can greatly lower on farm efficiency of sprinkler and drip irrigation levidow et al 2014 therefore by comparison of different w b w nb relationship under two irrigation modes the water savings from reducing soil evaporation can be estimated we further investigate the new w b w rf relationship under water saving irrigation and estimate the water savings from the change of return flow accordingly 2 2 3 estimation of area induced changes in irrigation water use two scenarios irrigated lands varied s vary and irrigated lands fixed s fix were designed to explore the irrigation change induced by area change in s vary irrigated lands changed every five years according to hid datasets 1980 irrigated lands used for estimating irrigation in 1980 1984 and 1985 for 1985 1989 1990 for 1990 1994 1995 for 1995 1999 2000 for 2000 2004 and 2005 for 2005 to the end of study period in s fix 1980 irrigated lands were used to estimate irrigation in all years thus the area induced irrigation change c a was calculated as 6 c a w svary 2010s w sfix 2010s w svary 2010s w svary 1980s 100 where w svary 2010s and w sfix 2010s represent water flows withdrawal consumption or return flow averaged for the 2010s 2010 2018 under s vary and s fix scenarios respectively w svary 1980s represents the water flows averaged for the 1980s 1980 1989 under s vary scenario 2 2 4 calculation of water savings at field and regional scale to calculate water savings firstly water consumption was divided into beneficial essentially transpiration and non beneficial essentially soil evaporation water consumption canopy interception was excluded because satellite based canopy interception is obtained from only precipitation rather than overhead irrigation we further assumed that 5 25 of return flow was percolated into saline aquifers thus can be seen as loss non recoverable the lower boundary was determined by the proportion of land salinized due to irrigation fao 2010 and the upper boundary was defined by a latest global dataset of groundwater salinity measurements thorslund and van vliet 2020 according to this dataset globally approximate 75 of groundwater in major irrigation areas mia was considered suitable for irrigation as the measured electrical conductivity is less than 2500 μs cm https mrccc org au wp content uploads 2013 10 water quality salinity standards pdf secondly it was necessary to differentiate water savings at field scale from that at region scale water savings at field scale was defined as the sum of saved water from non beneficial water consumption and all return flow while water savings at region scale was defined as the sum of saved water from non beneficial water consumption and non recoverable return flow percolating to saline aquifers 7 saving field σ w nb σ w rf σ w nb ti w nb si σ w rf ti w rf si 8 saving region σ w nb a σ w rf σ w nb ti w nb si a σ w rf ti w rf si where saving field and saving region are the accumulated 40 years water savings from the 1980s to 2010s at field and region scales respectively w nb si and w rf si are non beneficial water consumption and return flow from water saving irrigation w nb ti and w rf ti are non beneficial water consumption and return flow from traditional flooding irrigation w nb is the difference between w nb ti and w nb si and w rf is the difference between w rf ti and w rf si a denotes the proportion of saline groundwater which is not suitable for irrigation the range of a is set to 5 25 based on the water saving theory and following analysis the irrigation mode in newly developed irrigated lands s vary s fix scenario was considered as traditional and that in old irrigated lands s fix scenario was seen as water saving therefore the w b w nb and w b w rf relationships under traditional flooding irrigation mode were compared with those under water saving irrigation mode to estimate water savings 3 results 3 1 comparison of three partitioned satellite based et products fig 3a shows that the three satellite based et partitions agree fairly well at global scale with high correlation coefficients of 0 62 gleam vs pml 0 73 pml vs ntsg and 0 85 gleam vs ntsg respectively on average pml has the highest global average et gleam has the lowest global average et and ntsg is in the middle furthermore gleam and pml could be involved in comparison of et components the components of ntsg are unavailable in spite of the high correlation in total et between the two datasets large differences exist in their three components transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception the biggest inconsistency could be seen for soil evaporation comprising 8 gleam and 34 pml of total et respectively fig 3b this is probably caused by the different algorithms used for soil moisture constraints in gleam and pml models 3

show notable differences for the period 1980 2000s due to the inconsistency in et components fig 4 at global scale pml has the higher estimates of irrigation water flows with around 1500 km3 yr 1 for water withdrawal 700 km3 yr 1 for water consumption and 800 km3 yr 1 for return flow gleam has the lower estimates with about 1100 km3 yr 1 for water withdrawal 400 km3 yr 1 for water consumption and 700 km3 yr 1 for return flow water consumption of ntsg is the highest with about 720 km3 yr 1 at four hot spot irrigation areas gleam has higher estimates of water withdrawal and return flow than pml in western us and north china plain and ntsg has the highest estimates of water consumption in western us and central asia it should be noted that in western us and northwest india there are large discrepancies in estimates of irrigation water flows among different et datasets but the uncertainties are largely reduced in north china plain and central asia this might be attributed to the difficulties in et estimation in complex terrains fig 4 also shows that in comparison with s fix scenario the increase of irrigation water flows in the period 1980 2010s is largely caused by newly developed irrigated lands globally this area induced increase in water withdrawal accounts for 49 gleam and 82 pml of total increase while for water consumption the increase is 56 gleam 94 pml and 71 ntsg of the total increase also the area induced increase in return flow accounts for 46 gleam and 74 pml of the total increase regionally over 30 of increase in irrigation water flows in north china plain is induced by area increase with 34 gleam and 43 pml for water withdrawal 40 gleam 52 pml and 35 ntsg for water consumption and 31 gleam and 43 pml for return flow for central asia this area induced increase in water withdrawal is 47 gleam and 77 pml while 61 gleam 100 pml and 111 ntsg for water consumption and 33 gleam and 54 pml for return flow in western us and northwest india the area induced increase in irrigation water flows shows large discrepancies in estimates from different et datasets with 62 gleam vs 37 pml in western us and 35 gleam vs 97 pml in northwest india for water withdrawal 63 gleam 54 pml vs 59 ntsg in western us and 36 gleam 145 pml vs 64 ntsg in northwest india for water consumption 61 gleam vs 18 pml in western us and 34 gleam vs 83 pml in northwest india for return flow 3 3 global w b w nb and w b w rf relationships under two irrigation modes fig 5a shows the relationships between beneficial and non beneficial w b w nb relationship water consumption in three scenarios with different irrigated lands s vary s fix and s vary s fix there is strong and positive w b w nb relationship r 2 0 86 for gleam and r 2 0 91 for pml in s vary scenario while the correlation becomes much weaker r 2 0 46 for gleam and r 2 0 21 for pml in s fix scenario this finding clearly implies that water saving technologies are mainly applied in old irrigated lands s fix and effectively reduce soil evaporation while those newly developed irrigated lands s vary s fix are still dominant by traditional flooding irrigation r 2 0 95 for gleam and r 2 0 98 for pml therefore the irrigated lands of s fix scenario is seen as water saving while those of s vary s fix scenario can be seen as traditional by comparison the w b w nb relationship of s vary s fix scenario with that of s fix scenario it is estimated that totally 178 km3 gleam or 629 km3 pml water is saved during the past 40 years through reducing soil evaporation in old irrigated lands fig 5b fig 6a shows the relationships between beneficial water consumption and return flow w b w rf correlation in three scenarios with different irrigated lands s vary s fix and s vary s fix similarly strong and positive w b w rf relationship is noted in s vary scenario r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 99 for pml however the w b w rf relationship is also strong in s fix scenario r 2 0 97 for gleam and r 2 0 93 for pml and s vary s fix scenario r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 99 for pml it implies the inefficiency in reducing return flow of water saving technologies contrary to general expectations it is found that more return flow in irrigated lands where water saving technologies are applied when compare the w b w rf relationship of s vary s fix scenario with that of s fix scenario this might be caused by the increase of cropping intensity and the replacement of original crops by water intensive crops which bring more irrigation water demand and in turn more percolation it is estimated that water savings from the change of return flow is 877 km3 gleam or 618 km3 pml implying that global return flow has increased during the 40 years in old irrigated lands in spite of wide application of water saving technologies fig 6b 3 4 regional w b w nb and w b w rf relationships under two irrigation modes at the four hot spot irrigated areas the water saving effect is different fig 7 in western us the relative weak w b w nb relationships r 2 0 37 for gleam and r 2 0 64 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 27 for gleam and r 2 0 56 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 55 for gleam and r 2 0 8 for pml in s vary s fix scenario show that water saving technologies are widely used in all irrigation lands also the w b w rf relationships are weaker in western us than other three regions r 2 0 96 for gleam and r 2 0 7 for pml in s vary and s fix scenarios while r 2 0 82 for gleam and r 2 0 22 for pml in s vary s fix scenario in northwest india the strong w b w nb relationships r 2 0 92 for gleam and r 2 0 7 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 89 for gleam and r 2 0 42 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 88 for gleam and r 2 0 93 for pml in s vary s fix scenario and w b w rf relationships r 2 0 99 for all products and scenarios in all scenarios show that the application of water saving technologies are limited in this region in north china plain the relatively weak w b w nb relationships r 2 0 49 for gleam and r 2 0 87 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 32 for gleam and r 2 0 8 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 81 for gleam and r 2 0 98 for pml in s vary s fix scenario and relative strong w b w rf relationships r 2 0 99 for gleam and r 2 0 95 for pml in s vary and s fix scenario and r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 97 for pml in s vary s fix scenario implies that traditional flooding irrigation is dominant here but soil evaporation is effectively reduced by other methods such as straw mulching qin et al 2015 in central asia water saving technologies might be partly used because of relative weak w b w nb relationships r 2 0 61 for gleam and r 2 0 51 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 6 for gleam and r 2 0 47 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 69 for gleam and r 2 0 71 for pml in s vary s fix scenario and w b w rf relationships r 2 0 95 for gleam and r 2 0 82 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 79 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 71 for gleam and r 2 0 65 for pml in s vary s fix scenario 3 5 water savings assessment at field and regional scale given that water saving technologies are mainly applied on old irrigated lands water savings are estimated only in old irrigated lands across the globe and the four hot spot irrigated areas fig 8 in spite of large difference between gleam and pml estimates results show high consistency in water savings assessment at both globe and four hot spot irrigated areas water savings from non beneficial water consumption are positive implying that water saving technologies reduce soil evaporation conversely water savings from return flow is negative implying increasing return flow despite water saving technologies are widely used as a result water savings is negative at field scale because the accumulated increased return flow is more than the accumulated reduced non beneficial water consumption it means that water saving technologies fail to save water at field scale as all return flow is considered as loss however if most return flow percolating into fresh aquifers is seen as beneficial water savings become positive over globe and four hot spot irrigated areas which means that water saving technologies do save water at regional scale meanwhile accumulated increased beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeds the water savings at regional scale in the four decades this explains the paradox between wide application of water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage over globe in spite of more return flow in irrigated lands it does not mean the recovery of water table this is because 1 more irrigation water is needed from newly developed irrigated lands and the increasing beneficial water consumption 2 irrigation water was probably from deep aquifer withdrawal but it recharged to shallow aquifers and caused higher depletion rate in deep aquifers feng et al 2013 4 discussions 4 1 satellite based method reliability and uncertainty previous studies using agro hydrological models report that irrigation water consumption ranging from 800 to 1600 km3 yr 1 and water withdrawal from 1500 to 3000 km3 yr 1 fig 9 moreover on global scale irrigation water consumption accounts for 50 of water withdrawal gleeson 2017 which fits the values found by this study although our study has lower estimates compared to other studies we think the biases are acceptable because 1 our estimation is only conducted in cells where more than 20 of area is equipped with irrigation and 2 some small irrigated areas are ignored due to the coarse spatial resolution among the three products pml and ntsg estimates are the highest while gleam estimates are the lowest in spite of the reasonable global estimation however large uncertainties exist for some regions such as western united states and northwest india besides the influence of complex terrains mentioned above two other factors are considered attributed to the uncertainties one is the algorithm of the satellite based et partitions in pml the soil evaporation fraction f min p e eq 1 is used where p is accumulated precipitation and e eq soil equilibrium evaporation zhang et al 2010a 2010b this soil moisture availability model works well at daily scale and in mediterranean type drylands where available soil moisture continually supports et in a few days after precipitation events at annual scale however pml excessively overestimates soil evaporation because p generally equals et and thereby makes f approaches 1 especially in drylands on the other hand gleam likely underestimates soil evaporation because satellites only observe surface soil moisture which rapidly goes dry in the first stage the second stage evaporation from capillary flow from deep soil moisture sources is neglected by satellite soil moisture lehmann et al 2018 another is the rice farming in northwest india rice is the major crop in northern sub himalayan region which contributes some 15 to india s entire rice production sharma et al 2018 in rice system water is needed in land preparation stage then ponding technique is adopted to keep soil saturated during the entire growth period except for the last 15 days chapagain and hoekstra 2010 it is not clear how satellite deals with soil evaporation in rice fields as free water evaporation or normal evaporation in arable lands however it probably underestimates soil evaporation at the initial stage of rice growth moreover high variations of 50 85 percolation due to climate management soil texture induce large uncertainties in return flow estimation mandal et al 2019 in recent decades the changes of cropping pattern from rice to other crops mainly wheat in this region leads to more uncertainties of return flow estimation bajpai and volavka 2005 ramadas et al 2019 it is recommended to improve the algorithms of satellite based et and the transformation of cropping pattern should be considered in the future 4 2 higher water use efficiency towards more water savings and food security it is reported that water use efficiency for global irrigated lands has significantly increased from 1 52 in 2000 to 1 73 kg m3 in 2014 xue et al 2015 ai et al 2020 meanwhile global cereal production has increased from 2 05 to 2 82 billion tons per year in the same period world bank 2018 given that irrigated agriculture produces about 40 of the world s food fao 2002 it is estimated 21 of increase in irrigation water use from 2000 to 2014 meanwhile our results show only 15 of increase in water withdrawal consumption implying that other factors also contribute to the water savings e g the increase of water use efficiency from cultivar change fertilizer input better management therefore actual water savings would be higher than our estimates if water use efficiency is considered moreover this study shows that globally area induced increase accounts for over 50 of total increase in irrigation water flows from 1980s to 2000s which implies that 20 of increase in cereal production is from newly developed irrigated lands unfortunately the potentials for future increase of cropland expansion is quite limited due to urban encroachment land degradation climate change geographic constraints and the threat of biodiversity loss zabel et al 2019 thus it is recommended that the improvement of water use efficiency would be a better solutions for both water and food insecurity in the future 5 conclusions to explore the paradox in irrigation efficiency on global scale this study estimated global water withdrawal consumption and return flow from irrigated agriculture for the past 40 years using satellite based et partitions for the first time the effects of water saving technologies were quantified across the globe at both field and region scales based on water accounting framework the results showed that global irrigation water flows kept increasing from the 1980s to the 2010s with over 50 of the increase due to newly developed irrigated lands water saving technologies were mainly applied in old irrigated lands while traditional flooding irrigation was still dominant in newly developed irrigated lands water saving technologies effectively reduced soil evaporation but increasing return flow was found in spite of the wide application of these technologies at field scale water saving technologies failed to save water because the accumulated increased return flow was more than the accumulated decreased non beneficial water consumption soil evaporation at regional scale however water was saved as the return flow percolated to fresh aquifers was seen as beneficial rather than loss at the same time accumulated increased beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeded the regional water savings which explains the paradox between wide application of water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage in the future more work was required including exploration of the mechanisms for partitioning satellite based transpiration and evaporation improvement of gridded irrigation efficiency based on crop type and irrigation system and the inclusion of water use

10141,water saving technologies have long been seen as an effective method to reduce irrigation water use and alleviate regional water shortage however growing reports of more severe water shortage and increasing application of water saving technologies across the world have necessitated reassessment of agricultural water saving this study develops a simple method based on satellite based et partitions to estimate water withdrawal water consumption and return flow from the 1980s to 2010s and quantifies water savings across globe and four hot spot irrigated areas at both field and regional scales based on water accounting framework the results show that global irrigation water flows keep increasing from the 1980s to 2010s with over 50 increase from the expansion in irrigated lands while water saving technologies are found mainly applied in originally old irrigated lands traditional flooding irrigation is still dominant in newly developed irrigated lands non beneficial water consumption soil evaporation is effectively reduced by water saving technologies but return flow has increased at the same time at field scale water saving technologies fail to save water because the accumulated increased return flow is more than the accumulated decreased non beneficial water consumption at regional scale however water is saved because the return flow percolated to fresh aquifers is seen as beneficial rather than loss at the same time the accumulated increase of beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeds regional water savings which explains the paradox between wide application of water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage this study provides key new evidence for the paradox of irrigation efficiency and helps reconsidering water saving technologies and their impacts on regional water resources keywords paradox of irrigation efficiency water accounting framework water savings estimation satellite based et partitions data availability global gridded data used in this study are openly available as indicated in section 2 1 1 introduction irrigation is widely considered a major contributor to water scarcity as it is the largest freshwater user with a long criticism of low efficiency especially in water scarce regions perry et al 2009 thus water saving irrigation that aims to reduce inefficient water use and maximizes beneficial crop water use is seen as a basic solution to water scarcity perry et al 2017 paradoxically increase in water scarcity has become common with the growing application of water saving irrigation in recent decades due to the reuse of saved water in the cultivation of more areas higher crop density and more water intensive crops kendy et al 2004 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 scott et al 2014 fishman et al 2015 molle and tanouti 2017 berbel et al 2018 grafton et al 2018 this has changed the current understanding of water saving and moved water saving calculations from field scale to region scale thus a scheme called water accounting has been proposed to reassess irrigation water saving at regional scale based on the new definition of water flows perry 2007 gleick et al 2011 batchelor et al 2017 in water accounting framework irrigation water use is divided into four parts i the beneficial water consumption such as transpiration for crop growth ii the non beneficial water consumption such as evaporation from bare soil and weed transpiration iii the recoverable return flow including water re entering river reservoirs and fresh aquifers iv the non recoverable return flow such as percolation to saline aquifers or outflow to the ocean perry 2007 at region scale recoverable return flow can be reused by other users thus only non beneficial water consumption and non recoverable return flow can be seen as a loss compared to traditional field scale framework in that all return flow is seen as loss the new framework takes more water users into consideration thus calls for a regional scale reassessment of water savings for irrigation although this framework has been successfully applied in some case studies vardon et al 2007 karimi et al 2013a b however global assessment of irrigation water saving at region scale that is based on water accounting framework has not been conducted so far agro hydrological models have traditionally been used to estimate global irrigation water use shiklomanov 2000 wada et al 2011 2014 kummu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 however it is hard to analyze global irrigation water saving at region scale that is based on water accounting framework through traditional agro hydrological models this is because 1 a lot of studies estimate global irrigation in a certain year or a short time period for a fixed irrigated area which hampers assessment of the effect of land expansion on irrigation hanasaki et al 2006 2010 siebert and dӧll 2010 2 most agro hydrological models only calculate net irrigation requirements without accounting for return flow which is critical for assessing regional water saving dӧll and siebert 2002 haddeland et al 2006 siebert and dӧll 2010 haddeland et al 2014 müller et al 2019 3 for those models that do consider deep percolation irrigation systems surface sprinkler and drip are insufficiently represented due to the coarse knowledge on irrigation systems despite their large impact on return flow and groundwater recharge hanasaki et al 2010 wada et al 2014 chen et al 2019 recent boom in partitioned satellite based evapotranspiration et products those partitioning et into evaporation and transpiration provides a chance to assess water saving at both field and region scales based on water accounting framework stoy et al 2019 in this study a simple approach was proposed to estimate irrigation water use water withdrawal water consumption and return flow and divide them into four components beneficial and non beneficial water consumption recoverable and non recoverable return flow using satellite based et partitions and other agricultural datasets jӓgermeyr et al 2015 siebert et al 2015 the novelties of this study include 1 solving the difficulty of return flow estimation from irrigation using a simple method and 2 answering how much irrigation water is saved across the globe at both field and region scales for solving these issues we setup in this study the following objectives 1 estimation of water withdrawal water consumption and return flow from the 1980s to 2010s across the globe and four hot spot irrigation areas and 2 investigation of water saving from irrigation at field and region scales in the past four decades the results of the study will strengthen our understanding about the change in irrigation across the globe and provide different perspectives on water governance 2 data and methodology 2 1 data three partitioned satellite based et products two precipitation datasets the extent of irrigated lands hid and beneficial irrigation efficiency bie were used to estimate water withdrawal water consumption and return flow for irrigation the spatiotemporal resolutions of these datasets were listed in table 1 and brief descriptions were provided afterwards 2 1 1 satellite based et partitions global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam gleam uses the priestley taylor approach to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet

research unit cru and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc two precipitation datasets cru ts v4 03 and gpcc v2018 were used to estimate water consumption and water withdrawal due to long

gridded products of time series of aei from 1900 to 2005 here the final version from hyde source involving only irrigated lands was used hid is available at https mygeohub org publications 8 2 the validation of hid dataset through comparison with other products was given in appendix b 2 1 2 2 beneficial irrigation efficiency bie jӓgermeyr et al 2015 produced a global spatial distribution map of beneficial irrigation efficiency which considers the impacts of both crop types 14 crop functional types and irrigation systems three types including surface sprinkler and drip averaged from 1980 to 2009 using lpjml model taking crop transpiration as beneficial beneficial irrigation efficiency was defined as the ratio of transpiration to withdrawal sharing the same definition with irrigation efficiency brouwer et al 1989 all the datasets were converted to 0 25 spatial resolution and annual time scale across the globe for the following calculation and analysis 2 2 method 2 2 1 water withdrawal water consumption and return flow estimation water withdrawal was estimated as satellite based transpiration e t divided by beneficial irrigation efficiency bie water consumption was calculated from the difference between satellite based et and precipitation p with et aggregated from transpiration e t soil evaporation e s and canopy interception e i return flow was estimated as the difference between water withdrawal and water consumption all irrigation related variables were estimated in major irrigation areas mia defined as cells where more than 20 of the land area is equipped for irrigation siebert et al 2015 water withdrawal w w km3 water consumption w c km3 and return flow w rf km3 were estimated as 1 w w e t irr f eff b a h 2 w c et irr p a h 3 w rf w w w c where e t irr and et irr mm represent crop transpiration and total actual evapotranspiration from irrigated lands respectively f denotes precipitation related adjustment coefficient and is calculated as et p et to exclude precipitation induced transpiration eff b is beneficial irrigation efficiency a h ha is the area equipped for irrigation aei p mm is precipitation from cru and gpcc satellite based gridded et and its components however came from mixed land use including not only irrigated crops but also other vegetation and bare soil therefore et e t from irrigated land was estimated using an irrigation contribution factor which could be obtained through the comparison between mia cells and non mia cells fig 2a 4 e t i r r i e t m i a i e t n o n m i a 1 θ i r r i θ i r r i where e t i r r i e t m i a i and θ i r r i are et value from irrigated crops et value from mixed land use and irrigation contribution factor of the ith mia cell in a domain see fig 1 for the definition respectively e t n o n m i a denotes average et value from all non mia cells in the same domain 5 θ i r r i e t m i a i e t n o n m i a e t m i a i where etmia i and θirr i are the et value and irrigation contribution factor of the ith mia cell in a domain respectively etnon mia with average mark denotes the average et value of all non mia cells in the same domain n is the number of mia cells in the domain the calculation of et irr was the same as that of etirr for the conditions that θirr 0 we assumed that all et et came from irrigated crop and soil thus etirr et irr was calculated as et et divided by the proportion of aei in a cell given the dispersed geographic locations of mia and high heterogeneity in climate the calculations were conducted in different domains then aggregated to global scale for avoiding improper comparison between mia and non mia cells from extremely different climates fig 1 what is more four hot spot irrigated areas western united states wus northwest india ni north china plain ncp and central asia ca were selected for detailed analysis 2 2 2 the theory of water savings calculation under traditional flooding irrigation there exists linear relationship between crop yield transpiration and irrigation water use despite the relationships differ from place to place due to varying soil nutrition climate and management conditions howell 1990 burt et al 2001 liao et al 2008 di et al 2019 given the knowledge the increase of crop transpiration is necessarily complying with the increase of irrigation water use meanwhile soil evaporation and return flow are increasing at the same time because water is evenly applied to crop and soil therefore it is reasonable to assume that under traditional flooding irrigation crop transpiration beneficial water consumption w b is positively and linearly related to soil evaporation non beneficial water consumption w nb and return flow w rf fig 2b under water saving irrigation however the relationship between crop transpiration and soil evaporation return flow is probably different with that under traditional flooding irrigation on one hand the correlation between crop transpiration and soil evaporation hereafter called w b w nb relationship would be much weaker on the other hand the linear relationship between crop transpiration and return flow hereafter called w b w rf relationship is largely uncertain and waiting for investigation this is because 1 some water saving technologies mainly work on reducing soil evaporation rather than return flow e g soil mulching lots of literatures documented that soil mulching is the most widely used water saving technologies in some regions such as china and india qin et al 2015 sun et al 2020 other water saving technologies can reduce soil evaporation and return flow simultaneously e g sprinkler and drip irrigation but their application is quite limited due to high capital investment polak et al 1997 2 water is also heavily percolated in the process of transportation from river to the field it is reported that canals waste up 30 50 of total volume of water transported according to different locations and management mohammadi et al 2019 additionally improper management such as more irrigation times inadequate maintenance and emitter clogging can greatly lower on farm efficiency of sprinkler and drip irrigation levidow et al 2014 therefore by comparison of different w b w nb relationship under two irrigation modes the water savings from reducing soil evaporation can be estimated we further investigate the new w b w rf relationship under water saving irrigation and estimate the water savings from the change of return flow accordingly 2 2 3 estimation of area induced changes in irrigation water use two scenarios irrigated lands varied s vary and irrigated lands fixed s fix were designed to explore the irrigation change induced by area change in s vary irrigated lands changed every five years according to hid datasets 1980 irrigated lands used for estimating irrigation in 1980 1984 and 1985 for 1985 1989 1990 for 1990 1994 1995 for 1995 1999 2000 for 2000 2004 and 2005 for 2005 to the end of study period in s fix 1980 irrigated lands were used to estimate irrigation in all years thus the area induced irrigation change c a was calculated as 6 c a w svary 2010s w sfix 2010s w svary 2010s w svary 1980s 100 where w svary 2010s and w sfix 2010s represent water flows withdrawal consumption or return flow averaged for the 2010s 2010 2018 under s vary and s fix scenarios respectively w svary 1980s represents the water flows averaged for the 1980s 1980 1989 under s vary scenario 2 2 4 calculation of water savings at field and regional scale to calculate water savings firstly water consumption was divided into beneficial essentially transpiration and non beneficial essentially soil evaporation water consumption canopy interception was excluded because satellite based canopy interception is obtained from only precipitation rather than overhead irrigation we further assumed that 5 25 of return flow was percolated into saline aquifers thus can be seen as loss non recoverable the lower boundary was determined by the proportion of land salinized due to irrigation fao 2010 and the upper boundary was defined by a latest global dataset of groundwater salinity measurements thorslund and van vliet 2020 according to this dataset globally approximate 75 of groundwater in major irrigation areas mia was considered suitable for irrigation as the measured electrical conductivity is less than 2500 μs cm https mrccc org au wp content uploads 2013 10 water quality salinity standards pdf secondly it was necessary to differentiate water savings at field scale from that at region scale water savings at field scale was defined as the sum of saved water from non beneficial water consumption and all return flow while water savings at region scale was defined as the sum of saved water from non beneficial water consumption and non recoverable return flow percolating to saline aquifers 7 saving field σ w nb σ w rf σ w nb ti w nb si σ w rf ti w rf si 8 saving region σ w nb a σ w rf σ w nb ti w nb si a σ w rf ti w rf si where saving field and saving region are the accumulated 40 years water savings from the 1980s to 2010s at field and region scales respectively w nb si and w rf si are non beneficial water consumption and return flow from water saving irrigation w nb ti and w rf ti are non beneficial water consumption and return flow from traditional flooding irrigation w nb is the difference between w nb ti and w nb si and w rf is the difference between w rf ti and w rf si a denotes the proportion of saline groundwater which is not suitable for irrigation the range of a is set to 5 25 based on the water saving theory and following analysis the irrigation mode in newly developed irrigated lands s vary s fix scenario was considered as traditional and that in old irrigated lands s fix scenario was seen as water saving therefore the w b w nb and w b w rf relationships under traditional flooding irrigation mode were compared with those under water saving irrigation mode to estimate water savings 3 results 3 1 comparison of three partitioned satellite based et products fig 3a shows that the three satellite based et partitions agree fairly well at global scale with high correlation coefficients of 0 62 gleam vs pml 0 73 pml vs ntsg and 0 85 gleam vs ntsg respectively on average pml has the highest global average et gleam has the lowest global average et and ntsg is in the middle furthermore gleam and pml could be involved in comparison of et components the components of ntsg are unavailable in spite of the high correlation in total et between the two datasets large differences exist in their three components transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception the biggest inconsistency could be seen for soil evaporation comprising 8 gleam and 34 pml of total et respectively fig 3b this is probably caused by the different algorithms used for soil moisture constraints in gleam and pml models 3 2 global and regional changes in irrigation water flows for the past 40 years global and regional water withdrawal water consumption and return flow estimated from three satellite based et partitions show notable differences for the period 1980 2000s due to the inconsistency in et components fig 4 at global scale pml has the higher estimates of irrigation water flows with around 1500 km3 yr 1 for water withdrawal 700 km3 yr 1 for water consumption and 800 km3 yr 1 for return flow gleam has the lower estimates with about 1100 km3 yr 1 for water withdrawal 400 km3 yr 1 for water consumption and 700 km3 yr 1 for return flow water consumption of ntsg is the highest with about 720 km3 yr 1 at four hot spot irrigation areas gleam has higher estimates of water withdrawal and return flow than pml in western us and north china plain and ntsg has the highest estimates of water consumption in western us and central asia it should be noted that in western us and northwest india there are large discrepancies in estimates of irrigation water flows among different et datasets but the uncertainties are largely reduced in north china plain and central asia this might be attributed to the difficulties in et estimation in complex terrains fig 4 also shows that in comparison with s fix scenario the increase of irrigation water flows in the period 1980 2010s is largely caused by newly developed irrigated lands globally this area induced increase in water withdrawal accounts for 49 gleam and 82 pml of total increase while for water consumption the increase is 56 gleam 94 pml and 71 ntsg of the total increase also the area induced increase in return flow accounts for 46 gleam and 74 pml of the total increase regionally over 30 of increase in irrigation water flows in north china plain is induced by area increase with 34 gleam and 43 pml for water withdrawal 40 gleam 52 pml and 35 ntsg for water consumption and 31 gleam and 43 pml for return flow for central asia this area induced increase in water withdrawal is 47 gleam and 77 pml while 61 gleam 100 pml and 111 ntsg for water consumption and 33 gleam and 54 pml for return flow in western us and northwest india the area induced increase in irrigation water flows shows large discrepancies in estimates from different et datasets with 62 gleam vs 37 pml in western us and 35 gleam vs 97 pml in northwest india for water withdrawal 63 gleam 54 pml vs 59 ntsg in western us and 36 gleam 145 pml vs 64 ntsg in northwest india for water consumption 61 gleam vs 18 pml in western us and 34 gleam vs 83 pml in northwest india for return flow 3 3 global w b w nb and w b w rf relationships under two irrigation modes fig 5a shows the relationships between beneficial and non beneficial w b w nb relationship water consumption in three scenarios with different irrigated lands s vary s fix and s vary s fix there is strong and positive w b w nb relationship r 2 0 86 for gleam and r 2 0 91 for pml in s vary scenario while the correlation becomes much weaker r 2 0 46 for gleam and r 2 0 21 for pml in s fix scenario this finding clearly implies that water saving technologies are mainly applied in old irrigated lands s fix and effectively reduce soil evaporation while those newly developed irrigated lands s vary s fix are still dominant by traditional flooding irrigation r 2 0 95 for gleam and r 2 0 98 for pml therefore the irrigated lands of s fix scenario is seen as water saving while those of s vary s fix scenario can be seen as traditional by comparison the w b w nb relationship of s vary s fix scenario with that of s fix scenario it is estimated that totally 178 km3 gleam or 629 km3 pml water is saved during the past 40 years through reducing soil evaporation in old irrigated lands fig 5b fig 6a shows the relationships between beneficial water consumption and return flow w b w rf correlation in three scenarios with different irrigated lands s vary s fix and s vary s fix similarly strong and positive w b w rf relationship is noted in s vary scenario r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 99 for pml however the w b w rf relationship is also strong in s fix scenario r 2 0 97 for gleam and r 2 0 93 for pml and s vary s fix scenario r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 99 for pml it implies the inefficiency in reducing return flow of water saving technologies contrary to general expectations it is found that more return flow in irrigated lands where water saving technologies are applied when compare the w b w rf relationship of s vary s fix scenario with that of s fix scenario this might be caused by the increase of cropping intensity and the replacement of original crops by water intensive crops which bring more irrigation water demand and in turn more percolation it is estimated that water savings from the change of return flow is 877 km3 gleam or 618 km3 pml implying that global return flow has increased during the 40 years in old irrigated lands in spite of wide application of water saving technologies fig 6b 3 4 regional w b w nb and w b w rf relationships under two irrigation modes at the four hot spot irrigated areas the water saving effect is different fig 7 in western us the relative weak w b w nb relationships r 2 0 37 for gleam and r 2 0 64 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 27 for gleam and r 2 0 56 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 55 for gleam and r 2 0 8 for pml in s vary s fix scenario show that water saving technologies are widely used in all irrigation lands also the w b w rf relationships are weaker in western us than other three regions r 2 0 96 for gleam and r 2 0 7 for pml in s vary and s fix scenarios while r 2 0 82 for gleam and r 2 0 22 for pml in s vary s fix scenario in northwest india the strong w b w nb relationships r 2 0 92 for gleam and r 2 0 7 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 89 for gleam and r 2 0 42 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 88 for gleam and r 2 0 93 for pml in s vary s fix scenario and w b w rf relationships r 2 0 99 for all products and scenarios in all scenarios show that the application of water saving technologies are limited in this region in north china plain the relatively weak w b w nb relationships r 2 0 49 for gleam and r 2 0 87 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 32 for gleam and r 2 0 8 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 81 for gleam and r 2 0 98 for pml in s vary s fix scenario and relative strong w b w rf relationships r 2 0 99 for gleam and r 2 0 95 for pml in s vary and s fix scenario and r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 97 for pml in s vary s fix scenario implies that traditional flooding irrigation is dominant here but soil evaporation is effectively reduced by other methods such as straw mulching qin et al 2015 in central asia water saving technologies might be partly used because of relative weak w b w nb relationships r 2 0 61 for gleam and r 2 0 51 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 6 for gleam and r 2 0 47 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 69 for gleam and r 2 0 71 for pml in s vary s fix scenario and w b w rf relationships r 2 0 95 for gleam and r 2 0 82 for pml in s vary scenario r 2 0 98 for gleam and r 2 0 79 for pml in s fix scenario and r 2 0 71 for gleam and r 2 0 65 for pml in s vary s fix scenario 3 5 water savings assessment at field and regional scale given that water saving technologies are mainly applied on old irrigated lands water savings are estimated only in old irrigated lands across the globe and the four hot spot irrigated areas fig 8 in spite of large difference between gleam and pml estimates results show high consistency in water savings assessment at both globe and four hot spot irrigated areas water savings from non beneficial water consumption are positive implying that water saving technologies reduce soil evaporation conversely water savings from return flow is negative implying increasing return flow despite water saving technologies are widely used as a result water savings is negative at field scale because the accumulated increased return flow is more than the accumulated reduced non beneficial water consumption it means that water saving technologies fail to save water at field scale as all return flow is considered as loss however if most return flow percolating into fresh aquifers is seen as beneficial water savings become positive over globe and four hot spot irrigated areas which means that water saving technologies do save water at regional scale meanwhile accumulated increased beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeds the water savings at regional scale in the four decades this explains the paradox between wide application of water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage over globe in spite of more return flow in irrigated lands it does not mean the recovery of water table this is because 1 more irrigation water is needed from newly developed irrigated lands and the increasing beneficial water consumption 2 irrigation water was probably from deep aquifer withdrawal but it recharged to shallow aquifers and caused higher depletion rate in deep aquifers feng et al 2013 4 discussions 4 1 satellite based method reliability and uncertainty previous studies using agro hydrological models report that irrigation water consumption ranging from 800 to 1600 km3 yr 1 and water withdrawal from 1500 to 3000 km3 yr 1 fig 9 moreover on global scale irrigation water consumption accounts for 50 of water withdrawal gleeson 2017 which fits the values found by this study although our study has lower estimates compared to other studies we think the biases are acceptable because 1 our estimation is only conducted in cells where more than 20 of area is equipped with irrigation and 2 some small irrigated areas are ignored due to the coarse spatial resolution among the three products pml and ntsg estimates are the highest while gleam estimates are the lowest in spite of the reasonable global estimation however large uncertainties exist for some regions such as western united states and northwest india besides the influence of complex terrains mentioned above two other factors are considered attributed to the uncertainties one is the algorithm of the satellite based et partitions in pml the soil evaporation fraction f min p e eq 1 is used where p is accumulated precipitation and e eq soil equilibrium evaporation zhang et al 2010a 2010b this soil moisture availability model works well at daily scale and in mediterranean type drylands where available soil moisture continually supports et in a few days after precipitation events at annual scale however pml excessively overestimates soil evaporation because p generally equals et and thereby makes f approaches 1 especially in drylands on the other hand gleam likely underestimates soil evaporation because satellites only observe surface soil moisture which rapidly goes dry in the first stage the second stage evaporation from capillary flow from deep soil moisture sources is neglected by satellite soil moisture lehmann et al 2018 another is the rice farming in northwest india rice is the major crop in northern sub himalayan region which contributes some 15 to india s entire rice production sharma et al 2018 in rice system water is needed in land preparation stage then ponding technique is adopted to keep soil saturated during the entire growth period except for the last 15 days chapagain and hoekstra 2010 it is not clear how satellite deals with soil evaporation in rice fields as free water evaporation or normal evaporation in arable lands however it probably underestimates soil evaporation at the initial stage of rice growth moreover high variations of 50 85 percolation due to climate management soil texture induce large uncertainties in return flow estimation mandal et al 2019 in recent decades the changes of cropping pattern from rice to other crops mainly wheat in this region leads to more uncertainties of return flow estimation bajpai and volavka 2005 ramadas et al 2019 it is recommended to improve the algorithms of satellite based et and the transformation of cropping pattern should be considered in the future 4 2 higher water use efficiency towards more water savings and food security it is reported that water use efficiency for global irrigated lands has significantly increased from 1 52 in 2000 to 1 73 kg m3 in 2014 xue et al 2015 ai et al 2020 meanwhile global cereal production has increased from 2 05 to 2 82 billion tons per year in the same period world bank 2018 given that irrigated agriculture produces about 40 of the world s food fao 2002 it is estimated 21 of increase in irrigation water use from 2000 to 2014 meanwhile our results show only 15 of increase in water withdrawal consumption implying that other factors also contribute to the water savings e g the increase of water use efficiency from cultivar change fertilizer input better management therefore actual water savings would be higher than our estimates if water use efficiency is considered moreover this study shows that globally area induced increase accounts for over 50 of total increase in irrigation water flows from 1980s to 2000s which implies that 20 of increase in cereal production is from newly developed irrigated lands unfortunately the potentials for future increase of cropland expansion is quite limited due to urban encroachment land degradation climate change geographic constraints and the threat of biodiversity loss zabel et al 2019 thus it is recommended that the improvement of water use efficiency would be a better solutions for both water and food insecurity in the future 5 conclusions to explore the paradox in irrigation efficiency on global scale this study estimated global water withdrawal consumption and return flow from irrigated agriculture for the past 40 years using satellite based et partitions for the first time the effects of water saving technologies were quantified across the globe at both field and region scales based on water accounting framework the results showed that global irrigation water flows kept increasing from the 1980s to the 2010s with over 50 of the increase due to newly developed irrigated lands water saving technologies were mainly applied in old irrigated lands while traditional flooding irrigation was still dominant in newly developed irrigated lands water saving technologies effectively reduced soil evaporation but increasing return flow was found in spite of the wide application of these technologies at field scale water saving technologies failed to save water because the accumulated increased return flow was more than the accumulated decreased non beneficial water consumption soil evaporation at regional scale however water was saved as the return flow percolated to fresh aquifers was seen as beneficial rather than loss at the same time accumulated increased beneficial water consumption crop transpiration exceeded the regional water savings which explains the paradox between wide application of water saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage in the future more work was required including exploration of the mechanisms for partitioning satellite based transpiration and evaporation improvement of gridded irrigation efficiency based on crop type and irrigation system and the inclusion of water use

10142,in the lower mississippi river basin tailwater recovery twr systems are water conservation practices implemented to mitigate downstream nutrient losses and alleviate groundwater depletion as supplemental irrigation sources this study was conducted to characterize water quality within twr systems and assess the influence of precipitation and fertilizer application events as well as reservoir levee protection on water quality three twr systems were selected and water samples were collected during the growing seasons of 2014 2016 nitrate no3 and dissolved inorganic orthophosphate dip were observed to be significantly lower p 0 001 in reservoirs when compared with twr influent and effluent hence reservoirs demonstrate a vital role in reducing downstream nutrient contribution mean no3 in the reservoirs twr influent and twr effluent was 0 05 0 01 mg l 1 0 10 0 01 mg l 1 and 0 14 0 02 mg l 1 respectively mean dip concentrations in the reservoirs twr influent and twr effluent

reduced on average by 43 compared to the influent water quality was influenced by reservoir levee protection materials especially no3 and dissolved oxygen concentrations which were lower with vegetated protection keywords tailwater recovery influent reservoir tailwater recovery effluent total suspended solids tss nitrate no3 dissolved inorganic orthophosphate dip 1 introduction groundwater has a profound effect on the economy of the mid southern united states as a resource for both agricultural and municipal uses clark et al 2011 the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrva hereafter referred to as the alluvial aquifer is heavily relied on for irrigation in the lower mississippi river basin pimentel et al 2004 clark et al 2011 marston et al 2015 reba and massey 2020 and is one of the primary reasons arkansas is ranked third in the nation for irrigated area usda nass 2014 likewise unsustainable irrigation and limited recharge have contributed to significant cones of depression in the alluvial aquifer particularly in eastern arkansas anrc 2015 moore et al 2015 schrader 2015 though the region receives approximately 1000 mm of precipitation per year the quantity and timing is not always ideal for crops while precipitation during the growing season in the region may vary between 20 and 40 of the annual total brye and pirani 2005 henry et al 2016 the majority of the precipitation occurs in the winter and spring months variable precipitation during the growing season has been unable to sustain profitable crop production in the region in response the state of arkansas irrigates the third largest land area in the us with more than 90 of the water sourced from the alluvial aquifer nass 2019 in an attempt to reduce over reliance on the region s alluvial aquifer producers have shifted towards storing surface water for irrigation purposes to accomplish this constructed on farm storage ofs reservoirs and tailwater recovery twr ditches are being used for runoff capture storage and subsequent reuse as irrigation water gates 2005 prince czarnecki et al 2016 management of the systems includes consideration of erosive processes during filling that typically takes place in the non growing season wren et al 2018 ozeren et al 2020 typically surface runoff from a production field or fields entering a ditch can either be pumped into an ofs or in absence of an ofs left in the ditch thereafter relift pumps can be employed to reuse stored water for subsequent irrigation usda nrcs 2014 apart from general water quantity concerns in this region the mississippi embayment has been scrutinized for its contributions to eutrophication and the hypoxic zone of the gulf of mexico in part due to significant chemical runoff resulting from use of pesticides and fertilizer applications upon agricultural landscapes for extensive row crop production turner and rabalais 2003 moore et al 2007 kröger et al 2012 as a result state nutrient reduction strategies have been implemented by the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force mrwntf to counteract water quality degradation in the region mrwntf 2008 state nutrient reduction strategies allow stakeholder states bordering the mississippi river basin to develop and promote initiatives geared toward reducing nutrient loading into surface water mrwntf 2008 the practice of capturing storing and reusing surface water for irrigation is well documented from ancient times more recently this practice was implemented in the mid southern united states with financial assistance from the u s department of agriculture natural resource conservation service usda nrcs as both water quantity and quality conservation incentive options to producers this is in response to the growing concern of the alluvial aquifer depletion evidenced by the cone of depression reported in the region and water quality degradation usda nrcs 2014 prince czarnecki et al 2016 while the capacity of twr systems to supplement irrigation and alleviate groundwater depletion has been investigated their capacity to mitigate downstream nutrient and sediment loss is still in need of further study the overall objective of this study was to examine water quality characteristics of selected twr systems in northeast arkansas specific objectives were to 1 quantify and compare water quality spatially within twr systems 2 assess the influence of precipitation and fertilizer application events on twr systems water quality and 3 assess the influence of reservoir levee protection materials on ofs reservoir water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description study sites were located in craighead county arkansas southwest of jonesboro fig 1 two of the twr systems gs 1 and gs 2 were next to each other and located at 35 759792 n 90 766225 w and 35 757146 n 90 775324 w respectively tailwater enters the system via a drainage ditch at the northeast and southeast sides of the gs 1 ofs reservoir the gs 1 and gs 2 ofs reservoirs were separated by a ditch and levee excess tailwater from gs 1 flows through gs 2 where it can be captured and stored along with tailwater contributed by a feeder ditch from the south the third system gs 3 is located further south at 35 723914 n 90 818239 w approximately 1 km east of otwell ar gs 3 receives surface water from three drainage ditches entering from multiple directions each system in this study received water from surrounding agricultural fields used for soybean and rice production many of the fields were precision leveled to provide directional flow for surface waters as well as having drain culverts to direct water into ditches fig 2 ditches had been dredged among crop fields to promote optimal drainage with flow directed to the reservoir inflow ditches typically had impoundment structures midstream to elevate the water level so the reservoir inflow pump could move water from the ditch into the reservoir managing water level in the reservoir is a balance between taking advantage of winter and spring precipitation and minimizing levee erosion a general water management scheme is to begin filling reservoirs in january and complete filling by april removal of stored water was facilitated by the use of butterfly valves and piping to transported to surrounding cropland during irrigation events for water transport to more distant cropland irrigation booster pumps were used for adequate pressure and volume to irrigate fields in a timely manner soils in the study area were 56 1 calhoun silt loam 29 6 hillemann silt loam and 14 4 tichnor silt loam according to the usda web soil survey accessed on 14 may 2019 all three sites are part of the lost creek ditch watershed a sub watershed of the cache sub basin with eventual drainage into bayou deview average annual rainfall for the area obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration was approximately 1222 mm with roughly less than half falling during the april through september timeframe prevailing weather is characterized by long hot summers and relatively cool winters typical of the humid mid southern us 2 2 site history gs 1 is the newest constructed system sampled in this study completed in 2011 it has a 45 ha reservoir with an average water depth of 2 75 m at full capacity refuse concrete rubble from a nearby building site was distributed along the upper portion of the levee to reduce erosion from wave action prevailing winds for the area generally originate from the southwest to the northeast the reservoir had three inflow pumps moving water from the bordering ditch into the reservoir water was carried to the surrounding cropland by three outflow pipes or discharged back into the ditch and moved to a relift pump for release into cropland gs 1 had one main ditch and one feeder ditch that supplied tailwater to the reservoir inflows the reservoir irrigated 261 ha with additional irrigation from groundwater wells the estimated percent irrigated area captured by the reservoir in gs 1 was 86 gs 2 was the oldest constructed system sampled in this study completed in 1980 the 85 ha reservoir had an average water depth of 2 m at full capacity the reservoir was drained and remodified in 2013 and 2014 originally timber was allowed to stand inside the reservoir but was eventually pushed over and windrowed in the bottom to serve as wave breaks levee banks were protected with vegetation rather than refuse cement fill inside the main levee that forms the reservoir levees were raised though not connected to serve as sacrificial levees to reduce the fetch length of the water surface and reduce wave action on the surrounding levees gs 2 had one inflow site and two outflow sites it borders the reservoir of gs 1 to the west and receives its tailwater discharge gs 2 captured water lost from gs 1 as well as tailwater from surrounding cropland delivered by two feeder ditches adjacent cropland totaling 437 ha was irrigated and managed as the primary watershed to fill the reservoir irrigation was augmented with groundwater wells runoff from two downstream fields does not cycle back into the reservoir with percent irrigated area captured by gs 2 being 92 gs 3 was constructed in two phases the first reservoir 40 ha was constructed in 1999 and a second 21 ha reservoir was added in 2007 to meet increased irrigation demands reservoirs were separated by a center levee with a pipe allowing water to move freely between the two systems the reservoirs had an average depth of 2 5 m at full capacity refuse concrete rubble from a nearby building site was used to line the top of the levees 2 m to protect them against wave action gs 3 had four inflow sites supplied by one main ditch that was itself supplied by three feeder ditches there were two outflows from the reservoir piping the water to surrounding cropland gs 3 partially irrigates 601 ha and was augmented by groundwater pumping water was recaptured from 83 of the irrigated contributing field area 2 3 water sampling design water samples were collected during three consecutive 2014 2016 growing seasons of rice and soybeans beginning in early april and ending in late august sampling dates were based on when water was available in the system and in response to management of the production fields samples were collected in response to precipitation events and after drawdown defined as the release of standing water from rice fields in the absence of these types of events samples were still collected within 3 weeks to ensure no data gap occurred and are referred to as no movement in total 29 sampling events 8 8 and 13 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively were collected for this study sampling was also secondarily designed to capture responses to fertilizer applications fertilizer application dates for the study period for all systems are presented in table 1 while water sampling events segregated into field water movement scenarios are shown in table 2 sampling sites were identified in both ditches and reservoirs to represent different components within each twr system fig 2 not all water in the ditches of the ofs system was delivered into the reservoir with some portion of the water bypassing the water relift and providing downstream users with water influent sampling sites were those that were within ditches and upstream of water relift effluent sites were those that were within ditches that moved water out of the ofs system samples were identified as influent effluent or reservoir to distinguish entering exiting and storage components respectively within each ofs system to collect grab water samples a prewashed 1 l polyethylene bottle was attached to an adjustable 5 m telescoping fiberglass pole a single grab sample was collected just beneath the water surface at approximately 1 m from the shore at each site for every sampling event prewashed sample and transport bottles were immediately rinsed with sample at collection to avoid cross contamination each grab sample was immediately transferred to a labeled 1 l polyethylene bottle a total of 533 samples were collected for the entire study duration with 292 170 and 71 collected from systems influent reservoir and effluent respectively deliberate sample pouring to reduce agitation was used to lessen impact on dissolved oxygen do readings in the field a ysi professional plus multi probe ysi incorporated yellow springs oh was inserted into the transport bottle to assess temperature do and ph the multi probe was thoroughly rinsed with di water between samples to avoid possible cross contamination each grab sample was stored on ice and transported to arkansas state university for further chemical analysis 2 4 water sample analyses all water samples were analyzed as quickly as possible upon arrival at the laboratory samples were stored at approximately 4 c unless being immediately analyzed nutrients were analyzed within 24 48 h of arrival while total suspended solids tss were processed within 7 days samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm pore diameter s pak membrane filter millipore sas molsheim france and allowed to reach laboratory temperature before conducting analysis dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and nitrate were analyzed using molybdenum blue colorimetric reaction methods described by murphy and riley 1962 and the cadmium reduction powder pillow method american public health association apha 2005 respectively on 25 ml aliquot samples analysis was performed using a hach dr 890 colorimeter loveland co usa and colorimeter nutrient test kits method detection limits for dip and nitrate were 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively while sample absorbances were read at 610 nm and 520 nm respectively standard curves were prepared and absorbance was regressed with concentration at 99 in addition the sample analysis methodology adhered to laboratory qa qc procedures where a di water blank was furnished with every sample run 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using minitab statistical software version 18 minitab inc u s a mixed effect model of analysis of variance where individual farms were treated as a random effect factor was performed to assess if differences existed among the mean values of water quality parameters nitrate dip tss temperature do and ph estimated among twr influent effluent and reservoir components mixed effect model of analysis of variance helps to mask out and account for variability attributed to individual systems this variability having been accounted for in the model does not influence the conclusion drawn on the parameter statistics the same model was also used to assess differences in water quality matrices within twr system components during water movement and fertilizer application events where differences existed a bonferroni pairwise multiple mean comparisons test was performed for treatment mean separation data were checked for normality using the shapiro wilk test likewise homogeneity of variance was tested using bartlett s test for data with initial normal distribution or levene s test for any continuous distribution where data violated the normality assumption test e g nitrate and dip data were log transformed to validate the parametric anova statistical assumption however where data still failed normality parametric test assumptions after transformation a generalized linear mixed model glm procedure was performed to determine differences among treatments likewise the glm procedure was performed to determine differences in water quality matrices between ofs levee protection materials alpha was set to 0 05 for all tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 component water quality water quality variations occurred within the studied twr systems components table 3 over the entire growing season no reduction in mean concentrations of nitrate and dip was observed in the twr influent and effluent however a significant p 0 001 reduction in concentrations of both nutrients was observed in the reservoir when compared with mean concentrations observed in the influent and effluent table 3 observed results were contrary to those reported by moore et al 2015 from twr systems in poinsett county northeast arkansas with no significant differences measured among the three twr system components lower nitrate concentrations observed in the reservoir versus the twr influent and effluent could possibly be a result of dilution or denitrification in the reservoir karki et al 2018 additionally an increase in water depth and residence time could also have allowed for more biogeochemical activities associated with nutrient transformation omer et al 2018a with regard to dip inundation created by the reservoirs is reported to enhance biogeochemical processes of phosphorus p sorption by facilitating fine soil particle deposition which further plays a vital role in enhancing p sorption within systems mcdowell et al 2004 iseyemi et al 2018 studies by durand et al 2011 and smukler et al 2012 demonstrated that changes in nutrient concentrations between aquatic system influent and effluent can be attributed to system size depth and hydraulic residence time smukler et al 2012 reported an increase of about 40 in nitrate concentration between twr influent and effluent in an organic farm in california and attributed the increase to the small size of the twr system and a reduced hydraulic residence time omer et al 2018a reported how interaction between water depth and residence time could have an effect on nutrient reduction efficiency of twr systems they observed twr system performance increased with a concomitant increase in residence time and water depth likewise the study suggested smaller sized systems would perform better with lower depth while larger sized systems would perform better with greater depth like omer et al 2018a durand et al 2011 emphasized the importance of both increased residence time and reduced water depth upon increased nitrate removal but with attention upon system management and environmental factors concentrations of nitrate observed in all components were comparable to mean concentrations of 0 10 0 30 mg l 1 reported in twr systems by omer et al 2017 2018b however mean nitrate concentration observed in the current study s ofs was lower than concentrations 0 9 3 6 mg l 1 reported by moore et al 2015 likewise mean influent and effluent dip concentrations observed in this study were higher than concentrations 0 33 0 44 mg l 1 reported by moore et al 2015 on the other hand reported concentrations in the ofs reported by moore et al 2015 0 22 0 45 mg l 1 were comparable to the mean dip concentration observed in the ofs in the current study a lack of difference between influent and effluent nutrient concentrations may have been due to shorter residence times for water at both twr influent and effluent compared to that of the ofs according to omer et al 2018a nutrient concentrations are more likely to decrease in the water column by physical processes i e settling and with longer retention times ultimately allowing for additional biological transformation on average do was significantly higher p 0 001 in the ofs reservoir compared to similar concentrations observed at both twr influent and effluent respectively table 5 higher do concentration in the ofs compared to twr systems influent and effluent may have resulted from at least two conjoined twr ditches connected to the ofs whose water movement and discharge was believed to mix with the water column in the reservoir this mixing was observed based on visual observation of water transfer between these feeder ditches and the reservoir while depth and residence time could have resulted in anoxic conditions in the reservoir to enhance denitrification karki et al 2018 higher do concentration may have limited this process particularly during water movement from the feeder ditches this was apparently not the case in this study because the mean nitrate concentration was observed to be lower in the reservoir despite the expected limited denitrification process in the reservoir when compared to the other twr system components on the other hand higher do concentrations were believed to have supported increased biological activities further enhancing the generation of sediment organic matter som usda nrcs 2019 within the reservoir to enhance p transformation depending on soil types and p concentration in the water column and transported soil som has been reported to keep p sorption sites in sediments relatively constant and more readily available as well as reducing the equilibrium ph dependence of sediment p sorption activities hiradate and uchida 2004 chintala et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 this may have been the case in the current study since ph was relatively similar across all twr components table 3 thus a lower dip concentration was measured in the ofs compared to that of other twr components total suspended solids concentrations were comparable across twr components with mean concentrations ranging between 62 and 108 mg l 1 table 3 observed mean tss concentrations in the current study were slightly greater than mean concentrations reported by omer et al 2017 2018b in twr systems in mississippi 50 90 mg l 1 mean tss in the ofs 61 84 mg l 1 was significantly lower when compared to influent 107 88 mg l 1 but tss in ofs was comparable with that of the effluent however the tss of the effluent was also not significantly different with that of the influent table 3 it was anticipated that tss would be lower in the ofs due to impoundment of water increased hydraulic residence time and greater water depth all which facilitate solids settling from the water column mcdowell et al 2004 iseyemi et al 2018 however wetzel 2001 noted shallow reservoirs with depths 5 7 m may have limited sedimentation resulting from poor thermal stratification thornton 1990 additionally mentioned constraint in sedimentation processes in reservoirs owing to continual longitudinal gradient mixing of water albeit referencing more elaborate riverine zones nonetheless current results were comparable to studies by omer et al 2018a and carruth et al 2014 who reported no significant difference in mean tss concentrations between and among components from twr systems in mississippi thus twr systems may actually be limited in their capacities to mitigate suspended solids even with the ability to capture and hold water on the landscape and collect loads of solids that would have otherwise moved downstream omer et al 2018a more specifically omer et al 2018a reported a 21 reduction efficiency of tss concentrations in twr systems mean water temperature was marginally higher p 0 05 in the ofs reservoir but was comparable with mean water temperature observed in both twr influent and effluent table 3 although observed water temperatures were lower than those reported by moore et al 2015 from twr systems in northeast arkansas warmer irrigation water temperatures than the typical groundwater temperature of 14 c are known to be advantageous to proper rice seedling vegetative growth the lower temperature of groundwater irrigation water is reported to cause cold shock to rice seedlings and such abiotic stress is known to account for about 50 of world wide reductions in average yield in rice production mahajan and tuteja 2005 as observed for water temperature water ph was also marginally higher p 0 05 in the twr reservoir but was comparable to mean ph observed in both twr influent and effluent table 3 observed ph values in the current study were similar to the ph range of 7 0 8 5 reported by moore et al 2015 from twr systems in northeast arkansas likewise observed ph values were similar to those reported by andrews et al 2005 signifying a typical ph range reported for surface waters in the lower mississippi river basin 3 2 management events water quality sampling events that segregated with regard to water movement did not influence water quality with the exception of temperature in the twr systems in the current study although mean nitrate concentration in the twr systems was significantly higher p 0 001 during precipitation sampling events when compared with periods with a lack of water movement events the concentration was comparable to those observed during the end of season drawdown table 4 however there was no significant difference in nitrate concentrations observed during both lack of water movement and the end of season drawdown events table 4 likewise mean dip concentration was comparable in the twr systems during precipitation and lack of water movement but was significantly higher p 0 001 during the drawdown events compared to the precipitation events however there was no significant difference in the mean dip concentrations between lack of water movement and the end of season drawdown events table 4 precipitation can be a significant source of variation in surface water quality in aquatic systems depending on soil type vegetation cover agronomic management and intensity and duration of rainfalls martin and holabaugh 2002 liu et al 2014 this is particularly true in agricultural landscapes when precipitation closely follows fertilizer application davidson et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 a lack of difference in nitrate concentrations in the twr systems with respect to precipitation in the current study may be attributed to precipitation lag time following fertilizer applications there were a number of intense precipitation events that triggered water sampling during the study period particularly during the 2016 growing season also intensive precipitation events during the non growing seasons especially in early spring and late fall present the potential to trigger more nutrient runoff compared to those during growing seasons with greater ground cover rainfall during non growing periods lacking vegetation cover have been shown to trigger the release of residual nutrients from soil into the water column davidson et al 2012 carruth et al 2014 omer et al 2018b while it was expected that nitrate concentrations were similar in the twr systems during precipitation and the other water movement sampling periods it was also anticipated that dip and tss would increase during precipitation heavy rainfall events as precipitation often disturbs and mixes the water column subsequently causing p and tss resuspension chapra 2008 omer et al 2018a zhou et al 2015 reported a higher p concentration in a twr ofs during a storm runoff event when compared to a more typical rain event and attributed this to sediment disruption during heavy storms although intensive precipitation events are expected to disrupt p sorption and trigger more dip release into the water column release of p into solution is ultimately dependent upon soil p status regardless of the amount and the intensity of the rainfall hahna et al 2012 although not measured in the current study low soil p concentrations could have contributed to the lack of differences found in dip concentrations during precipitation and other water movement sampling events on average water temperature was significantly lower p 0 001 during the drawdown sampling events compared to temperatures observed during precipitation and no water movement events table 4 this was somewhat surprising because drawdown events were in august which is usually the hottest month of the growing season however a study by rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 on vegetated and unvegetated lowland rivers reported a strong negative relationship between do and water temperature but emphasized the relationship can be influenced by many factors the factors identified were the intensity and distribution of rainfall the rate and amount of runoff and the travel rates and travel distances of floodwaters a lower temperature observed during drawdown events may be a result of increased floodwater flow during the end of season drawdown events triggering higher do concentrations although do concentrations were not significantly different in the twr systems during all water movement sampling events they were highest during the drawdown in the current study table 4 3 3 fertilizer events water quality water quality varied in the twr systems during fertilizer application events in the current study mean nitrate concentrations in the twr systems were comparable during pre and post first and second fertilizer application events with concentrations of 0 08 0 3 mg l 1 0 12 0 3 mg l 1 0 06 0 3 mg l 1 respectively this reflected good n management within the growing systems according to dabney et al 2006 and mitsch et al 2001 n deployment from agriculture production acreages can be managed and prevented by in field agronomic practices including fertilizer application irrigation management tillage practices vegetative barrier and cover cropping mean dip concentrations were significantly different p 0 001 across all fertilizer application events with the highest concentration observed during pre fertilizer application sampling events and the lowest concentration observed during post second fertilizer application sampling events table 5 soil sediments coupled with precipitation can be a significant source of dip bridgham et al 2001 zhou et al 2015 this is due to a strong affinity between dip and soil sediments house and denison 2000 bridgham et al 2001 zamparas and zacharias 2014 and a strong relationship between these two variables and intensive precipitation events yuan et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 omer et al 2018b however it was not the case in the current study because tss was not influenced by water movement table 4 and was significantly lower during pre fertilizer application events table 5 instead higher dip during pre fertilizer application was likely attributable to biosolid application in the early growing season prior to inorganic fertilizer application 3 4 levee protection water quality water quality was influenced by reservoir levee protection materials in the current study while temperature dip and tss were not influenced by ofs levee protection materials on average nitrate and do concentrations were significantly lower p 0 001 in vegetated protected ofs compared to ofs with concrete levee protection table 6 according to bastviken et al 2003 n transformation processes in aquatic systems are generally influenced by soil sediment conditions macrophyte and microbial communities while long term n removal in aquatic systems is mostly facilitated by denitrifying bacteria present in anoxic sediments of aquatic systems seitzinger 2008 vegetation can also provide for significant biotic sorption of nitrate in systems deaver et al 2005 kröger et al 2009 moore et al 2010 thus a significantly lower concentration of nitrate could be attributed to vegetation providing a biotic environment for additional n transformation mean do concentration was significantly lower p 0 001 in vegetation protected ofs compared to concrete rubble protected ofs table 6 a significantly lower do in vegetation protected ofs may be a result of oxygen utilization by macrophyte associated microbial communities which usually furnish additional surface area for denitrification processes in many aquatic systems eriksson and weisner 1999 körner 1999 similar to results obtained for nitrate and do water ph was also significantly lower p 0 001 in the vegetation protected ofs compared to concrete rubble protected ofs table 6 a significantly higher ph in concrete rubble protected reservoirs could be attributed to continuous curing of concrete debris subsequently increasing the ph while releasing calcium hydroxide as a by product of cement hydration šiler et al 2016 while it may be surprising that dip concentration was not influenced by the vegetation protection of the reservoir in the current study many studies reddy et al 1995 bridgham et al 2001 deaver et al 2005 moore et al 2010 kröger and moore 2011 iseyemi et al 2018 on p transformation in aquatic systems have demonstrated vegetation in systems only offer short term biological p sorption and limited p removal efficiency 30 depending on p concentration in water soil p concentration soil ph and soil type when compared to biotic removal of n in aquatic systems likewise similar tss concentrations in vegetation protected ofs and concrete rubble protected ofs table 6 may be attributed to limited vegetative surface area exchange with system water vegetation cover was limited only on the banks unlike wetlands and ditches with established vegetation and root systems providing additional opportunities for sedimentation within systems 4 conclusion water quality varied spatially within twr systems in the lower mississippi river basin nutrients were observed to be significantly lower in twr ofs when compared with twr influent and effluent from management systems monitoring of system responses to production and weather demonstrated ofs play a vital role in reducing nutrients in farms that can implement twr systems as a water conservation measure although water routing and hydraulic residence time in ditches affects nutrient reduction capability from twr effluent bypassing relifts installation of adjustable weirs or risers at system outflows would be expected to additionally help optimize such opportunities ofs levee protection materials water movement and fertilizer application events were found to each influence water quality variables within twr and should be given careful consideration by land managers and producers when implementing twr systems on production landscapes ultimately this study will help inform modeling of water resources in the lower mississippi river

10142,in the lower mississippi river basin tailwater recovery twr systems are water conservation practices implemented to mitigate downstream nutrient losses and alleviate groundwater depletion as supplemental irrigation sources this study was conducted to characterize water quality within twr systems and assess the influence of precipitation and fertilizer application events as well as reservoir levee protection on water quality three twr systems were selected and water samples were collected during the growing seasons of 2014 2016 nitrate no3 and dissolved inorganic orthophosphate dip were observed to be significantly lower p 0 001 in reservoirs when compared with twr influent and effluent hence reservoirs demonstrate a vital role in reducing downstream nutrient contribution mean no3 in the reservoirs twr influent and twr effluent was 0 05 0 01 mg l 1 0 10 0 01 mg l 1 and 0 14 0 02 mg l 1 respectively mean dip concentrations in the reservoirs twr influent and twr effluent was 0 39 0 03 mg l 1 0 96 0 04 mg l 1 and 1 03 0 08 mg l 1 respectively mean no3 concentration was also significantly lower p 0 001 in the reservoir with levees protected with vegetation 0 02 0 01 mg l 1 compared to 0 06 0 01 mg l 1 reservoirs with levees protected with concrete rubble total suspended solids tss of the influent and reservoir were significantly different with the reservoir tss reduced on average by 43 compared to the influent water quality was influenced by reservoir levee protection materials especially no3 and dissolved oxygen concentrations which were lower with vegetated protection keywords tailwater recovery influent reservoir tailwater recovery effluent total suspended solids tss nitrate no3 dissolved inorganic orthophosphate dip 1 introduction groundwater has a profound effect on the economy of the mid southern united states as a resource for both agricultural and municipal uses clark et al 2011 the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrva hereafter referred to as the alluvial aquifer is heavily relied on for irrigation in the lower mississippi river basin pimentel et al 2004 clark et al 2011 marston et al 2015 reba and massey 2020 and is one of the primary reasons arkansas is ranked third in the nation for irrigated area usda nass 2014 likewise unsustainable irrigation and limited recharge have contributed to significant cones of depression in the alluvial aquifer particularly in eastern arkansas anrc 2015 moore et al 2015 schrader 2015 though the region receives approximately 1000 mm of precipitation per year the quantity and timing is not always ideal for crops while precipitation during the growing season in the region may vary between 20 and 40 of the annual total brye and pirani 2005 henry et al 2016 the majority of the precipitation occurs in the winter and spring months variable precipitation during the growing season has been unable to sustain profitable crop production in the region in response the state of arkansas irrigates the third largest land area in the us with more than 90 of the water sourced from the alluvial aquifer nass 2019 in an attempt to reduce over reliance on the region s alluvial aquifer producers have shifted towards storing surface water for irrigation purposes to accomplish this constructed on farm storage ofs reservoirs and tailwater recovery twr ditches are being used for runoff capture storage and subsequent reuse as irrigation water gates 2005 prince czarnecki et al 2016 management of the systems includes consideration of erosive processes during filling that typically takes place in the non growing season wren et al 2018 ozeren et al 2020 typically surface runoff from a production field or fields entering a ditch can either be pumped into an ofs or in absence of an ofs left in the ditch thereafter relift pumps can be employed to reuse stored water for subsequent irrigation usda nrcs 2014 apart from general water quantity concerns in this region the mississippi embayment has been scrutinized for its contributions to eutrophication and the hypoxic zone of the gulf of mexico in part due to significant chemical runoff resulting from use of pesticides and fertilizer applications upon agricultural landscapes for extensive row crop production turner and rabalais 2003 moore et al 2007 kröger et al 2012 as a result state nutrient reduction strategies have been implemented by the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force mrwntf to counteract water quality degradation in the region mrwntf 2008 state nutrient reduction strategies allow stakeholder states bordering the mississippi river basin to develop and promote initiatives geared toward reducing nutrient loading into surface water mrwntf 2008 the practice of capturing storing and reusing surface water for irrigation is well documented from ancient times more recently this practice was implemented in the mid southern united states with financial assistance from the u s department of agriculture natural resource conservation service usda nrcs as both water quantity and quality conservation incentive options to producers this is in response to the growing concern of the alluvial aquifer depletion evidenced by the cone of depression reported in the region and water quality degradation usda nrcs 2014 prince czarnecki et al 2016 while the capacity of twr systems to supplement irrigation and alleviate groundwater depletion has been investigated their capacity to mitigate downstream nutrient and sediment loss is still in need of further study the overall objective of this study was to examine water quality characteristics of selected twr systems in northeast arkansas specific objectives were to 1 quantify and compare water quality spatially within twr systems 2 assess the influence of precipitation and fertilizer application events on twr systems water quality and 3 assess the influence of reservoir levee protection materials on ofs reservoir water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description study sites were located in craighead county arkansas southwest of jonesboro fig 1 two of the twr systems gs 1 and gs 2 were next to each other and located at 35 759792 n 90 766225 w and 35 757146 n 90 775324 w respectively tailwater enters the system via a drainage ditch at the northeast and southeast sides of the gs 1 ofs reservoir the gs 1 and gs 2 ofs reservoirs were separated by a ditch and levee excess tailwater from gs 1 flows through gs 2 where it can be captured and stored along with tailwater contributed by a feeder ditch from the south the third system gs 3 is located further south at 35 723914 n 90 818239 w approximately 1 km east of otwell ar gs 3 receives surface water from three drainage ditches entering from multiple directions each system in this study received water from surrounding agricultural fields used for soybean and rice production many of the fields were precision leveled to provide directional flow for surface waters as well as having drain culverts to direct water into ditches fig 2 ditches had been dredged among crop fields to promote optimal drainage with flow directed to the reservoir inflow ditches typically had impoundment structures midstream to elevate the water level so the reservoir inflow pump could move water from the ditch into the reservoir managing water level in the reservoir is a balance between taking advantage of winter and spring precipitation and minimizing levee erosion a general water management scheme is to begin filling reservoirs in january and complete filling by april removal of stored water was facilitated by the use of butterfly valves and piping to transported to surrounding cropland during irrigation events for water transport to more distant cropland irrigation booster pumps were used for adequate pressure and volume to irrigate fields in a timely manner soils in the study area were 56 1 calhoun silt loam 29 6 hillemann silt loam and 14 4 tichnor silt loam according to the usda web soil survey accessed on 14 may 2019 all three sites are part of the lost creek ditch watershed a sub watershed of the cache sub basin with eventual drainage into bayou deview average annual rainfall for the area obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration was approximately 1222 mm with roughly less than half falling during the april through september timeframe prevailing weather is characterized by long hot summers and relatively cool winters typical of the humid mid southern us 2 2 site history gs 1 is the newest constructed system sampled in this study completed in 2011 it has a 45 ha reservoir with an average water depth of 2 75 m at full capacity refuse concrete rubble from a nearby building site was distributed along the upper portion of the levee to reduce erosion from wave action prevailing winds for the area generally originate from the southwest to the northeast the reservoir had three inflow pumps moving water from the bordering ditch into the reservoir water was carried to the surrounding cropland by three outflow pipes or discharged back into the ditch and moved to a relift pump for release into cropland gs 1 had one main ditch and one feeder ditch that supplied tailwater to the reservoir inflows the reservoir irrigated 261 ha with additional irrigation from groundwater wells the estimated percent irrigated area captured by the reservoir in gs 1 was 86 gs 2 was the oldest constructed system sampled in this study completed in 1980 the 85 ha reservoir had an average water depth of 2 m at full capacity the reservoir was drained and remodified in 2013 and 2014 originally timber was allowed to stand inside the reservoir but was eventually pushed over and windrowed in the bottom to serve as wave breaks levee banks were protected with vegetation rather than refuse cement fill inside the main levee that forms the reservoir levees were raised though not connected to serve as sacrificial levees to reduce the fetch length of the water surface and reduce wave action on the surrounding levees gs 2 had one inflow site and two outflow sites it borders the reservoir of gs 1 to the west and receives its tailwater discharge gs 2 captured water lost from gs 1 as well as tailwater from surrounding cropland delivered by two feeder ditches adjacent cropland totaling 437 ha was irrigated and managed as the primary watershed to fill the reservoir irrigation was augmented with groundwater wells runoff from two downstream fields does not cycle back into the reservoir with percent irrigated area captured by gs 2 being 92 gs 3 was constructed in two phases the first reservoir 40 ha was constructed in 1999 and a second 21 ha reservoir was added in 2007 to meet increased irrigation demands reservoirs were separated by a center levee with a pipe allowing water to move freely between the two systems the reservoirs had an average depth of 2 5 m at full capacity refuse concrete rubble from a nearby building site was used to line the top of the levees 2 m to protect them against wave action gs 3 had four inflow sites supplied by one main ditch that was itself supplied by three feeder ditches there were two outflows from the reservoir piping the water to surrounding cropland gs 3 partially irrigates 601 ha and was augmented by groundwater pumping water was recaptured from 83 of the irrigated contributing field area 2 3 water sampling design water samples were collected during three consecutive 2014 2016 growing seasons of rice and soybeans beginning in early april and ending in late august sampling dates were based on when water was available in the system and in response to management of the production fields samples were collected in response to precipitation events and after drawdown defined as the release of standing water from rice fields in the absence of these types of events samples were still collected within 3 weeks to ensure no data gap occurred and are referred to as no movement in total 29 sampling events 8 8 and 13 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively were collected for this study sampling was also secondarily designed to capture responses to fertilizer applications fertilizer application dates for the study period for all systems are presented in table 1 while water sampling events segregated into field water movement scenarios are shown in table 2 sampling sites were identified in both ditches and reservoirs to represent different components within each twr system fig 2 not all water in the ditches of the ofs system was delivered into the reservoir with some portion of the water bypassing the water relift and providing downstream users with water influent sampling sites were those that were within ditches and upstream of water relift effluent sites were those that were within ditches that moved water out of the ofs system samples were identified as influent effluent or reservoir to distinguish entering exiting and storage components respectively within each ofs system to collect grab water samples a prewashed 1 l polyethylene bottle was attached to an adjustable 5 m telescoping fiberglass pole a single grab sample was collected just beneath the water surface at approximately 1 m from the shore at each site for every sampling event prewashed sample and transport bottles were immediately rinsed with sample at collection to avoid cross contamination each grab sample was immediately transferred to a labeled 1 l polyethylene bottle a total of 533 samples were collected for the entire study duration with 292 170 and 71 collected from systems influent reservoir and effluent respectively deliberate sample pouring to reduce agitation was used to lessen impact on dissolved oxygen do readings in the field a ysi professional plus multi probe ysi incorporated yellow springs oh was inserted into the transport bottle to assess temperature do and ph the multi probe was thoroughly rinsed with di water between samples to avoid possible cross contamination each grab sample was stored on ice and transported to arkansas state university for further chemical analysis 2 4 water sample analyses all water samples were analyzed as quickly as possible upon arrival at the laboratory samples were stored at approximately 4 c unless being immediately analyzed nutrients were analyzed within 24 48 h of arrival while total suspended solids tss were processed within 7 days samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm pore diameter s pak membrane filter millipore sas molsheim france and allowed to reach laboratory temperature before conducting analysis dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and nitrate were analyzed using molybdenum blue colorimetric reaction methods described by murphy and riley 1962 and the cadmium reduction powder pillow method american public health association apha 2005 respectively on 25 ml aliquot samples analysis was performed using a hach dr 890 colorimeter loveland co usa and colorimeter nutrient test kits method detection limits for dip and nitrate were 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively while sample absorbances were read at 610 nm and 520 nm respectively standard curves were prepared and absorbance was regressed with concentration at 99 in addition the sample analysis methodology adhered to laboratory qa qc procedures where a di water blank was furnished with every sample run 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using minitab statistical software version 18 minitab inc u s a mixed effect model of analysis of variance where individual farms were treated as a random effect factor was performed to assess if differences existed among the mean values of water quality parameters nitrate dip tss temperature do and ph estimated among twr influent effluent and reservoir components mixed effect model of analysis of variance helps to mask out and account for variability attributed to individual systems this variability having been accounted for in the model does not influence the conclusion drawn on the parameter statistics the same model was also used to assess differences in water quality matrices within twr system components during water movement and fertilizer application events where differences existed a bonferroni pairwise multiple mean comparisons test was performed for treatment mean separation data were checked for normality using the shapiro wilk test likewise homogeneity of variance was tested using bartlett s test for data with initial normal distribution or levene s test for any continuous distribution where data violated the normality assumption test e g nitrate and dip data were log transformed to validate the parametric anova statistical assumption however where data still failed normality parametric test assumptions after transformation a generalized linear mixed model glm procedure was performed to determine differences among treatments likewise the glm procedure was performed to determine differences in water quality matrices between ofs levee protection materials alpha was set to 0 05 for all tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 component water quality water quality variations occurred within the studied twr systems components table 3 over the entire growing season no reduction in mean concentrations of nitrate and dip was observed in the twr influent and effluent however a significant p 0 001 reduction in concentrations of both nutrients was observed in the reservoir when compared with mean concentrations observed in the influent and effluent table 3 observed results were contrary to those reported by moore et al 2015 from twr systems in poinsett county northeast arkansas with no significant differences measured among the three twr system components lower nitrate concentrations observed in the reservoir versus the twr influent and effluent could possibly be a result of dilution or denitrification in the reservoir karki et al 2018 additionally an increase in water depth and residence time could also have allowed for more biogeochemical activities associated with nutrient transformation omer et al 2018a with regard to dip inundation created by the reservoirs is reported to enhance biogeochemical processes of phosphorus p sorption by facilitating fine soil particle deposition which further plays a vital role in enhancing p sorption within systems mcdowell et al 2004 iseyemi et al 2018 studies by durand et al 2011 and smukler et al 2012 demonstrated that changes in nutrient concentrations between aquatic system influent and effluent can be attributed to system size depth and hydraulic residence time smukler et al 2012 reported an increase of about 40 in nitrate concentration between twr influent and effluent in an organic farm in california and attributed the increase to the small size of the twr system and a reduced hydraulic residence time omer et al 2018a reported how interaction between water depth and residence time could have an effect on nutrient reduction efficiency of twr systems they observed twr system performance increased with a concomitant increase in residence time and water depth likewise the study suggested smaller sized systems would perform better with lower depth while larger sized systems would perform better with greater depth like omer et al 2018a durand et al 2011 emphasized the importance of both increased residence time and reduced water depth upon increased nitrate removal but with attention upon system management and environmental factors concentrations of nitrate observed in all components were comparable to mean concentrations of 0 10 0 30 mg l 1 reported in twr systems by omer et al 2017 2018b however mean nitrate concentration observed in the current study s ofs was lower than concentrations 0 9 3 6 mg l 1 reported by moore et al 2015 likewise mean influent and effluent dip concentrations observed in this study were higher than concentrations 0 33 0 44 mg l 1 reported by moore et al 2015 on the other hand reported concentrations in the ofs reported by moore et al 2015 0 22 0 45 mg l 1 were comparable to the mean dip concentration observed in the ofs in the current study a lack of difference between influent and effluent nutrient concentrations may have been due to shorter residence times for water at both twr influent and effluent compared to that of the ofs according to omer et al 2018a nutrient concentrations are more likely to decrease in the water column by physical processes i e settling and with longer retention times ultimately allowing for additional biological transformation on average do was significantly higher p 0 001 in the ofs reservoir compared to similar concentrations observed at both twr influent and effluent respectively table 5 higher do concentration in the ofs compared to twr systems influent and effluent may have resulted from at least two conjoined twr ditches connected to the ofs whose water movement and discharge was believed to mix with the water column in the reservoir this mixing was observed based on visual observation of water transfer between these feeder ditches and the reservoir while depth and residence time could have resulted in anoxic conditions in the reservoir to enhance denitrification karki et al 2018 higher do concentration may have limited this process particularly during water movement from the feeder ditches this was apparently not the case in this study because the mean nitrate concentration was observed to be lower in the reservoir despite the expected limited denitrification process in the reservoir when compared to the other twr system components on the other hand higher do concentrations were believed to have supported increased biological activities further enhancing the generation of sediment organic matter som usda nrcs 2019 within the reservoir to enhance p transformation depending on soil types and p concentration in the water column and transported soil som has been reported to keep p sorption sites in sediments relatively constant and more readily available as well as reducing the equilibrium ph dependence of sediment p sorption activities hiradate and uchida 2004 chintala et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 this may have been the case in the current study since ph was relatively similar across all twr components table 3 thus a lower dip concentration was measured in the ofs compared to that of other twr components total suspended solids concentrations were comparable across twr components with mean concentrations ranging between 62 and 108 mg l 1 table 3 observed mean tss concentrations in the current study were slightly greater than mean concentrations reported by omer et al 2017 2018b in twr systems in mississippi 50 90 mg l 1 mean tss in the ofs 61 84 mg l 1 was significantly lower when compared to influent 107 88 mg l 1 but tss in ofs was comparable with that of the effluent however the tss of the effluent was also not significantly different with that of the influent table 3 it was anticipated that tss would be lower in the ofs due to impoundment of water increased hydraulic residence time and greater water depth all which facilitate solids settling from the water column mcdowell et al 2004 iseyemi et al 2018 however wetzel 2001 noted shallow reservoirs with depths 5 7 m may have limited sedimentation resulting from poor thermal stratification thornton 1990 additionally mentioned constraint in sedimentation processes in reservoirs owing to continual longitudinal gradient mixing of water albeit referencing more elaborate riverine zones nonetheless current results were comparable to studies by omer et al 2018a and carruth et al 2014 who reported no significant difference in mean tss concentrations between and among components from twr systems in mississippi thus twr systems may actually be limited in their capacities to mitigate suspended solids even with the ability to capture and hold water on the landscape and collect loads of solids that would have otherwise moved downstream omer et al 2018a more specifically omer et al 2018a reported a 21 reduction efficiency of tss concentrations in twr systems mean water temperature was marginally higher p 0 05 in the ofs reservoir but was comparable with mean water temperature observed in both twr influent and effluent table 3 although observed water temperatures were lower than those reported by moore et al 2015 from twr systems in northeast arkansas warmer irrigation water temperatures than the typical groundwater temperature of 14 c are known to be advantageous to proper rice seedling vegetative growth the lower temperature of groundwater irrigation water is reported to cause cold shock to rice seedlings and such abiotic stress is known to account for about 50 of world wide reductions in average yield in rice production mahajan and tuteja 2005 as observed for water temperature water ph was also marginally higher p 0 05 in the twr reservoir but was comparable to mean ph observed in both twr influent and effluent table 3 observed ph values in the current study were similar to the ph range of 7 0 8 5 reported by moore et al 2015 from twr systems in northeast arkansas likewise observed ph values were similar to those reported by andrews et al 2005 signifying a typical ph range reported for surface waters in the lower mississippi river basin 3 2 management events water quality sampling events that segregated with regard to water movement did not influence water quality with the exception of temperature in the twr systems in the current study although mean nitrate concentration in the twr systems was significantly higher p 0 001 during precipitation sampling events when compared with periods with a lack of water movement events the concentration was comparable to those observed during the end of season drawdown table 4 however there was no significant difference in nitrate concentrations observed during both lack of water movement and the end of season drawdown events table 4 likewise mean dip concentration was comparable in the twr systems during precipitation and lack of water movement but was significantly higher p 0 001 during the drawdown events compared to the precipitation events however there was no significant difference in the mean dip concentrations between lack of water movement and the end of season drawdown events table 4 precipitation can be a significant source of variation in surface water quality in aquatic systems depending on soil type vegetation cover agronomic management and intensity and duration of rainfalls martin and holabaugh 2002 liu et al 2014 this is particularly true in agricultural landscapes when precipitation closely follows fertilizer application davidson et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 a lack of difference in nitrate concentrations in the twr systems with respect to precipitation in the current study may be attributed to precipitation lag time following fertilizer applications there were a number of intense precipitation events that triggered water sampling during the study period particularly during the 2016 growing season also intensive precipitation events during the non growing seasons especially in early spring and late fall present the potential to trigger more nutrient runoff compared to those during growing seasons with greater ground cover rainfall during non growing periods lacking vegetation cover have been shown to trigger the release of residual nutrients from soil into the water column davidson et al 2012 carruth et al 2014 omer et al 2018b while it was expected that nitrate concentrations were similar in the twr systems during precipitation and the other water movement sampling periods it was also anticipated that dip and tss would increase during precipitation heavy rainfall events as precipitation often disturbs and mixes the water column subsequently causing p and tss resuspension chapra 2008 omer et al 2018a zhou et al 2015 reported a higher p concentration in a twr ofs during a storm runoff event when compared to a more typical rain event and attributed this to sediment disruption during heavy storms although intensive precipitation events are expected to disrupt p sorption and trigger more dip release into the water column release of p into solution is ultimately dependent upon soil p status regardless of the amount and the intensity of the rainfall hahna et al 2012 although not measured in the current study low soil p concentrations could have contributed to the lack of differences found in dip concentrations during precipitation and other water movement sampling events on average water temperature was significantly lower p 0 001 during the drawdown sampling events compared to temperatures observed during precipitation and no water movement events table 4 this was somewhat surprising because drawdown events were in august which is usually the hottest month of the growing season however a study by rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 on vegetated and unvegetated lowland rivers reported a strong negative relationship between do and water temperature but emphasized the relationship can be influenced by many factors the factors identified were the intensity and distribution of rainfall the rate and amount of runoff and the travel rates and travel distances of floodwaters a lower temperature observed during drawdown events may be a result of increased floodwater flow during the end of season drawdown events triggering higher do concentrations although do concentrations were not significantly different in the twr systems during all water movement sampling events they were highest during the drawdown in the current study table 4 3 3 fertilizer events water quality water quality varied in the twr systems during fertilizer application events in the current study mean nitrate concentrations in the twr systems were comparable during pre and post first and second fertilizer application events with concentrations of 0 08 0 3 mg l 1 0 12 0 3 mg l 1 0 06 0 3 mg l 1 respectively this reflected good n management within the growing systems according to dabney et al 2006 and mitsch et al 2001 n deployment from agriculture production acreages can be managed and prevented by in field agronomic practices including fertilizer application irrigation management tillage practices vegetative barrier and cover cropping mean dip concentrations were significantly different p 0 001 across all fertilizer application events with the highest concentration observed during pre fertilizer application sampling events and the lowest concentration observed during post second fertilizer application sampling events table 5 soil sediments coupled with precipitation can be a significant source of dip bridgham et al 2001 zhou et al 2015 this is due to a strong affinity between dip and soil sediments house and denison 2000 bridgham et al 2001 zamparas and zacharias 2014 and a strong relationship between these two variables and intensive precipitation events yuan et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 omer et al 2018b however it was not the case in the current study because tss was not influenced by water movement table 4 and was significantly lower during pre fertilizer application events table 5 instead higher dip during pre fertilizer application was likely attributable to biosolid application in the early growing season prior to inorganic fertilizer application 3 4 levee protection water quality water quality was influenced by reservoir levee protection materials in the current study while temperature dip and tss were not influenced by ofs levee protection materials on average nitrate and do concentrations were significantly lower p 0 001 in vegetated protected ofs compared to ofs with concrete levee protection table 6 according to bastviken et al 2003 n transformation processes in aquatic systems are generally influenced by soil sediment conditions macrophyte and microbial communities while long term n removal in aquatic systems is mostly facilitated by denitrifying bacteria present in anoxic sediments of aquatic systems seitzinger 2008 vegetation can also provide for significant biotic sorption of nitrate in systems deaver et al 2005 kröger et al 2009 moore et al 2010 thus a significantly lower concentration of nitrate could be attributed to vegetation providing a biotic environment for additional n transformation mean do concentration was significantly lower p 0 001 in vegetation protected ofs compared to concrete rubble protected ofs table 6 a significantly lower do in vegetation protected ofs may be a result of oxygen utilization by macrophyte associated microbial communities which usually furnish additional surface area for denitrification processes in many aquatic systems eriksson and weisner 1999 körner 1999 similar to results obtained for nitrate and do water ph was also significantly lower p 0 001 in the vegetation protected ofs compared to concrete rubble protected ofs table 6 a significantly higher ph in concrete rubble protected reservoirs could be attributed to continuous curing of concrete debris subsequently increasing the ph while releasing calcium hydroxide as a by product of cement hydration šiler et al 2016 while it may be surprising that dip concentration was not influenced by the vegetation protection of the reservoir in the current study many studies reddy et al 1995 bridgham et al 2001 deaver et al 2005 moore et al 2010 kröger and moore 2011 iseyemi et al 2018 on p transformation in aquatic systems have demonstrated vegetation in systems only offer short term biological p sorption and limited p removal efficiency 30 depending on p concentration in water soil p concentration soil ph and soil type when compared to biotic removal of n in aquatic systems likewise similar tss concentrations in vegetation protected ofs and concrete rubble protected ofs table 6 may be attributed to limited vegetative surface area exchange with system water vegetation cover was limited only on the banks unlike wetlands and ditches with established vegetation and root systems providing additional opportunities for sedimentation within systems 4 conclusion water quality varied spatially within twr systems in the lower mississippi river basin nutrients were observed to be significantly lower in twr ofs when compared with twr influent and effluent from management systems monitoring of system responses to production and weather demonstrated ofs play a vital role in reducing nutrients in farms that can implement twr systems as a water conservation measure although water routing and hydraulic residence time in ditches affects nutrient reduction capability from twr effluent bypassing relifts installation of adjustable weirs or risers at system outflows would be expected to additionally help optimize such opportunities ofs levee protection materials water movement and fertilizer application events were found to each influence water quality variables within twr and should be given careful consideration by land managers and producers when implementing twr systems on production landscapes ultimately this study will help inform modeling of water resources in the lower mississippi river

10143,raised beds rb are hailed as means to mitigate the problem of excessive irrigation however their adoption and impacts in egypt are not well documented this paper is based on survey data collected from a sample of 691 wheat fields drawn from three major wheat producing provinces of egypt using area weights for upward aggregation we estimated that 19 3 of total wheat area in the three provinces is cultivated with raised beds we applied the endogenous switching regression model to analyze the socioeconomic biophysical and environmental impacts of rb model results showed that the adoption of rb led to a 937 kg ha 12 79 increase in yield a us 77 60 ha 9 47 increase in gross margins an 824 63 m3 ha 15 05 reduction in irrigation water application 16 7 reduction in seeding rate 5 56 increase in water productivity and an 11 80 reduction in downside yield risk adoption of rb didn t have significant effect on soil salinity and quantities of fertilizer and labor inputs these results show that rb can provide panacea to several interrelated socioeconomic biophysical and environmental problems associated with irrigation the policy implication of our findings is that egypt and other similar countries can benefit from embracing rb as part of the technology packages promoted by their national agricultural extension systems the benefits to these countries will increase if they invest more on research for adapting and perfecting the rb technology including its mechanization and its efficacy in soil salinity management keywords raised beds impact socioeconomic irrigation water input quantity soil salinity 1 introduction in the late 2000s irrigated lands constituted about 20 of total global cultivated land thenkabail et al 2009a 40 of total food production thenkabail et al 2009b and 65 of total ground and surface water exploited by humans thenkabail 2010 after a decade the share of irrigation in total croplands and in total food production have reduced to 20 and 40 respectively while the share in total ground and surface water exploited by humans has increased to 70 world bank 2020 indicating that irrigation has sizeable role not only in determining the sustainability of water resources but also on the ability of the human race to produce sufficient food over time several challenges associated with irrigation including ground water depletion water conflicts soil salinization and hence yield loss are emerging some of these problems are aggravated by farmers mismanagement this paper provides field level empirical evidence from egypt on whether the use of raised beds in irrigated wheat production helps mitigate some of these challenges ground water is being depleted at a faster pace and competition among countries and communities sharing the same water sources is increasing due to growing demand for water and large regional variations in the distribution of the endowments wada et al 2010 the increased competition for water along with the increasing scarcity of surface water resources are in some cases leading to water conflicts levy and sidel 2011 another challenge facing our world is soil salinity which results from the accumulation of salt above levels that adversely affect plant growth shrivastava and kumar 2015 regardless of the irrigation method poor water management practices including insufficient leaching and poor drainage are bound to accumulate salts at and beyond the rooting zone causing soil salinity shahid 2013 salinized areas are steadily growing at a rate of 10 per year currently costing the world about us 27 billion per year zaman et al 2018 left unchecked by 2050 salinity is expected to affect more than 50 of croplands worldwide jamil et al 2011 all the challenges discussed above show the very high importance of irrigation in food water and soil security koch et al 2012 thenkabail et al 2010 and hence the due attention that it deserves therefore introduction of effective ways of sustainably conserving water and timely recognition of salinity symptoms in irrigated fields and use of appropriate soil and water management practices may save further degradation of water and soil resources and costly reclamation efforts shahid 2013 the different irrigation methods that are currently used by farmers can be broadly classified into five categories namely flood furrow sprinkler subsurface and localized irrigation methods kandiah 1994 historically flood irrigation also known as traditional surface irrigation has been the most dominant irrigation method bilibio et al 2011 yigezu et al 2014 this method is characterized by poor control over water distribution and hence associated with low water use efficiency yigezu et al 2013 irmak et al 2011 poor water management under flood irrigation is also often associated with soil salinity problems shahid 2013 with surface irrigation applying an optimal equivalent to the leaching requirement amount of water to leach the salt down through the soil profile is the desired method for maintaining suitable soil salinity thompson et al 2010 however there are tradeoffs between the two goals of increasing water use efficiency and reducing salinity for example in the face of scarcity of water and the associated growth in the use of low quality water the tendency to increase the water use efficiency in irrigation can lead to the accumulation of salts in the soil as the leaching fraction is reduced and the salts contained in the irrigation water are not leached enough machado and serralheiro 2017 in egypt the main source of irrigation is fresh water from the nile and flood irrigation is the most common irrigation method therefore the main cause of salinity in the country is capillary effect due to excessive application of irrigation water in areas where the ground water table is shallow especially in lower egypt the main strategy used in the country for mitigating salinity problems has been developing drainage structures for the crop lands subsurface drainage system is widely applied in the nile delta to withdraw the excessive irrigation water from the root zone and lower the groundwater level the drainage water is officially reused after mixing with canal fresh water to adjust the salinity farmers also unofficially reuse drainage water moreover farming in the nile delta is highly intensified and diversified because farm sizes are very small an average of 0 5 acre per family as a result farmers apply excessive amount of fertilizers in order to maximize their farm income in the absence of proper leaching and soil management such practices also increase the salinity level in the soil therefore all efforts aimed at identifying appropriate irrigation methods should be driven not only by water use efficiency considerations but also their implications on salinity the other methods of irrigation are less common especially in the production of cereals but play important roles in fruit and vegetable production drip irrigation is perhaps the best irrigation technology because it ensures uniformity in water application and hence enhances plant growth saves water by minimizing evaporation reduces nutrient leaching and requires lower labor input especially for land leveling however it may not work when irrigation water has high iron content as it can create clogging maintenance cost can also be high and tubes can be easily damaged by rodents and insects causing leakages sprinkler irrigation is efficient on soils with medium and coarse texture and water can be applied at low rates however frequent application may be needed to recharge soil moisture depleted by the crop while furrow irrigation requires low initial investment on equipment and involves lower pumping costs it involves higher labor costs and lower application efficiency compared to sprinkler and subsurface drip irrigation for example albaji et al 2010 found that drip and sprinkler irrigation methods are more effective and efficient than surface irrigation however soil texture salinity and slope can be major limiting factors for sprinkler irrigation for drip irrigation the calcium carbonate content can be an additional limiting factor by reducing the amount of water application while also allowing excess water to drain into open collector which discharges it off the field raised beds are effective in enhancing yield water productivity and soil structural and chemical properties including reducing soil salinity mcdonald 2019 soomro et al 2017 devkota et al 2015 amer et al 2011 velmurugan et al 2016 acuña et al 2011 bakker et al 2005 ahmad and mahmood 2005 planting on beds can also lead to the reduction in fungal and other diseases with improved radiation interception acquisitive temperature and reduced humidity in the canopy enabling farmers to reduce their pesticide applications alwang et al 2018 however while raised beds have several advantages their suitability in mixed crop livestock systems is yet to be established manik et al 2019 raised beds have long history in egypt where several farmers apply it for several crops including vegetables the adoption of raised bed technology in egypt is increasing due to its multiple benefits alwang et al 2018 swelam 2016 however the types and extents of benefits from raised beds depend on the dimensions of beds and its associated farrows and the method of implementation manual or mechanized sowing method rows vs broadcasting and seeding rates in recognition of the benefits of the raised bed technology the shortcomings of traditional designs and the threats that continue to constrain agricultural production in the north african and west asia regions the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda and its national and international partners have carried intensive research between 2004 and 2008 proof of concept which led to the design and testing of a raised bed machin between 2009 and 2012 ultimately icarda in collaboration with the agricultural research center arc of egypt developed prototypes for raised bed machines that are adapted and suitable to the local socio economic and agroecological conditions in the country since 2012 there have been concerted efforts to out scale the raised bed technology in general and the mechanized raised bed mrb technology in particular in egypt through at least five different projects while good progress was made during the implementation of the projects a breakthrough was not made until after the policy makers in egypt got convinced by the appropriateness and advantages of the mrb technology in 2016 as a result of which mrb has been included as one component of the wheat technology package that is widely being popularized through the national wheat campaign of the government if the use of the mrb continues to expand at its current pace an estimated 800 thousand ha of land is projected to be under the technology by 2023 alwang et al 2018 however it is important to note that an inappropriate implementation of raised beds can lead to yield reduction if the bed width is too large and furrow depth is too shallow due to water stress on the middle rows because water does not reach the effective root zone the design and introduction of raised beds should carefully factor the soil type and salinity level raised beds should also be packaged with other appropriate technology components such as crop variety and fertilizer and seed rates because different varieties perform differently depending on the specifications of the beds and whether the soils are salt affected sandy or clay therefore using raised beds without proper advisory services can lead to negative effects on yield and soil health maintaining the delicate balance between the specifications of the raised beds and identification of the other complementary technology components can be complicated which may in many cases affect the adoption of the technology especially by mostly uneducated smallholders national research partners from many other countries including morocco tunisia algeria nigeria and sudan have also shown interest to introduce the technology into their respective countries as a result the project called enhancing food security in arab countries efsac implemented jointly by icarda and arc which promoted the raised bed technology in egypt also carried adaptation and testing activities in all these countries efsac 2018 this indeed is an exciting moment for icarda and its partners which invested a lot of time efforts and resources into developing and perfecting the mrb technology as it has great potential to transform agriculture in irrigated areas of many countries in the north african and west asian regions and more other regions with similar biophysical conditions however it remains unanswered whether the technology can be a panacea for several agricultural problems in irrigated agriculture and providing the expected social economic biophysical and environmental benefits to the farmers who are using it and their surroundings using data collected to measure the impacts of a technology package that was introduced to enhance wheat productivity in egypt this paper attempts to shed some light on the levels of adoption and impacts of the raised bed rb technology on wheat fields in three major wheat growing provinces namely al sharkia al dakahlia and kafr al sheikh in the nile delta region specifically the paper provides estimates of 1 economic benefits in terms of yield and net returns 2 social benefits in terms of the amount of labor needed and the reduction of downside yield risk in wheat production and 3 biophysical environmental benefits in terms of reducing the quantity of irrigation water applied per unit of area m3 ha increasing water productivity kg m3 and reducing salinity ds m unfortunately the data that was collected did not make distinction between different types of raised beds mechanically or manually constructed width and height of beds width and depth of furrows between beds seeding methods row planting vs broadcasting and seeding rate the traditional manually constructed raised beds are still common in egypt especially in vegetable cultivation while they are starting to be replaced by mechanized raised beds in cereal cultivation as a result about 40 50 of all raised beds in wheat fields in the study governorates are estimated to be constructed manually or semi mechanically using chisel plow therefore despite our earnest desire to measure the impacts of the mechanized raised beds the results of our study cannot be explicitly attributed to mechanized raised beds nor to the manually constructed raised beds hence we report the impacts of raised beds in general regardless of their type the findings of our study are believed to be useful to inform future research and extension and guide policy and development efforts in egypt and many similar countries facing the challenges associated with irrigated agriculture 2 the raised bed technology in egypt egypt has a total of 3 69 million ha 8 8 million feddan of agricultural land out of which an estimated 3 61 million ha 97 7 is irrigated with the remaining 84 000 ha rainfed the nile river is the main source of water in the country therefore agriculture heavily depends on the nile river from which it obtains about 55 5 billion m3 year of water due to the highly fertile alluvial soils and availability of water for irrigation wheat productivity in egypt is the highest in africa for example average wheat yields in the country stands at about 6 7 ton ha which is much higher than the african average of 2 6 t ha faostat 2019 however because of rapid population growth the country is under pressure to open new lands for cultivation thereby increasing the pressure on the limited water supply moreover available water resources have reduced by over 80 in the last century fao 2016 new upstream initiatives might also potentially compromise the amount of water egypt will get in the future another domestic challenge egypt is currently facing is that because of the accumulation of salts mostly at the soil surface 35 of the agricultural land is suffering from salinity reducing the yield potential of the agricultural lands raised beds have been considered by some farmers as a good practice for irrigated land and have been used in egypt since long time alwang et al 2018 however given the high labor demand for their construction their adoption has been limited in view of the current and potential future challenges for agriculture in egypt the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda and its national partners including the agricultural research center arc of egypt have carried long term research to improve the efficacy of raised beds for the conservation not only of water and soil but also of agricultural labor to this effect they designed a raised bed machine rbm for which a prototype has been developed and validated the machine has been tested in various parts of the country and demonstrated clear advantages in terms of enhancing yield and in saving irrigation water and labor for land cultivation relative to both the traditional surface irrigation and the traditional raised beds in the last decade yields of some field crops have increased while water consumption otherwise known as evapotranspiration et has slightly decreased due to wide adoption of new agronomic practices that reduce et these practices were introduced through different large research for development projects to improve the productivity of irrigated farming systems using surface irrigation these practices include raised bed soil salinity amendment packages including gypsum application biofertilizer leaching fraction etc lining irrigation canals gated pipe surface irrigation deficit irrigation as an optional practice to cope with water shortage condition and alternate furrow irrigation crop lands in egypt are generally flat with maximum slope of 5 however laser based land leveling is practiced in some crop lands to enhance irrigation efficiency currently in addition to the dissemination of raised bed technology the government of egypt is implementing a nation wide irrigation modernization initiative that mainly focuses on switching from surface flood irrigation to pressurized irrigation systems drip and sprinkler to reduce irrigation application in this connection the agriculture research center of egypt has recently developed and disseminated high yielding drought tolerant and water efficient crop varieties mainly of wheat barley and maize the scientists who developed the mechanized raised bed mrb technology argue that when accompanied with good practices it has the potential to reduce salinity increase photosynthesis and reduce diseases and pest prevalence in short mrb will provide a panacea for most of the irrigation related problems egyptian farmers are currently facing and may face in the future several initiatives and projects have tried to disseminate the mrb technology into six provinces between 2011 and 2014 a project funded by the international fund for agricultural development ifad and the project enhancing food security in the arab countries efsac funded by multiple donors in the arab world introduced the technology as part of a wheat technology package involving six other components in al sharkia governorate the same projects also promoted the technology in al dakahlia governorate between 2015 and 2018 since 2018 the efsac project popularized the technology in al behera governorate the mrb technology was also introduced in al assuit since 2015 by a project funded by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao a development program funded by the european union eu has also introduced the technology in al fayoum and al minia provinces since 2018 based on the evidence demonstrated by these projects policy makers in egypt were convinced on the appropriateness and advantages of the technology for which they have decided to include mrb as one component of the wheat technology package that is being widely popularized through the government s national wheat campaign nwc nwc has much larger coverage than all the projects mentioned above not only in terms of number of districts and villages covered but also in terms of number of farmers included in the popularization effort from each district and village as it is disseminating the mrb in 22 governorates across the country arc plans to increase the total cultivated area using rb from 1 000 000 acre in 2019 2020 to 1 037 843 acre in 2020 2021 fas 2020 several project reports showed that based on bivariate data analysis the adoption of the mechanized raised bed mrb technology was associated with 15 25 increase in yields 50 lower seed costs a 25 reduction in irrigation water and lower labor costs icarda 2017 swelam 2016 swelam and atta 2012 karrou et al 2012 since its dissemination in 2011 the mechanized raised bed technology has expanded in various parts of the country the raised beds constructed using the icarda arc raised bed machine are 130 cm wide and 50 m long the associated furrows are 20 40 cm wide and 20 30 cm deep the machine plants the seeds in straight rows and can be calibrated to the desired seeding rate optimally at 107 kg ha for wheat the recommended spacing for planting is 7 rows on each bed which are 15 cm apart at the same time a large number of farmers have been constructing permanent raised beds either semi mechanically or manually with their own modifications to the bed sizes farrow depths and widths for semi mechanical raised beds farmers first plant using broadcasting at a high seeding rate of above 145 kg ha and then prepare the raised beds using chisel plows while there is huge variation in the dimensions of the semi mechanically constructed raised beds they generally have much narrower beds than mrbs the traditional manually constructed raised beds on the other hand are much wider than the semi mechanically constructed beds but still slightly narrower than the fully mechanized similar to the semi mechanized raised beds farmers using the traditional manually constructed raised beds use broadcasting with high seeding rate of over 145 kg ha all types of raised beds are believed to have advantages in terms of irrigation water saving and yield over the traditional furrow and flood irrigation fig 1 experts estimate that up to 200 thousand ha of crop land is under raised beds out of which about 100 thousand ha are estimated to be under wheat the experts also estimate that some 40 50 of the raised bed in wheat lands is manually or semi mechanically constructed and more than half up to 60 thousand ha is estimated to be fully mechanized as the expansion of raised beds in wheat fields intensified mainly after the introduction of the raised bed machines unavailability of the rb machine is the main reason given for why some farmers are cultivating their wheat fields with semi mechanical or manually constructed raised beds non adopters of raised beds consider the land used as farrows between beds to be too much in the face of their small landholding while the benefits of raised beds regardless of the levels of mechanization seem to be widely agreed experts warn that some specifications followed in the construction of manual and semi mechanized raised beds might not deliver some or all of the benefits and in the extreme case may be harmful 3 data as described above between 2011 and 2018 the efsac project introduced a wheat technology package with a total of 10 components variety raised beds seed and fertilizer rates herbicide and pesticide rates planting and harvesting dates rotation and irrigation scheduling as part of the conclusion of the 2nd phase of the project there was a need to measure the adoption and impacts of the technology package to this effect the research team purposively included al sharkia and al dakahlia the only two governorates where the project introduced the technology package into the sample to see if the technology was expanding outside the project areas and also to make sure that the socio economic and environmental changes happening in al sharkia and al dakahlia are not also happening elsewhere one governorate kafr al sheikh was included into the survey as a control afterwards a multi stage stratified random sampling procedure was used to draw samples using power analysis the minimum sample size needed to ensure a confidence level of 95 and a precision level of at least 3 for estimates of adoption was determined to be 602 to account for missing values and for balancing of the samples across all sampling units the sample size was increased to 615 the sample households were then distributed across all three governorates proportional to their farmer populations to do this first districts and villages were stratified into project and non project districts and villages then random samples of project and non project districts and villages were selected for inclusion into the sample then at the level of villages the primary sampling units farm households were randomly drawn using the master file containing all wheat growers of each village as sampling frames given that the main objective of this study is to draw lessons from the project interventions there was concern that by taking random samples of farmers at the village levels we may run the risk of not having sufficient number of farmers in the sample who have adopted one or more of the technologies promoted by the project to overcome this potential problem the research team decided to first take a random sample of 426 households 70 of the total sample size using a random sampling procedure and then randomly select the remaining 189 households 30 of the total sample only from among those who were project participants by so doing the team ensured having sufficient number of farmers who used each technology component in the sample descriptive statistics for selected variables are presented in table 1 4 methods one of the main challenges in the estimation of average treatment effects is related to establishing counterfactuals as selection bias is often inherent in program participation egyptian wheat farmers may self select into or out of the adoption of the raised bed technology for various reasons some farmers may adopt it because they believe that they have the right soil tractor s manpower and special knowledge skills abilities and expertise and as a result have stronger motivation to adopt the technology other farmers may have reasons including lack of manpower shallow soil and confidence and negative attitude to believe that the technology will not work for them moreover some important explanatory variables are very difficult to measure and hence despite all efforts remain missing in the data and hence are omitted from the regression as a result the problem of endogeneity is likely to be present during estimation which left unaddressed might lead to erroneous inferences depending on the source of bias several econometric approaches can be used to address the problem of selection bias in program evaluation using quasi experimental and observational data imbens and wooldridge 2009 provide a good review of the literature and the developments in causal inference and impact assessment propensity score matching psm due to rosenbaum and rubin 1983 is by far the most widely used for improving causal inference and estimation of average treatment effects el shater et al 2016 morgan and winship 2014 henderson and chatfield 2011 jalan and ravallion 2003 propensity score matching psm helps in correcting biases introduced only by observable covariates heckman and vytlacil 2007 therefore results from psm can sometimes be misleading since unobservable factors such as skills and motivation can influence not only the outcome but also the program participation decision thereby leading to confounding errors see austin 2008 for critical review of pms to overcome this problem two other methods namely the instrumental variables iv regression angrist and pischke 2009 and endogenous switching regression maddala and nelson 1975 methods have been proposed in this paper we employ the endogenous switching regression esr approach for estimating treatment effects of the adoption of raised bed rb among egyptian wheat farmers 4 1 endogenous switching regression esr the difference in the outcomes of interest between adopters and non adopters may not only be due to observable heterogeneity but also due to unobserved heterogeneity bidzakin et al 2019 paltasingh and goyari 2018 khonje et al 2015 malikov and kumbhakar 2014 therefore we use an endogenous switching regression esr to account for both observable and unobservable endogeneity of the adoption decision by simultaneously estimating the adoption function eq 1 and the outcome equation of interest for each group eq 2 or 3 theoretically farmers decide to adopt a technology when the expected utility received from adoption d 1 is greater than the utility received from non adoption d 0 while utility is not observable adoption is observable and is treated as a dichotomous choice d 1 if d 1 d 0 and d 0 if d 1 d 0 thus following bidzakin et al 2019 shiferaw et al 2014 and lokshin and sajaia 2011 the esr can be formulated as follows with the adoption decision selection equation modeled as 1 d i z i β ε i with d i 1 if d i d 0 otherwise d i 0 where z represents a matrix of the explanatory variables ß is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ε a vector representing normally distributed error term with mean zero and variance σ ε 2 the outcome equations can also be formulated as 2 y 1 x 1 ω 1 ϵ 1 if d 1 3 y 0 x 0 ω 0 ϵ 0 if d 0 where y i is a vector of dependent variables representing outcomes for adopters y 1 and non adopters y 0 x i is a matrix of explanatory variables some of which may be in z where for proper identification of the model z contains at least one explanatory variable which is not in x ω i is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 are error terms the error terms from the three equations ε ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 are assumed to have a trivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and a symmetric covariance matrix as shown in lokshin and sajaia 2011 if ε is correlated with ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 the expected values of ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 conditional on the sample selection are non zero if σ ϵ 1 ε and σ ϵ 0 ε are statistically significant this would indicate that the decision to adopt and the outcome variable of interest are correlated suggesting evidence of sample selection bias therefore estimating the outcome equations using ordinary least square ols would lead to biased and inconsistent results and heckman procedures heckman 1979 are normally used in the face of heteroscedastic error terms the full information maximum likelihood film estimator can be used to fit an endogenous switching regression that simultaneously estimates the selection and outcome equations to yield consistent estimates the esr can be estimated where the actual expected outcomes of adopters 4 and non adopters 5 and the counterfactual hypothetical cases that the non adopters did adopt 6 and the adopters did not adopt 7 can be analyzed as follows 4 e y 1 d 1 x 1 ω 1 σ ϵ 1 ε λ 1 5 e y 0 d 0 x 0 ω 0 σ ϵ 0 ε λ 0 6 e y 0 d 1 x 1 ω 0 σ ϵ 0 ε λ 1 7 e y 1 d 0 x 0 ω 1 σ ϵ 1 ε λ 0 finally we calculate the average treatment effect on the treated att as the difference between 4 and 7 and the average treatment effect on the non adopters atu as the difference between 6 and 5 di falco et al 2011 lokshin and sajaia 2011 lokshin and glinskaya 2009 miranda and rabe hesketh 2006 carter and milon 2005 we also compute the effect of base heterogeneity for the group of adopters bh1 as the difference between 4 and 6 and for the group of non adopters bh2 as the difference between 7 and 5 a number of factors such as varieties used and the amounts of fertilizers seed labor quantity of irrigation water are important in determining yield which in turn will affect the gross margins and water productivity moreover for farmers to adopt the mechanized raised bed mrb by far the dominant type accounting for 70 80 of total raised beds it is necessary that they have access to rented or privately owned raised bed machine rbm therefore we use availability of the raised bed machine as instrument in the estimation of the esr version 15 of the stata software statacorp 2017 was used for all the data analysis carried in this study 5 results and discussion 5 1 model diagnostics the durbin wu hausman test hausman 1978 was carried to examine if endogeneity is a problem for the estimation of impacts of the adoption of the raised bed technology on yield downside risk on yield per capital wheat consumption gross margins water productivity quantity of irrigation water applied and soil salinity the test results showed that endogeneity was indeed a problem in the yield and downside risk equations for which we used the endogenous switching regression esr for estimation of the treatment effects however for the rest of the equations the test results showed that endogeneity was not a problem and hence we used the ordinary least squares ols regression which is efficient an exogenous variable which is excluded from the list of covariates is needed to serve as an instrumental variable for identification during the simultaneous estimation of the selection and outcome equations for an excluded exogenous variable to be a valid instrument it must be sufficiently correlated with the included endogenous regressors but uncorrelated with the error term angrist and pischke 2009 stock et al 2002 we believe that the adoption of the raised bed technology is correlated with the availability of raised bed machines and hence we use the number of raised bed machines per 10 000 ha of wheat area in each district rbm 10k ha as an instrument a falsification test di falco et al 2011 showed that rbm 10k ha does not have a direct effect on the outcome variables yield and downside risk on yield except through its effect on adoption of the raised bed technology further justification for the use of rb 10k ha as an instrument is that since 2012 different projects have purchased and distributed about 120 of the icarda arc raised bed machines to promote the mechanized raised bed technology especially in the al sharkia and al dakahlia provinces village level data on the availability of raised bed machines would be a much better instrument but the data that we were able to obtain is only at district level we believe that the district level figures will still be valid because most service providers both public and private are located in the district capitals where they serve all farmers who are interested and have the financial means to pay for the services within the district the downside of this instrument is that about 40 50 of all raised beds in wheat fields are manually or semi mechanically constructed and hence may make the instrument weak for example the correlation between the adoption of the raised bed technology and the instrument rbm 10k ha is 0 36 making it not very strong as a result the use of the endogenous switching regression esr which can also be identified through the assumed non linearities is justified robustness checks were also carried comparing several alternative specifications of the models the results from esr were also compared with results of an ols regression the results show that the signs of coefficients of only few variables changed while the values of almost all parameter estimates showed slight changes however their significance levels remained stable likewise the estimates of treatment effects from the esr model were found to be stable in terms of all the sign magnitude and statistical significance of the effects 5 2 determination of the level and explaining adoption of raised bed based only on the random sample of 426 households the average farmer population weighted adoption rate of the raised bed technology in the three sample provinces is 17 61 al sharkia province has the highest district level number of wheat growers weighted adoption rate with 38 27 of farmers cultivating wheat using the raised bed technology followed by al dakahlia at 10 32 while none of the farmers in the kafr al sheikh province are using the technology the corresponding district wheat area weighted adoption degrees in each province stand at 39 57 13 03 and 0 00 respectively leading to a wheat area weighted adoption degree in all three provinces of 19 28 the fact that the of wheat area under rb cultivation is higher than the of farmers using the technology shows that on the average relatively larger farmers are using the technology estimates of the full information maximum likelihood fiml estimation of the selection and outcome equations of the esr models for yield and downside risk on yield are provided in table 2 as the main objective of this paper is to measure impacts of rb only a brief discussion of the results pertaining to the factors affecting the adoption of rb is provided here from column a in table 2 we can see that several variables have statistically significant effects on farmers decision on whether to adopt the raised bed technology as expected the number of raised bed machines per 10 000 ha of wheat land in each district rbm 10k ha which is used as an instrument in the esr model has a positive and significant effect on farmers adoption decision likewise participation in past projects which promoted wheat technology packages including the raised bed machine also has a positive and significant effect on farmers adoption decision farmers with medium to deep soils are also found to have a higher propensity to adopt raised beds farmers decisions to adopt the other technology packages including rotation and the recommended planting and harvesting dates have positive and significant effects on the adoption of the raised bed technology showing complementarity between the technology components there is also an association some positive and some negative between the quantities of inputs such as the quantity of irrigation water applied and seed rate used and the adoption of raised beds some of these could be the results of reverse causality where the adoption of raised bed may be the cause and the quantities of inputs may be the effects but we believe that there are two way causalities for which estimation of the pairs of the selection and outcome equations using esr is appropriate 5 3 impact of the adoption of the raised bed technology in this study several indicators including yield downside risk on yield a proxy for changes in the likelihoods of obtaining low yield levels gross margins per capita wheat consumption from own production water productivity quantity of irrigated water and salinity were used to measure the impacts of adoption of rb based on the fiml estimation of the esr model table 2 the average expected treatment and heterogeneity effects of the adoption of rb on yield and downside yield risk are presented in table 3 the results of the ols estimation of impacts of adoption of rb on gross margins per capita wheat consumption from own production water productivity quantity of irrigated water applied and soil salinity are presented in table 4 5 4 impacts on yield and downside yield risk model results show that adopters of the rb technology are on the average obtaining about 112 65 kg ha 1 46 yield gain which is much less than the 25 yield gain documented in past project reports for the mechanized raised bed mrb technology the fact that this study does not make any distinction between types of raised beds manual vs mechanized width and height of beds width and depth of furrows and row vs broadcast planting may have contributed to the discrepancy the developers of the rb machine argue that depending on how they are constructed some traditional raised beds might even lead to reduced yields but still results of the downside risk analysis show that adopters of rb are enjoying 11 8 less risks of lower yields which in the face of climate change and growing problem of soil and water salinity is a great benefit had non adopters used the technology our results show that they would have obtained 1505 kg ha 21 6 higher yields than their current average which is closer to what was reported earlier for mechanized raised beds these yield gains would also be accompanied by a very high level over 540 of risk reduction showing that the benefits that will be enjoyed by those who are yet to adopt rb are far greater than what has been realized by those who have already adopted combining these results we can conclude that a typical wheat farmer in the sample provinces can obtain on the average 12 79 increase in yield 5 5 impacts of adoption of raised beds on consumption gross margin input use and soil salinity we have also analyzed the impacts of the adoption of the raised bed technology on several socio economic and environmental indicators while we found that adoption of rb led to significant benefits in some indicators we also found that it does not have significant effects on some others for example as can be seen from column a in table 4 the adoption of rb led to an increase in wheat consumption from own production by 18 kg capita year 21 87 results in column b also show that adoption of rb led to a 1042 25 egp or us 58 25 per ha 7 5 increase in gross margins the fact that the percentage increase in gross margins for a typical wheat farmer in the sample provinces is lower than the percentage gain in yield shows that adoption of rb also led to a net increase in the costs of production the additional labor cost for manually constructed raised beds can be a contributor the data we have collected in the survey is only on broad cost items including land preparation which can include cost of land levelling tillage construction of raised beds etc for which we don t have data specifically on the cost of building raised beds therefore the service fee farmers pay for having mechanized raised beds on their fields might also be higher to make the total cost of production to be higher to reduce the percentage gains in gross margins the results in columns c and d in table 4 show that adoption of rb has the added benefit of reducing the amount of irrigation water applied by 804 89 m3 ha 15 05 and the associated benefit of increasing water productivity by 0 08 kg m3 5 56 these benefits have very high importance in egypt not only because the magnitudes are high and the country continues to face irrigation water shortages but also because they can justify the rb technology from all the social economic and environmental dimensions adoption of rb also has a clear impact on the reduction of the seeding rate column f by 23 35 kg ha 16 71 we had also looked at the impacts of the adoption of the raised bed technology on the amounts of tsp and nitrogen fertilizers applied and the total amount of labor used however the results showed that it did not have significant impacts adoption of rb is found to have no significant effect on soil salinity column e a disappointing result as soil salinity is a growing concern in egypt and almost all irrigated production systems of the world the scientists who developed the raised bed machine rbm argue that if we looked at only the fields cultivated by the rbm or manually with careful adherence to the bed width and height and furrow width and depth specification can reduce the salinity problem as they are designed to enhance the efficiency of drainage and reduce the quantity of water to be applied our results might have been confounded by several factors first we have wide variation of raised beds which are bundled into one group as rb where some of the manually constructed rb might actually be counterproductive second analysis of soil salinity is best done using carefully designed study based on actual measurement of soil salinity on the spot or based on analysis of carefully collected soil samples unfortunately the only data we had for this analysis was farmers subjective assessment of the salinity level of their fields as low moderate or high in general though lower in magnitude our results are consistent with findings of past research in other parts of the world for example in a study conducted in pakistan soomro et al 2017 found that the use of raised bed led to 24 65 higher yield 50 73 water saving and 54 37 water productivity in wheat production relative to conventional flood irrigation system in a study carried in bangladesh mollah et al 2015 found that grain yield on 70 cm wide beds was 0 5 t ha 21 higher than that of conventional tillage zhongming et al 2005 reported that in wheat production in the hexi corridor of china the use of raised beds led to the reduction of 750 m3 ha of irrigation water 6 conclusions this paper analyzed the social economic and environmental impacts of the raised bed technology rb in egypt rb has several benefits including significant gains in yield and gross margins significant reductions in quantities of inputs including the amounts of irrigation water and seed and the added advantage of higher water productivity adoption of rb however didn t have significant effects on soil salinity to enhance the benefits of the rb technology scientists from the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda and the agricultural research center arc of egypt have developed a raised bed machine which helps the construction of the beds with the optimal specifications of the beds and furrows while at the same time reducing labor demand thereby minimizing farmers drudgery to construct the structures while the benefits estimated in this study are high enough the scientists who developped the technology believe that even higher benefits can be expected if the traditional raised beds were excluded from the analysis and the benefits of row planting included the main implication of our results is that it is important to invest in the dissemination of rb by enhancing farmers awareness of the social economic and environmental benefits of the technology future studies in this topic should close the knowledge gap by making comparisons not only between traditional tillage and raised beds in general but also between the mechanized raised beds constructed with the optimal specifications and traditional raised beds that are constructed with suboptimal specifications

10143,raised beds rb are hailed as means to mitigate the problem of excessive irrigation however their adoption and impacts in egypt are not well documented this paper is based on survey data collected from a sample of 691 wheat fields drawn from three major wheat producing provinces of egypt using area weights for upward aggregation we estimated that 19 3 of total wheat area in the three provinces is cultivated with raised beds we applied the endogenous switching regression model to analyze the socioeconomic biophysical and environmental impacts of rb model results showed that the adoption of rb led to a 937 kg ha 12 79 increase in yield a us 77 60 ha 9 47 increase in gross margins an 824 63 m3 ha 15 05 reduction in irrigation water application 16 7 reduction in seeding rate 5 56 increase in water productivity and an 11 80 reduction in downside yield risk adoption of rb didn t have significant effect on soil salinity and quantities of fertilizer and labor inputs these results show that rb can provide panacea to several interrelated socioeconomic biophysical and environmental problems associated with irrigation the policy implication of our findings is that egypt and other similar countries can benefit from embracing rb as part of the technology packages promoted by their national agricultural extension systems the benefits to these countries will increase if they invest more on research for adapting and perfecting the rb technology including its mechanization and its efficacy in soil salinity management keywords raised beds impact socioeconomic irrigation water input quantity soil salinity 1 introduction in the late 2000s irrigated lands constituted about 20 of total global cultivated land thenkabail et al 2009a 40 of total food production thenkabail et al 2009b and 65 of total ground and surface water exploited by humans thenkabail 2010 after a decade the share of irrigation in total croplands and in total food production have reduced to 20 and 40 respectively while the share in total ground and surface water exploited by humans has increased to 70 world bank 2020 indicating that irrigation has sizeable role not only in determining the sustainability of water resources but also on the ability of the human race to produce sufficient food over time several challenges associated with irrigation including ground water depletion water conflicts soil salinization and hence yield loss are emerging some of these problems are aggravated by farmers mismanagement this paper provides field level empirical evidence from egypt on whether the use of raised beds in irrigated wheat production helps mitigate some of these challenges ground water is being depleted at a faster pace and competition among countries and communities sharing the same water sources is increasing due to growing demand for water and large regional variations in the distribution of the endowments wada et al 2010 the increased competition for water along with the increasing scarcity of surface water resources are in some cases leading to water conflicts levy and sidel 2011 another challenge facing our world is soil salinity which results from the accumulation of salt above levels that adversely affect plant growth shrivastava and kumar 2015 regardless of the irrigation method poor water management practices including insufficient leaching and poor drainage are bound to accumulate salts at and beyond the rooting zone causing soil salinity shahid 2013 salinized areas are steadily growing at a rate of 10 per year currently costing the world about us 27 billion per year zaman et al 2018 left unchecked by 2050 salinity is expected to affect more than 50 of croplands worldwide jamil et al 2011 all the challenges discussed above show the very high importance of irrigation in food water and soil security koch et al 2012 thenkabail et al 2010 and hence the due attention that it deserves therefore introduction of effective ways of sustainably conserving water and timely recognition of salinity symptoms in irrigated fields and use of appropriate soil and water management practices may save further degradation of water and soil resources and costly reclamation efforts shahid 2013 the different irrigation methods that are currently used by farmers can be broadly classified into five categories namely flood furrow sprinkler subsurface and localized irrigation methods kandiah 1994 historically flood irrigation also known as traditional surface irrigation has been the most dominant irrigation method bilibio et al 2011 yigezu et al 2014 this method is characterized by poor control over water distribution and hence associated with low water use efficiency yigezu et al 2013 irmak et al 2011 poor water management under flood irrigation is also often associated with soil salinity problems shahid 2013 with surface irrigation applying an optimal equivalent to the leaching requirement amount of water to leach the salt down through the soil profile is the desired method for maintaining suitable soil salinity thompson et al 2010 however there are tradeoffs between the two goals of increasing water use efficiency and reducing salinity for example in the face of scarcity of water and the associated growth in the use of low quality water the tendency to increase the water use efficiency in irrigation can lead to the accumulation of salts in the soil as the leaching fraction is reduced and the salts contained in the irrigation water are not leached enough machado and serralheiro 2017 in egypt the main source of irrigation is fresh water from the nile and flood irrigation is the most common irrigation method therefore the main cause of salinity in the country is capillary effect due to excessive application of irrigation water in areas where the ground water table is shallow especially in lower egypt the main strategy used in the country for mitigating salinity problems has been developing drainage structures for the crop lands subsurface drainage system is widely applied in the nile delta to withdraw the excessive irrigation water from the root zone and lower the groundwater level the drainage water is officially reused after mixing with canal fresh water to adjust the salinity farmers also unofficially reuse drainage water moreover farming in the nile delta is highly intensified and diversified because farm sizes are very small an average of 0 5 acre per family as a result farmers apply excessive amount of fertilizers in order to maximize their farm income in the absence of proper leaching and soil management such practices also increase the salinity level in the soil therefore all efforts aimed at identifying appropriate irrigation methods should be driven not only by water use efficiency considerations but also their implications on salinity the other methods of irrigation are less common especially in the production of cereals but play important roles in fruit and vegetable production drip irrigation is perhaps the best irrigation technology because it ensures uniformity in water application and hence enhances plant growth saves water by minimizing evaporation reduces nutrient leaching and requires lower labor input especially for land leveling however it may not work when irrigation water has high iron content as it can create clogging maintenance cost can also be high and tubes can be easily damaged by rodents and insects causing leakages sprinkler irrigation is efficient on soils with medium and coarse texture and water can be applied at low rates however frequent application may be needed to recharge soil moisture depleted by the crop while furrow irrigation requires low initial investment on equipment and involves lower pumping costs it involves higher labor costs and lower application efficiency compared to sprinkler and subsurface drip irrigation for example albaji et al 2010 found that drip and sprinkler irrigation methods are more effective and efficient than surface irrigation however soil texture salinity and slope can be major limiting factors for sprinkler irrigation for drip irrigation the calcium carbonate content can be an additional limiting factor by reducing the amount of water application while also allowing excess water to drain into open collector which discharges it off the field raised beds are effective in enhancing yield water productivity and soil structural and chemical properties including reducing soil salinity mcdonald 2019 soomro et al 2017 devkota et al 2015 amer et al 2011 velmurugan et al 2016 acuña et al 2011 bakker et al 2005 ahmad and mahmood 2005 planting on beds can also lead to the reduction in fungal and other diseases with improved radiation interception acquisitive temperature and reduced humidity in the canopy enabling farmers to reduce their pesticide applications alwang et al 2018 however while raised beds have several advantages their suitability in mixed crop livestock systems is yet to be established manik et al 2019 raised beds have long history in egypt where several farmers apply it for several crops including vegetables the adoption of raised bed technology in egypt is increasing due to its multiple benefits alwang et al 2018 swelam 2016 however the types and extents of benefits from raised beds depend on the dimensions of beds and its associated farrows and the method of implementation manual or mechanized sowing method rows vs broadcasting and seeding rates in recognition of the benefits of the raised bed technology the shortcomings of traditional designs and the threats that continue to constrain agricultural production in the north african and west asia regions the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda and its national and international partners have carried intensive research between 2004 and 2008 proof of concept which led to the design and testing of a raised bed machin between 2009 and 2012 ultimately icarda in collaboration with the agricultural research center arc of egypt developed prototypes for raised bed machines that are adapted and suitable to the local socio economic and agroecological conditions in the country since 2012 there have been concerted efforts to out scale the raised bed technology in general and the mechanized raised bed mrb technology in particular in egypt through at least five different projects while good progress was made during the implementation of the projects a breakthrough was not made until after the policy makers in egypt got convinced by the appropriateness and advantages of the mrb technology in 2016 as a result of which mrb has been included as one component of the wheat technology package that is widely being popularized through the national wheat campaign of the government if the use of the mrb continues to expand at its current pace an estimated 800 thousand ha of land is projected to be under the technology by 2023 alwang et al 2018 however it is important to note that an inappropriate implementation of raised beds can lead to yield reduction if the bed width is too large and furrow depth is too shallow due to water stress on the middle rows because water does not reach the effective root zone the design and introduction of raised beds should carefully factor the soil type and salinity level raised beds should also be packaged with other appropriate technology components such as crop variety and fertilizer and seed rates because different varieties perform differently depending on the specifications of the beds and whether the soils are salt affected sandy or clay therefore using raised beds without proper advisory services can lead to negative effects on yield and soil health maintaining the delicate balance between the specifications of the raised beds and identification of the other complementary technology components can be complicated which may in many cases affect the adoption of the technology especially by mostly uneducated smallholders national research partners from many other countries including morocco tunisia algeria nigeria and sudan have also shown interest to introduce the technology into their respective countries as a result the project called enhancing food security in arab countries efsac implemented jointly by icarda and arc which promoted the raised bed technology in egypt also carried adaptation and testing activities in all these countries efsac 2018 this indeed is an exciting moment for icarda and its partners which invested a lot of time efforts and resources into developing and perfecting the mrb technology as it has great potential to transform agriculture in irrigated areas of many countries in the north african and west asian regions and more other regions with similar biophysical conditions however it remains unanswered whether the technology can be a panacea for several agricultural problems in irrigated agriculture and providing the expected social economic biophysical and environmental benefits to the farmers who are using it and their surroundings using data collected to measure the impacts of a technology package that was introduced to enhance wheat productivity in egypt this paper attempts to shed some light on the levels of adoption and impacts of the raised bed rb technology on wheat fields in three major wheat growing provinces namely al sharkia al dakahlia and kafr al sheikh in the nile delta region specifically the paper provides estimates of 1 economic benefits in terms of yield and net returns 2 social benefits in terms of the amount of labor needed and the reduction of downside yield risk in wheat production and 3 biophysical environmental benefits in terms of reducing the quantity of irrigation water applied per unit of area m3 ha increasing water productivity kg m3 and reducing salinity ds m unfortunately the data that was collected did not make distinction between different types of raised beds mechanically or manually constructed width and height of beds width and depth of furrows between beds seeding methods row planting vs broadcasting and seeding rate the traditional manually constructed raised beds are still common in egypt especially in vegetable cultivation while they are starting to be replaced by mechanized raised beds in cereal cultivation as a result about 40 50 of all raised beds in wheat fields in the study governorates are estimated to be constructed manually or semi mechanically using chisel plow therefore despite our earnest desire to measure the impacts of the mechanized raised beds the results of our study cannot be explicitly attributed to mechanized raised beds nor to the manually constructed raised beds hence we report the impacts of raised beds in general regardless of their type the findings of our study are believed to be useful to inform future research and extension and guide policy and development efforts in egypt and many similar countries facing the challenges associated with irrigated agriculture 2 the raised bed technology in egypt egypt has a total of 3 69 million ha 8 8 million feddan of agricultural land out of which an estimated 3 61 million ha 97 7 is irrigated with the remaining 84 000 ha rainfed the nile river is the main source of water in the country therefore agriculture heavily depends on the nile river from which it obtains about 55 5 billion m3 year of water due to the highly fertile alluvial soils and availability of water for irrigation wheat productivity in egypt is the highest in africa for example average wheat yields in the country stands at about 6 7 ton ha which is much higher than the african average of 2 6 t ha faostat 2019 however because of rapid population growth the country is under pressure to open new lands for cultivation thereby increasing the pressure on the limited water supply moreover available water resources have reduced by over 80 in the last century fao 2016 new upstream initiatives might also potentially compromise the amount of water egypt will get in the future another domestic challenge egypt is currently facing is that because of the accumulation of salts mostly at the soil surface 35 of the agricultural land is suffering from salinity reducing the yield potential of the agricultural lands raised beds have been considered by some farmers as a good practice for irrigated land and have been used in egypt since long time alwang et al 2018 however given the high labor demand for their construction their adoption has been limited in view of the current and potential future challenges for agriculture in egypt the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda and its national partners including the agricultural research center arc of egypt have carried long term research to improve the efficacy of raised beds for the conservation not only of water and soil but also of agricultural labor to this effect they designed a raised bed machine rbm for which a prototype has been developed and validated the machine has been tested in various parts of the country and demonstrated clear advantages in terms of enhancing yield and in saving irrigation water and labor for land cultivation relative to both the traditional surface irrigation and the traditional raised beds in the last decade yields of some field crops have increased while water consumption otherwise known as evapotranspiration et has slightly decreased due to wide adoption of new agronomic practices that reduce et these practices were introduced through different large research for development projects to improve the productivity of irrigated farming systems using surface irrigation these practices include raised bed soil salinity amendment packages including gypsum application biofertilizer leaching fraction etc lining irrigation canals gated pipe surface irrigation deficit irrigation as an optional practice to cope with water shortage condition and alternate furrow irrigation crop lands in egypt are generally flat with maximum slope of 5 however laser based land leveling is practiced in some crop lands to enhance irrigation efficiency currently in addition to the dissemination of raised bed technology the government of egypt is implementing a nation wide irrigation modernization initiative that mainly focuses on switching from surface flood irrigation to pressurized irrigation systems drip and sprinkler to reduce irrigation application in this connection the agriculture research center of egypt has recently developed and disseminated high yielding drought tolerant and water efficient crop varieties mainly of wheat barley and maize the scientists who developed the mechanized raised bed mrb technology argue that when accompanied with good practices it has the potential to reduce salinity increase photosynthesis and reduce diseases and pest prevalence in short mrb will provide a panacea for most of the irrigation related problems egyptian farmers are currently facing and may face in the future several initiatives and projects have tried to disseminate the mrb technology into six provinces between 2011 and 2014 a project funded by the international fund for agricultural development ifad and the project enhancing food security in the arab countries efsac funded by multiple donors in the arab world introduced the technology as part of a wheat technology package involving six other components in al sharkia governorate the same projects also promoted the technology in al dakahlia governorate between 2015 and 2018 since 2018 the efsac project popularized the technology in al behera governorate the mrb technology was also introduced in al assuit since 2015 by a project funded by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao a development program funded by the european union eu has also introduced the technology in al fayoum and al minia provinces since 2018 based on the evidence demonstrated by these projects policy makers in egypt were convinced on the appropriateness and advantages of the technology for which they have decided to include mrb as one component of the wheat technology package that is being widely popularized through the government s national wheat campaign nwc nwc has much larger coverage than all the projects mentioned above not only in terms of number of districts and villages covered but also in terms of number of farmers included in the popularization effort from each district and village as it is disseminating the mrb in 22 governorates across the country arc plans to increase the total cultivated area using rb from 1 000 000 acre in 2019 2020 to 1 037 843 acre in 2020 2021 fas 2020 several project reports showed that based on bivariate data analysis the adoption of the mechanized raised bed mrb technology was associated with 15 25 increase in yields 50 lower seed costs a 25 reduction in irrigation water and lower labor costs icarda 2017 swelam 2016 swelam and atta 2012 karrou et al 2012 since its dissemination in 2011 the mechanized raised bed technology has expanded in various parts of the country the raised beds constructed using the icarda arc raised bed machine are 130 cm wide and 50 m long the associated furrows are 20 40 cm wide and 20 30 cm deep the machine plants the seeds in straight rows and can be calibrated to the desired seeding rate optimally at 107 kg ha for wheat the recommended spacing for planting is 7 rows on each bed which are 15 cm apart at the same time a large number of farmers have been constructing permanent raised beds either semi mechanically or manually with their own modifications to the bed sizes farrow depths and widths for semi mechanical raised beds farmers first plant using broadcasting at a high seeding rate of above 145 kg ha and then prepare the raised beds using chisel plows while there is huge variation in the dimensions of the semi mechanically constructed raised beds they generally have much narrower beds than mrbs the traditional manually constructed raised beds on the other hand are much wider than the semi mechanically constructed beds but still slightly narrower than the fully mechanized similar to the semi mechanized raised beds farmers using the traditional manually constructed raised beds use broadcasting with high seeding rate of over 145 kg ha all types of raised beds are believed to have advantages in terms of irrigation water saving and yield over the traditional furrow and flood irrigation fig 1 experts estimate that up to 200 thousand ha of crop land is under raised beds out of which about 100 thousand ha are estimated to be under wheat the experts also estimate that some 40 50 of the raised bed in wheat lands is manually or semi mechanically constructed and more than half up to 60 thousand ha is estimated to be fully mechanized as the expansion of raised beds in wheat fields intensified mainly after the introduction of the raised bed machines unavailability of the rb machine is the main reason given for why some farmers are cultivating their wheat fields with semi mechanical or manually constructed raised beds non adopters of raised beds consider the land used as farrows between beds to be too much in the face of their small landholding while the benefits of raised beds regardless of the levels of mechanization seem to be widely agreed experts warn that some specifications followed in the construction of manual and semi mechanized raised beds might not deliver some or all of the benefits and in the extreme case may be harmful 3 data as described above between 2011 and 2018 the efsac project introduced a wheat technology package with a total of 10 components variety raised beds seed and fertilizer rates herbicide and pesticide rates planting and harvesting dates rotation and irrigation scheduling as part of the conclusion of the 2nd phase of the project there was a need to measure the adoption and impacts of the technology package to this effect the research team purposively included al sharkia and al dakahlia the only two governorates where the project introduced the technology package into the sample to see if the technology was expanding outside the project areas and also to make sure that the socio economic and environmental changes happening in al sharkia and al dakahlia are not also happening elsewhere one governorate kafr al sheikh was included into the survey as a control afterwards a multi stage stratified random sampling procedure was used to draw samples using power analysis the minimum sample size needed to ensure a confidence level of 95 and a precision level of at least 3 for estimates of adoption was determined to be 602 to account for missing values and for balancing of the samples across all sampling units the sample size was increased to 615 the sample households were then distributed across all three governorates proportional to their farmer populations to do this first districts and villages were stratified into project and non project districts and villages then random samples of project and non project districts and villages were selected for inclusion into the sample then at the level of villages the primary sampling units farm households were randomly drawn using the master file containing all wheat growers of each village as sampling frames given that the main objective of this study is to draw lessons from the project interventions there was concern that by taking random samples of farmers at the village levels we may run the risk of not having sufficient number of farmers in the sample who have adopted one or more of the technologies promoted by the project to overcome this potential problem the research team decided to first take a random sample of 426 households 70 of the total sample size using a random sampling procedure and then randomly select the remaining 189 households 30 of the total sample only from among those who were project participants by so doing the team ensured having sufficient number of farmers who used each technology component in the sample descriptive statistics for selected variables are presented in table 1 4 methods one of the main challenges in the estimation of average treatment effects is related to establishing counterfactuals as selection bias is often inherent in program participation egyptian wheat farmers may self select into or out of the adoption of the raised bed technology for various reasons some farmers may adopt it because they believe that they have the right soil tractor s manpower and special knowledge skills abilities and expertise and as a result have stronger motivation to adopt the technology other farmers may have reasons including lack of manpower shallow soil and confidence and negative attitude to believe that the technology will not work for them moreover some important explanatory variables are very difficult to measure and hence despite all efforts remain missing in the data and hence are omitted from the regression as a result the problem of endogeneity is likely to be present during estimation which left unaddressed might lead to erroneous inferences depending on the source of bias several econometric approaches can be used to address the problem of selection bias in program evaluation using quasi experimental and observational data imbens and wooldridge 2009 provide a good review of the literature and the developments in causal inference and impact assessment propensity score matching psm due to rosenbaum and rubin 1983 is by far the most widely used for improving causal inference and estimation of average treatment effects el shater et al 2016 morgan and winship 2014 henderson and chatfield 2011 jalan and ravallion 2003 propensity score matching psm helps in correcting biases introduced only by observable covariates heckman and vytlacil 2007 therefore results from psm can sometimes be misleading since unobservable factors such as skills and motivation can influence not only the outcome but also the program participation decision thereby leading to confounding errors see austin 2008 for critical review of pms to overcome this problem two other methods namely the instrumental variables iv regression angrist and pischke 2009 and endogenous switching regression maddala and nelson 1975 methods have been proposed in this paper we employ the endogenous switching regression esr approach for estimating treatment effects of the adoption of raised bed rb among egyptian wheat farmers 4 1 endogenous switching regression esr the difference in the outcomes of interest between adopters and non adopters may not only be due to observable heterogeneity but also due to unobserved heterogeneity bidzakin et al 2019 paltasingh and goyari 2018 khonje et al 2015 malikov and kumbhakar 2014 therefore we use an endogenous switching regression esr to account for both observable and unobservable endogeneity of the adoption decision by simultaneously estimating the adoption function eq 1 and the outcome equation of interest for each group eq 2 or 3 theoretically farmers decide to adopt a technology when the expected utility received from adoption d 1 is greater than the utility received from non adoption d 0 while utility is not observable adoption is observable and is treated as a dichotomous choice d 1 if d 1 d 0 and d 0 if d 1 d 0 thus following bidzakin et al 2019 shiferaw et al 2014 and lokshin and sajaia 2011 the esr can be formulated as follows with the adoption decision selection equation modeled as 1 d i z i β ε i with d i 1 if d i d 0 otherwise d i 0 where z represents a matrix of the explanatory variables ß is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ε a vector representing normally distributed error term with mean zero and variance σ ε 2 the outcome equations can also be formulated as 2 y 1 x 1 ω 1 ϵ 1 if d 1 3 y 0 x 0 ω 0 ϵ 0 if d 0 where y i is a vector of dependent variables representing outcomes for adopters y 1 and non adopters y 0 x i is a matrix of explanatory variables some of which may be in z where for proper identification of the model z contains at least one explanatory variable which is not in x ω i is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 are error terms the error terms from the three equations ε ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 are assumed to have a trivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and a symmetric covariance matrix as shown in lokshin and sajaia 2011 if ε is correlated with ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 the expected values of ϵ 1 and ϵ 0 conditional on the sample selection are non zero if σ ϵ 1 ε and σ ϵ 0 ε are statistically significant this would indicate that the decision to adopt and the outcome variable of interest are correlated suggesting evidence of sample selection bias therefore estimating the outcome equations using ordinary least square ols would lead to biased and inconsistent results and heckman procedures heckman 1979 are normally used in the face of heteroscedastic error terms the full information maximum likelihood film estimator can be used to fit an endogenous switching regression that simultaneously estimates the selection and outcome equations to yield consistent estimates the esr can be estimated where the actual expected outcomes of adopters 4 and non adopters 5 and the counterfactual hypothetical cases that the non adopters did adopt 6 and the adopters did not adopt 7 can be analyzed as follows 4 e y 1 d 1 x 1 ω 1 σ ϵ 1 ε λ 1 5 e y 0 d 0 x 0 ω 0 σ ϵ 0 ε λ 0 6 e y 0 d 1 x 1 ω 0 σ ϵ 0 ε λ 1 7 e y 1 d 0 x 0 ω 1 σ ϵ 1 ε λ 0 finally we calculate the average treatment effect on the treated att as the difference between 4 and 7 and the average treatment effect on the non adopters atu as the difference between 6 and 5 di falco et al 2011 lokshin and sajaia 2011 lokshin and glinskaya 2009 miranda and rabe hesketh 2006 carter and milon 2005 we also compute the effect of base heterogeneity for the group of adopters bh1 as the difference between 4 and 6 and for the group of non adopters bh2 as the difference between 7 and 5 a number of factors such as varieties used and the amounts of fertilizers seed labor quantity of irrigation water are important in determining yield which in turn will affect the gross margins and water productivity moreover for farmers to adopt the mechanized raised bed mrb by far the dominant type accounting for 70 80 of total raised beds it is necessary that they have access to rented or privately owned raised bed machine rbm therefore we use availability of the raised bed machine as instrument in the estimation of the esr version 15 of the stata software statacorp 2017 was used for all the data analysis carried in this study 5 results and discussion 5 1 model diagnostics the durbin wu hausman test hausman 1978 was carried to examine if endogeneity is a problem for the estimation of impacts of the adoption of the raised bed technology on yield downside risk on yield per capital wheat consumption gross margins water productivity quantity of irrigation water applied and soil salinity the test results showed that endogeneity was indeed a problem in the yield and downside risk equations for which we used the endogenous switching regression esr for estimation of the treatment effects however for the rest of the equations the test results showed that endogeneity was not a problem and hence we used the ordinary least squares ols regression which is efficient an exogenous variable which is excluded from the list of covariates is needed to serve as an instrumental variable for identification during the simultaneous estimation of the selection and outcome equations for an excluded exogenous variable to be a valid instrument it must be sufficiently correlated with the included endogenous regressors but uncorrelated with the error term angrist and pischke 2009 stock et al 2002 we believe that the adoption of the raised bed technology is correlated with the availability of raised bed machines and hence we use the number of raised bed machines per 10 000 ha of wheat area in each district rbm 10k ha as an instrument a falsification test di falco et al 2011 showed that rbm 10k ha does not have a direct effect on the outcome variables yield and downside risk on yield except through its effect on adoption of the raised bed technology further justification for the use of rb 10k ha as an instrument is that since 2012 different projects have purchased and distributed about 120 of the icarda arc raised bed machines to promote the mechanized raised bed technology especially in the al sharkia and al dakahlia provinces village level data on the availability of raised bed machines would be a much better instrument but the data that we were able to obtain is only at district level we believe that the district level figures will still be valid because most service providers both public and private are located in the district capitals where they serve all farmers who are interested and have the financial means to pay for the services within the district the downside of this instrument is that about 40 50 of all raised beds in wheat fields are manually or semi mechanically constructed and hence may make the instrument weak for example the correlation between the adoption of the raised bed technology and the instrument rbm 10k ha is 0 36 making it not very strong as a result the use of the endogenous switching regression esr which can also be identified through the assumed non linearities is justified robustness checks were also carried comparing several alternative specifications of the models the results from esr were also compared with results of an ols regression the results show that the signs of coefficients of only few variables changed while the values of almost all parameter estimates showed slight changes however their significance levels remained stable likewise the estimates of treatment effects from the esr model were found to be stable in terms of all the sign magnitude and statistical significance of the effects 5 2 determination of the level and explaining adoption of raised bed based only on the random sample of 426 households the average farmer population weighted adoption rate of the raised bed technology in the three sample provinces is 17 61 al sharkia province has the highest district level number of wheat growers weighted adoption rate with 38 27 of farmers cultivating wheat using the raised bed technology followed by al dakahlia at 10 32 while none of the farmers in the kafr al sheikh province are using the technology the corresponding district wheat area weighted adoption degrees in each province stand at 39 57 13 03 and 0 00 respectively leading to a wheat area weighted adoption degree in all three provinces of 19 28 the fact that the of wheat area under rb cultivation is higher than the of farmers using the technology shows that on the average relatively larger farmers are using the technology estimates of the full information maximum likelihood fiml estimation of the selection and outcome equations of the esr models for yield and downside risk on yield are provided in table 2 as the main objective of this paper is to measure impacts of rb only a brief discussion of the results pertaining to the factors affecting the adoption of rb is provided here from column a in table 2 we can see that several variables have statistically significant effects on farmers decision on whether to adopt the raised bed technology as expected the number of raised bed machines per 10 000 ha of wheat land in each district rbm 10k ha which is used as an instrument in the esr model has a positive and significant effect on farmers adoption decision likewise participation in past projects which promoted wheat technology packages including the raised bed machine also has a positive and significant effect on farmers adoption decision farmers with medium to deep soils are also found to have a higher propensity to adopt raised beds farmers decisions to adopt the other technology packages including rotation and the recommended planting and harvesting dates have positive and significant effects on the adoption of the raised bed technology showing complementarity between the technology components there is also an association some positive and some negative between the quantities of inputs such as the quantity of irrigation water applied and seed rate used and the adoption of raised beds some of these could be the results of reverse causality where the adoption of raised bed may be the cause and the quantities of inputs may be the effects but we believe that there are two way causalities for which estimation of the pairs of the selection and outcome equations using esr is appropriate 5 3 impact of the adoption of the raised bed technology in this study several indicators including yield downside risk on yield a proxy for changes in the likelihoods of obtaining low yield levels gross margins per capita wheat consumption from own production water productivity quantity of irrigated water and salinity were used to measure the impacts of adoption of rb based on the fiml estimation of the esr model table 2 the average expected treatment and heterogeneity effects of the adoption of rb on yield and downside yield risk are presented in table 3 the results of the ols estimation of impacts of adoption of rb on gross margins per capita wheat consumption from own production water productivity quantity of irrigated water applied and soil salinity are presented in table 4 5 4 impacts on yield and downside yield risk model results show that adopters of the rb technology are on the average obtaining about 112 65 kg ha 1 46 yield gain which is much less than the 25 yield gain documented in past project reports for the mechanized raised bed mrb technology the fact that this study does not make any distinction between types of raised beds manual vs mechanized width and height of beds width and depth of furrows and row vs broadcast planting may have contributed to the discrepancy the developers of the rb machine argue that depending on how they are constructed some traditional raised beds might even lead to reduced yields but still results of the downside risk analysis show that adopters of rb are enjoying 11 8 less risks of lower yields which in the face of climate change and growing problem of soil and water salinity is a great benefit had non adopters used the technology our results show that they would have obtained 1505 kg ha 21 6 higher yields than their current average which is closer to what was reported earlier for mechanized raised beds these yield gains would also be accompanied by a very high level over 540 of risk reduction showing that the benefits that will be enjoyed by those who are yet to adopt rb are far greater than what has been realized by those who have already adopted combining these results we can conclude that a typical wheat farmer in the sample provinces can obtain on the average 12 79 increase in yield 5 5 impacts of adoption of raised beds on consumption gross margin input use and soil salinity we have also analyzed the impacts of the adoption of the raised bed technology on several socio economic and environmental indicators while we found that adoption of rb led to significant benefits in some indicators we also found that it does not have significant effects on some others for example as can be seen from column a in table 4 the adoption of rb led to an increase in wheat consumption from own production by 18 kg capita year 21 87 results in column b also show that adoption of rb led to a 1042 25 egp or us 58 25 per ha 7 5 increase in gross margins the fact that the percentage increase in gross margins for a typical wheat farmer in the sample provinces is lower than the percentage gain in yield shows that adoption of rb also led to a net increase in the costs of production the additional labor cost for manually constructed raised beds can be a contributor the data we have collected in the survey is only on broad cost items including land preparation which can include cost of land levelling tillage construction of raised beds etc for which we don t have data specifically on the cost of building raised beds therefore the service fee farmers pay for having mechanized raised beds on their fields might also be higher to make the total cost of production to be higher to reduce the percentage gains in gross margins the results in columns c and d in table 4 show that adoption of rb has the added benefit of reducing the amount of irrigation water applied by 804 89 m3 ha 15 05 and the associated benefit of increasing water productivity by 0 08 kg m3 5 56 these benefits have very high importance in egypt not only because the magnitudes are high and the country continues to face irrigation water shortages but also because they can justify the rb technology from all the social economic and environmental dimensions adoption of rb also has a clear impact on the reduction of the seeding rate column f by 23 35 kg ha 16 71 we had also looked at the impacts of the adoption of the raised bed technology on the amounts of tsp and nitrogen fertilizers applied and the total amount of labor used however the results showed that it did not have significant impacts adoption of rb is found to have no significant effect on soil salinity column e a disappointing result as soil salinity is a growing concern in egypt and almost all irrigated production systems of the world the scientists who developed the raised bed machine rbm argue that if we looked at only the fields cultivated by the rbm or manually with careful adherence to the bed width and height and furrow width and depth specification can reduce the salinity problem as they are designed to enhance the efficiency of drainage and reduce the quantity of water to be applied our results might have been confounded by several factors first we have wide variation of raised beds which are bundled into one group as rb where some of the manually constructed rb might actually be counterproductive second analysis of soil salinity is best done using carefully designed study based on actual measurement of soil salinity on the spot or based on analysis of carefully collected soil samples unfortunately the only data we had for this analysis was farmers subjective assessment of the salinity level of their fields as low moderate or high in general though lower in magnitude our results are consistent with findings of past research in other parts of the world for example in a study conducted in pakistan soomro et al 2017 found that the use of raised bed led to 24 65 higher yield 50 73 water saving and 54 37 water productivity in wheat production relative to conventional flood irrigation system in a study carried in bangladesh mollah et al 2015 found that grain yield on 70 cm wide beds was 0 5 t ha 21 higher than that of conventional tillage zhongming et al 2005 reported that in wheat production in the hexi corridor of china the use of raised beds led to the reduction of 750 m3 ha of irrigation water 6 conclusions this paper analyzed the social economic and environmental impacts of the raised bed technology rb in egypt rb has several benefits including significant gains in yield and gross margins significant reductions in quantities of inputs including the amounts of irrigation water and seed and the added advantage of higher water productivity adoption of rb however didn t have significant effects on soil salinity to enhance the benefits of the rb technology scientists from the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas icarda and the agricultural research center arc of egypt have developed a raised bed machine which helps the construction of the beds with the optimal specifications of the beds and furrows while at the same time reducing labor demand thereby minimizing farmers drudgery to construct the structures while the benefits estimated in this study are high enough the scientists who developped the technology believe that even higher benefits can be expected if the traditional raised beds were excluded from the analysis and the benefits of row planting included the main implication of our results is that it is important to invest in the dissemination of rb by enhancing farmers awareness of the social economic and environmental benefits of the technology future studies in this topic should close the knowledge gap by making comparisons not only between traditional tillage and raised beds in general but also between the mechanized raised beds constructed with the optimal specifications and traditional raised beds that are constructed with suboptimal specifications

very complex uncertain and ambiguous horan et al 2011 agent based modeling approach was used in this research to model the complex socio ecological system agent based models abms have emerged as a way to capture and model the complexity of sess schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 castilla rho et al 2015 bakarji et al 2017 jaxa rozen et al 2019 van strien et al 2019 aghaie et al 2020 an agent is an autonomous decision making unit of the system that has unique modifiable objectives characteristics and behaviors macal and north 2006 akhbari and grigg 2015 abms are usually object oriented computer programs in which objects are actors at different levels for example residents farmers union organization authorities making rule based decisions according to the feedbacks and environment conditions zellner 2008 an actor is an individual or aggregated social entity collective actor with the ability to make independent decisions and act as a unit pahl wostl 2005 khatibi et al 2012 takes an overview of evolutionary processes in the development of abm and berglund 2015 reviewed studies of agent based modeling and introduced the abm as an active area of research in water resources several major advantages in abm have made it powerful in modeling sess including individual decision making considering interactions feedbacks and heterogeneity in agents characteristics and behaviors incorporating social ecological processes structures norms and institutional factors and implementing behavior theories or models an 2012 miyasaka et al 2017 abms are introduced as practical tools to address the conflicts in tracking the common pool resources management challenges bars et al 2002 akhbari and grigg 2013 this feature helps to evaluate real world scenarios and makes it feasible to examine the impacts of any changes in the environment on feedback and behavioral reactions such as ones emerging from institutional regulation and various social and institutional developments schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 chu et al 2009 in groundwater resources management abms show the potential for a substantial capacity to design robust policies and incentives to help for balancing agricultural production potable water supply and also ensure the sustainability of aquifers castilla rho et al 2015 farhadi et al 2016 nouri et al 2019 in order to achieve this goal the participatory modeling framework in agent based modeling would facilitate communication stakeholder identification and analysis and have a better management practice in sess reeves and zellner 2010 an uncertainty analysis was performed in the present study to face various sources of uncertainty reflecting insufficient knowledge of the system processes in abms as other modeling tools of complex adaptive sess uncertainty assessment has been considered as an important issue in socio ecological research including environmental modeling e g warmink et al 2010 nguyen et al 2013 land use change and land cover e g pontius and neeti 2010 hyun et al 2019 etc due to inherent uncertainties abm can benefit from uncertainty analysis in incorporating various factors including lack of sufficient information and change of attitude of an actor resulting from environmental changes and or the passage of time ballarini et al 2009 these inherent uncertainties may arise and can be expressed by the uncertainty in the parameters of the behavioral utility functions in a probabilistic form in this study the ses is based on the dynamic interaction between abm and artificial neural network ann models artificial intelligence models such as ann have been utilized in individual based and agent based models in the past research but to represent the decision making processes and consequent behaviors of agents e g huse and giske 1998 jäger 2019 of course farhadi et al 2016 use the ann model to increase the computational speed of the modflow model but in this study the ann model was successfully replaced with the numerical model to simulate the behavior of aquifer as the environment of agent based model the framework was developed in an object oriented programming more suitable for considering the agent based approach without limitations of the software used in some studies due to the high capacity of the used framework the model has the capability of intelligent agents with the feasibility of implementing parallel behavioral activities the framework provided a high capability in modeling communications of stakeholders at the various individual group and institutional levels including relationships between water institutions according to the literature review the latter issue has not received much attention in the previous research the ability to exchange different types of messages has made the interactions modeled with the proposed framework closer to what is happening in reality in brief the literature review identified the research gaps including i they did not focus on the interaction of institutions and the effect of communications on the farmer agents ii messaging between intelligent agents was not specifically considered in many cases iii many researchers ignored some important social characteristics of farmer agents such as risk taking this study aimed to treat the gaps by developing a framework which brings consensually together two primary dimensions including i three kinds of agents two institutional agents and farmer agents ii and their interactions with each other and with the environment providing a real world example the impact of organizational coordination on effective governance was illustrated considering intergovernmental interactions in the framework to address the effect of incentives and policy levers the developed framework was applied to the water resources challenges in shabestar sofian plain ssp lake urmia basin lub iran in a participatory approach the key stakeholders agents were identified using social surveys questionnaires and interviews the objectives attributes and behavioral patterns of the agents were recognized and agents interactions with each other and with the environment were defined in the stakeholder analysis process this approach was also used to adjust the behavioral simulation model based on stakeholder feedback the target society of interviews included a diverse range of provincial and local managers and experts as well as farmers from different villages in the study area 2 case study lake urmia is located between the provinces of east azerbaijan and west azerbaijan northwest iran and has been renowned as a unique ecological region it is a ramsar site unesco biosphere reserve conservation of iranian wetlands project 2008 and one of the largest saline lakes in the world lub is facing a serious crisis due to the absence of a planning system that encourages poor water governance and significant over exploitation khatibi et al 2020 fig 1 shows the water level elevation changes of the lake on the fixed day of december 25 for the last five decades the average water level elevation over the past 20 years and the past 5 years has been 2 2 m and 3 5 m lower than the lake s ecological elevation respectively this means that there has been an average of about 12 5 km3 of water shortage in the lake over the past 5 years during the last decades the poor planning systems including the construction of a large number of dams without a proper operation plan have encouraged to develop the irrigated farming area to almost three times and have led the cropping patterns towards water intensive crops as a result many of the lub sub basins have been faced with a sharp groundwater drawdown resulting in a wide range of impacts including land subsidence as investigated by nadiri et al 2018 and consequently are classified as critical areas of the country by the government fig 2 shows the location maps of lub and ssp as one of the most critical aquifers in lub it includes 12 selective piezometers and zoning within the aquifer in this paper see section 4 2 the total area of the shabestar sofian region is equal to 1314 km2 of which about 501 km2 is a plain with 3804 farmland parcels the maximum and minimum altitude of this study area is 3060 and 1280 m above sea level respectively the average annual rainfall in the region is 324 mm and the average annual temperature in the highlands and the plain is 9 3 c and 11 2 c based on daryan and benis shanjan weather stations respectively in shabestar sofian plain there are five seasonal rivers the most important of which is the daryan river with an average flow of 0 53 cubic meters per second in ssp total water demand is 104 million m3 of which 84 million m3 is supplied from groundwater resources and 20 million m3 from surface water resources the urban and rural public sector uses about 9 of water equal to 9 5 million m3 about 1 equal to 1 million m3 is used by the industry sector and about 90 equal to 93 5 million m3 is used by the irrigation sector according to the observation data from 27 piezometric wells in the study area the average groundwater level drawdown in ssp is about 10 m in the last three decades fig 3 an annual average of approx 80 million m3 is extracted from 665 active wells in recent years while the annual infiltration is estimated to be about 70 million m3 considering the irrigation return flow therefore based on these simple figures the aquifer is depleted by 10 million m3 per annum in recent studies the average groundwater level drawdown in ssp is reported to be about 63 cm per year the stakeholders of the water sector in ssp include a wide range of individuals and institutions among the individual agents there are water consumers including farmers potable water subscribers and industrial units in the study area farmers as the main consumers of groundwater resources about 90 are the most important individual agents on which this research is focused in ssp civil institutions include farmer s house agricultural trade union and onion production cooperative formed by the organization of agriculture jihad oaj however due to the top down approach in the governance of these agricultural institutions and their structural problems they have not been able to play their due role in the actions and decision making processes of the study area governmental and semi governmental institutions involved in water sector issues include regional water authority oaj environment organization water and wastewater organization industry mining and trade organization forests range and watershed management organization islamic parliament of iran court of justice and provincial government although all of these institutions are related to water issues only a few are directly responsible for managing water resources in the region as this study focuses on groundwater consumption in the agricultural sector two governmental institutions are taken in the abm regional water authority rwa and oaj top down governmental organizations at the provincial level other institutions are also effective in water governance by setting and monitoring the water sector laws judicial support budget allocation and implementation of consumption management programs however they are not modeled due to the limitation of the present study the groundwater resources are mainly managed by rwa which is responsible for application review of the well permits blocking unpermitted wells monitoring the withdrawal of permitted wells and generally monitoring the status of groundwater resources the overall management of the agricultural sector is the responsibility of the oaj it includes arrangement and implementation of agricultural land management programs promotion of suitable crop pattern granting of facilities for agriculture development supply and distribution of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers conducting agricultural research and training and promotion of new cultivation and irrigation technologies one of the significant problems in ssp is the lack of coordination in the policies of organizations which are in contact with the farmers especially the two mentioned governmental institutions oaj mainly targets the promotion of cultivation and production of more crops which conflicts with the rwa to reduce water consumption at the national level groundwater restoration and balancing program grbp has been defined in recent years as an extensive groundwater conservation program to reduce the trend of groundwater depletion and to create more coordination to achieve the aquifer balance in critical study areas in grbp a series of projects were defined to move towards the rehabilitation of the aquifers including installing the smart meters on agricultural wells promoting water saving technologies such as modern irrigation technologies and implementing participatory management as a few examples the capabilities of abm are used to illustrate the effects of a number of grbp projects on socio economic parameters as well as aquifer balance in ssp 3 model description 3 1 model elements description the overall framework of the model depicted in fig 4 comprises i the two primary dimensions in terms of three agents rwa oaj and farmer agents and ii their interactions with each other and with the environment objectives characteristics and rules governing agents behaviors are as follows 3 1 1 farmer agents the main objective of farmer agents is to maximize the amount of income or earned capital a series of characteristics attributed to each of the farmer agents in the model includes static characteristics such as agent identification aid and neighborhood region and dynamic characteristics such as capital available water cultivated area and irrigation technology for instance one of the important characteristics of any farmer agent considered in the model is the level of conservatism or resistance to the change the conservatism parameter of a farmer agent is considered to recognize the farmer s willingness to modify their previous approaches and moving towards intended policies see section 4 6 it should be noted that farmer agents are considered in the model based on the operation wells in ssp 3 1 2 rwa agent the main objective of this agent is preventing the further degradation of the aquifer and moving towards the restoration of groundwater resources in this regard rwa declares the maximum allowable water withdrawal of the wells each year based on the aquifer conditions it controls the well extractions based on issued license and water allocations especially using the smart meters if installed in the developed abm the available water of each farmer agent is determined based on the maximum allowable withdrawal declared by a message on the first of each water year period 3 1 3 oaj agent the responsibility of this institutional agent is to improve the situation of agricultural sectors and in particular it aims to increase the crop products in the region the top down and high level policies dictate oaj to reduce water use and increase efficiency in the agricultural sector therefore oaj attempts to implement some projects including modifying the crop pattern and mechanizing the irrigation systems it uses stakeholder education and incentive policies such as paying grants to farmers to change the irrigation technology to move towards the goals 3 1 4 the environment one of the important elements of the model is the aquifer with which the agents interact as the model environment in the sess of the water resources different actors with their behaviors and decisions affect the environment and mutually are affected by it groundwater level will decrease due to reduced recharge increased abstraction or a combination of both causes ann is used to model the groundwater resources since the anns are coded as a java class an object of this class is built into the abm and an interactive abm ann link is created to cover the two way interaction between agents and the environment see section 4 2 as an artificial intelligence model ann attempts to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks as processing information the neural network consists of a set of interconnected primary processing units called neurons multilayer perceptron mlp is a feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers of neurons feedforward means that data flows from the input to the output layer forward neurons in hidden layers are processing units that use transferring functions such as sigmoid log sigmoid and hyperbolic the backpropagation learning algorithm is widely used for training this kind of network rojas 1996 mean square error mse and correlation coefficient cc between the observed data and the corresponding simulated results are used to measure the performance of the network 3 2 actors behavior patterns and decision making process research on farmers decision making process following institutional policies and implementing the new approaches e g using new pumping and irrigation technologies has shown that gaining the maximum economic profit has an essential role in the farmer s behaviors direction janssen and van ittersum 2007 holtz and pahl wostl 2012 each farmer agent is defined by some characteristics such as current capital available water cropping pattern cultivated area and irrigation technology since the 1990s a wide range of other factors has been identified in empirical studies that includes farmer psychology and market structure to social environment factors pahl wostl 2002 however little information is available on contributing these different factors to the farmers decisions janssen and van ittersum 2007 on the whole the developed model should put more emphasis on the impact of economic profit on farmers decision making process along with consideration of other factors as an example of farmers behavior patterns in the model it can be considered to calculate the probability of changing the irrigation technology of a farmer agent from traditional to modern using eq 1 according to the surveys changing the irrigation technology of a farmer agent depends on four factors available capital the influence of neighbors conservatism parameter and water shortage of the agent 1 p i r r c h a n g e α e c a p β e n e i g h b o r γ e c o n s λ e d e f α β γ λ where e c a p is the effect of farmer capital e n e i g h b o r is the neighborhood effect e c o n s is to the effect of conservatism parameter and e d e f is the water shortage effect on the farmer agent decision about using modern irrigation technology the parameters α β γ and λ show the effectiveness of the variables which are determined based on the local conditions and using the results of questionnaires 3 2 1 economic factor in decision making process box 1 is used to calculate the farmer income in the model considering the importance of the economic factors in farmer agents decision making schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 considered a linear relationship between supply and annual farmer income based on a simple approximation of the linear relationship of water deficit to yield however the crops are affected by water stress in varying degrees depending on their growth stages and the severity of water scarcity and it is required to investigate each crop yield in the local condition for more details see rao et al 1988 bennett and harms 2011 doorenbos and kassam 1979 proposed eq 2 for the relationship between plant water use and crop production 2 1 y a y x k y 1 e t a e t x where y x and y a are maximum and real yields e t x and e t a are maximum and real evapotranspiration respectively and k y is a yield response factor that reflects the effect of reducing evapotranspiration on yield losses fao 2012 proposed k y values for several crops based on analyzing a large amount of available literature on crop yield and water deficit relationships table 1 for other crops that have not yet provided a specific number for k y in the literature the linear relationship k y 1 is assumed in the model farmer agents evaluate their financial results at the end of each year then based on the revenue and total capital along with other effective parameters such as water availability and neighborhood effect each farmer agent decides on the crop cultivated area installing the smart meter and the irrigation technology for the next year 3 3 agents interactions as discussed one of the characteristics of the agents is the ability to interact with other actors in the system farmer agents are involved in two types of interactions with each other the first one is the effect on the environment groundwater pumping which results in increased pumping costs for other agents this kind of interaction is an indirect mechanism of interaction between agents in this interaction model a third entity mediates the agents interaction the second type of interaction is the direct relationship between farmer agents this issue is considered in the model by providing information sharing or observing other agents for example in the neighborhood farmers in a village see section 3 4 1 in order to change the irrigation technology farmer agents apply for a grant by sending a request message to oaj the oaj receives the messages from farmer agents in a queue reviews the messages based on the time priority of receiving and the budget constraint set each year and sends a positive or negative response to the same farmer agent this kind of interaction between agents is similar to the communication of farmer agents and rwa for receiving more water to cover part of the shortage see section 3 4 1 3 4 java agent development framework in this study the model is implemented in the jade java agent development framework an agent based modeling library fully implemented in the java language it is an environment founded on the fipa specifications foundation for intelligent physical agent to enable the development of intelligent agents fipa 2002 jade supports the parallel and simultaneous activities of agents through the behavioral models and the possibility of creating different kinds of behavioral models using defined classes in this framework jade provides a high capacity for transmitting various acl messages agent communication language includes a set of standard specifications defined by fipa in a model for flexible and efficient communication between different agents caire 2009 besides due to the open source framework and access to a wide range of library classes and functions in java this framework provides most of this study s requirements 3 4 1 communication of agents in jade the jade framework uses fipa standard interaction protocols as standard templates under which various tools are defined to build agent communications including acl messages df directory facilitator ams agent management service and gui messaging exchanging acl messages between agents is a usual tool of agents communication in jade by generating the agent identifier aid from its local name to send different types of text messages and objects for example the values of a variable the messages can be sent to a specific agent or a group of agents with specified characteristics and the message recipient can also process it in predefined conditions the messages can share information between agents inform template such as sharing information on irrigation technology of neighboring farmer agents another example of the templates is the request for an agent from another agent request template in the model the farmer agent sends a request message to rwa in the case of a serious water shortage fig 5 rwa receives messages sent by different farmer agents in a message queue to process them according to the rwa policy based on the interviews with the authorities in the first 2 years a maximum of two requests and in the next 3 years just one request per year is agreed for each farmer agent and the amount of additional allocation is sent to the same aid in a reply message by agreement template agree for more requests a reply message will be sent by disagreement template refuse in receiving and processing messages the time of responding will vary depending on the number of received messages which corresponds to what is happening in reality another communication tool in the jade framework is the directory facilitator df framework known as the yellow page service in this method one or more agents define a specified service maybe an information package with a specific name and type and registers it on yellow pages by searching for the type of a specific service on the yellow page other agents find the agents that provide it and receive the desired service for example each farmer agent in the case of changing irrigation technology declares this change by registering on the yellow page with its local name and the neighborhood code as the service type at the end of each year so farmer agents can be informed about the irrigation technology situation in their neighborhood area by searching in df services and decide about their irrigation system in the next year 4 model construction 4 1 crops attributes in this model eleven different types of crops are considered which form the dominant cropping pattern of the region table 2 the price of products and production costs per hectare including fertilizer pesticide seed labor and pumping are calculated using the census data on the sale prices for products and the cost of agricultural services it should be noted that crop prices and production costs have fluctuated in recent years due to high inflation and devaluation of the national currency in iran and the values in table 2 are based on constant prices in 2017 two general types of irrigation systems are considered in the ssp model including traditional flood irrigation and modern drip and sprinkler irrigation technologies according to the implementation of irrigation practices in the region irrigation efficiency in the flood sprinkler and drip irrigation technologies are 0 42 0 65 and 0 8 respectively 4 2 groundwater simulation model based on evaluation of observed groundwater level from piezometers in ssp and removal of ones with incomplete or inappropriate historical data series 12 piezometers were selected in the study area with 180 months of data length 2002 2016 the 12 location zones were identified using the thiessen polygon method and each operating well is coded in a location zone fig 2 for each location zone an ann model is developed in the form of eq 3 3 g e t f w 1 g e t 1 w 2 p t 1 w 3 e t 1 w 4 q t 1 where g e t is groundwater elevation at time t as an output node of the network f is the transfer function in ann sigmoid function is used w 1 w 4 are the weights of the input nodes in the network and g e t 1 groundwater elevation p t 1 precipitation e t 1 evaporation and q t 1 total discharge of the zone are input nodes of the network at the time t 1 according to the available historical data of each piezometer 80 144 months are used for training and 20 36 months for testing each of the 12 networks table 3 shows the training and testing characteristics and mse and cc results which indicate a relatively acceptable condition for most anns however in the case of zones 3 and 5 the network situation is somewhat poor due to the lack of appropriate piezometric data and should be updated in the future the results for zone 1 presented in fig 6 exemplify the training and testing models 4 3 uncertainty analysis quantification and analysis of uncertainty can help to examine decisions based on the level of uncertainty for uncertainty analysis there is a need for a multiple model run in which the values of the parameters random variables are randomly selected from their respective probability distributions according to the monte carlo simulation approach a total of 20 parameters leading to uncertainty in the model results were identified in the entire model setup as empirical data for parameters are only partially available a uniform probability density function is used to model the parameters based on the expert opinions eight model parameters can have different values during the simulation period different values each year due to uncertainty including the crop water demand the price of crops which have a guaranteed purchase by the government wheat and barley the price of other crops crop yield per irrigated area water scarcity effect on crop yield yield response factor cost of changing irrigation technology the amount of budget allocation for smart meters installation and the amount of budget allocation to grant the changing irrigation technology the uncertainty of these parameters is due to the factors such as climate variability market fluctuations and budgetary constraints over the years and also lack of sufficient information the other parameters have constant values during each run including irrigation efficiency for each technology the percentage of return flow to the aquifer the minimum extra available water of a farmer agent to enter the decision making process to increase cultivated area the percentage of farmer agents that increase their cultivated area if there are other conditions the percentage of farmer agents having illegal water withdrawal the initial capital of a farmer agent initial annual life cost of a farmer agent the effect of granting in changing irrigation technology and α β γ and λ in eq 1 the uncertainty of these parameters is mainly due to a lack of sufficient social and economic studies and uncertainty in the experts opinions 4 4 validation validation in abm is a real challenge validation represents what a model provides in its application domain at a satisfactory level compared with our expected results from the model bars et al 2002 the abms have validity if a subject expert or a panel of experts confirms the quality of simulation results and the causal chain through which input parameter settings cause the simulated output in accordance with the real world phenomena vermeulen and pyka 2016 in the model this issue is performed by researchers considering outputs such as the trend of changing the cultivation area during the simulation period separately for each irrigation technology trends of economic benefit at micro and macro levels and changes in groundwater level these outputs are compared with the actual situation of the study area according to the experienced experts opinions also the processes defined in the model such as the causal chain in changing the irrigation method or the communication processes defined between the farmer agents rwa and oaj are evaluated by the subject experts as discussed in section 4 2 the calibration and validation of the groundwater simulation model the ann model ensure the feedback of the abm environment in this study a qualitative research method is used to analyze stakeholders this qualitative study complies with the following assumptions i in qualitative research saturation rule has been widely accepted as a methodological principle saunders et al 2018 in this study based on this rule the interviews with farmers experts and managers of rwa and oaj continued until no further new issue or additional information was discovered ii regarding the validation methods in qualitative research the interview transcripts were examined by the researcher s self monitoring and member checks techniques as riege 2003 stated iii convergent interviewing techniques were used to ensure reliability semi structured protocols were designed to follow a specific procedure which helped maintain reliability and provide repeatable reasonable results as rao and perry 2003 stated iv triangulation of interview questions and analysis of negative issues in designing the interview protocol the existence of several interviewers separately but parallel to each other peer debriefing and the use of the steering committee have increased the validity of this qualitative research as proposed by riege 2003 and lisa 2006 4 5 regulatory levers and formulation of scenarios it is necessary to make immediate but equitable decisions and apply equitable regulatory levers that can control hyperconsumption over the capacity of the aquifer to stop the rapid deterioration of groundwater resources and reclamation of these vital resources in ssp equitability is vital and will be considered in future studies but this study focuses on main policy levers in grbp to evaluate their effects on consumption pattern modification aquifer reclamation and socio economic variables the following dimensions are detailed for the formulation of seven scenarios including the baseline i well monitoring project wmp ii license adjustment coefficient lac and iii two variations of promoting modern irrigation technologies pmit notably the baseline scenario bs is initialized with no special policy implementation 4 5 1 wells monitoring project wmp in the absence of smart meters many farmer agents withdraw groundwater beyond the amount set in the well licenses i e formal rules and regulations in grbp the installation of well smart meters is one of the important programs to reduce the probability of disobedience from the formal rules in addition to monitoring programs attention should be paid to the livelihood of farmers especially in smallholder farms with subsistence farming moreover the monitoring should be implemented fairly throughout the plain one of the reasons for the failure of this project has been the feeling of injustice in its implementation in the wmp scenario according to the rwa program the installation of meters is planned over a period of 5 years in the model if the value of well monitoring variable is true for a farmer agent according to the surveys the probability of extracting more than the well license is reduced from 90 to 10 however due to the uncertainty in the studies these parameters are included in the model with 10 uncertainty in the early years of the project implementation local institutions have decided to adopt a particular policy to avoid sudden economic pressure on farmers upon request of each farmer there will be a possibility to allocate a further 20 withdrawal beyond the wells withdrawal license the model procedure was described in section 3 4 1 fig 5 4 5 2 license adjustment coefficient lac due to the severe negative groundwater balance in ssp one of the plans designed for aquifer reclamation is to reduce the license of all agricultural wells lac is set to reduce the well permits by 20 during 5 years until the aquifer deficit is offset in the model the rwa announces the allowable amount of withdrawals to farmer agents based on each well s initial license and the same adjustment coefficient as an informative message inform template at the beginning of each year each farmer agent receives this message and adjusts the variable of available water based on the message 4 5 3 promoting modern irrigation technologies pmit changing the farms irrigation technology to high efficiency systems is another important policy considered in grbp in recent years oaj has a wide spreading program to encourage farmers to change their irrigation systems the program includes financial levers in the form of paying grants to farmers and also educational practices in the model farmer agents send a request message to oaj for grant allocation to their farm oaj receives and process the messages in its message queue and replies to them in an agreement template up to the annual budget of the project more requests are postponed to the next year if the value of grant variable of a farmer agent is true the value of the variable e c a p in eq 1 will be equal to 1 this means that this agent will have a maximum score in terms of the amount of capital required to change the irrigation method however since the effect of the capital parameter in this case will be more significant in the probability of changing the irrigation method according to surveys the α parameter will be increased between 10 and 30 in uncertainty analysis this is the first scenario considered in the pmit project pmit 1 a policy is considered to make the oaj grant conditional on the installation of meters to assist wmp implementation in pmit 2 oaj will check the wells meter installation as a prerequisite in processing the request messages of farmer agents in addition to the remaining annual budget constraint table 4 describes a set of six sample combinations of policy levers implemented in the model for example the effect of applying the combination of wmp and lac as two rwa policy levers to reduce extractions is evaluated in the second scenario sc 2 4 6 sensitivity analysis on weather variability and behavioral mechanisms it is possible to investigate the model sensitivity on changes in behavioral patterns of stakeholders using the developed framework as an example the effect of changing the conservatism parameter on the model results is evaluated conservatism parameter of farmer agents as a criterion for the degree of risk aversion or risk seeking can affect the decision making process sensitivity analysis is performed by considering three conditions including neutral society risk seeking society rss and risk averse society ras to show the parameter effects on the results in the neutral condition it is assumed to have a normal distribution for the conservatism parameter of farmer agents i e a risk neutral society rss is implemented by considering a skew factor of 0 6 in the curve fitting process while in ras it is assumed to have a skew factor of 0 6 three precipitation sensitivity tests are evaluated in combination with management scenarios to examine the effects of climate variability in this regard three periods of wet dry and relatively normal are identified in the historical data and assumed as different weather conditions it helps to have a better projection of what groundwater resources may face given the regulatory levers in the near future 5 results and discussion the uncertainty analysis for each scenario described in table 4 was implemented in the model to have outputs of 200 realizations each of which has a set of random variables for different uncertain parameters a period of 20 years with an average equal to the long term average of ssp is selected for the weather parameters of precipitation and evaporation in the groundwater simulation model to have a normal weather condition as an environmental indicator fig 7 illustrates the monthly time series of groundwater elevation resulting from the sample scenarios implementation compared to the bs the hydrograph of the aquifer is obtained from 12 piezometers of location zones using the thiessen polygon method shaded areas show the uncertainty of the results emerging from 20 uncertain input parameters the total annual net income as an economic index is illustrated in fig 8 for the scenarios this index is calculated based on the sum of farmer agents net income presented in box 1 in each annual time step shaded areas indicate 95 confidence intervals in different realizations for each scenario due to no significant change in earnings after the tenth year the total annual net income chart has been plotted until this year the bs will result in a catastrophic groundwater level drop of about 8 m in the simulation period fig 7 and there is an almost constant total annual net income fig 8 however due to the critical situation of the aquifer it may cause wells to run dry and may result in water quality degradation in part of the study area it in turn will lead to a reduction in total net revenue therefore qualitative studies are required in the future in sc 1 the wmp project alleviates negative aquifer balance during the simulation period and despite existing fluctuations in dry years there is no change in the groundwater elevation although wmp reduces groundwater resource degradation the total annual net income will be reduced by more than 4 million about a 22 decrease in annual revenue as a result of increasing farmer agents water stress level it should be noted that according to expert opinions the probability of unauthorized withdrawals during the installation of smart meters is reduced from about 90 to about 15 which is applied with a 10 uncertainty in the model lac wmp implementation in sc 2 has a significant impact on the reduction of extraction therefore the groundwater level will increase by about 5 5 m and given the uncertainty it will even be possible to increase the water level up to 7 m nevertheless some farmer agents will be under tremendous economic pressure and the total annual net income will fall by 36 7 million consequently this scenario cannot be a sustainable solution to the problem due to social challenges the implementation of modern irrigation network systems is considered one of the major programs to reduce consumption in grbp however in sc 3 not only it has not improved aquifer status but also has exacerbated the problem this has occurred for two main reasons first due to the availability of more water to the farmer agents and the tendency of the farmers to have more income the cultivated area will increase according to the conditions defined in the model these include the amount of capital needed to increase the cultivated area the requirement for a minimum amount of extra water for the added demand and the impact of the fallow area factor of the farmer agent model results in the run of sc 3 show that the total cultivated area will increase by approximately 5000 ha about 40 during the simulation period in addition with less water available the farmer agents grow crops under deficit irrigation in some cases with less crop production due to the water stress box 1 the second reason is the removal of about 10 million m3 return flow towards the aquifer due to the use of pressurized irrigation systems according to studies in the region the return flow in traditional irrigation systems is about 10 15 on the other hand this scenario generates the most revenue for the farmers and results in a 6 6 million 34 increase in total annual net income the model implementation results in sc 4 show that the simultaneous implementation of modern irrigation development and well monitoring projects will be more sustainable however in this scenario groundwater resources status has not yet improved and even the aquifer has declined slightly about 1 5 m total annual net income has increased by about 5 5 million which is favorable for the growth of the agricultural economy in ssp considering lac in sc 5 significantly improves the aquifer status with the groundwater level increased by approximately 5 m during the simulation period although the aquifer s recovery rate is lower than the second scenario unlike sc 2 the total annual net income increases by 1 3 million the results are very close in both scenarios 5 and 6 contrary to expectations the dependence of oaj granting on the installation of the meters did not significantly improve the situation the reason is the assumption of proper funding by the rwa for the implementation of wmp given that sc 5 has a significant impact on the improvement of groundwater resources the aquifer balance is positive in this scenario and the income level of farmer agents increases slightly it is considered the top scenario among others fig 9 illustrates the run results of the model for a sample sensitivity analysis on the weather variations and risk taking behavior of farmer agents for the selected scenario see section 4 6 under pessimistic conditions during the dry period the aquifer condition is constant relative to the beginning of the simulation period and no change in the aquifer level is observed fig 9a assuming a wet weather period under optimistic conditions there is a significant improvement in the status of the aquifer resulting in an elevation groundwater level increase of 11 m fig 9c it is noteworthy that the dry and wet periods do not significantly impact the overall income of farmers i e less than 1 on average the reason for this is the strict conditions imposed by the rwa that have limited more extraction even in wet conditions the importance of these results is that decision builders can predict different future conditions and plan the necessary actions in each case for example in consecutive wet periods conservation restrictions may be reduced proportionally by the level of the aquifer improvement at the discretion of decision makers the risk taking behavior of farmer agents has been more influential in the results of the early years of projects execution as is evident the changes in the conservatism parameter of the farmers community do not significantly impact the changes in groundwater level fig 9b this is due to the effect described in sc 3 i e increase in the cultivation area the removal of return flow and thus neutralize the reduction in consumption caused by increased irrigation efficiency however the impact of changing risk taking behavior on farmers income especially in the early years of project implementation is more apparent and leads to an increase in total annual net income by up to 10 in the rss condition fig 9d 6 conclusion in this study an uncertain social ecological model was developed using agent based modeling as a decision support tool and it was used in the shabestar sofian plain iran as a case study this extendable tool treats some of the complexity of real world systems including system dynamics feedback and heterogeneity it considers the links between the coherent patterns of relationships between individuals groups and the institutions of the systems this model allows decision makers to have sufficient flexibility for optimistic and pessimistic situations rather than rigid planning for the future by considering the uncertainty of the parameters the ability of the model as a virtual laboratory to evaluate different management scenarios was demonstrated by examining the results of a set of sample scenarios and analyzing the sensitivity of the results to weather and behavioral conditions the developed framework considers social parameters such as risk taking and neighbors impact as social learning economic parameters such as water stress cropping pattern and irrigation method and environmental parameters such as groundwater level to achieve the most sustainable decisions in water resources management the framework was implemented to evaluate a number of management scenarios as combinations of policy levers including wells monitoring license adjustment and promoting modern irrigation technologies based on the results the coordinated implementation of the policy levers defined in the fifth scenario not only can stop the aquifer decline but also lead to a 5 m increase in groundwater level this result along with a slight increase in the total income of farmers indicates a possible sustainable solution in this scenario although this result will be achieved by training and participation of farmers it provides some evidence that policymaking can avert the ongoing catastrophe it should be noted that solutions proposed in this study alone and without the policy of replacing agriculture with suitable industries can not fully restore the aquifer and return it to the normal condition although the model is developed specifically for a particular aquifer it can easily be extended to other regions and more complex systems additionally different management policies and various combinations of scenarios can be evaluated in the proposed framework to minimize the high costs of managerial mistakes the ability to provide customized user interfaces in the framework operation enables users including authorities and local communities to communicate and can train the target community this study considers only two more effective institutions in the problem that can be developed in future studies the paper does not consider the equitability of water distribution among the farmers however this will be considered in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10144,socio ecological systems include diverse resources of complexity involving complicated interactions feedback dynamic behavior patterns heterogeneity in agents characteristics and behaviors as well as system uncertainties agent based modeling is introduced as a tool to simulate different levels of stakeholders and interactions including individual group and institutional agents in complex socio ecological systems in the present study an agent based model was developed to explore sustainable solutions in uncertain conditions for groundwater restoration of a critical aquifer in the lake urmia basin iran different projects for aquifer restoration such as wells monitoring license adjustment and modern irrigation development were implemented in the developed framework the results showed that it is possible to alleviate the negative balance of the aquifer in case of necessary coordination in the projects implementation so that during the simulation period while increasing the total annual net income of the cultivation by 1 3 million about 7 the groundwater level drawdown can be compensated by about 5 m about 50 of the decline over the past 30 years results of sensitivity analysis on the risk taking behavior of farmer agents showed that it has a more significant impact on the total income than groundwater level in the risk seeking society conditions a 10 increase of total annual net income is expected in the early years of simulation the framework is used to learn about the influences of agents objectives characteristics and behaviors on the system variability systematic analysis in such a framework provides a better understanding of system structures to support decision making under uncertainty in a participatory process keywords groundwater resources agent based modeling water resources management behavioral model complexity analysis stakeholders 1 introduction a socio ecological simulation framework was developed in the present study to model the interaction between groundwater resources and the stakeholder society experts evaluation has proven that issues relating to groundwater resources include complex socio ecological systems sess also called human environmental systems zellner 2008 social behavior and dynamic interactions between different components of a water resources system including human environment interactions are often very complex uncertain and ambiguous horan et al 2011 agent based modeling approach was used in this research to model the complex socio ecological system agent based models abms have emerged as a way to capture and model the complexity of sess schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 castilla rho et al 2015 bakarji et al 2017 jaxa rozen et al 2019 van strien et al 2019 aghaie et al 2020 an agent is an autonomous decision making unit of the system that has unique modifiable objectives characteristics and behaviors macal and north 2006 akhbari and grigg 2015 abms are usually object oriented computer programs in which objects are actors at different levels for example residents farmers union organization authorities making rule based decisions according to the feedbacks and environment conditions zellner 2008 an actor is an individual or aggregated social entity collective actor with the ability to make independent decisions and act as a unit pahl wostl 2005 khatibi et al 2012 takes an overview of evolutionary processes in the development of abm and berglund 2015 reviewed studies of agent based modeling and introduced the abm as an active area of research in water resources several major advantages in abm have made it powerful in modeling sess including individual decision making considering interactions feedbacks and heterogeneity in agents characteristics and behaviors incorporating social ecological processes structures norms and institutional factors and implementing behavior theories or models an 2012 miyasaka et al 2017 abms are introduced as practical tools to address the conflicts in tracking the common pool resources management challenges bars et al 2002 akhbari and grigg 2013 this feature helps to evaluate real world scenarios and makes it feasible to examine the impacts of any changes in the environment on feedback and behavioral reactions such as ones emerging from institutional regulation and various social and institutional developments schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 chu et al 2009 in groundwater resources management abms show the potential for a substantial capacity to design robust policies and incentives to help for balancing agricultural production potable water supply and also ensure the sustainability of aquifers castilla rho et al 2015 farhadi et al 2016 nouri et al 2019 in order to achieve this goal the participatory modeling framework in agent based modeling would facilitate communication stakeholder identification and analysis and have a better management practice in sess reeves and zellner 2010 an uncertainty analysis was performed in the present study to face various sources of uncertainty reflecting insufficient knowledge of the system processes in abms as other modeling tools of complex adaptive sess uncertainty assessment has been considered as an important issue in socio ecological research including environmental modeling e g warmink et al 2010 nguyen et al 2013 land use change and land cover e g pontius and neeti 2010 hyun et al 2019 etc due to inherent uncertainties abm can benefit from uncertainty analysis in incorporating various factors including lack of sufficient information and change of attitude of an actor resulting from environmental changes and or the passage of time ballarini et al 2009 these inherent uncertainties may arise and can be expressed by the uncertainty in the parameters of the behavioral utility functions in a probabilistic form in this study the ses is based on the dynamic interaction between abm and artificial neural network ann models artificial intelligence models such as ann have been utilized in individual based and agent based models in the past research but to represent the decision making processes and consequent behaviors of agents e g huse and giske 1998 jäger 2019 of course farhadi et al 2016 use the ann model to increase the computational speed of the modflow model but in this study the ann model was successfully replaced with the numerical model to simulate the behavior of aquifer as the environment of agent based model the framework was developed in an object oriented programming more suitable for considering the agent based approach without limitations of the software used in some studies due to the high capacity of the used framework the model has the capability of intelligent agents with the feasibility of implementing parallel behavioral activities the framework provided a high capability in modeling communications of stakeholders at the various individual group and institutional levels including relationships between water institutions according to the literature review the latter issue has not received much attention in the previous research the ability to exchange different types of messages has made the interactions modeled with the proposed framework closer to what is happening in reality in brief the literature review identified the research gaps including i they did not focus on the interaction of institutions and the effect of communications on the farmer agents ii messaging between intelligent agents was not specifically considered in many cases iii many researchers ignored some important social characteristics of farmer agents such as risk taking this study aimed to treat the gaps by developing a framework which brings consensually together two primary dimensions including i three kinds of agents two institutional agents and farmer agents ii and their interactions with each other and with the environment providing a real world example the impact of organizational coordination on effective governance was illustrated considering intergovernmental interactions in the framework to address the effect of incentives and policy levers the developed framework was applied to the water resources challenges in shabestar sofian plain ssp lake urmia basin lub iran in a participatory approach the key stakeholders agents were identified using social surveys questionnaires and interviews the objectives attributes and behavioral patterns of the agents were recognized and agents interactions with each other and with the environment were defined in the stakeholder analysis process this approach was also used to adjust the behavioral simulation model based on stakeholder feedback the target society of interviews included a diverse range of provincial and local managers and experts as well as farmers from different villages in the study area 2 case study lake urmia is located between the provinces of east azerbaijan and west azerbaijan northwest iran and has been renowned as a unique ecological region it is a ramsar site unesco biosphere reserve conservation of iranian wetlands project 2008 and one of the largest saline lakes in the world lub is facing a serious crisis due to the absence of a planning system that encourages poor water governance and significant over exploitation khatibi et al 2020 fig 1 shows the water level elevation changes of the lake on the fixed day of december 25 for the last five decades the average water level elevation over the past 20 years and the past 5 years has been 2 2 m and 3 5 m lower than the lake s ecological elevation respectively this means that there has been an average of about 12 5 km3 of water shortage in the lake over the past 5 years during the last decades the poor planning systems including the construction of a large number of dams without a proper operation plan have encouraged to develop the irrigated farming area to almost three times and have led the cropping patterns towards water intensive crops as a result many of the lub sub basins have been faced with a sharp groundwater drawdown resulting in a wide range of impacts including land subsidence as investigated by nadiri et al 2018 and consequently are classified as critical areas of the country by the government fig 2 shows the location maps of lub and ssp as one of the most critical aquifers in lub it includes 12 selective piezometers and zoning within the aquifer in this paper see section 4 2 the total area of the shabestar sofian region is equal to 1314 km2 of which about 501 km2 is a plain with 3804 farmland parcels the maximum and minimum altitude of this study area is 3060 and 1280 m above sea level respectively the average annual rainfall in the region is 324 mm and the average annual temperature in the highlands and the plain is 9 3 c and 11 2 c based on daryan and benis shanjan weather stations respectively in shabestar sofian plain there are five seasonal rivers the most important of which is the daryan river with an average flow of 0 53 cubic meters per second in ssp total water demand is 104 million m3 of which 84 million m3 is supplied from groundwater resources and 20 million m3 from surface water resources the urban and rural public sector uses about 9 of water equal to 9 5 million m3 about 1 equal to 1 million m3 is used by the industry sector and about 90 equal to 93 5 million m3 is used by the irrigation sector according to the observation data from 27 piezometric wells in the study area the average groundwater level drawdown in ssp is about 10 m in the last three decades fig 3 an annual average of approx 80 million m3 is extracted from 665 active wells in recent years while the annual infiltration is estimated to be about 70 million m3 considering the irrigation return flow therefore based on these simple figures the aquifer is depleted by 10 million m3 per annum in recent studies the average groundwater level drawdown in ssp is reported to be about 63 cm per year the stakeholders of the water sector in ssp include a wide range of individuals and institutions among the individual agents there are water consumers including farmers potable water subscribers and industrial units in the study area farmers as the main consumers of groundwater resources about 90 are the most important individual agents on which this research is focused in ssp civil institutions include farmer s house agricultural trade union and onion production cooperative formed by the organization of agriculture jihad oaj however due to the top down approach in the governance of these agricultural institutions and their structural problems they have not been able to play their due role in the actions and decision making processes of the study area governmental and semi governmental institutions involved in water sector issues include regional water authority oaj environment organization water and wastewater organization industry mining and trade organization forests range and watershed management organization islamic parliament of iran court of justice and provincial government although all of these institutions are related to water issues only a few are directly responsible for managing water resources in the region as this study focuses on groundwater consumption in the agricultural sector two governmental institutions are taken in the abm regional water authority rwa and oaj top down governmental organizations at the provincial level other institutions are also effective in water governance by setting and monitoring the water sector laws judicial support budget allocation and implementation of consumption management programs however they are not modeled due to the limitation of the present study the groundwater resources are mainly managed by rwa which is responsible for application review of the well permits blocking unpermitted wells monitoring the withdrawal of permitted wells and generally monitoring the status of groundwater resources the overall management of the agricultural sector is the responsibility of the oaj it includes arrangement and implementation of agricultural land management programs promotion of suitable crop pattern granting of facilities for agriculture development supply and distribution of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers conducting agricultural research and training and promotion of new cultivation and irrigation technologies one of the significant problems in ssp is the lack of coordination in the policies of organizations which are in contact with the farmers especially the two mentioned governmental institutions oaj mainly targets the promotion of cultivation and production of more crops which conflicts with the rwa to reduce water consumption at the national level groundwater restoration and balancing program grbp has been defined in recent years as an extensive groundwater conservation program to reduce the trend of groundwater depletion and to create more coordination to achieve the aquifer balance in critical study areas in grbp a series of projects were defined to move towards the rehabilitation of the aquifers including installing the smart meters on agricultural wells promoting water saving technologies such as modern irrigation technologies and implementing participatory management as a few examples the capabilities of abm are used to illustrate the effects of a number of grbp projects on socio economic parameters as well as aquifer balance in ssp 3 model description 3 1 model elements description the overall framework of the model depicted in fig 4 comprises i the two primary dimensions in terms of three agents rwa oaj and farmer agents and ii their interactions with each other and with the environment objectives characteristics and rules governing agents behaviors are as follows 3 1 1 farmer agents the main objective of farmer agents is to maximize the amount of income or earned capital a series of characteristics attributed to each of the farmer agents in the model includes static characteristics such as agent identification aid and neighborhood region and dynamic characteristics such as capital available water cultivated area and irrigation technology for instance one of the important characteristics of any farmer agent considered in the model is the level of conservatism or resistance to the change the conservatism parameter of a farmer agent is considered to recognize the farmer s willingness to modify their previous approaches and moving towards intended policies see section 4 6 it should be noted that farmer agents are considered in the model based on the operation wells in ssp 3 1 2 rwa agent the main objective of this agent is preventing the further degradation of the aquifer and moving towards the restoration of groundwater resources in this regard rwa declares the maximum allowable water withdrawal of the wells each year based on the aquifer conditions it controls the well extractions based on issued license and water allocations especially using the smart meters if installed in the developed abm the available water of each farmer agent is determined based on the maximum allowable withdrawal declared by a message on the first of each water year period 3 1 3 oaj agent the responsibility of this institutional agent is to improve the situation of agricultural sectors and in particular it aims to increase the crop products in the region the top down and high level policies dictate oaj to reduce water use and increase efficiency in the agricultural sector therefore oaj attempts to implement some projects including modifying the crop pattern and mechanizing the irrigation systems it uses stakeholder education and incentive policies such as paying grants to farmers to change the irrigation technology to move towards the goals 3 1 4 the environment one of the important elements of the model is the aquifer with which the agents interact as the model environment in the sess of the water resources different actors with their behaviors and decisions affect the environment and mutually are affected by it groundwater level will decrease due to reduced recharge increased abstraction or a combination of both causes ann is used to model the groundwater resources since the anns are coded as a java class an object of this class is built into the abm and an interactive abm ann link is created to cover the two way interaction between agents and the environment see section 4 2 as an artificial intelligence model ann attempts to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks as processing information the neural network consists of a set of interconnected primary processing units called neurons multilayer perceptron mlp is a feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers of neurons feedforward means that data flows from the input to the output layer forward neurons in hidden layers are processing units that use transferring functions such as sigmoid log sigmoid and hyperbolic the backpropagation learning algorithm is widely used for training this kind of network rojas 1996 mean square error mse and correlation coefficient cc between the observed data and the corresponding simulated results are used to measure the performance of the network 3 2 actors behavior patterns and decision making process research on farmers decision making process following institutional policies and implementing the new approaches e g using new pumping and irrigation technologies has shown that gaining the maximum economic profit has an essential role in the farmer s behaviors direction janssen and van ittersum 2007 holtz and pahl wostl 2012 each farmer agent is defined by some characteristics such as current capital available water cropping pattern cultivated area and irrigation technology since the 1990s a wide range of other factors has been identified in empirical studies that includes farmer psychology and market structure to social environment factors pahl wostl 2002 however little information is available on contributing these different factors to the farmers decisions janssen and van ittersum 2007 on the whole the developed model should put more emphasis on the impact of economic profit on farmers decision making process along with consideration of other factors as an example of farmers behavior patterns in the model it can be considered to calculate the probability of changing the irrigation technology of a farmer agent from traditional to modern using eq 1 according to the surveys changing the irrigation technology of a farmer agent depends on four factors available capital the influence of neighbors conservatism parameter and water shortage of the agent 1 p i r r c h a n g e α e c a p β e n e i g h b o r γ e c o n s λ e d e f α β γ λ where e c a p is the effect of farmer capital e n e i g h b o r is the neighborhood effect e c o n s is to the effect of conservatism parameter and e d e f is the water shortage effect on the farmer agent decision about using modern irrigation technology the parameters α β γ and λ show the effectiveness of the variables which are determined based on the local conditions and using the results of questionnaires 3 2 1 economic factor in decision making process box 1 is used to calculate the farmer income in the model considering the importance of the economic factors in farmer agents decision making schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 considered a linear relationship between supply and annual farmer income based on a simple approximation of the linear relationship of water deficit to yield however the crops are affected by water stress in varying degrees depending on their growth stages and the severity of water scarcity and it is required to investigate each crop yield in the local condition for more details see rao et al 1988 bennett and harms 2011 doorenbos and kassam 1979 proposed eq 2 for the relationship between plant water use and crop production 2 1 y a y x k y 1 e t a e t x where y x and y a are maximum and real yields e t x and e t a are maximum and real evapotranspiration respectively and k y is a yield response factor that reflects the effect of reducing evapotranspiration on yield losses fao 2012 proposed k y values for several crops based on analyzing a large amount of available literature on crop yield and water deficit relationships table 1 for other crops that have not yet provided a specific number for k y in the literature the linear relationship k y 1 is assumed in the model farmer agents evaluate their financial results at the end of each year then based on the revenue and total capital along with other effective parameters such as water availability and neighborhood effect each farmer agent decides on the crop cultivated area installing the smart meter and the irrigation technology for the next year 3 3 agents interactions as discussed one of the characteristics of the agents is the ability to interact with other actors in the system farmer agents are involved in two types of interactions with each other the first one is the effect on the environment groundwater pumping which results in increased pumping costs for other agents this kind of interaction is an indirect mechanism of interaction between agents in this interaction model a third entity mediates the agents interaction the second type of interaction is the direct relationship between farmer agents this issue is considered in the model by providing information sharing or observing other agents for example in the neighborhood farmers in a village see section 3 4 1 in order to change the irrigation technology farmer agents apply for a grant by sending a request message to oaj the oaj receives the messages from farmer agents in a queue reviews the messages based on the time priority of receiving and the budget constraint set each year and sends a positive or negative response to the same farmer agent this kind of interaction between agents is similar to the communication of farmer agents and rwa for receiving more water to cover part of the shortage see section 3 4 1 3 4 java agent development framework in this study the model is implemented in the jade java agent development framework an agent based modeling library fully implemented in the java language it is an environment founded on the fipa specifications foundation for intelligent physical agent to enable the development of intelligent agents fipa 2002 jade supports the parallel and simultaneous activities of agents through the behavioral models and the possibility of creating different kinds of behavioral models using defined classes in this framework jade provides a high capacity for transmitting various acl messages agent communication language includes a set of standard specifications defined by fipa in a model for flexible and efficient communication between different agents caire 2009 besides due to the open source framework and access to a wide range of library classes and functions in java this framework provides most of this study s requirements 3 4 1 communication of agents in jade the jade framework uses fipa standard interaction protocols as standard templates under which various tools are defined to build agent communications including acl messages df directory facilitator ams agent management service and gui messaging exchanging acl messages between agents is a usual tool of agents communication in jade by generating the agent identifier aid from its local name to send different types of text messages and objects for example the values of a variable the messages can be sent to a specific agent or a group of agents with specified characteristics and the message recipient can also process it in predefined conditions the messages can share information between agents inform template such as sharing information on irrigation technology of neighboring farmer agents another example of the templates is the request for an agent from another agent request template in the model the farmer agent sends a request message to rwa in the case of a serious water shortage fig 5 rwa receives messages sent by different farmer agents in a message queue to process them according to the rwa policy based on the interviews with the authorities in the first 2 years a maximum of two requests and in the next 3 years just one request per year is agreed for each farmer agent and the amount of additional allocation is sent to the same aid in a reply message by agreement template agree for more requests a reply message will be sent by disagreement template refuse in receiving and processing messages the time of responding will vary depending on the number of received messages which corresponds to what is happening in reality another communication tool in the jade framework is the directory facilitator df framework known as the yellow page service in this method one or more agents define a specified service maybe an information package with a specific name and type and registers it on yellow pages by searching for the type of a specific service on the yellow page other agents find the agents that provide it and receive the desired service for example each farmer agent in the case of changing irrigation technology declares this change by registering on the yellow page with its local name and the neighborhood code as the service type at the end of each year so farmer agents can be informed about the irrigation technology situation in their neighborhood area by searching in df services and decide about their irrigation system in the next year 4 model construction 4 1 crops attributes in this model eleven different types of crops are considered which form the dominant cropping pattern of the region table 2 the price of products and production costs per hectare including fertilizer pesticide seed labor and pumping are calculated using the census data on the sale prices for products and the cost of agricultural services it should be noted that crop prices and production costs have fluctuated in recent years due to high inflation and devaluation of the national currency in iran and the values in table 2 are based on constant prices in 2017 two general types of irrigation systems are considered in the ssp model including traditional flood irrigation and modern drip and sprinkler irrigation technologies according to the implementation of irrigation practices in the region irrigation efficiency in the flood sprinkler and drip irrigation technologies are 0 42 0 65 and 0 8 respectively 4 2 groundwater simulation model based on evaluation of observed groundwater level from piezometers in ssp and removal of ones with incomplete or inappropriate historical data series 12 piezometers were selected in the study area with 180 months of data length 2002 2016 the 12 location zones were identified using the thiessen polygon method and each operating well is coded in a location zone fig 2 for each location zone an ann model is developed in the form of eq 3 3 g e t f w 1 g e t 1 w 2 p t 1 w 3 e t 1 w 4 q t 1 where g e t is groundwater elevation at time t as an output node of the network f is the transfer function in ann sigmoid function is used w 1 w 4 are the weights of the input nodes in the network and g e t 1 groundwater elevation p t 1 precipitation e t 1 evaporation and q t 1 total discharge of the zone are input nodes of the network at the time t 1 according to the available historical data of each piezometer 80 144 months are used for training and 20 36 months for testing each of the 12 networks table 3 shows the training and testing characteristics and mse and cc results which indicate a relatively acceptable condition for most anns however in the case of zones 3 and 5 the network situation is somewhat poor due to the lack of appropriate piezometric data and should be updated in the future the results for zone 1 presented in fig 6 exemplify the training and testing models 4 3 uncertainty analysis quantification and analysis of uncertainty can help to examine decisions based on the level of uncertainty for uncertainty analysis there is a need for a multiple model run in which the values of the parameters random variables are randomly selected from their respective probability distributions according to the monte carlo simulation approach a total of 20 parameters leading to uncertainty in the model results were identified in the entire model setup as empirical data for parameters are only partially available a uniform probability density function is used to model the parameters based on the expert opinions eight model parameters can have different values during the simulation period different values each year due to uncertainty including the crop water demand the price of crops which have a guaranteed purchase by the government wheat and barley the price of other crops crop yield per irrigated area water scarcity effect on crop yield yield response factor cost of changing irrigation technology the amount of budget allocation for smart meters installation and the amount of budget allocation to grant the changing irrigation technology the uncertainty of these parameters is due to the factors such as climate variability market fluctuations and budgetary constraints over the years and also lack of sufficient information the other parameters have constant values during each run including irrigation efficiency for each technology the percentage of return flow to the aquifer the minimum extra available water of a farmer agent to enter the decision making process to increase cultivated area the percentage of farmer agents that increase their cultivated area if there are other conditions the percentage of farmer agents having illegal water withdrawal the initial capital of a farmer agent initial annual life cost of a farmer agent the effect of granting in changing irrigation technology and α β γ and λ in eq 1 the uncertainty of these parameters is mainly due to a lack of sufficient social and economic studies and uncertainty in the experts opinions 4 4 validation validation in abm is a real challenge validation represents what a model provides in its application domain at a satisfactory level compared with our expected results from the model bars et al 2002 the abms have validity if a subject expert or a panel of experts confirms the quality of simulation results and the causal chain through which input parameter settings cause the simulated output in accordance with the real world phenomena vermeulen and pyka 2016 in the model this issue is performed by researchers considering outputs such as the trend of changing the cultivation area during the simulation period separately for each irrigation technology trends of economic benefit at micro and macro levels and changes in groundwater level these outputs are compared with the actual situation of the study area according to the experienced experts opinions also the processes defined in the model such as the causal chain in changing the irrigation method or the communication processes defined between the farmer agents rwa and oaj are evaluated by the subject experts as discussed in section 4 2 the calibration and validation of the groundwater simulation model the ann model ensure the feedback of the abm environment in this study a qualitative research method is used to analyze stakeholders this qualitative study complies with the following assumptions i in qualitative research saturation rule has been widely accepted as a methodological principle saunders et al 2018 in this study based on this rule the interviews with farmers experts and managers of rwa and oaj continued until no further new issue or additional information was discovered ii regarding the validation methods in qualitative research the interview transcripts were examined by the researcher s self monitoring and member checks techniques as riege 2003 stated iii convergent interviewing techniques were used to ensure reliability semi structured protocols were designed to follow a specific procedure which helped maintain reliability and provide repeatable reasonable results as rao and perry 2003 stated iv triangulation of interview questions and analysis of negative issues in designing the interview protocol the existence of several interviewers separately but parallel to each other peer debriefing and the use of the steering committee have increased the validity of this qualitative research as proposed by riege 2003 and lisa 2006 4 5 regulatory levers and formulation of scenarios it is necessary to make immediate but equitable decisions and apply equitable regulatory levers that can control hyperconsumption over the capacity of the aquifer to stop the rapid deterioration of groundwater resources and reclamation of these vital resources in ssp equitability is vital and will be considered in future studies but this study focuses on main policy levers in grbp to evaluate their effects on consumption pattern modification aquifer reclamation and socio economic variables the following dimensions are detailed for the formulation of seven scenarios including the baseline i well monitoring project wmp ii license adjustment coefficient lac and iii two variations of promoting modern irrigation technologies pmit notably the baseline scenario bs is initialized with no special policy implementation 4 5 1 wells monitoring project wmp in the absence of smart meters many farmer agents withdraw groundwater beyond the amount set in the well licenses i e formal rules and regulations in grbp the installation of well smart meters is one of the important programs to reduce the probability of disobedience from the formal rules in addition to monitoring programs attention should be paid to the livelihood of farmers especially in smallholder farms with subsistence farming moreover the monitoring should be implemented fairly throughout the plain one of the reasons for the failure of this project has been the feeling of injustice in its implementation in the wmp scenario according to the rwa program the installation of meters is planned over a period of 5 years in the model if the value of well monitoring variable is true for a farmer agent according to the surveys the probability of extracting more than the well license is reduced from 90 to 10 however due to the uncertainty in the studies these parameters are included in the model with 10 uncertainty in the early years of the project implementation local institutions have decided to adopt a particular policy to avoid sudden economic pressure on farmers upon request of each farmer there will be a possibility to allocate a further 20 withdrawal beyond the wells withdrawal license the model procedure was described in section 3 4 1 fig 5 4 5 2 license adjustment coefficient lac due to the severe negative groundwater balance in ssp one of the plans designed for aquifer reclamation is to reduce the license of all agricultural wells lac is set to reduce the well permits by 20 during 5 years until the aquifer deficit is offset in the model the rwa announces the allowable amount of withdrawals to farmer agents based on each well s initial license and the same adjustment coefficient as an informative message inform template at the beginning of each year each farmer agent receives this message and adjusts the variable of available water based on the message 4 5 3 promoting modern irrigation technologies pmit changing the farms irrigation technology to high efficiency systems is another important policy considered in grbp in recent years oaj has a wide spreading program to encourage farmers to change their irrigation systems the program includes financial levers in the form of paying grants to farmers and also educational practices in the model farmer agents send a request message to oaj for grant allocation to their farm oaj receives and process the messages in its message queue and replies to them in an agreement template up to the annual budget of the project more requests are postponed to the next year if the value of grant variable of a farmer agent is true the value of the variable e c a p in eq 1 will be equal to 1 this means that this agent will have a maximum score in terms of the amount of capital required to change the irrigation method however since the effect of the capital parameter in this case will be more significant in the probability of changing the irrigation method according to surveys the α parameter will be increased between 10 and 30 in uncertainty analysis this is the first scenario considered in the pmit project pmit 1 a policy is considered to make the oaj grant conditional on the installation of meters to assist wmp implementation in pmit 2 oaj will check the wells meter installation as a prerequisite in processing the request messages of farmer agents in addition to the remaining annual budget constraint table 4 describes a set of six sample combinations of policy levers implemented in the model for example the effect of applying the combination of wmp and lac as two rwa policy levers to reduce extractions is evaluated in the second scenario sc 2 4 6 sensitivity analysis on weather variability and behavioral mechanisms it is possible to investigate the model sensitivity on changes in behavioral patterns of stakeholders using the developed framework as an example the effect of changing the conservatism parameter on the model results is evaluated conservatism parameter of farmer agents as a criterion for the degree of risk aversion or risk seeking can affect the decision making process sensitivity analysis is performed by considering three conditions including neutral society risk seeking society rss and risk averse society ras to show the parameter effects on the results in the neutral condition it is assumed to have a normal distribution for the conservatism parameter of farmer agents i e a risk neutral society rss is implemented by considering a skew factor of 0 6 in the curve fitting process while in ras it is assumed to have a skew factor of 0 6 three precipitation sensitivity tests are evaluated in combination with management scenarios to examine the effects of climate variability in this regard three periods of wet dry and relatively normal are identified in the historical data and assumed as different weather conditions it helps to have a better projection of what groundwater resources may face given the regulatory levers in the near future 5 results and discussion the uncertainty analysis for each scenario described in table 4 was implemented in the model to have outputs of 200 realizations each of which has a set of random variables for different uncertain parameters a period of 20 years with an average equal to the long term average of ssp is selected for the weather parameters of precipitation and evaporation in the groundwater simulation model to have a normal weather condition as an environmental indicator fig 7 illustrates the monthly time series of groundwater elevation resulting from the sample scenarios implementation compared to the bs the hydrograph of the aquifer is obtained from 12 piezometers of location zones using the thiessen polygon method shaded areas show the uncertainty of the results emerging from 20 uncertain input parameters the total annual net income as an economic index is illustrated in fig 8 for the scenarios this index is calculated based on the sum of farmer agents net income presented in box 1 in each annual time step shaded areas indicate 95 confidence intervals in different realizations for each scenario due to no significant change in earnings after the tenth year the total annual net income chart has been plotted until this year the bs will result in a catastrophic groundwater level drop of about 8 m in the simulation period fig 7 and there is an almost constant total annual net income fig 8 however due to the critical situation of the aquifer it may cause wells to run dry and may result in water quality degradation in part of the study area it in turn will lead to a reduction in total net revenue therefore qualitative studies are required in the future in sc 1 the wmp project alleviates negative aquifer balance during the simulation period and despite existing fluctuations in dry years there is no change in the groundwater elevation although wmp reduces groundwater resource degradation the total annual net income will be reduced by more than 4 million about a 22 decrease in annual revenue as a result of increasing farmer agents water stress level it should be noted that according to expert opinions the probability of unauthorized withdrawals during the installation of smart meters is reduced from about 90 to about 15 which is applied with a 10 uncertainty in the model lac wmp implementation in sc 2 has a significant impact on the reduction of extraction therefore the groundwater level will increase by about 5 5 m and given the uncertainty it will even be possible to increase the water level up to 7 m nevertheless some farmer agents will be under tremendous economic pressure and the total annual net income will fall by 36 7 million consequently this scenario cannot be a sustainable solution to the problem due to social challenges the implementation of modern irrigation network systems is considered one of the major programs to reduce consumption in grbp however in sc 3 not only it has not improved aquifer status but also has exacerbated the problem this has occurred for two main reasons first due to the availability of more water to the farmer agents and the tendency of the farmers to have more income the cultivated area will increase according to the conditions defined in the model these include the amount of capital needed to increase the cultivated area the requirement for a minimum amount of extra water for the added demand and the impact of the fallow area factor of the farmer agent model results in the run of sc 3 show that the total cultivated area will increase by approximately 5000 ha about 40 during the simulation period in addition with less water available the farmer agents grow crops under deficit irrigation in some cases with less crop production due to the water stress box 1 the second reason is the removal of about 10 million m3 return flow towards the aquifer due to the use of pressurized irrigation systems according to studies in the region the return flow in traditional irrigation systems is about 10 15 on the other hand this scenario generates the most revenue for the farmers and results in a 6 6 million 34 increase in total annual net income the model implementation results in sc 4 show that the simultaneous implementation of modern irrigation development and well monitoring projects will be more sustainable however in this scenario groundwater resources status has not yet improved and even the aquifer has declined slightly about 1 5 m total annual net income has increased by about 5 5 million which is favorable for the growth of the agricultural economy in ssp considering lac in sc 5 significantly improves the aquifer status with the groundwater level increased by approximately 5 m during the simulation period although the aquifer s recovery rate is lower than the second scenario unlike sc 2 the total annual net income increases by 1 3 million the results are very close in both scenarios 5 and 6 contrary to expectations the dependence of oaj granting on the installation of the meters did not significantly improve the situation the reason is the assumption of proper funding by the rwa for the implementation of wmp given that sc 5 has a significant impact on the improvement of groundwater resources the aquifer balance is positive in this scenario and the income level of farmer agents increases slightly it is considered the top scenario among others fig 9 illustrates the run results of the model for a sample sensitivity analysis on the weather variations and risk taking behavior of farmer agents for the selected scenario see section 4 6 under pessimistic conditions during the dry period the aquifer condition is constant relative to the beginning of the simulation period and no change in the aquifer level is observed fig 9a assuming a wet weather period under optimistic conditions there is a significant improvement in the status of the aquifer resulting in an elevation groundwater level increase of 11 m fig 9c it is noteworthy that the dry and wet periods do not significantly impact the overall income of farmers i e less than 1 on average the reason for this is the strict conditions imposed by the rwa that have limited more extraction even in wet conditions the importance of these results is that decision builders can predict different future conditions and plan the necessary actions in each case for example in consecutive wet periods conservation restrictions may be reduced proportionally by the level of the aquifer improvement at the discretion of decision makers the risk taking behavior of farmer agents has been more influential in the results of the early years of projects execution as is evident the changes in the conservatism parameter of the farmers community do not significantly impact the changes in groundwater level fig 9b this is due to the effect described in sc 3 i e increase in the cultivation area the removal of return flow and thus neutralize the reduction in consumption caused by increased irrigation efficiency however the impact of changing risk taking behavior on farmers income especially in the early years of project implementation is more apparent and leads to an increase in total annual net income by up to 10 in the rss condition fig 9d 6 conclusion in this study an uncertain social ecological model was developed using agent based modeling as a decision support tool and it was used in the shabestar sofian plain iran as a case study this extendable tool treats some of the complexity of real world systems including system dynamics feedback and heterogeneity it considers the links between the coherent patterns of relationships between individuals groups and the institutions of the systems this model allows decision makers to have sufficient flexibility for optimistic and pessimistic situations rather than rigid planning for the future by considering the uncertainty of the parameters the ability of the model as a virtual laboratory to evaluate different management scenarios was demonstrated by examining the results of a set of sample scenarios and analyzing the sensitivity of the results to weather and behavioral conditions the developed framework considers social parameters such as risk taking and neighbors impact as social learning economic parameters such as water stress cropping pattern and irrigation method and environmental parameters such as groundwater level to achieve the most sustainable decisions in water resources management the framework was implemented to evaluate a number of management scenarios as combinations of policy levers including wells monitoring license adjustment and promoting modern irrigation technologies based on the results the coordinated implementation of the policy levers defined in the fifth scenario not only can stop the aquifer decline but also lead to a 5 m increase in groundwater level this result along with a slight increase in the total income of farmers indicates a possible sustainable solution in this scenario although this result will be achieved by training and participation of farmers it provides some evidence that policymaking can avert the ongoing catastrophe it should be noted that solutions proposed in this study alone and without the policy of replacing agriculture with suitable industries can not fully restore the aquifer and return it to the normal condition although the model is developed specifically for a particular aquifer it can easily be extended to other regions and more complex systems additionally different management policies and various combinations of scenarios can be evaluated in the proposed framework to minimize the high costs of managerial mistakes the ability to provide customized user interfaces in the framework operation enables users including authorities and local communities to communicate and can train the target community this study considers only two more effective institutions in the problem that can be developed in future studies the paper does not consider the equitability of water distribution among the farmers however this will be considered in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
