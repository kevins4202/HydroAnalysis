6580,understanding the environmental impacts associated with water related adaptation measures plays an important role in decision making as some adaptation measures may not offer environmental benefits compared to traditional water systems the water depletion index wdi is one water stress indicator used to estimate the impacts of water consumption a dynamic wdi was constructed and employed in this study under climate change scenarios with weather and streamflow modeling to demonstrate whether adaptation measures can reduce water depletion and to demonstrate how dynamic wdi affects assessment results taipei a highly developed and populated city in taiwan was selected as a case study site decreased wdi from july to august and increased wdi from september to october were simulated under climate change this approach implied that when measuring water consumption impacts the wdi should be applied according to the corresponding time period additionally by substituting 70 of potable water with rainwater in a four story building 17 9 159 3 m3 of the freshwater depletion risk might be reduced every month as adaptation measures can be long term strategies and long lasting infrastructures a dynamic wdi could provide policy makers with a method to accurately and effectively assess the impacts of applying water related adaptation measures in response to climate change

global challenges of the next 10 years the world economic forum 2016 according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc extreme weather events such as rainstorms and droughts are increasing particularly due to rainfalls that are inconsistent and unpredictable both spatially and temporally ipcc 2014 studies have also suggested that by 2025 these extreme weather events may result in elevated water stress in the form of an increased freshwater withdrawal to availability ratio in several countries unep 2008 adaptation in response to future extreme water stress is necessary to reduce the impact of oncoming water crises recently the concept of the sponge city was proposed as an adaptation measure to improve water resilience at the urban level liu et al 2015 this concept can be implemented using such measures as a rainwater harvesting system rwhs pandey et al 2003 which enables the recycling and reuse of runoff and provides the additional benefit of runoff reduction sample and liu 2014 however a drawback of this system is its high energy consumption which may limit its environmental feasibility in practice vieira et al 2014 a study on potable water savings using rwhs showed a reduction of up to 11 of total water consumption in paris belmeziti et al 2014 an annual water savings potential of up to 46 500 l per household was also estimated using an optimized tank fonseca et al 2017 recent studies have therefore recommended understanding the impacts of these conservation systems from a life cycle perspective anand and apul 2011 godskesen et al 2013 li et al 2018 in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the benefits and trade offs of water related adaptations various approaches to measuring the consequences of water consumption have been proposed recently berger et al 2014 pfister et al 2009 water stress indicators have been used as characterization factors in quantifying the causality between water consumption and its related impacts on water resources berger et al 2014 pfister et al 2009 temporal and spatial conditions at the points of water consumption are critical to improve the accuracy of the impact assessments núñez et al 2015 scherer et al 2015 soligno et al 2017 hoekstra et al 2012 and pfister and bayer 2014 noted that the high variability of water availability in a given year can be a challenge to efficient water resource management and indicated that monthly resolution can reveal water stress more accurately moreover the impacts of water consumption depend on the status of water environments which may vary by region or time period núñez et al 2015 because long term weather conditions determine water environments and water availability núñez et al 2015 impacts can differ depending on the time period therefore it is suggested that water demand as well as water availability for the specific location and time period should be considered when assessing future water consumption impacts this study constructed a monthly dynamic water depletion index wdimon with improved temporal and spatial resolution under consideration of climate change the impacts of urban water consumption defined as the risk of monthly freshwater depletion rfdmon was derived from direct and indirect water consumption and the region specific wdimon to demonstrate the application of the dynamic wdimon in impact assessments of urban water consumption taipei the capital city of taiwan was chosen as a case study site an rwhs in a building was designed to show the potential impacts of adaptation measures with rfdmon results the dynamic wdimon approach could be of interest to researchers or policy makers in determining long term water management policies that consider the influences of climate change 2 methods 2 1 monthly water depletion index wdi mon the wdi proposed in this study was adopted from berger et al 2014 to evaluate the depletion of freshwater resources due to water consumption the monthly wdi wdi mon dimensionless reflecting temporal scale modifications can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 wdi mon 1 1 1 0 01 1 e af erf m o n cta mon 2 c t a mon c mon a mon sws mon af gws m o n 3 s w s mon h v dam m o n h k a lake w e t l a n d k d eff m o n k where wdi mon is adjusted from a logistic function with an ecological reference flow adjusted factor af erf m o n dimensionless and the monthly water consumption to availability ratio c t a mon dimensionless given by eq 2 to obtain continuous values ranging from 0 01 to 1 berger et al 2014 pfister et al 2009 c mon is the monthly water consumption of the research area in m3 month see section 2 1 1 monthly water consumption a mon is the monthly water availability in m3 month see section 2 1 2 available water estimation sws mon is the monthly usable surface water stocks in m3 month given by eq 3 af gws m o n is the monthly groundwater stocks adjusted factor and 0 9 was applied in this study to indicate that the geological structure of the research area is a major groundwater basin with 300 mm annual recharge which can reduce 10 0 freshwater scarcity berger et al 2014 as c t a mon exceeds 0 80 wdi mon climbs to 1 indicating severe water stress as shown in supporting information fig s1 table s1 shows the determination of af erf m o n based on the monthly average stream flow and monthly 95th percentile exceedance flow q95 which was defined as the ecological reference flow erf acreman et al 2008 taiwan water resources agency 2014 af erf m o n with the value 12 5 means that the q95 to monthly average stream flow ratio is less than 0 2 sws mon was calculated using the monthly inflow of the dam h v dam m o n h m3 month and the usable volume of lake wetland k which were estimated at the surface area a lake w e t l a n d k m2 and multiplied by the monthly effective depth d eff m o n k m month in the case study the v dam m o n h was derived by annual inflow to the dam because of data availability and the d eff m o n k was set to be 0 as a result of no lake and wetland in the watershed 2 1 1 monthly water consumption c m o n projection of water consumption in the research area of this study mainly focuses on municipal water demand or water supply for domestic purposes thus future monthly water consumption was estimated based on two sources 1 domestic water consumption eq 4 and 2 other municipal water use monthly domestic water consumption wcon domestic m o n m3 month was calculated based on future population projections p o p proj capital with some assumptions the population served ratio p o p s e r v e d dimensionless reaches 100 in the future water consumption per capita per day w c o n lpcd lpcd remains as it is at present which is 327 l and revenue water ratio r e v e n u e w dimensionless slightly increases to 80 in the future table s2 4 wco n domestic m o n pop proj popserved wcon lpcd d a y s m o n t h 1 1000 revenuew other municipal water use was determined based on historically distributed water quantity in 2009 2012 with monthly variation the quantity of other municipal water use was assumed to be the same in the future time periods 2 1 2 monthly available water estimation a m o n monthly available water in the future time periods considered in this study was derived by taiwap for future weather generation with 1996 2015 as baseline years liu et al 2009 tung et al 2014 and using a hydrological model of a soil and water assessment tool swat for streamflow simulation neitsch et al 2009 in taiwap climate change scenarios were selected based on ipcc ar5 four representative concentrative pathways rcps rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 with four time periods 2021 2040 2030s 2041 2060 2050s 2061 2080 2070s and 2081 2100 2090s ipcc 2014 two general circulation models gcms ccsm4 and csiro mk3 6 0 models were chosen because they were suitable for taiwan according to the rankings by tung et al 2014 the resolution of weather projections for regional simulation was downscaled from 300 km to 5 km in taiwap through statistical approaches hsu et al 2011 the swat model which was originally a watershed and subbasin level simulations model was utilized to simulate water availability as streamflow for estimating water stress indicator scherer et al 2015 the arcswat 2012 model was applied in this study to enhance spatial resolution and to assess water consumption impacts streamflow calibration was based on daily observed data from 2009 to 2010 and validation from 2011 to 2012 fig s2 manual calibration was done according to the parameters that govern the hydrologic process table s3 the performance of swat was evaluated by three statistics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse standard deviation ratio rsr and coefficient of determination r2 if nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and r2 0 5 the performance was confirmed as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 the goodness of fit is shown in table s4 2 2 assessing the risk of monthly freshwater depletion rfd mon the risk of monthly freshwater depletion rfd mon m3 month is used to represent the potential consequences of water consumption in the watersheds berger et al 2014 which can be quantified by multiplying the monthly water consumption wc mon m3 month of a product service or activity from inventory analysis and the wdi mon eq 5 the differences between c mon and wc mon were that c mon addressed the monthly water consumption status in the research area while wc mon described the consumptive water use of target activities in the research area 5 rfd mon wc mon wdi mon 2 3 case study the framework and data used in this study are described in fig 1 the case study aims to derive the wdis of taipei under different time periods and discuss whether the dynamic concept is necessary therefore the first part of the case study is to calculate current wdis and future wdis of taipei the former used historical statistical data 2009 2012 and the latter used the prediction data from taiwap and swat in order to demonstrate how the wdis can support water resource management we then applied the calculated wdis to perform a comparative analysis of a potable water system pws and an adaptation measure an rwhs in a building by quantifying their risk of freshwater depletion in the second part of the case study the spatial scale is a building and the direct and indirect water consumption of pws and rwhs was inventoried with defined scope see section 2 3 2 adaptation scenarios 2 3 1 spatial description the research area water consumer taipei is a highly developed area that is home to many commercial and residential activities the water supplied to taipei mainly comes from the feitsui reservoir and the streamflow in the water quality and quantity protection area their relative location is shown in fig 2 during 2009 2012 the average annual water withdrawal from the watershed is 868 116 943 m3 in order to get actual c m o n and a m o n we assume that water is withdrawn upstream of the watershed and directly transmitted to potable water treatment plants in the city through pipes therefore c m o n is calculated on the basis of taipei yellow area in fig 2 and a m o n is the simulated results of the upstream of the feitsui reservoir dark green area water quality and quantity protection area in fig 2 suggesting that the points of water consumption and water withdrawal may be different this approach ensures that the wdis is not underestimated due to overestimations of availability 2 3 2 adaptation scenarios the system boundary of the pws includes raw water catchment and treatment potable water distribution and water usage in toilet flushing fig s3 a on the other hand the rwhs includes the construction of rainwater catchment a filter a rainwater storage tank a pump and rainwater distribution for toilet flushing fig s3 b the placements of pws and rwhs in the building are shown in fig 3 the functional unit fu for the analysis is defined as the provision of sanitation services for 204 people in a 4 story research building at national taiwan university for one month light green dot in fig 2 water demand is assumed to be the sum of toilet flushing five times per person per day with 6 l per flush for low flush toilets that is 30 l per person per day this study also assumes 1 the rwhs has a lifetime of at least 20 years and 2 all of the direct and indirect water consumption leads to water depletion risk in the research watershed three scenarios are designed to estimate rfdmon for the case study site s0 pws the potable water system is the business as usual scenario s1 rwhs x a combination of the rainwater harvesting system and the potable water system uses the addition of the rwhs to the pws to substitute 70 of potable water for toilet flushing with saved potable water available to be supplied for other water consumption needs s2 rwhs x i the rainwater harvesting system includes the same infrastructures as in s1 this scenario additionally includes the construction stage of the rwhs such as catchment filter storage tank pipes and pumps the data inventories of the three scenarios focused on direct and indirect water consumption from the watershed fig 3 while direct water consumption is water directly used for toilet flushing indirect water consumption includes electricity and chemical inputs in the pws and electricity usage and the construction stage in the rwhs the quantity of direct and indirect water flow and the nodes of water collection reservation and consumption are also presented in fig 3 in the pws fig 3 a direct water for toilet flushing is 184 m3 month in the research building indirect water consumption of water treatment procedure water distribution from the water treatment plant to the research building and pumping when using water in the research building is 47 1 m3 month 7 3 m3 month and 11 7 m3 month respectively in the rwhs x and rwhs x i fig 3 b water consumption from the pws accounts for 30 of the total consumption of pws direct use of rainwater for toilet flushing is estimated at 129 m3 month which is assumed to be excluded from the water depletion calculation on the watershed the indirect water use of rwhs is 0 22 m3 month for rainwater collection and 8 72 m3 month for rainwater pumping when using rainwater in the research building detail inventories of the three scenarios are summarized in tables s5 and s6 the data on electricity and chemical inputs in pws were obtained from the taiwan water resources agency 2013 the inventory of materials used in constructing the rwhs was obtained from the ecoinvent 3 0 database the electricity mix data were obtained from the taiwan power company taiwan power company 2015 the volume of the storage tanks was modeled by rain cycle which is a continuous mass balance software that uses the yield after spillage model jenkins and pearson 1978 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic water depletion index 3 1 1 temporal scale of wdi fig 4 shows the wdis of the research area at both annual and monthly scales 2009 2012 the wdis were derived from eqs 1 3 using historical data in this study the af erf was adjusted to conform to the result of a wdi of 0 51 for a cta of 0 37 which is the threshold between moderate and severe water depletion the annual wdi determined in this study was 0 732 which was higher than the defined threshold of water depletion and thus indicated severe water depletion the annual wdi from berger et al 2014 is also displayed in the figs 4 and s4 for reference the annual wdi estimated by berger et al 2014 was 0 116 which was six times lower than the average wdi calculated in this study the main differences in the estimations can be attributed to the af erf and cta in the calculation in their study an af erf with a value of 40 0 was utilized this setting was based on the assumptions that the extreme water depletion occurring at cta reached 0 25 when the wdi rose to 1 fig s1 this threshold was stricter than that was defined in our study the lower value of wdi estimated by berger et al 2014 might be due to the cta was calculated from the modeled annual water consumption and annual availability using watergap2 a global hydrological model this further suggested that the global hydrological model or the large spatial scale model as in fig s4 might not be suitable for our research area where regions for water withdrawal and water consumption are not the same using the monthly scale the maximum wdi mon in april was 0 98 which was approximately four times as high as the minimum wdi mon in october 0 25 previous research also indicated that monthly or seasonal temporal scales such as high and low flow periods are appropriate to depict the water resource status in taiwan lin et al 2017 this result showed that annual wdi values may not indicate all the water stress that occurs over a year and thus such values may mislead water management decision makers lin et al 2017 scherer et al 2015 monthly wdi values however can be used to provide more specific information to prepare for household water usage and agricultural irrigation in different months pfister and bayer 2014 3 1 2 water depletion index under climate change monthly available water amon in section 2 1 2 in future periods is a key parameter to derive the wdi under climate change in this study thus the monthly precipitation and streamflow under climate change scenarios were simulated and modeled fig s5 presents the results of relative changes in monthly average precipitation and streamflow under climate change scenarios in general increased precipitation was simulated during wet seasons from may to october and dry seasons from november to april in the csiro mk3 6 0 model at most precipitation increased 114 during dry seasons on the other hand increased precipitation during wet seasons and decreased precipitation during dry seasons were simulated in the ccsm4 model these simulations indicated that the risk of a strong flood at most 136 increased precipitation during the 2090s and drought at most 70 decreased precipitation during the 2070s might be high in rcp 8 5 scenarios these results were also validated based on previous studies conducted in northern taiwan yu and wang 2009 and showed the suitability of using a monthly scale in the determination of the wdi the monthly wdi under climate change were calculated with eqs 1 3 and the simulated parameters listed in supplementary information b fig 5 displays wdi mon in four time periods under four climate change scenarios and with two gcms it was observed that the wdimon changes considerably for example the period of march may spring has higher wdis and june august summer has lower wdis out of the four time periods the 2030s have the highest wdi mon with values being significantly different across the four time periods for all months the annual wdi derived from average amon cmon and swamon were also presented in fig 5 dotted lines the differences between wdimon under climate change in fig 5 and wdimon in the corresponding time periods without climate change effect are calculated to examine the influences of climate change on the wdis results of the change in wdi mon is shown in fig 6 a significant decrease in wdi mon was observed from june to august and then an increase in wdi mon from august to october was shown in most time periods and climate change scenarios the difference in the characterization factor in time is an essential aspect when considering time in global warming impacts assessment pinsonnault et al 2014 since wdimon can also serve as a characterization factor in the life cycle impact assessment berger et al 2014 it can be used to understand its variation in time based on the results in fig 5 we proposed the concept and application of the dynamic wdi this dynamic concept was also proposed in levasseur et al 2010 and pinsonnault et al 2014 as dynamic life cycle assessment dynamic lca it focused on inclusion of temporal information in every stage of the lca likewise collinge et al 2013 emphasized utilizing time dependent characterization factors to show the temporal variability of the impacts of an institutional building a long lasting infrastructure therefore the dynamic wdi mon is suggested to be coordinated with the appropriate corresponding period when calculating the impacts of water consumption 3 2 risk of freshwater depletion in the case study 3 2 1 current urban water consumption and related impacts according to the data inventory analysis tables s5 and s6 using 1 m3 potable water in a four story building in taipei consumes 1 36 m3 water including 1 05 m3 direct water and 0 31 m3 indirect water from raw water treatment water distribution and water pumping on the other hand using 1 m3 rainwater consumes 0 06 m3 stressed water due to pumping considering the construction stage of the rwhs an additional 0 01 m3 water was required rainwater reclaimed from the rwhs was assumed to substitute for 70 of the potable water used for toilet flushing monthly stressed water consumption of toilet flushing in the research building is shown in fig 7 a direct rainwater use was excluded from water consumption as it did not come from the watershed and would not contribute to freshwater depletion in all of the scenarios the largest share of water consumption was toilet flushing the direct potable water use in s0 moreover the indirect water use of aluminum oxide used in the potable water purification process was the hotspot in s0 accounting for 26 0 of indirect water consumption in s1 and s2 indirect water use of electricity for pumping rainwater accounted for 32 4 and 31 6 of indirect water consumption respectively this potential impact of the use of electricity for pumping has been validated by morales pinzón et al 2012 comparing s0 and s2 construction of rwhs the rwhs saved 166 2 m3 water in toilet flushing every month including 135 3 m3 direct water and 30 9 m3 indirect water by applying an rwhs potable water could be saved and applied to more valuable uses by comparing s1 and s2 it seems that the water consumption for the construction of an rwhs is negligible as shown in fig 7 a and table s6 the water consumption in the rainwater catchment including collecting pipe sand and storage tank and in the rainwater use stage including pump supply pipe and storage tank are 0 2 m3 and 0 5 m3 respectively these results are due to the relatively long lifespan of an rwhs at 20 years however inclusion of the construction stage in the impact assessment is suggested especially when life cycle energy and resources are required for a long lasting infrastructure 3 2 2 urban water consumption under the influences of climate change reduction in water depletion risk eq 5 was also calculated in this study to demonstrate how dynamic wdimon results in fig 5 can apply for evaluation of adaptation measures fig 7 b and fig s6 reveal the rfdmon of toilet flushing dotted line for current monthly and annual risk and colored bars for different scenarios the differences between the scenarios in figs 7 b and s6 indicated the reduction in rfdmon due to the application of the rwhs in the rwhs the risk of freshwater depletion was less fluctuant the potential of reduction in rfdmon was in the range of 17 9 m3 to 159 3 m3 when the rwhs was used vialle et al 2015 conducted an rwhs analysis with boulay s water stress indicator boulay et al 2011 and showed a similar result in which an rwhs was 0 71 l eq lower than a pws with the functional unit of 30 l of water for toilet flushing per day although the environmental performance of the rwhs alone seemed to be poorer than that of pws anand and apul 2011 crettaz et al 1999 the rwhs did show more water savings than the pws when the impacts of water resource depletion were considered vialle et al 2015 additionally the water saved by the rwhs is due to not only the saving of stressed water from the watershed but also to the reduction in chemicals and energy used for potable water treatment 3 3 limitations the variation of wdi is strongly affected by water consumption cmom and water availability related factors in this research the temporal and spatial resolution of wdimon with simulated available water amon were improved as a result a slight decrease in wdimon was observed for future scenarios fig 5 which was partly due to the increase in future available water from projected precipitation and streamflow under the influence of climate change fig s6 it is worth mentioning that increase in rainwater quantity does not guarantee the increase of water availability as the rainwater usually accompanies with high turbidity from seriously erosion nearby the watershed fakour et al 2016 besides it is difficult to catch the high streamflow in a short duration particularity because of the terrain characteristics of short rivers in taiwan on the other hand cmom is primarily estimated based on the projection of population in this research the water consumption per capita per day was assumed remaining as it is at present which neglected the potential of future advancement of water management strategies and technologies if the quantity of water saving is large enough to change the distribution of regional water resources the potential of water conservation is suggested to be included in the cmom estimation for example a water conservation research in california reported that the potential of water reduce use could reach to 34 from residential indoor and outdoor use commercial use and industrial use gleick et al 2003 in this case the savings would be taken into consideration when calculating future wdis therefore wdimon could be further improved with refined availability water considering water quality issue as well as contribution of water conservation 4 conclusions this study proposed an approach for constructing a dynamic wdi under climate change scenarios using modeled monthly available water and water consumption the wdimon can serve as a characterization factor in the life cycle impact assessment in order to understand its variation in impact results over time this index can also be applied to determine whether applying different wdimon is necessary when assessing impacts of water consumption in this case study parameters for calculating wdimon in taipei taiwan was derived as follows regional watershed data and projected precipitation the abovementioned parameters were applied to the hydrological model for simulating available water with consideration of the reservoir inflow data as the surface water stock in addition the actual water intake data for potable water facilities were used to represent water consumption instead of using the simulated data impact assessment on water consumption of an rwhs at a four story building scale was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of dynamic characterization factor the results showed that rwhs could save potable water for more valuable uses with the dynamic wdimon the impact results can show the monthly change of risk of water depletion with different time periods which could provide more information about the consequence of water consumption the use of dynamic wdi in this study facilitates the understanding of its monthly variation within a year due to the geographical or climate condition it is also worth noting that wdi can be applied to any defined temporal scales such as in season the changes in wdi for future scenarios could be attributed to the influence of climate change therefore it is suggested that the dynamic wdi mon should be coordinated with the appropriate corresponding period when calculating the impacts of water consumption especially when assessing water related adaption strategies in water

the surface area a lake w e t l a n d k m2 and multiplied by the monthly effective depth d eff m o n k m month in the case study the v dam m o n h was derived by annual inflow to the dam because of data availability and the d eff m o n k was set to be 0 as a result of no lake and wetland in the watershed 2 1 1 monthly water consumption c m o n projection of water consumption in the research area

monthly available water estimation a m o n monthly available water in the future time periods considered in this study was derived by taiwap for future weather generation with 1996 2015 as baseline years liu et al 2009 tung et al 2014 and using a hydrological model of a soil and water assessment tool swat for streamflow simulation neitsch et al 2009 in taiwap climate change scenarios were selected based on ipcc ar5 four representative concentrative pathways rcps rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 with four time periods 2021 2040 2030s 2041 2060 2050s 2061 2080 2070s and 2081 2100 2090s ipcc 2014 two general circulation models gcms ccsm4 and csiro mk3 6 0 models were chosen because they were suitable for taiwan according to the rankings by tung et al 2014 the resolution of weather projections for regional simulation was downscaled from 300 km to 5 km in taiwap through statistical approaches hsu et al 2011 the swat model which was originally a watershed and subbasin level simulations model was utilized to simulate water availability as streamflow for estimating water stress indicator scherer et al 2015 the arcswat 2012 model was applied in this study to enhance spatial resolution and to assess water consumption impacts streamflow calibration was based on daily observed data from 2009 to 2010 and validation from 2011 to 2012 fig s2 manual calibration was done according to the parameters that govern the hydrologic process table s3 the performance of swat was evaluated by three statistics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse standard deviation ratio rsr and coefficient of determination r2 if nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and r2 0 5 the performance was confirmed as satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 the goodness of fit is shown in table s4 2 2 assessing the risk of

mon 2 3 case study the framework and data used in this study are described in fig 1 the case study aims to derive the wdis of taipei under different time periods and discuss whether the dynamic concept is necessary therefore the first part of the case study is to calculate current wdis and future wdis of taipei the former used historical statistical data 2009 2012 and the latter used the prediction data from taiwap and swat in order to demonstrate how the wdis can support water resource management we then applied the calculated wdis to perform a comparative analysis of a potable water system pws and an adaptation measure an rwhs in a building by quantifying their risk of freshwater depletion in the second part of the case study the spatial scale is a building and the direct and indirect water consumption of pws and rwhs was inventoried with defined scope see section 2 3 2 adaptation scenarios 2 3 1 spatial description the research area water consumer taipei is a highly developed area that is home to many commercial and residential activities the water supplied to taipei mainly comes from the feitsui reservoir and the streamflow in the water quality and quantity protection area their relative location is shown in fig 2 during 2009 2012 the average annual water withdrawal from the watershed is 868 116 943 m3 in order to get actual c m o n and a m o n we assume that water is withdrawn upstream of the watershed and directly transmitted to potable water treatment plants in the city through pipes therefore c m o n is calculated on the basis of taipei yellow area in fig 2 and a m o n is the simulated results of the upstream of the feitsui reservoir dark green area water quality and quantity protection area in fig 2 suggesting that the points of water consumption and water withdrawal may be different this approach ensures that the wdis is not underestimated due to overestimations of availability 2 3 2 adaptation scenarios the system boundary of the pws includes raw water catchment and treatment potable water distribution and water usage in toilet flushing fig s3 a on the other hand the rwhs includes the construction of rainwater catchment a filter a rainwater storage tank a pump and rainwater distribution for toilet flushing fig s3 b the placements of pws and rwhs in the building are shown in fig 3 the functional unit fu for the analysis is defined as the provision of sanitation services for 204 people in a 4 story research building at national taiwan university for one month light green dot in fig 2 water demand is assumed to be the sum of toilet flushing five times per person per day with 6 l per flush for low flush toilets that is 30 l per person per day this study also assumes 1 the rwhs has a lifetime of at least 20 years and 2 all of the direct and indirect water consumption leads to water depletion risk in the research watershed three scenarios are designed to estimate rfdmon for the case study site s0 pws the potable water system is the business as usual scenario s1 rwhs x a combination of the rainwater harvesting system and the potable water system uses the addition of the rwhs to the pws to substitute 70 of potable water for toilet flushing with saved potable water available to be supplied for other water consumption needs s2 rwhs x i the rainwater harvesting system includes the same infrastructures as in s1 this scenario additionally includes the construction stage of the rwhs such as catchment filter storage tank pipes and pumps the data inventories of the three scenarios focused on direct and indirect water consumption from the watershed fig 3 while direct water consumption is water directly used for toilet flushing indirect water consumption includes electricity and chemical inputs in the pws and electricity usage and the construction stage in the rwhs the quantity of direct and indirect water flow and the nodes of water collection reservation and consumption are also presented in fig 3 in the pws fig 3 a direct water for toilet flushing is 184 m3 month in the research building indirect water consumption of water treatment procedure water distribution from the water treatment plant to the research building and pumping when using water in the research building is 47 1 m3 month 7 3 m3 month and 11 7 m3 month respectively in the rwhs x and rwhs x i fig 3 b water consumption from the pws accounts for 30 of the total consumption of pws direct use of rainwater for toilet flushing is estimated at 129 m3 month which is assumed to be excluded from the water depletion calculation on the watershed the indirect water use of rwhs is 0 22 m3 month for rainwater collection and 8 72 m3 month for rainwater pumping when using rainwater in the research building detail inventories of the three scenarios are summarized in tables s5 and s6 the data on electricity and chemical inputs in pws were obtained from the taiwan water resources agency 2013 the inventory of materials used in constructing the rwhs was obtained from the ecoinvent 3 0 database the electricity mix data were obtained from the taiwan power company taiwan power company 2015 the volume of the storage tanks was modeled by rain cycle which is a continuous mass balance software that uses the yield after spillage model jenkins and pearson 1978 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic water depletion index 3 1 1 temporal scale of wdi fig 4 shows the wdis of the research area at both annual and monthly scales 2009 2012 the wdis were derived from eqs 1 3 using historical data in this study the af erf was adjusted to conform to the result of a wdi of 0 51 for a cta of 0 37 which is the threshold between moderate and severe water depletion the annual wdi determined in this study was 0 732 which was higher than the defined threshold of water depletion and thus indicated severe water depletion the annual wdi from berger et al 2014 is also displayed in the figs 4 and s4 for reference the annual wdi estimated by berger et al 2014 was 0 116 which was six times lower than the average wdi calculated in this study the main differences in the estimations can be attributed to the af erf and cta in the calculation in their study an af erf with a value of 40 0 was utilized this setting was based on the assumptions that the extreme water depletion occurring at cta reached 0 25 when the wdi rose to 1 fig s1 this threshold was stricter than that was defined in our study the lower value of wdi estimated by berger et al 2014 might be due to the cta was calculated from the modeled annual water consumption and annual availability using watergap2 a global hydrological model this further suggested that the global hydrological model or the large spatial scale model as in fig s4 might not be suitable for our research area where regions for water withdrawal and water consumption are not the same using the monthly scale the maximum wdi mon in april was 0 98 which was approximately four times as high as the minimum wdi mon in october 0 25 previous research also indicated that monthly or seasonal temporal scales such as high and low flow periods are appropriate to depict the water resource status in taiwan lin et al 2017 this result showed that annual wdi values may not indicate all the water stress that occurs over a year and thus such values may mislead water management decision makers lin et al 2017 scherer et al 2015 monthly wdi values however can be used to provide more specific information to prepare for household water usage and agricultural irrigation in different months pfister and bayer 2014 3 1 2 water depletion index under climate change monthly available water amon in section 2 1 2 in future periods is a key parameter to derive the wdi under climate change in this study thus the monthly precipitation and streamflow under climate change scenarios were simulated and modeled fig s5 presents the results of relative changes in monthly average precipitation and streamflow under climate change scenarios in general increased precipitation was simulated during wet seasons from may to october and dry seasons from november to april in the csiro mk3 6 0 model at most precipitation increased 114 during dry seasons on the other hand increased precipitation during wet seasons and decreased precipitation during dry seasons were simulated in the ccsm4 model these simulations indicated that the risk of a strong flood at most 136 increased precipitation during the 2090s and drought at most 70 decreased precipitation during the 2070s might be high in rcp 8 5 scenarios these results were also validated based on previous studies conducted in northern taiwan yu and wang 2009 and showed the suitability of using a monthly scale in the determination of the wdi the monthly wdi under climate change were calculated with eqs 1 3 and the simulated parameters listed in supplementary information b fig 5 displays wdi mon in four time periods under four climate change scenarios and with two gcms it was observed that the wdimon changes considerably for example the period of march may spring has higher wdis and june august summer has lower wdis out of the four time periods the 2030s have the highest wdi mon with values being significantly different across the four time periods for all months the annual wdi derived from average amon cmon and swamon were also presented in fig 5 dotted lines the differences between wdimon under climate change in fig 5 and wdimon in the corresponding time periods without climate change effect are calculated to examine the influences of climate change on the wdis results of the change in wdi mon is shown in fig 6 a significant decrease in wdi mon was observed from june to august and then an increase in wdi mon from august to october was shown in most time periods and climate change scenarios the difference in the characterization factor in time is an essential aspect when considering time in global warming impacts assessment pinsonnault et al 2014 since wdimon can also serve as a characterization factor in the life cycle impact assessment berger et al 2014 it can be used to understand its variation in time based on the results in fig 5 we proposed the concept and application of the dynamic wdi this dynamic concept was also proposed in levasseur et al 2010 and pinsonnault et al 2014 as dynamic life cycle assessment dynamic lca it focused on inclusion of temporal information in every stage of the lca likewise collinge et al 2013 emphasized utilizing time dependent characterization factors to show the temporal variability of the impacts of an institutional building a long lasting infrastructure therefore the dynamic wdi mon is suggested to be coordinated with the appropriate corresponding period when calculating the impacts of water consumption 3 2 risk of freshwater depletion in the case study 3 2 1 current urban water consumption and related impacts according to the data inventory analysis tables s5 and s6 using 1 m3 potable water in a four story building in taipei consumes 1 36 m3 water including 1 05 m3 direct water and 0 31 m3 indirect water from raw water treatment water distribution and water pumping on the other hand using 1 m3 rainwater consumes 0 06 m3 stressed water due to pumping considering the construction stage of the rwhs an additional 0 01 m3 water was required rainwater reclaimed from the rwhs was assumed to substitute for 70 of the potable water used for toilet flushing monthly stressed water consumption of toilet flushing in the research building is shown in fig 7 a direct rainwater use was excluded from water consumption as it did not come from the watershed and would not contribute to freshwater depletion in all of the scenarios the largest share of water consumption was toilet flushing the direct potable water use in s0 moreover the indirect water use of aluminum oxide used in the potable water purification process was the hotspot in s0 accounting for 26 0 of indirect water consumption in s1 and s2 indirect water use of electricity for pumping rainwater accounted for 32 4 and 31 6 of indirect water consumption respectively this potential impact of the use of electricity for pumping has been validated by morales pinzón et al 2012 comparing s0 and s2 construction of rwhs the rwhs saved 166 2 m3 water in toilet flushing every month including 135 3 m3 direct water and 30 9 m3 indirect water by applying an rwhs potable water could be saved and applied to more valuable uses by comparing s1 and s2 it seems that the water consumption for the construction of an rwhs is negligible as shown in fig 7 a and table s6 the water consumption in the rainwater catchment including collecting pipe sand and storage tank and in the rainwater use stage including pump supply pipe and storage tank are 0 2 m3 and 0 5 m3 respectively these results are due to the relatively long lifespan of an rwhs at 20 years however inclusion of the construction stage in the impact assessment is suggested especially when life cycle energy and resources are required for a long lasting infrastructure 3 2 2 urban water consumption under the influences of climate change reduction in water depletion risk eq 5 was also calculated in this study to demonstrate how dynamic wdimon results in fig 5 can apply for evaluation of adaptation measures fig 7 b and fig s6 reveal the rfdmon of toilet flushing dotted line for current monthly and annual risk and colored bars for different scenarios the differences between the scenarios in figs 7 b and s6 indicated the reduction in rfdmon due to the application of the rwhs in the rwhs the risk of freshwater depletion was less fluctuant the potential of reduction in rfdmon was in the range of 17 9 m3 to 159 3 m3 when the rwhs was used vialle et al 2015 conducted an rwhs analysis with boulay s water stress indicator boulay et al 2011 and showed a similar result in which an rwhs was 0 71 l eq lower than a pws with the functional unit of 30 l of water for toilet flushing per day although the environmental performance of the rwhs alone seemed to be poorer than that of pws anand and apul 2011 crettaz et al 1999 the rwhs did show more water savings than the pws when the impacts of water resource depletion were considered vialle et al 2015 additionally the water saved by the rwhs is due to not only the saving of stressed water from the watershed but also to the reduction in chemicals and energy used for potable water treatment 3 3 limitations the variation of wdi is strongly affected by water consumption cmom and water availability related factors in this research the temporal and spatial resolution of wdimon with simulated available water amon were improved as a result a slight decrease in wdimon was observed for future scenarios fig 5 which was partly due to the increase in future available water from projected precipitation and streamflow under the influence of climate change fig s6 it is worth mentioning that increase in rainwater quantity does not guarantee the increase of water availability as the rainwater usually accompanies with high turbidity from seriously erosion nearby the watershed fakour et al 2016 besides it is difficult to catch the high streamflow in a short duration particularity because of the terrain characteristics of short rivers in taiwan on the other hand cmom is primarily estimated based on the projection of population in this research the water consumption per capita per day was assumed remaining as it is at present which neglected the potential of future advancement of water management strategies and technologies if the quantity of water saving is large enough to change the distribution of regional water resources the potential of water conservation is suggested to be included in the cmom estimation for example a water conservation research in california reported that the potential of water reduce use could reach to 34 from residential indoor and outdoor use commercial use and industrial use gleick et al 2003 in this case the savings would be taken into consideration when calculating future wdis therefore wdimon could be further improved with refined availability water considering water quality issue as well as contribution of water conservation 4 conclusions this study proposed an approach for constructing a dynamic wdi under climate change scenarios using modeled monthly available water and water consumption the wdimon can serve as a characterization factor in the life cycle impact assessment in order to understand its variation in impact results over time this index can also be applied to determine whether applying different wdimon is necessary when assessing impacts of water consumption in this case study parameters for calculating wdimon in taipei taiwan was derived as follows regional watershed data and projected precipitation the abovementioned parameters were applied to the hydrological model for simulating available water with consideration of the reservoir inflow data as the surface water stock in addition the actual water intake data for potable water facilities were used to represent water consumption instead of using the simulated data impact assessment on water consumption of an rwhs at a four story building scale was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of dynamic characterization factor the results showed that rwhs could save potable water for more valuable uses with the dynamic wdimon the impact results can show the monthly change of risk of water depletion with different time periods which could provide more information about the consequence of water consumption the use of dynamic wdi in this study facilitates the understanding of its monthly variation within a year due to the geographical or climate condition it is also worth noting that wdi can be applied to any defined temporal scales such as in season the changes in wdi for future scenarios could be attributed to the influence of climate change therefore it is suggested that the dynamic wdi mon should be coordinated with the appropriate corresponding period when calculating the impacts of water consumption especially when assessing water related adaption strategies in water consumption hot spots in response to climate change acknowledgments this work was financially supported by national taiwan university from excellence research program core consortiums ntuccp

6581,the lhasa river is the largest tributary of the yarlung zangbo river provides up to 85 of the water supply for the city of lhasa and has a high ecologic and economic importance annual streamflow of the lhasa river is reconstructed from juniperus tibetica tree rings the streamflow reconstruction developed for the southern tibetan plateau goes back to 1546 ce and has a r 2 of 0 485 spectral and wavelet analysis indicates the existence of decadal 34 and 16 years and interannual 8 1 5 7 4 8 3 8 3 5 3 2 2 7 2 3 and 2 1 years cycles that may reflect climate forcings lhasa river streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over a vast part of the yarlung zangbo river basin and represents streamflow of the upper yarlung zangbo river to a certain extent lhasa river variation is linked with large scale climate circulation features such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and asian summer monsoon some years of abnormally high and low streamflow are related to enso events based on the reconstruction the probability that annual streamflow does not exceed a target defined as the instrumental period mean was lower 48 non exceedance probability than during the instrumental period this study indicates that the instrumental record does not contain the full range of streamflow especially the lowest streamflow events and the reconstruction makes up for this shortcoming future water resource supply planning based on the instrumental record and streamflow reconstructions will be able to effectively reduce the risks posed by climate change keywords southern tibetan

mekong and salween the southern tibetan plateau tp has important influence on asian hydrology bolch et al 2012 yao et al 2012 fan and he 2015 and its river systems affect more than 3 billion people the hydrological regime on the tp is dominated by glacier melt snow meltwater and or summer precipitation high flows in august are the result of warm summer temperature and monsoon precipitation streamflow data from hydrological stations located upstream of transboundary rivers at the tp show an increasing trend with the accelerated melting of glaciers since at least 1980 li et al 2014 fan and he 2015 due to fast growing demands on water resources for drinking water tourism and hydropower generation in recent decades the supply of water from the tp as one of the main limitations to sustainable development of countries in downstream regions has been widely documented jacobs 2002 xue and wang 2005 immerzeel et al 2010 gain and wada 2014 orr et al 2012 due to uneven distribution of monsoonal rainfall this applies even to downstream regions with high annual precipitation such as vietnam thailand india kumar et al 2005 li et al 2011b trinh et al 2013 to improve water resource planning with the ultimate goal of improving peoples lives it is important to carry out scientific research on the spatiotemporal streamflow variation of various rivers of the tp continuous hydrological observations on the tp are not available before 1950 thus providing poor temporal and spatial coverage the application of remote sensing techniques and hydrological models has greatly improved the spatial coverage of hydrological data chen et al 2017 long et al 2016 2017 yi et al 2017 huang et al 2018a b huang et al 2018c however long term streamflow analysis is still limited by a

for the lhasa river in the yarlung zangbo river basin for the last 472 years we analyze characteristics of the streamflow reconstruction and its spatial representation over the tp finally to identify the main climatic forcings affecting lhasa river streamflow we compare the lhasa river reconstruction with atmospheric circulation indices such as sea surface temperatures sst of the indo pacific

geographical settings the lhasa river the largest tributary of the yarlung zangbo river originates on the southern slopes of the nyenchen tanglha mountains fig 1 the lhasa river provides most of the water supply for lhasa the largest city in tibet the lhasa river lies between 90 05 e and 93 20 e longitudes and 29 20 e and 31 15 n latitudes and drains a watershed of 32 558 km2 natural streamflow of the lhasa river is supplied mainly by precipitation groundwater and glacier melt water accounted for 46 28 and 26 of the total streamflow liu 1999 respectively the catchment area above the lhasa hydrological station is 26 225 km2 and accounts for 80 5 of the total basin area lin et al 2008 annual streamflow of the lhasa river averaged 295 m3 s during the period 1956 2017 due to the influence of glacier melt water and the summer monsoon the main streamflow peaks occur in summer august 876 m3 s the lowest streamflow occurs in winter march 49 4 m3 s the climate in the headwaters of the lhasa river is classified as continental plateau semi arid with summer monsoonal influence and strong ultraviolet radiation for the period 1963 2017 average annual temperature is 1 9 c the warmest month is july 11 1 c and the coldest month is january 9 0 c average annual precipitation is 473 8 mm and july 124 3 mm is the wettest month fig 2 a the basin is covered mostly by grassland and our sampling site a juniper forest stands on a southeastern facing slope characterized by thin and rocky soil favoring a strong influence of hydroclimatic variation on tree growth 2 2 tree ring data the long lived undamaged juniper trees juniperus tibetica kom at tanggu town near the lhasa river valley were sampled from open stands with shallow or rocky soils table 1 at least two cores were taken from live trees with the 5 1 mm diameter swedish increment borer in the rzs1 site in 2007 and one core per tree was collected from live trees with the 10 0 mm diameter swedish increment borer in the rzs2 and rzs3 site in 2018 in combination the three sites provide 85 cores taken from 63 trees all tree ring cores were air dried glued to wooden holders and fine polished with 400 grit sandpaper ring widths were measured to an accuracy of 0 001 mm using a ta unislide measurement system tree ring width data were crossdated by visual pattern matching and crossdating was checked using cofecha software holmes 1983 to remove non climatic trends while preserving the low frequency climate signal ring width series were detrended and converted to core indices with a negative exponential function these indices were combined into a final regional standard std chronology based on the bi weight robust mean as implemented in arstan software cook 1985 the period of usable chronology represented by adequate sample depth was evaluated with the expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 the eps is a function of the mean series intercorrelation which is the mean correlation between individual ring width series and number of cores 2 3 hydroclimatic data and statistical methods local monthly meteorological data from the danxiong station was used in this research the station is located at 91 06 e 30 29 n 4200 m a s l and its records date from 1963 to 2017 climagrams show a strongly continental climate with precipitation peaking in july fig 2a lhasa river streamflow data 1956 2017 were obtained for the lhasa hydrological station ls located at 91 15 e 29 64 n 3670 m a s l no reservoirs are upstream of ls and therefore this record approximately reflects the natural flow

correlations between tree ring width series and various monthly combinations of station hydroclimatic data a reconstruction model was estimated by simple linear regression of the water year august july streamflow series on the standard tree ring chronology we assessed the reliability of the reconstruction model applying leave one out cross validation method michaelsen 1987 the quality of the streamflow reconstruction equation was measured using the pearson correlation coefficient r product mean test pmt the sign test the reduction of error re and coefficient of efficiency ce fritts 1976 cook and kairiukstis 1990 a 20 year low pass filter was applied to the streamflow reconstruction to identify extended 10 years periods of high and low streamflow before the instrumental period thresholds of 2σ from the long term mean were used classify extremely high and low streamflow years spectral analysis by the wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 and multi taper method mtm mann and lees 1996 were used to reveal the cyclic characteristics of reconstructed streamflow the morlet wavelet with parameter m 6 was used in the wavelet analysis a 5 3 π taper was used in the mtm analysis and the power was tested against a red noise process at the 0 05 significance level to show that our reconstruction represents large scale hydroclimatic variability we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient of that series with the streamflow record of the yarlung zangbo river and cru gridded precipitation harris et al 2014 to reveal linkages with the atmospheric circulations composites of august july sst and june august monsoon season 850 hpa vector wind anomalies from the mean were created for the lowest and highest streamflow years n 10 during the period 1948 2017 furthermore the correlation coefficients between the lhasa river streamflow and atmospheric circulation indices were assessed to identify the main climatic forcings affecting interannual changes in streamflow to further analyze the influence of el niño events we used the superposed epoch analysis sea haurwitz and brier 1981 and the enso index li et al 2011a to evaluate significance of relationships in the presence of autocorrelation finally to assess whether the probability of meeting this minimum flow differed between the instrumental period and prior periods we used the cumulative distribution function cdf of reconstructed mean annual streamflow using the lognormal cdf we compared the specific probabilities of not meeting normal river streamflow targets in our case

ring regional chronology the resulting regional chronology covers the period 1211 2017 ce the tree ring chronology for use in reconstruction was truncated at 1546 ce before which the eps value drops below 0 85 the strength of the common signal can be assessed using the mean correlation of the individual ring width series with master as the three sampling sites were very close mean distance among the three sites is about 20 km the individual ring width series from the three sites showed a common signal r 0 620 and reflected the common responses to hydroclimatic influences consequently we combined all individual ring width series into a regional chronology the regional chronology had high standard deviation signal to noise ratio variance in first eigenvector and expressed population signal and also revealing that the radial growth of juniper trees was responding to common factors table 2 3 2 development of steamflow reconstruction the chronology is more strongly correlated with precipitation than with temperature fig 3 significant p 0 05 correlation with temperature occurs in previous july r 0 31 and current may r 0 57 and june r 0 41 correlation of the chronology with monthly precipitation is significant p 0 05 from may through june of the current year and from july to september of the previous year fig 3 highest monthly precipitation correlation r 0 60 is reached in current may the significant correlation with monsoon precipitation of the previous season could be explained by positively autocorrelated growth good growth conditions in one year leave the tree better prepared to start growth next year much higher positive correlations were seen between tree rings and streamflow from previous july to current march r 0 45 0 68 high monthly streamflow correlation r 0 63 and 0 42 is found in current june and july during the monsoon season correlation of tree ring index with precipitation and streamflow is increased with aggregation of the hydrologic series over several months the highest correlation between tree ring series and seasonalized precipitation and streamflow was found for total august june precipitation r 0 706 p 0 001 and september july streamflow r 0 761 p 0 001 intervals while september july streamflow may be an optimum hydroclimatic target for reconstruction the chinese governmental stakeholders prefer a long series of streamflow for the water year august july r 0 696 p 0 001 to implement directly into the regional water management and land use planning in the tibet autonomous region the analysis of gauge and weather observations indicates that total august june precipitation and august july streamflow of the lhasa river are strongly correlated r 0 846 p 0 001 to secure practical implementation of our modeled data water year august july streamflow was selected as the predictand for the reconstruction model a regression model was developed to reconstruct the water year flow august july the reconstruction model is y 188 545 173 973 x where x is the standard tree ring chronology and y is the reconstructed streamflow in m3 s the calibration verification statistics indicate a reliable model table 3 the model has a highly significant p 0 01 overall f and explains 48 5 r 2 0 485 of the actual streamflow variance for the 1956 2017 calibration interval results of product mean and the sign test also indicate a successful model positive re and ce are positive revealing useful skill when the model is applied to data not used in the fit the prediction r 2 based on leave one out cross validation error is only slightly lower than the calibration r 2 45 4 vs 48 5 as shown in fig 4 the reconstructed streamflow closely tracks the observed streamflow at high and low frequencies with a few exceptions the compression of variance of the reconstruction relative to the observed streamflow is expected given that less than half the observed variance is explained in reconstruction while our tree ring chronology is also highly correlated with calendar year normalized streamflow for the yarlung zangbo river r 0 61 p 0 001 for the period 1960 2009 fig 4b we did not develop a streamflow reconstruction for that river because of its relatively large draining basin however the comparison result in fig 4b suggests that the tree ring width variability could be also employed to model the yarlung zangbo flow in future 3 3 analysis of streamflow reconstruction for the lhasa river the water year august july streamflow of the lhasa river reconstructed over the last 472 years is shown in fig 5 remarkable periods of low streamflow occurred in 1588 1609 1627 1642 1656 1679 1733 1743 1754 1786 1792 1809 1822 1845 1874 1888 1912 1935 1942 1964 and 1972 1988 while high streamflow periods occurred in 1549 1587 1610 1626 1643 1655 1680 1690 1697 1732 1744 1753 1810 1821 1846 1873 1889 1911 and 1989 2007 extreme years are listed in table 4 as indicated by our streamflow reconstruction the low streamflow epoch in 1874 1888 is the most severe drought with low streamflow in the study area since 1546 ce as shown in fig 6 a mtm analysis detected 34 and 16 year cycles at 95 level in reconstructed streamflow data for the lhasa river some interannual cycles 8 1 year 95 5 7 year 95 4 8 year 95 3 8 year 99 3 5 year 99 3 2 year 99 2 7 year 95 2 3 year 99 and 2 1 year 95 were also found temporal characteristic of the different cycles is showed using wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 fig 6b the largest significant feature in the cwt is high variance near 34 years centered in the 2nd half of the 19th century the time plot shows this variance as a major wave with driest conditions near 1875 other significant patches of variance are near 16 years centered at about 1700 and 1950 some significant high frequency periodicities on most of the reconstructions are found between 2 and 8 years these findings are confirmed by the mtm spectra 3 4 streamflow and circulation analysis reconstructed lhasa river streamflow is significantly correlated p 0 001 with august june cru ts 4 01 gridded 0 5 0 5 precipitation over a broad geographic region especially in the yarlung zangbo river basin fig 7 a the results confirm that our streamflow reconstruction captures regional hydroclimatic changes meanwhile significant negative correlations are found in pakistan and western india with strongest correlations occurring in southern pakistan especially at the arabian sea coastline near gwadar port strongly significant regions of sst correlation are found in the tropical indian ocean and western pacific ocean suggesting that these tropical domains are the main moisture sources for our research area fig 7b during the highest streamflow years the sst anomaly is negative in the tropical eastern pacific but positive in the western pacific ocean indicating a cold enso phase la niña and vice versa fig 7c d highest streamflow years are characterized by strong southwesterly mean 850 hpa winds over the western tp and pakistan fig 7e lowest streamflow years are characterized by strong westerly winds at 850 hpa from inland over the tp fig 7f comparison of our reconstruction with the enso index developed by li et al 2011a reveals no significant relationship between lhasa river streamflow and enso superposed epoch analysis however shows a significant increase in streamflow during strong la niña episode year 0 and low streamflow during year 0 and two years after year 2 during strong el niño episodes fig 8 the probability of not meeting the 358 8 m3 s streamflow target the mean of reconstructed streamflow computed from cdf of the reconstructed streamflow series over the pre instrumental period 0 48 was remarkably lower than the probability calculated for the gauged record 0 56 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 dendrohydroclimate correlations the significant positive correlation between tree ring index and total august june precipitation indicated that the water deficit stress was a major limiting factor for the radial growth of juniper trees like the tree ring record total august june precipitation strongly correlate to streamflow variations indicating that corresponding signals from both climate parameters were contained within the tree ring record and streamflow the strong correlative linkage between tree growth and streamflow supports this conclusion in the lhasa river basin dry conditions before the onset of the summer monsoon cause drought stress to the juniper trees and are thus limiting the radial growth of juniper trees thus tree growth and riverflow benefit from the former summer and current spring early summer precipitation which increase the soil moisture content during the early part of the growing season most of the correlations between the radial growth of juniper trees and spring temperature were negative high may june temperatures enhance evapotranspiration and thus decrease soil moisture availability and streamflow thus a year with above average spring temperature is also indicative of both decreased streamflow and depressed ring growth 4 2 lhasa river streamflow and climatic forcings the lhasa river basin located on the monsoonal tibet is affected by large scale ocean atmosphere land circulation systems zhang et al 2007 gao et al 2017 results of superposed epoch analysis also show that strong el niño events correspond to low river discharge on the tp fig 8b a good example would be the strong 1877 1878 el niño and the low streamflow period of 1874 1888 instrumental historical and various other climate proxies show widespread dry conditions in 1877 1878 especially in asia and south america aceituno et al 2009 hao et al 2010 cook et al 2010 2013 composite maps of the ten highest and lowest streamflow years show that abnormally low and high streamflow corresponds with enso events pointing to enso as a causal mechanism for streamflow variation in tibet china fig 7c d the frequency cycles of reconstructed series 34 year 8 1 year 5 7 year 4 8 year 3 8 year 3 5 year 3 2 year 2 7 year 2 3 year and 2 1 year are also similar to the enso cycles li et al 2011a these results resemble other findings in nearby areas and suggest the impact of sst in the tropical oceans on streamflow in tibet shrestha and kostaschuk 2005 zhang et al 2007 as shown by gao et al 2017 variations of oxygen isotopic composition precipitation in the lhasa basin of southern tibet is mainly influenced by enso induced anomalies in southwesterly water vapor flux that originates from the bay of bengal arabian sea and tropical indian ocean during cold enso events la nina enhanced southwesterly and southerly winds bring abundant moisture across the indian peninsula this moisture travels northward causing increased rain over southern tibet and results in lower δ18op at lhasa and vice versa zhou et al 2001 yao et al 2013 gao et al 2017 fig 7 our results indicate that lhasa river streamflow is highly positively correlated with the regional precipitation variation it is thus not surprising that our streamflow reconstruction also displays fingerprints of enso events meanwhile our results also indicate that ssts in the tropical indian ocean are negative correlated with lhasa river streamflow suggesting enso is not the only forcing of lhasa river streamflow variations there might also be linkages with tropical and north indian climate change the highest streamflow values were also associated with unusually cool ssts in the indo pacific ocean fig 7c a previous study has revealed that cold warm spring summer ssts over the equatorial western indian ocean tend to concomitant with strong weak southwesterly monsoon jia and zhou 2003 during highest streamflow years cold ssts strong southwesterly flow at 850 hpa occurs over western tibet and pakistan fig 7f this strong phase of southwesterly monsoon should advect water vapor from the arabian sea and lead to increased precipitation and runoff during lowest streamflow years the opposite pattern occurs these results together reveal that the tropical indian ocean especially the arabian sea is an important water vapor source for southern tibet and that colder ssts in the arabian sea tend to increase northward water vapor transport to the southern tibet and likely contribute to increase streamflow in that region 4 3 water management implications the 472 year reconstruction presented in this paper the first streamflow reconstruction for the southern tp from tree rings is also highly correlated with streamflow of the yarlung zangbo river this spatial representation is especially important for understanding the long term water resource variation in the southern tp where environmental protection is a priority and the water resource is fundamental for sustainable development and economic activities such as agriculture hydroelectric power generation and tourism the lhasa river provide up to 85 of the water supply for the lhasa city which is the biggest city in tibet autonomous region the pronounced continuous multi year decline in average streamflow over 1874 1888 highlights the vulnerability of the water resource supply for lhasa city a return of severe large scale drought to the southern tp would endanger sustainable water resources management of the yarlung zangbo river basin and have important implications for downstream plains regions in bangladesh and india a potential limitation depends on the frequency and severity of large scale drought in the southern tp although water resource allocation in the southern tp is less than the estimated reliable diversion yield these values were based on the instrumental streamflow record in addition to the yarlung zangbo river many other large asian rivers flow through the southern tp and often experience similar precipitation drought variation from the asian summer monsoon that influences the vital spring summer runoff and snow coverage liu et al 2011 gou et al 2013 he et al 2013 2018 chen et al 2018 large scale drought on the tp has been reported in tree ring based drought reconstructions at multiple forest sites across the tp at various times including the 1870 s and 1920 s brauning and griebinger 2006 sano et al 2012 cook et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the monsoon asia drought atlas mada offers support for extensive regional drought over the tp in only a few of the years over 1874 1888 but the mada reconstructions are not validated in our region cook et al 2010 it is worth noting that other moisture proxies from tree rings show a much smaller magnitude of this particular regional drought than our reconstruction our series suggests a nearly 30 reduction of lhasa streamflow in 1876 1882 overall this extraordinary episode of low flow in the reconstructed series needs to be investigated further with additional collections of moisture sensitive tree ring sites from critical runoff producing regions of the lhasa and yarlung zangbo rivers water resources management is often based on the extreme streamflow values in instrumental records reconstructed streamflow may provide additional information about the probability distributions of streamflow during pre instrumental period and this information can contribute to water resource allocation planning during the pre instrumental period there was a drop to a 8 lower chance that annual streamflow would not meet this target but this does not mean we can let down our guard against extreme drought events if the water supply is insufficient for normal river streamflow targets in our case 358 8 m3 s in the southern tp for consecutive years impacts could be huge downstream in india and bangladesh for example the reconstructed dry episodes table 3 suggest that annual streamflow of the yarlung zangbo river is sometimes well below its long term mean for 3 4 consecutive years it is also possible that the flow could be depressed over a 10 year period as in 1874 1888 interestingly some abnormal streamflow years in this interval were concomitant with the strong warm enso event of the 1877 1878 winter our reconstruction provides evidence for linking the low flow of rivers draining the tp to the failure of agricultural production across the arid plains of the indus river valley and other asian rivers major historical famines which result from complex political and environmental factors often occur during extreme weather events like droughts and floods ó gráda 2009 an example is the largest historical famine in asia which claimed over 21 million lives in china and india during 1876 1879 ó gráda 2009 davis 2002 that famine caused by back to back shortfalls of the staple crops was likely associated with the severe drought and water shortfalls of the reconstructed interval 1874 1888 another example is the bengal famine of 1943 1944 with excess mortality of three million people goswami 1990 that also links to a warm enso event and low tp streamflow 254 5 m3 s results from both observations and model simulations suggest that the frequency and severity of enso events will greatly increase with global warming and more extreme el niño events will appear under the el niño like background warming latif and keenlyside 2009 xia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 thus the risk of low flow extremes will increase if future warm enso events like those of 1876 1878 recur under global warming meanwhile continuous low streamflows after 2007 deserves our great attention 5 conclusions we have developed a 472 year streamflow reconstruction from a ring width standard chronology built from tree ring cores of juniperus tibetica collected from the lhasa river basin on the southern tp the reconstructed record provides the information for lhasa river streamflow during the pre instrumental period the streamflow reconstruction corresponds well with changes of ssts in the indo pacific oceans and represents regional hydroclimatic signals we interpret the findings as further evidence at least in part for the influence of the enso and asian summer monsoon on streamflow variation in the southern tp while the reconstruction gives a smaller chance than the observed streamflow record that annual streamflow will fail to meet the 358 8 m3 s baseline or target defined by the instrumental mean flow of the lhasa river severe multi year periods of sustained low streamflow unlike any in the instrumental period occurred in the past recurrence of such events under global warming would have devastating effects on the entire basin including downstream regions in india and bangladesh ongoing study is providing new streamflow reconstructions for the large rivers of the southern tp such reconstructions will improve our understanding of the spatial temporal changes of streamflow of the southern tp importantly the development of streamflow reconstruction will be beneficial for the development of predictive models of streamflow variation which combined with projections of fresh water demands under different socio economics scenarios will contribute to the

6581,the lhasa river is the largest tributary of the yarlung zangbo river provides up to 85 of the water supply for the city of lhasa and has a high ecologic and economic importance annual streamflow of the lhasa river is reconstructed from juniperus tibetica tree rings the streamflow reconstruction developed for the southern tibetan plateau goes back to 1546 ce and has a r 2 of 0 485 spectral and wavelet analysis indicates the existence of decadal 34 and 16 years and interannual 8 1 5 7 4 8 3 8 3 5 3 2 2 7 2 3 and 2 1 years cycles that may reflect climate forcings lhasa river streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over a vast part of the yarlung zangbo river basin and represents streamflow of the upper yarlung zangbo river to a certain extent lhasa river variation is linked with large scale climate circulation features such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and asian summer monsoon some years of abnormally high and low streamflow are related to enso events based on the reconstruction the probability that annual streamflow does not exceed a target defined as the instrumental period mean was lower 48 non exceedance probability than during the instrumental period this study indicates that the instrumental record does not contain the full range of streamflow especially the lowest streamflow events and the reconstruction makes up for this shortcoming

mekong and salween the southern tibetan plateau tp has important influence on asian hydrology bolch et al 2012 yao et al 2012 fan and he 2015 and its river systems affect more than 3 billion people the hydrological regime on the tp is dominated by glacier melt snow meltwater and or summer precipitation high flows in august are the result of warm summer temperature and monsoon precipitation streamflow data from hydrological stations located upstream of transboundary rivers at the tp show an increasing trend with the accelerated melting of glaciers since at least 1980 li et al 2014 fan and he 2015 due to fast growing demands on water resources for drinking water tourism and hydropower generation in recent decades the supply of water from the tp as one of the main limitations to

planning with the ultimate goal of improving peoples lives it is important to carry out scientific research on the spatiotemporal streamflow variation of various rivers of the tp continuous hydrological observations on the tp are not available before 1950 thus providing poor temporal and spatial coverage the application of remote sensing techniques and hydrological models has greatly improved the spatial coverage of hydrological data chen et al 2017 long et al 2016 2017 yi et al 2017 huang et al 2018a b huang et al 2018c however long term streamflow analysis is still limited by a

hydroclimatic reconstructions liu et al 2011 he et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 the southern tp remains largely unexplored the aim of this research is to show a tree ring based streamflow reconstruction for the lhasa river in the yarlung zangbo river basin for the last 472 years we analyze characteristics of the streamflow reconstruction and its spatial representation over the tp finally to identify the main climatic forcings affecting lhasa river streamflow we compare the lhasa river reconstruction with atmospheric circulation indices such as sea surface temperatures sst of the indo pacific oceans and el niño southern oscillation enso we believe this is the first research to attempt to use tree ring width for streamflow reconstruction on the southern tp 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographical settings the lhasa river the largest tributary of the yarlung zangbo river originates on the southern slopes of the nyenchen tanglha mountains fig 1 the lhasa river provides most of the water supply for lhasa the largest city in tibet the lhasa river lies between 90 05 e and 93 20 e longitudes and 29 20 e and 31 15 n latitudes and drains a watershed of 32 558 km2 natural streamflow of the lhasa river is supplied mainly by precipitation groundwater and glacier melt water accounted for 46 28 and 26 of the total streamflow liu 1999 respectively the catchment area above the lhasa hydrological station is 26 225 km2 and accounts for 80 5 of the total basin area lin et al 2008 annual streamflow of the lhasa river averaged 295 m3 s during the period 1956 2017 due to the influence of glacier melt water and the summer monsoon the main streamflow peaks occur in summer august 876 m3 s the lowest streamflow occurs in winter march 49 4 m3 s the climate in the headwaters of the lhasa river is classified as continental plateau semi arid with summer monsoonal influence and strong ultraviolet radiation for the period 1963 2017 average annual temperature is 1 9 c the warmest month is july 11 1 c and the coldest month is january 9 0 c average annual precipitation is 473 8 mm and july 124 3 mm is the wettest month fig 2 a the basin is covered mostly by grassland and our sampling site a juniper forest stands on a southeastern facing slope characterized by thin and rocky soil favoring a strong influence of hydroclimatic variation on tree growth 2 2 tree ring data the long lived undamaged juniper trees juniperus tibetica kom at tanggu town near the lhasa river valley were sampled from open stands with shallow or rocky soils table 1 at least two cores were taken from live trees with the 5 1 mm diameter swedish increment borer in the rzs1 site in 2007 and one core per tree was collected from live trees with the 10 0 mm diameter swedish increment borer in the rzs2 and rzs3 site in 2018 in combination the three sites provide 85 cores taken from 63 trees all tree ring cores were air dried glued to wooden holders and fine polished with 400 grit sandpaper ring widths were measured to an accuracy of 0 001 mm using a ta unislide measurement system tree ring width data were crossdated by visual pattern matching and crossdating was checked using cofecha software holmes 1983 to remove non climatic trends while preserving the low frequency climate signal ring width series were detrended and converted to core indices with a negative exponential function these indices were combined into a final regional standard std chronology based on the bi weight robust mean as implemented in arstan software cook 1985 the period of usable chronology represented by adequate sample depth was evaluated with the expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 the eps is a function of the mean series intercorrelation which is the mean correlation between individual ring width series and number of cores 2 3 hydroclimatic data and statistical methods local monthly meteorological data from the danxiong station was used in this research the station is located at 91 06 e 30 29 n 4200 m a s l and its records date from 1963 to 2017 climagrams show a strongly continental climate with precipitation peaking in july fig 2a lhasa river streamflow data 1956 2017 were obtained for the lhasa hydrological station ls located at 91 15 e 29 64 n 3670 m a s l no reservoirs are upstream of ls and therefore this record approximately reflects the natural flow variation of the lhasa river the annual calendar year streamflow of the lhasa river at ls correlates strongly r 0 84 p 0 01 with annual streamflow of the yarlung zangbo river at the yangcun hydrological station yc 91 82 e 29 26 n 3550 m a s l for the 1960 2009 period of overlap of the two records fig 2c to reveal the linkages between climate streamflow and tree ring data we calculate correlations between tree ring width series and various monthly combinations of station hydroclimatic data a reconstruction model was estimated by simple linear regression of the water year august july streamflow series on the standard tree ring chronology we assessed the reliability of the reconstruction model applying leave one out cross validation method michaelsen 1987 the quality of the streamflow reconstruction equation was measured using the pearson correlation coefficient r product mean test pmt the sign test the reduction of error re and coefficient of efficiency ce fritts 1976 cook and kairiukstis 1990 a 20 year low pass filter was applied to the streamflow reconstruction to identify extended 10 years periods of high and low streamflow before the instrumental period thresholds of 2σ from the long term mean were used classify extremely high and low streamflow years spectral analysis by the wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 and multi taper method mtm mann and lees 1996 were used to reveal the cyclic characteristics of reconstructed streamflow the morlet wavelet with parameter m 6 was used in the wavelet analysis a 5 3 π taper was used in the mtm analysis and the power was tested against a red noise process at the 0 05 significance level to show that our reconstruction represents large scale hydroclimatic variability we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient of that series with the streamflow record of the yarlung zangbo river and cru gridded precipitation harris et al 2014 to reveal linkages with the atmospheric circulations composites of august july sst and june august monsoon season 850 hpa vector wind anomalies from the mean were created for the lowest and highest streamflow years n 10 during the period 1948 2017 furthermore the correlation coefficients between the lhasa river streamflow and atmospheric circulation indices were assessed to identify the main climatic forcings affecting interannual changes in streamflow to further analyze the influence of el niño events we used the superposed epoch analysis sea haurwitz and brier 1981 and the enso index li et al 2011a to evaluate significance of relationships in the presence of autocorrelation finally to assess whether the probability of meeting this minimum flow differed between the instrumental period and prior periods we used the cumulative distribution function cdf of reconstructed mean annual streamflow using the lognormal cdf we compared the specific probabilities of not meeting normal river streamflow targets in our case 358 8 m3 s between the reconstructed instrumental period 1956 2017 and 1 the full reconstructed period and 2 pre instrumental periods equal in length to the gaged record n 61 years 3 results 3 1 tree ring regional chronology the resulting regional chronology covers the period 1211 2017 ce the tree ring chronology for use in reconstruction was truncated at 1546 ce before which the eps value drops below 0 85 the strength of the common signal can be assessed using the mean correlation of the individual ring width series with master as the three sampling sites were very close mean distance among the three sites is about 20 km the individual ring width series from the three sites showed a common signal r 0 620 and reflected the common responses to hydroclimatic influences consequently we combined all individual ring width series into a regional chronology the regional chronology had high standard deviation signal to noise ratio variance in first eigenvector and expressed population signal and also revealing that the radial growth of juniper trees was responding to common factors table 2 3 2 development of steamflow reconstruction the chronology is more strongly correlated with precipitation than with temperature fig 3 significant p 0 05 correlation with temperature occurs in previous july r 0 31 and current may r 0 57 and june r 0 41 correlation of the chronology with monthly precipitation is significant p 0 05 from may through june of the current year and from july to september of the previous year fig 3 highest monthly precipitation correlation r 0 60 is reached in current may the significant correlation with monsoon precipitation of the previous season could be explained by positively autocorrelated growth good growth conditions in one year leave the tree better prepared to start growth next year much higher positive correlations were seen between tree rings and streamflow from previous july to current march r 0 45 0 68 high monthly streamflow correlation r 0 63 and 0 42 is found in current june and july during the monsoon season correlation of tree ring index with precipitation and streamflow is increased with aggregation of the hydrologic series over several months the highest correlation between tree ring series and seasonalized precipitation and streamflow was found for total august june precipitation r 0 706 p 0 001 and september july streamflow r 0 761 p 0 001 intervals while september july streamflow may be an optimum hydroclimatic target for reconstruction the chinese governmental stakeholders prefer a long series of streamflow for the water year august july r 0 696 p 0 001 to implement directly into the regional water management and land use planning in the tibet autonomous region the analysis of gauge and weather observations indicates that total august june precipitation and august july streamflow of the lhasa river are strongly correlated r 0 846 p 0 001 to secure practical implementation of our modeled data water year august july streamflow was selected as the predictand for the reconstruction model a regression model was developed to reconstruct the water year flow august july the reconstruction model is y 188 545 173 973 x where x is the standard tree ring chronology and y is the reconstructed streamflow in m3 s the calibration verification statistics indicate a reliable model table 3 the model has a highly significant p 0 01 overall f and explains 48 5 r 2 0 485 of the actual streamflow variance for the 1956 2017 calibration interval results of product mean and the sign test also indicate a successful model positive re and ce are positive revealing useful skill when the model is applied to data not used in the fit the prediction r 2 based on leave one out cross validation error is only slightly lower than the calibration r 2 45 4 vs 48 5 as shown in fig 4 the reconstructed streamflow closely tracks the observed streamflow at high and low frequencies with a few exceptions the compression of variance of the reconstruction relative to the observed streamflow is expected given that less than half the observed variance is explained in reconstruction while our tree ring chronology is also highly correlated with calendar year normalized streamflow for the yarlung zangbo river r 0 61 p 0 001 for the period 1960 2009 fig 4b we did not develop a streamflow reconstruction for that river because of its relatively large draining basin however the comparison result in fig 4b suggests that the tree ring width variability could be also employed to model the yarlung zangbo flow in future 3 3 analysis of streamflow reconstruction for the lhasa river the water year august july streamflow of the lhasa river reconstructed over the last 472 years is shown in fig 5 remarkable periods of low streamflow occurred in 1588 1609 1627 1642 1656 1679 1733 1743 1754 1786 1792 1809 1822 1845 1874 1888 1912 1935 1942 1964 and 1972 1988 while high streamflow periods occurred in 1549 1587 1610 1626 1643 1655 1680 1690 1697 1732 1744 1753 1810 1821 1846 1873 1889 1911 and 1989 2007 extreme years are listed in table 4 as indicated by our streamflow reconstruction the low streamflow epoch in 1874 1888 is the most severe drought with low streamflow in the study area since 1546 ce as shown in fig 6 a mtm analysis detected 34 and 16 year cycles at 95 level in reconstructed streamflow data for the lhasa river some interannual cycles 8 1 year 95 5 7 year 95 4 8 year 95 3 8 year 99 3 5 year 99 3 2 year 99 2 7 year 95 2 3 year 99 and 2 1 year 95 were also found temporal characteristic of the different cycles is showed using wavelet analysis torrence and compo 1998 fig 6b the largest significant feature in the cwt is high variance near 34 years centered in the 2nd half of the 19th century the time plot shows this variance as a major wave with driest conditions near 1875 other significant patches of variance are near 16 years centered at about 1700 and 1950 some significant high frequency periodicities on most of the reconstructions are found between 2 and 8 years these findings are confirmed by the mtm spectra 3 4 streamflow and circulation analysis reconstructed lhasa river streamflow is significantly correlated p 0 001 with august june cru ts 4 01 gridded 0 5 0 5 precipitation over a broad geographic region especially in the yarlung zangbo river basin fig 7 a the results confirm that our streamflow reconstruction captures regional hydroclimatic changes meanwhile significant negative correlations are found in pakistan and western india with strongest correlations occurring in southern pakistan especially at the arabian sea coastline near gwadar port strongly significant regions of sst correlation are found in the tropical indian ocean and western pacific ocean suggesting that these tropical domains are the main moisture sources for our research area fig 7b during the highest streamflow years the sst anomaly is negative in the tropical eastern pacific but positive in the western pacific ocean indicating a cold enso phase la niña and vice versa fig 7c d highest streamflow years are characterized by strong southwesterly mean 850 hpa winds over the western tp and pakistan fig 7e lowest streamflow years are characterized by strong westerly winds at 850 hpa from inland over the tp fig 7f comparison of our reconstruction with the enso index developed by li et al 2011a reveals no significant relationship between lhasa river streamflow and enso superposed epoch analysis however shows a significant increase in streamflow during strong la niña episode year 0 and low streamflow during year 0 and two years after year 2 during strong el niño episodes fig 8 the probability of not meeting the 358 8 m3 s streamflow target the mean of reconstructed streamflow computed from cdf of the reconstructed streamflow series over the pre instrumental period 0 48 was remarkably lower than the probability calculated for the gauged record 0 56 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 dendrohydroclimate correlations the significant positive correlation between tree ring index and total august june precipitation indicated that the water deficit stress was a major limiting factor for the radial growth of juniper trees like the tree ring record total august june precipitation strongly correlate to streamflow variations indicating that corresponding signals from both climate parameters were contained within the tree ring record and streamflow the strong correlative linkage between tree growth and streamflow supports this conclusion in the lhasa river basin dry conditions before the onset of the summer monsoon cause drought stress to the juniper trees and are thus limiting the radial growth of juniper trees thus tree growth and riverflow benefit from the former summer and current spring early summer precipitation which increase the soil moisture content during the early part of the growing season most of the correlations between the radial growth of juniper trees and spring temperature were negative high may june temperatures enhance evapotranspiration and thus decrease soil moisture availability and streamflow thus a year with above average spring temperature is also indicative of both decreased streamflow and depressed ring growth 4 2 lhasa river streamflow and climatic forcings the lhasa river basin located on the monsoonal tibet is affected by large scale ocean atmosphere land circulation systems zhang et al 2007 gao et al 2017 results of superposed epoch analysis also show that strong el niño events correspond to low river discharge on the tp fig 8b a good example would be the strong 1877 1878 el niño and the low streamflow period of 1874 1888 instrumental historical and various other climate proxies show widespread dry conditions in 1877 1878 especially in asia and south america aceituno et al 2009 hao et al 2010 cook et al 2010 2013 composite maps of the ten highest and lowest streamflow years show that abnormally low and high streamflow corresponds with enso events pointing to enso as a causal mechanism for streamflow variation in tibet china fig 7c d the frequency cycles of reconstructed series 34 year 8 1 year 5 7 year 4 8 year 3 8 year 3 5 year 3 2 year 2 7 year 2 3 year and 2 1 year are also similar to the enso cycles li et al 2011a these results resemble other findings in nearby areas and suggest the impact of sst in the tropical oceans on streamflow in tibet shrestha and kostaschuk 2005 zhang et al 2007 as shown by gao et al 2017 variations of oxygen isotopic composition precipitation in the lhasa basin of southern tibet is mainly influenced by enso induced anomalies in southwesterly water vapor flux that originates from the bay of bengal arabian sea and tropical indian ocean during cold enso events la nina enhanced southwesterly and southerly winds bring abundant moisture across the indian peninsula this moisture travels northward causing increased rain over southern tibet and results in lower δ18op at lhasa and vice versa zhou et al 2001 yao et al 2013 gao et al 2017 fig 7 our results indicate that lhasa river streamflow is highly positively correlated with the regional precipitation variation it is thus not surprising that our streamflow reconstruction also displays fingerprints of enso events meanwhile our results also indicate that ssts in the tropical indian ocean are negative correlated with lhasa river streamflow suggesting enso is not the only forcing of lhasa river streamflow variations there might also be linkages with tropical and north indian climate change the highest streamflow values were also associated with unusually cool ssts in the indo pacific ocean fig 7c a previous study has revealed that cold warm spring summer ssts over the equatorial western indian ocean tend to concomitant with strong weak southwesterly monsoon jia and zhou 2003 during highest streamflow years cold ssts strong southwesterly flow at 850 hpa occurs over western tibet and pakistan fig 7f this strong phase of southwesterly monsoon should advect water vapor from the arabian sea and lead to increased precipitation and runoff during lowest streamflow years the opposite pattern occurs these results together reveal that the tropical indian ocean especially the arabian sea is an important water vapor source for southern tibet and that colder ssts in the arabian sea tend to increase northward water vapor transport to the southern tibet and likely contribute to increase streamflow in that region 4 3 water management implications the 472 year reconstruction presented in this paper the first streamflow reconstruction for the southern tp from tree rings is also highly correlated with streamflow of the yarlung zangbo river this spatial representation is especially important for understanding the long term water resource variation in the southern tp where environmental protection is a priority and the water resource is fundamental for sustainable development and economic activities such as agriculture hydroelectric power generation and tourism the lhasa river provide up to 85 of the water supply for the lhasa city which is the biggest city in tibet autonomous region the pronounced continuous multi year decline in average streamflow over 1874 1888 highlights the vulnerability of the water resource supply for lhasa city a return of severe large scale drought to the southern tp would endanger sustainable water resources management of the yarlung zangbo river basin and have important implications for downstream plains regions in bangladesh and india a potential limitation depends on the frequency and severity of large scale drought in the southern tp although water resource allocation in the southern tp is less than the estimated reliable diversion yield these values were based on the instrumental streamflow record in addition to the yarlung zangbo river many other large asian rivers flow through the southern tp and often experience similar precipitation drought variation from the asian summer monsoon that influences the vital spring summer runoff and snow coverage liu et al 2011 gou et al 2013 he et al 2013 2018 chen et al 2018 large scale drought on the tp has been reported in tree ring based drought reconstructions at multiple forest sites across the tp at various times including the 1870 s and 1920 s brauning and griebinger 2006 sano et al 2012 cook et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the monsoon asia drought atlas mada offers support for extensive regional drought over the tp in only a few of the years over 1874 1888 but the mada reconstructions are not validated in our region cook et al 2010 it is worth noting that other moisture proxies from tree rings show a much smaller magnitude of this particular regional drought than our reconstruction our series suggests a nearly 30 reduction of lhasa streamflow in 1876 1882 overall this extraordinary episode of low flow in the reconstructed series needs to be investigated further with additional collections of moisture sensitive tree ring sites from critical runoff producing regions of the lhasa and yarlung zangbo rivers water resources management is often based on the extreme streamflow values in instrumental records reconstructed streamflow may provide additional information about the probability distributions of streamflow during pre instrumental period and this information can contribute to water resource allocation planning during the pre instrumental period there was a drop to a 8 lower chance that annual streamflow would not meet this target but this does not mean we can let down our guard against extreme drought events if the water supply is insufficient for normal river streamflow targets in our case 358 8 m3 s in the southern tp for consecutive years impacts could be huge downstream in india and bangladesh for example the reconstructed dry episodes table 3 suggest that annual streamflow of the yarlung zangbo river is sometimes well below its long term mean for 3 4 consecutive years it is also possible that the flow could be depressed over a 10 year period as in 1874 1888 interestingly some abnormal streamflow years in this interval were concomitant with the strong warm enso event of the 1877 1878 winter our reconstruction provides evidence for linking the low flow of rivers draining the tp to the failure of agricultural production across the arid plains of the indus river valley and other asian rivers major historical famines which result from complex political and environmental factors often occur during extreme weather events like droughts and floods ó gráda 2009 an example is the largest historical famine in asia which claimed over 21 million lives in china and india during 1876 1879 ó gráda 2009 davis 2002 that famine caused by back to back shortfalls of the staple crops was likely associated with the severe drought and water shortfalls of the reconstructed interval 1874 1888 another example is the bengal famine of 1943 1944 with excess mortality of three million people goswami 1990 that also links to a warm enso event and low tp streamflow 254 5 m3 s results from both observations and model simulations suggest that the frequency and severity of enso events will greatly increase with global warming and more extreme el niño events will appear under the el niño like background warming latif and keenlyside 2009 xia et al 2017 liu et al 2018 thus the risk of low flow extremes will increase if future warm enso events like those of 1876 1878 recur under global warming meanwhile continuous low streamflows after 2007 deserves our great attention 5 conclusions we have developed a 472 year streamflow reconstruction from a ring width standard chronology built from tree ring cores of juniperus tibetica collected from the lhasa river basin on the southern tp the reconstructed record provides the information for lhasa river streamflow during the pre instrumental period the streamflow reconstruction corresponds well with changes of ssts in the indo pacific oceans and represents regional hydroclimatic signals we interpret the findings as further evidence at least in part for the influence of the enso and asian summer monsoon on streamflow variation in the southern tp while the reconstruction gives a smaller chance than the observed streamflow record that annual streamflow will fail to meet the 358 8 m3 s baseline or target defined by the instrumental mean flow of the lhasa river severe multi year periods of sustained low streamflow unlike any in the instrumental period occurred in the past recurrence of such events under global warming would have devastating effects on the entire basin including downstream regions in india and bangladesh ongoing study is providing new streamflow reconstructions for the large rivers of the southern tp such reconstructions will improve our understanding of the spatial temporal changes of streamflow of the southern tp importantly the development of streamflow reconstruction will be beneficial for the development of predictive models of streamflow variation which combined with projections of fresh water demands under different socio economics scenarios will contribute to the sustainable use of water resources in asia declaration of interest the author declares that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work was supported by the nsfc 91547115 and u1803341

6582,extreme rainfall is the most common cause of flooding and likelihood of such events is found to increase in recent studies large scale natural variability human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming are important drivers of extreme rainfall understanding the association of these drivers with extreme rainfall and finding out the most significant physical driver will provide a foundation for risk assessment this study presents a methodology to investigate the association of extreme rainfall events with physical drivers and to model their dependence structure the methodology is demonstrated with application to mahanadi river basin india non stationary extreme value models with multivariate enso index global average temperature anomalies and local mean temperature anomalies as covariates are fitted at non stationary rainfall grids of the basin statistical modelling confirms localized temperature to be the main driver influencing rainfall extremes clausius clapeyron cc scaling curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes significant deviations from the expected cc scaling behaviour are observed daily rainfall extremes show peaks at low 25 c to medium 30 c range of temperature but exhibit a decrease at high temperatures for most of the grids no change in this pattern of relationship is observed when the extreme rainfall is lagged by 1 9 days with temperature this time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere the copula theory is applied to capture the dependence of annual maximum daily rainfall and temperature extremes conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall are estimated by conditioning on local mean temperature values of strongest extreme rainfall events comparison of conditional probabilities suggests that stronger rainfall events are occurring at 30 c this study emphasizes the necessity of understanding the dependence structure of extreme rainfall and local mean temperature keywords extreme rainfall local mean temperature non stationarity extreme value theory clausius clapeyron scaling curves copula theory 1 introduction increase in extreme rainfall related hazards in a warming climate is the motivation to study the relationship of extreme rainfall with temperature extreme rainfall events are responsible for river floods and flash floods high intensity rainfall over short time scale can cause flash flooding and continuous heavy rainfall can cause river flooding risk of floods is high in a warming climate ipcc 2012 observations and climate model projections show an increase in extreme rainfall events due to warmer climate allan and soden 2008 o gorman 2015 utsumi et al 2011 there are strong evidences for intensification of global water cycle huntington 2006 the primary cause of this intensification is the increased capacity of warmer atmosphere to hold more moisture the physical clausius clapeyron relationship with the assumption of constant relative humidity suggests a rise of about 6 5 or 7 in atmospheric moisture per degree increase in temperature this relationship predicts the intensification of hydrologic cycle across the globe with some regional variations allen and ingram 2002 trenberth et al 2003 the strength of association between rainfall extremes and global average temperature using non stationary generalized extreme value analysis was determined by westra et al 2013 median intensity of extreme rainfall was found to change with global average temperature at a rate ranging between 5 9 and 7 7 k 1 but with significant variation by latitude this rate of increase is confirmed in other studies at daily utsumi et al 2011 and sub daily timescales lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 however a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between local scale thermodynamic effects large scale atmospheric circulation and extreme rainfall is needed to identify the likely future of such events westra et al 2014 rainfall and temperature extremes have been analysed individually on global zwiers and wehner 2013 as well as regional scale angélil et al 2016 but it is important to study their association due to changing nature of extremes trenberth and shea 2005 suggest that rainfall and temperature records should not be interpreted without considering the strong co variability between them the relationships between rainfall and temperature in contiguous united states and europe were investigated by madden and williams 1978 from 1897 to 1960 and relationships for each month of the year for the period 1905 to 1984 were updated by zhao and khalil 1993 associations between global precipitation and surface temperature on inter annual and longer time scales were explored for the period 1979 2006 by adler et al 2008 changes to the bivariate distributions of temperature and rainfall were assessed by estrella and menzel 2013 a hierarchical bayesian approach was used to study the joint projections of rainfall and temperature by tebaldi and sansó 2009 trends in joint quantiles of temperature and rainfall were investigated by beniston 2009 to explore the behaviour of high rainfall low temperature high rainfall high temperature low rainfall high temperature and low rainfall low temperature in europe significant changes were observed in these four combinations at all the locations considered in this study there is increase in the joint occurrence of warm dry and warm wet events at global scale while cold wet and cold dry events have decreased over most parts of globe hao et al 2013 the relationship of extreme rainfall magnitudes and temperature was investigated by gaur et al 2018 at multiple locations of canada in order to understand the effects of global warming on rainfall extremes they found drastic intensification of rainfall extremes with temperature for shorter duration rainfall events compared to longer duration events investigating the association of rainfall intensity and temperature is crucial to understand the link of atmospheric warming to changing behaviour of rainfall extremes clausius clapeyron cc scaling relationship is widely used to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes allen and ingram 2002 berg et al 2013 jones et al 2010 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 o gorman and schneider 2009a pall et al 2007 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 the greatest agreement with predicted changes in rainfall extremes using cc scaling has been found in mid latitudes pall et al 2007 deviations from cc scaling are observed in short duration rainfall extremes using century long records of hourly rainfall observations in de bilt netherlands lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 the validity of cc relationship for different seasons is investigated by berg et al 2009 using observed and simulated datasets in europe the extreme rainfall intensity is observed to increase in winter and decrease in summer cc scaling controls the peak of large scale precipitation with increasing temperature in winter whereas availability of moisture is the dominant factor than the capacity of atmosphere to hold moisture in summer the applicability of cc relationship to limit maximum rainfall intensity varies from region to region and in different seasons as well shaw et al 2011 generally daily rainfall intensities increase slowly with increase in temperature compared to hourly intensities the effect of temporal resolution on the scaling of extreme rainfall intensity with temperature is investigated by utsumi et al 2011 the cc scaling was found to be valid on sub hourly timescale even in those regions where the scaling relationship was not valid on daily timescale changes in moist adiabatic temperature lapse rate upward velocity and in temperature when rainfall extreme occur forms the physical basis for changes in rainfall extremes o gorman and schneider 2009b the scaling relationship between rainfall and temperature does not imply cause and effect as the moisture availability can be a limitation therefore thermodynamics of moisture holding capacity dynamics of atmospheric circulation and moisture advection should be considered jones et al 2010 clausius clapeyron relationship unequivocally provides a reason to study the interaction of rainfall and temperature but its validity at regional scale is in question rate of change of daily extreme rainfall with temperature might vary with geographic locations depending on the role of other physical processes responsible for generating the extreme rainfall event thus it is important to first identify and isolate the effects of physical drivers on extreme rainfall of the region under study rainfall in india is highly variable increasing spatial variability in extreme rainfall was reported by ghosh et al 2011 a major driver responsible for climate variability on inter annual timescale is el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon the relationship of indian summer monsoon rainfall and enso is extensively studied azad and rajeevan 2016 gadgil et al 2004 kumar et al 1999 pant and parthasarathy 1981 rasmusson and carpenter 1983 sikka 1980 therefore it is important to examine the association of enso with extreme rainfall of the study area increase in extreme rainfall events of india under anthropogenic warming climate is confirmed in a recent study by mukherjee et al 2018 therefore the choice of human induced global warming as another important physical driver influencing the rainfall extremes is appropriate mondal and mujumdar 2015 modelled the non stationarities in extreme rainfall characteristics of india local temperature changes have been found to be more significantly affecting the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall spells of india thus local atmospheric warming is considered as another important process associated with the changing character of extremes selection of physical drivers is discussed in detail in section 3 2 in this study the association of extreme rainfall of a flood prone region of india is examined with el niño southern oscillation global average surface air temperature anomaly series and local mean temperature anomaly series via non stationary extreme value modelling this study is an attempt to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship of extreme rainfall with the most significant physical driver after establishing the conclusion that local mean temperature is significantly influencing the rainfall extremes the curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed the mean temperature values associated with the strongest extreme rainfall events are determined further the dependence of these two variables is quantified through a rank based correlation coefficient the copula theory is applied to determine probabilities of extreme rainfall conditioned on mean temperature values where peaks in extreme rainfall are observed the paper is organized as follows selection of the study area is justified in section 2 data used and selection of covariates for developing non stationary extreme value models is described in section 3 the methodology to achieve the objectives is defined in section 4 the results are shown and interpreted in section 5 section 6 provides a discussion on the findings limitations of the present work and possible extensions 2 study area mahanadi river basin shown in fig 1 is selected as the study area this basin has witnessed frequent heavy floods in the recent past the river originates in chhattisgarh and traverses a length of 851 km with the catchment area of 1 41 589 km2 extending from 80 28 e to 86 43 e longitudes and 19 8 n to 23 32 n latitudes before it discharges into bay of bengal mahanadi is one of the major rivers of the country and this river is mainly rain fed in the summer monsoon season from june to september major floods from 1960 to 2008 have caused significant damages in the basin there is increase in number of affected districts in nineties but this number is significantly high for the floods which occurred in 2001 2003 2006 and 2008 this hints at an increase in spatial extent of rainfall extremes heavy rainfall leading to a flash flood in september 2011 has inundated those villages above hirakud dam which were never affected before the basin is expected to be the worst affected in terms of occurrences of floods due to climate change gosain et al 2006 the projected climate conditions also show an increase in the intensity of floods ashokan and dutta 2008 increase in number of wet days and wet day precipitation amounts is predicted with conditional random field based downscaling raje and mujumdar 2009 a recent study has shown an increasing trend in mahanadi floods the study reveals that major incidences of high floods are occurring due to an increase in extreme rainfall in the middle reaches of the basin jena et al 2014 thus it is important to identify the physical driver which is significantly influencing the extreme rainfall of this region 3 data description 3 1 rainfall and temperature data high resolution gridded 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude daily rainfall dataset developed from 6995 rain gauge stations pai et al 2014 and high resolution daily gridded temperature dataset 1 latitude 1 longitude developed from 395 quality controlled stations srivastava et al 2009 are used in this study common period of 60 years from 1951 to 2010 is chosen for this study based on the data availability for rainfall temperature and the covariates defined subsequently temperature data is re gridded to the same scale of rainfall using bilinear interpolation temperature data is missing at 12 grids near the outfall into bay of bengal therefore 233 grids out of 245 are selected based on availability of data for the selected variables mahanadi river basin receives most of the rain in summer monsoon season therefore data for four monsoon months june september is used in this study 3 2 data for covariates three physical covariates are used in this study to formulate non stationary models for annual maximum daily rainfall extremes the el niño southern oscillation is an indicator of large scale natural climate variability which affects heavy rainfall events over many parts of the world influence of enso on extreme rainfall at global scale is examined by kenyon and hegerl 2010 they observe strong increase in extreme rainfall in united states central america and india while moderate to strongly moderate decrease is seen in southern africa southeast asia australia and pacific northwest at regional scale effects of enso on extreme rainfall are studied in western united states cayan et al 1999 contiguous united states gershunov and barnett 1998 schubert et al 2008 north america whan and zwiers 2017 south america grimm and tedeschi 2009 and india mondal and mujumdar 2015 enso is a large complex and multifaceted system involving various aspects of ocean and atmosphere interactions in tropical pacific there are different ways to measure enso based on mean sea level pressure difference sea surface temperature outgoing longwave radiation and wind across the tropical pacific southern oscillation index soi is the widely used enso index measuring the sea level pressure difference at tahiti and darwin another popular enso indicator is based on sea surface temperature sst anomalies of central and eastern equatorial pacific southern oscillation index soi el adlouni et al 2007 katz et al 2002 min et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 niño3 4 sst anomalies katz et al 2002 maity and kumar 2006 mondal and mujumdar 2015 are used as covariates to study the effect of large scale variability on extreme rainfall to integrate more information on coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon multivariate enso index mei is introduced wolter and timlin 1993 mei is based on six parameters sea level pressure sea surface temperature zonal and meridional components of surface wind surface air temperature and cloudiness mei is the first unrotated principal component of these six parameters since mei is derived from significant climate features it is less vulnerable to non enso related variability arising due to single variable consideration wolter and timlin 1998 2011 in an attempt to identify the enso induced rainfall and runoff variability in australia mei is found to outperform soi and sst kiem and franks 2001 in this study mei index averaged over winter season shown in fig 2 a is chosen as a physical covariate to investigate the effect of enso on extreme rainfall of the study area global hydrologic cycle is expected to intensify in a warming climate allen and ingram 2002 past research has established global warming to be a major cause for intensification of rainfall extremes on local as well as regional scale allan and soden 2008 o gorman 2015 utsumi et al 2011 climate models show an increase of 1 3 per kelvin in global mean rainfall due to surface warming held and soden 2006 vecchi and soden 2007 but observational datasets suggest an increased rate the response of rainfall and total atmospheric water to global warming is assessed by wentz et al 2007 based on satellite observations for the period 1987 2006 they found the rate of increase to be about 7 per kelvin of surface warming which is close to clausius clapeyron scaling global average temperature is the most robust indicator of human induced climate change hegerl et al 2007 to study changes in extreme rainfall across the globe due to global warming global average temperature was used as a covariate by westra et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2016 identified linear scaling of heavy rainfall events with global mean temperature changes for different emission scenarios wartenburger et al 2017 investigated the changes in regional climate extremes as a function of global mean temperature as a follow up to this study changes in rainfall extremes are investigated in west and central africa by diedhiou et al 2018 to address the implications of 1 5 c and 2 c global warming with reference to the pre industrial period it is important to address the question of how global warming is influencing the extreme rainfall of the study area therefore global average temperature anomaly series is used as an indicator of global warming nasa gistemp hansen et al 2010 gistemp team 2018 global surface air temperature anomaly series with respect to 1951 1980 mean shown in fig 2b is used as a covariate to develop non stationary extreme value models rainfall within a catchment basin is governed by two sources external moisture advected by the winds into the region or internal water vapours formed by local evaporation regional water cycle is complicated as it has contributions from external and internal moisture sources and flows in rivers and groundwater reservoirs are additional boundary fluxes eltahir and bras 1996 floods are often fairly local and develop on shorter time scale trenberth 2011 external advective moisture initiates monsoon rainfall in india but availability of local moisture can contribute to large amount of rainfall leading to flooding of a particular region contribution of local evaporation to local precipitation is generally measured by precipitation recycling the concept of precipitation recycling is used in several studies to identify the contribution of regional moisture to generation of precipitation in the same region brubaker et al 1993 dominguez and kumar 2008 eltahir and bras 1996 guo et al 2018 pathak et al 2014 trenberth 1999 these studies suggest that local evaporation contributes to the total amount of rainfall in the region and local temperature significantly controls the evaporation process therefore it is important to examine how local temperature changes are influencing the extreme rainfall of the region mondal and mujumdar 2015 found non stationary associations between intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall with local mean temperature in india sun et al 2017 studied the impact of enso and local temperature changes on extreme rainfall at global scale using non stationary generalized extreme value models for the period 1979 2015 they found that stationary models dominate over 52 of global land surface local mean temperature is the most significant covariate over 26 of global land and enso dominates over 22 of global land thus selection of local mean temperature as a physical driver influencing the extreme rainfall is justified annual mean temperature anomaly series based on 1951 1980 mean at each grid is considered as a covariate to investigate the effect of localized changes on rainfall extremes in this study fig 2c shows the location of grids where temperature is available after re gridding and fig 2d shows the slope of trends in annual average local mean temperature at each grid slope of the trends is positive at many grids with high magnitude in the left most section of the basin which decreases on moving from left to right negative slopes of trends are also observed in the upper right section of the basin 4 methodology 4 1 detection of non stationarity non parametric mann kendall trend test is employed in most of the studies to quantify the magnitude of changes in hydrologic extremes but it is important to find the cause of changing patterns on regional as well as global scale since a hydrologic series can possess non stationarity due to various reasons detailed investigation of non stationarity is necessary to understand the underlying processes detecting trends and non stationarity in a hydrologic time series may help us to understand the possible links between hydrological processes and changes in global environment gelder et al 2007 non stationarities in annual maximum rainfall extremes are detected with phillips perron pp test and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test these tests are complementary and jointly used to detect departures from stationary behaviour 4 1 1 phillips perron test this test was developed by phillips and perron 1988 to detect the presence of unit root in a wide class of time series models it accommodates the general class of weakly dependent and heterogeneously distributed data through nonparametric approach pp test is based on the model 1 x t μ α t π x t 1 u t where μ and α are the parameters of a first order polynomial regression and u t is not assumed to be white noise pp test corrects for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity present in the errors by modifying dickey fuller dickey and fuller 1979 test statistic the unit root null is tested with h 0 π 1 against the alternative h a π 1 4 1 2 kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test this test was proposed by kwiatkowski et al 1992 it complements the unit root test by testing the null hypothesis of stationarity either around a fixed level or around a deterministic trend against the alternative of difference stationary series the series x t is expressed as the sum of deterministic trend α t random walk r t stationary error ε t and the test is lagrange multiplier test of the hypothesis that the random walk has zero variance 2 x t α t r t ε t 3 r t r t 1 u t w h e r e u t a r e i i d 0 σ 2 to check the stationarity around a deterministic trend trend stationarity the null hypothesis h 0 σ u 2 0 is tested against the alternative h a σ u 2 0 to check the level stationarity the null is h 0 σ u 2 0 α 0 against the alternative same as that of trend stationarity 4 2 non stationary extreme value model formulation the entire range of models namely gumbel fréchet and weibull for maximum of the process are given by extremal types theorem these three families can be combined into a single family known as generalized extreme value family of distributions with μ σ ξ as location scale and shape parameters respectively coles 2001 the cdf of gev distribution is given by 4 g x μ σ ξ exp exp x μ σ f o r ξ 0 exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 1 ξ x μ σ 0 the shape parameter governs the tail behaviour ξ 0 leads to gumbel family ξ 0 results in fréchet family and family with ξ 0 is interpreted as weibull family a time series x t is strictly stationary if the joint probability distribution of random variables doesn t change after an arbitrary shift in time generally the weak or second order stationarity is considered in practice which requires the mean variance and auto covariance to remain unaltered with shifts in time thus a non stationary series can possess non stationarity in mean non stationarity in variance or non stationarity in auto covariance the simplest way to introduce non stationarity in annual maxima model is by expressing one or more of the parameters of gev distribution as a function of time t year in the following form 5 μ t μ 0 μ 1 t ln σ t σ 0 σ 1 t ξ t ξ the candidate non stationary model consists of linear trends in location and log transformed scale parameters to ensure positivity of σ for all values of time t but no trend in shape parameter is considered as it is difficult to estimate and vary ξ smoothly with time a different situation arises when extremal behaviour of one series is related to the other variable referred to as covariate coles 2001 in this case the terms μ 1 t and σ 1 t are replaced with μ 1 c o v a r i a t e t and σ 1 c o v a r i a t e t theoretical developments in extreme value theory are explored in this study for investigating the association of rainfall extremes with physical covariates the selection of covariates is done as per the discussion in section 3 2 4 2 1 model selection and diagnosis statistical significance of non stationary parameters in the model m1 against stationary gev sub model m0 is commonly evaluated with likelihood ratio test if l1 m1 and l0 m0 are maximized log likelihoods for the non stationary and stationary model respectively the large value of deviance statistic d 2 l 1 m 1 l 0 m 0 indicates that non stationary model explains more variability of data but how large is large for d should be determined from asymptotic distribution of deviance function null hypothesis of m0 is rejected at α level of significance if d c α where c α is the 1 α quantile of χ 2 distribution whose degree of freedom is the difference in dimensionality of models selection of appropriate model among multiple candidate models can be done using akaike s information criterion aic or bayesian information criterion bic but the basic principal of parsimony should not be sacrificed for explaining more variability of data with complex models because complexity brings additional uncertainty to ensure the adequacy of selected extreme value model standard diagnostic checks like probability plots and quantile plots are used these tools are based on the assumption of identical distribution which is violated in the non stationary case therefore some modification is required to account for lack of homogeneity in distributional assumptions the variable x t g e v μ t σ t ξ is standardized to stationary standardized variable x t defined as 6 x t 1 ξ l o g 1 ξ x t μ t σ t standardized variable x t follows standard gumbel distribution with μ 0 σ 1 and both the diagnostic plots can be made with reference to this distribution for the ordered values of standardized variable probability plot consists of points i m 1 e x p e x i and quantile plot is the plot of pairs x i l o g l o g i m 1 these plots present the same information on different scales all the points should lie close to the diagonal for a reasonable model any departure from linearity indicates that the selected model is not suitable for representing the data 4 2 2 field significance test it is important to assess the collective significance of individual statistical tests as the spatial datasets generally exhibit strong spatial correlations with nearby geographic locations variability in one geographic location is often correlated with the variability in neighbouring location suppose temperature at some grid has strong correlation with a randomly chosen time series then the temperature at nearby location will also show correlation with that random time series because temperature has high spatial correlation unfortunately this will affect the hypothesis testing results at different grids in the study area therefore the question arises what is the probability that we are getting these results purely by chance a description of probability distribution of percentage area will help in answering this question livezey and chen 1983 resampling based field significance test livezey and chen 1983 wilks 1997 are used in few studies mondal and mujumdar 2015 westra et al 2013 to evaluate the significance of test statistic percentage of locations where a covariate is found to be significantly influencing the rainfall extremes is the test statistic the original data matrix is resampled by random draws with replacement this process is repeated 1000 times and test statistic is computed each time a probability distribution of percentage of locations where a particular covariate is found to be significant is generated in this way if the observed area lies in 5 tail of the probability distribution it has field significance in simple words it is highly unlikely that the non stationarities in extreme rainfall are associated with the covariate by random chance 4 3 binning method for scaling the scaling behaviour of daily extreme rainfall with temperature is identified using binning method the rainfall extremes are defined by conditioning on daily mean temperature the temperature data is sorted and paired with daily rainfall data paired temperature rainfall data is placed in bins with varying temperature range each bin contains equal number of paired samples the median value of temperature is selected as representative for a particular bin rainfall intensities corresponding to different percentiles are estimated for each bin linear regression is fitted to the logarithm of rainfall values for all percentiles the expression relating rainfall r to change in temperature δt is given by 7 r 2 r 1 1 α δ t where α 0 068 is equivalent to clausius clapeyron scaling of 6 8 per degree celsius at 25 c 4 4 dependence modelling graphs generally convey more information about the dependence structure in contrast to summary statistics where information is limited to single form of association graphical tools like chi plot based on ranks fisher and switzer 1985 and kendall plot k plot which adapts the concept of probability plot genest and boies 2003 are used in this study to investigate possible association of two variables suppose we have n pairs of random variables x and y then for a given pair x i y i 8 χ i h i f i g i f i 1 f i g i 1 g i where h i 1 n 1 j i i x j x i y j y i f i 1 n 1 j i i x j x i and g i 1 n 1 j i i y j y i 9 λ i 4 s i g n f i 0 5 g i 0 5 max f i 0 5 2 g i 0 5 2 the scatter plot of λ i χ i is the chi plot for all λ i 4 1 n 1 0 5 2 the control limits are placed at c p n and c p represents the proportion of observations which falls within horizontal bounds as might be the case under independence k plot is based on the concept of q q plot for a random sample of pairs x 1 y 1 x n y n it plots the pairs of w i n h i for i 1 n specifically h i is computed for each pair as described above and ordered here w i n is the expected value of i th order statistic in a random sample of size n from random variable w h x y under the null hypothesis of independence expressed as 10 w i n n n 1 i 1 0 1 w k 0 w i 1 1 k 0 w n i d k 0 w where k 0 w p h x y w for 0 w 1 is the corresponding density measuring the association between variables is a central issue in modelling extremes and copulas provide a platform to model this association a widely known scale invariant numerical measure of association kendall s τ which measures the concordance between two random variables play an important role in quantifying statistical dependence and fitting copulas one reason for choosing this rank based correlation coefficient over pearson s correlation coefficient is that it is sensitive to non linear dependence let x rainfall and y temperature are two correlated random variables with marginal cumulative distribution functions u f x x and v f y y respectively let x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 be iid vectors of rainfall and temperature random variables the difference between probability of concordance and probability of discordance defines the kendall s τ two random variables are said to be concordant if high values of one are associated with high values of the other and similarly low values are likely to be associated with low values of the other variable if the opposite happens they are called discordant the difference is expressed as 11 τ p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 copulas are the functions that connect the multivariate probability distributions to their one dimensional marginal probability distributions nelsen 2006 archimedean class of copulas is used to model the dependence structure of rainfall and local mean temperature extremes kendall s τ is defined as a function of generator γ for the archimedean case salvadori et al 2007 the expression is given by 12 τ c 1 4 0 1 γ t γ t goodness of fit tests defined based on cramér von mises test statistic are used to select the best suited copula genest et al 2011 2009 genest and rémillard 2008 these tests are based on the empirical processes comparing the distance between empirical copula and parametric estimate of the copula derived under the null hypothesis h 0 c c 0 for some class c 0 of copulas approximate p values for the cramér von mises test statistic are obtained using parametric bootstrap the non exceedance probabilities of rainfall conditioned on local temperature values are computed by taking partial derivative of the best suited copula 13 p u u v v δ c u v δ v lim δ v 0 c u v δ v c u v δ v 5 results 5 1 non stationary extreme value modelling pp test and kpss test are jointly applied at the 233 grid points to detect non stationarities in annual maximum daily rainfall extremes the results of hypothesis testing are not presented here for brevity unit root null hypothesis in phillips perron test was rejected for all the considered annual maximum daily rainfall time series similar results were obtained in studies conducted by fatichi et al 2009 and saidi et al 2015 this test suffers appreciable size distortions and is not recommended for models with moving average errors and negative serial correlation phillips and perron 1988 the extreme rainfall time series is on annual scale and contains only 60 values which might be a reason for low power of pp test rejection of unit root null indicates that hydrologic extremes are not following a random walk kpss test fails to reject the null hypothesis of a deterministic trend at 129 grids which concludes that departure of stationarity in these extreme rainfall time series should be considered as a result of stochastic behaviour fig 3 a shows the presence of non stationarities detected at 129 grids non stationary rainfall grids are spread all over the basin however the number of non stationary grids is high in the left part of the basin high magnitude of positive slope of trends in annual average local mean temperature was observed in left section of the basin in fig 2d this hints towards the relation of local mean temperature to heavy rainfall events in left part of the basin further investigation is performed through non stationary extreme value modelling the non stationary gev models with linear trends in location and log transformed scale parameters with three covariates discussed in section 4 2 are developed at all the non stationary rainfall grids the test results for presence of trends and non stationarity in annual maximum daily rainfall series are presented in table 1 at one grid point 82e 21 5n table 2 provides the details of extreme value models fitted to answer the question of which physical covariate influences the stationary behaviour of rainfall extremes at this grid similar statistical models are fitted for 129 non stationary grid points and best selected model is declared to be appropriate after checking the diagnostic plots fig 3b shows that about 44 21 of locations are found to be stationary 9 87 possess non stationarities due to enso 18 03 are non stationary due to global warming and non stationary effects of local temperature changes are significant at 65 grids around 27 89 of total area adequacy of best selected model is checked with two graphical diagnostic plots probability plots and quantile plots shown in fig 4 standardization to the gumbel distribution is required for obtaining the diagnostic plots after scrutinizing non stationary extreme value modelling results it can be concluded that localized temperature changes are significantly influencing the rainfall extremes of the region the package extremes developed by gilleland and katz 2016 for the open source statistical programming language r is used to obtain non stationary extreme value modelling results present in table 2 http cran r project org web packages extremes 5 2 field significance to assess the collective significance of a finite set of individual statistical tests resampling based field significance test is used the results to test the significance of association of extreme rainfall intensities with covariates are shown in fig 5 the observed values of percentage of locations found to be non stationary due to local mean temperature and global warming fall outside the distribution of null hypothesis this indicates that individual tests have field significance thus it is highly unlikely that these covariates are associated with extreme rainfall intensities purely by chance it can be concluded based on highest percentage of locations and field significance that effects of local mean temperature are most significant 5 3 scaling of daily rainfall extremes with local temperature scaling relationship using linear regression is developed at all the grids but results for few locations are shown in fig 6 a peaked structure is observed at all locations and the patterns followed by most of the grids are shown here a decrease in the intensity of rainfall extremes with temperature is observed at high range of local mean temperature except four grids of the river basin near its confluence with bay of bengal these four grids follow the pattern shown in fig 6d daily rainfall extremes show a peaked structure at low 25 c to medium 30 c range of temperature over most of the locations these two values represent the temperature of strongest extreme rainfall events the residence time of water in the atmosphere is around 9 days scaling relationship is examined with time lag varying from 1 to 9 days between extreme rainfall and mean temperature no change in the pattern of this relationship is observed so the graphs are not shown here for brevity this kind of peak structure in daily data is observed in few earlier studies berg et al 2009 wang et al 2017 the temperature dependence of rainfall intensity depends on the relative contribution of large scale and convective rainfall berg et al 2009 several factors like time and spatial averaging type of temperature data used for scaling vertical velocity in updrafts precipitation efficiency can contribute to departure from cc scaling drobinski et al 2016 5 4 conditional probabilities kendall s tau which measures concordance is used to summarize the association of annual maximum daily rainfall and local mean temperature the values of this measure of association for different grids in the river basin are shown in fig 7 a negative association is observed in the lower part of the basin but it strengthens while moving to the upper part positive dependence simply means that high values of extreme rainfall are associated with high values of local mean temperature and similarly low values are associated with the low values the field significance of kendall s τ is examined to confirm that this association is not observed simply by chance as the neighbouring grids behave similarly the null hypothesis of independence is tested on 1000 randomly generated samples through the resampling approach discussed in section 4 2 2 the randomly generated time series of rainfall cannot be related to local temperature in the same way therefore null hypothesis of independence is achieved histogram of the results for 1000 trials is shown in fig 7b note that the observed percentage of area with positive kendall s τ lies outside the histogram so it can be concluded that the association measure has field significance to detect the presence of dependence in annual maximum rainfall and local mean temperature extremes two rank based graphical tools called chi plot and kendall plot are employed at a randomly chosen grid located at 82e 21 5n which exhibit positive dependence the points in the chi plot are lying above the upper limit in fig 8 a indicating the positive association in fig 8b values are located above the diagonal line pointing towards the positive dependence among the variables gev distribution is used to model annual maximum time series of both the variables and their validity is tested using goodness of fit kolmogorov smirnov ks test at 5 significance level the parameters estimated using maximum likelihood estimation method are reported in table 3 to model the joint behavior of rainfall and temperature extremes copulas are fitted using the copbasic package asquith 2018 gumbel hougaard copula with parameter 1 336 0 143 is found to be best suited using the goodness of fit test based on cramér von mises function the standard expression for gumbel hougaard family is 14 c θ u v e ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where u v are uniformly distributed probabilistic counterparts of x rainfall and y temperature and θ is the dependence parameter the relationship of θ and kendall s τ is given by 15 τ θ θ 1 θ our aim is to evaluate the conditional probability of annual rainfall extremes conditioned on mean temperature values where the peaks in rainfall intensity are observed let a ln u θ and b ln v θ then the expression for partial derivative of gumbel hougaard copula is given by 16 p u u v v δ c u v δ v exp a b 1 θ 1 a b 1 1 θ v partial derivative of gumbel hougaard copula with dependence parameter θ 1 336 kendall s τ 0 251 and upper tail dependence λ u 2 2 1 θ 0 320 is computed conditioned on temperature values of 25 c and 30 c the conditional probabilities of annual maximum rainfall conditioned on these two mean temperature values are shown in fig 9 it is clear from the figure that the cdf of rainfall extremes conditioned on 30 c is located below the cdf of 25 c i e p x x y 30 p x x y 25 this implies that on an average more strong rainfall events are occurring at 30 c as compared to 25 c similar results are observed at other grids of the basin 6 summary and conclusion extreme rainfall and associated hazardous events are increasing across the globe a better understanding of relationship between extreme rainfall and mechanisms responsible for generation of such events is needed to improve their predictability this study presents a methodology to explore this relationship with the application to mahanadi river basin of india the basin has witnessed heavy floods in the last decade due to increase in extreme rainfall in this study the association of extreme rainfall with natural climate variability human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming is investigated our aim is to find out the physical driver which is significantly influencing the rainfall extremes of the study area non stationary extreme value models with multivariate enso index global average temperature anomaly series and local mean temperature anomaly series as covariates are fitted at non stationary rainfall grids non stationarities are detected with phillips perron pp test and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test in annual maximum rainfall extremes best fitted non stationary model with one physical covariate is selected at each grid the covariate in the best fitted model represents the most significant physical driver influencing the extreme rainfall of a grid the number of best chosen non stationary models is high with local mean temperature as covariate compared to models with other physical drivers thus local mean temperature is found to be significantly influencing the rainfall extremes of the region the collective significance of individual statistical tests is evaluated using a resampling based field significance test the test results conclude that it is highly unlikely that local mean temperature is associated with extreme rainfall purely by chance association of rainfall extremes with the physical processes varies with geographic locations depending upon their contribution in generating the extremes of the region response of rainfall extremes due to thermodynamic contribution is well understood but the contributions from changes in thermodynamics dynamics and precipitation efficiency have all been found to be important for changes in rainfall extremes o gorman 2015 in an attempt to understand the physical mechanisms causing differences at regional scale emori and brown 2005 decomposed the regional signal into thermodynamic due to changes in atmospheric moisture content and dynamic contributions due to changes in atmospheric motion using statistical approach which is not valid at all locations pfahl et al 2017 decomposed the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using robust physical diagnostic for improving the understanding of changes in daily regional scale extreme rainfall they showed that thermodynamics alone leads to a spatially homogeneous fractional increase however the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses dynamics is responsible for amplifying the increases in asian monsoon region while weakening them across australia south africa and the mediterranean these arguments suggest that the results of this study are not directly generalizable to other regions due to different response of rainfall extremes to physical mechanisms in different regions however our methodology can be followed to study the relationship of extreme rainfall with physical drivers which contribute to the extreme rainfall of the region clausius clapeyron relationship is a highly relevant constraint on extreme rainfall in a warming climate scaling relationships between extreme rainfall and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids of the basin significant deviations from expected cc scaling curves are observed at all the grids a peak in daily extreme rainfall is observed at low 25 c to medium 30 c range of local mean temperature extreme rainfall intensities show a decrease beyond the medium range of temperature to examine the validity of cc scaling daily mean temperature is used as a proxy for atmospheric water vapour but the atmospheric variables which influence the intensity of rainfall covary with temperature it is difficult to separate the effect of temperature on rainfall extremes from the combined effect of multiple atmospheric variables thus it is important to understand the interactions between atmospheric variables and physical processes to correctly interpret the scaling results westra et al 2014 changes in relative humidity were found to affect cc scaling at higher temperatures by jones et al 2010 a reduction in relative humidity was observed above 24 c hinting towards a decrease in moisture content at higher temperatures changes in rainfall types convective and large scale rainfall with temperature can also affect the cc scaling relationship berg et al 2013 time scale of the rainfall event strongly influences the scaling relationship beuchat et al 2011 jones et al 2010 temporary local cooling effect of extreme rainfall event and associated synoptic conditions on local temperature significantly influences the scaling rates bao et al 2017 this cooling effect is a fundamental problem in binning method the cooling artefacts are minimized by developing the scaling curves with a time lag of 1 9 days this time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere however no change in the relationship structure is observed at any grid of the basin deviations from scaling curves still remain debatable multiple mechanisms are responsible for the peaked shape in scaling relationship and which one is dominant is probably region specific wang et al 2017 exploring the physics behind the deviation of extreme rainfall and temperature relationship from cc scaling is beyond the scope of this study further investigation is needed to address the departure from clausius clapeyron expectations the dependence between rainfall and local mean temperature extremes is summarized using kendall s τ the grids in upper part of mahanadi exhibit positive dependence while the extremes are found to be negatively associated in lower part percentage of locations with positive association shows field significance the concept of copulas is used to determine the conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall conditioned on local mean temperature values where the strongest extreme rainfall events are observed we find that the strength of extreme rainfall events is stronger at 30 c compared to that of events at 25 c occurring in the basin this finding is in agreement with the fact that intensity of extreme rainfall events increases with increase in temperature intensities of extreme rainfall over land could rise at a higher rate than cc scaling rate because of the additional latent heat released from increased moisture liu et al 2009 thermodynamic component contributes more towards strengthening the intensity of rainfall events due to increased water availability the dynamic component on the other hand reduces the intensity of rainfall except for the heaviest rainfall events chou et al 2012 further research on how the dynamic component is contributing towards the extreme rainfall of the region might reveal valuable information for better understanding of underlying processes only annual maximum extremes are considered in this study but second highest extreme event of the year could be more disastrous than extremes in other years identifying extreme events by peak over threshold pot method is a way to use the information of extremes more efficiently this work can be further extended by defining extremes based on pot approach to capture more information on extreme events this might help in improving the understanding of extreme rainfall and temperature dependence structure several studies discuss the importance of time scales for examining the dependence of extreme rainfall intensities on temperature these studies have a common conclusion that sub daily rainfall extremes are intensifying more than the daily time scale rainfall extremes berg and haerter 2013 haerter et al 2010 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 2010 one potential limitation of this study is the selection of daily time scale due to data limitations further research at sub daily scale can reveal important information which the daily data has not revealed in this study conflict of interest none

6582,extreme rainfall is the most common cause of flooding and likelihood of such events is found to increase in recent studies large scale natural variability human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming are important drivers of extreme rainfall understanding the association of these drivers with extreme rainfall and finding out the most significant physical driver will provide a foundation for risk assessment this study presents a methodology to investigate the association of extreme rainfall events with physical drivers and to model their dependence structure the methodology is demonstrated with application to mahanadi river basin india non stationary extreme value models with multivariate enso index global average temperature anomalies and local mean temperature anomalies as covariates are fitted at non stationary rainfall grids of the basin statistical modelling confirms localized temperature to be the main driver influencing rainfall extremes clausius clapeyron cc scaling curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes significant deviations from the expected cc scaling behaviour are observed daily rainfall extremes show peaks at low 25 c to medium 30 c range of temperature but exhibit a decrease at high temperatures for most of the grids no change in this pattern of relationship is observed when the extreme rainfall is lagged by 1 9 days with temperature this time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere the copula theory is applied to capture the dependence of annual maximum daily rainfall and temperature extremes conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall are estimated by conditioning on local mean temperature values of strongest extreme rainfall events comparison of conditional probabilities suggests that stronger rainfall events are occurring at 30 c this study emphasizes the necessity of understanding the dependence structure of extreme rainfall and local mean temperature keywords extreme rainfall local mean temperature non stationarity extreme value theory clausius clapeyron scaling curves copula theory 1 introduction increase in extreme rainfall related hazards in a warming climate is the motivation to study the relationship of extreme rainfall with temperature extreme rainfall events are responsible for river floods and flash floods high intensity rainfall over short time scale can cause flash flooding and continuous heavy rainfall can cause river flooding risk of floods is high in a warming climate ipcc 2012 observations and climate model projections show an increase in extreme rainfall events due to warmer climate allan and soden 2008 o gorman 2015 utsumi et al 2011 there are strong evidences for intensification of global water cycle huntington 2006 the primary cause of this intensification is the increased capacity of warmer atmosphere to hold more moisture the physical clausius clapeyron relationship with the assumption of constant relative humidity suggests a rise of about 6 5 or 7 in atmospheric moisture per degree increase in temperature this relationship predicts the intensification of hydrologic cycle across the globe with some regional variations allen and ingram 2002 trenberth et al 2003 the strength of association between rainfall extremes and global average temperature using non stationary generalized extreme value analysis was determined by westra et al 2013 median intensity of extreme rainfall was found to change with global average temperature at a rate ranging between 5 9 and 7 7 k 1 but with significant variation by latitude this rate of increase is confirmed in other studies at daily utsumi et al 2011 and sub daily timescales lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 however a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between local scale thermodynamic effects large scale atmospheric circulation and extreme rainfall is needed to identify the likely future of such events westra et al 2014 rainfall and temperature extremes have been analysed individually on global zwiers and wehner 2013 as well as regional scale angélil et al 2016 but it is important to study their association due to changing nature of extremes trenberth and shea 2005 suggest that rainfall and temperature records should not be interpreted without considering the strong co variability between them the relationships between rainfall and temperature in contiguous united states and europe were investigated by madden and williams 1978 from 1897 to 1960 and relationships for each month of the year for the period 1905 to 1984 were updated by zhao and khalil 1993 associations between global precipitation and surface temperature on inter annual and longer time scales were explored for the period 1979 2006 by adler et al 2008 changes to the bivariate distributions of temperature and rainfall were assessed by estrella and menzel 2013 a hierarchical bayesian approach was used to study the joint projections of rainfall and temperature by tebaldi and sansó 2009 trends in joint quantiles of temperature and rainfall were investigated by beniston 2009 to explore the behaviour of high rainfall low temperature high rainfall high temperature low rainfall high temperature and low rainfall low temperature in europe significant changes were observed in these four combinations at all the locations considered in this study there is increase in the joint occurrence of warm dry and warm wet events at global scale while cold wet and cold dry events have decreased over most parts of globe hao et al 2013 the relationship of extreme rainfall magnitudes and temperature was investigated by gaur et al 2018 at multiple locations of canada in order to understand the effects of global warming on rainfall extremes they found drastic intensification of rainfall extremes with temperature for shorter duration rainfall events compared to longer duration events investigating the association of rainfall intensity and temperature is crucial to understand the link of atmospheric warming to changing behaviour of rainfall extremes clausius clapeyron cc scaling relationship is widely used to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes allen and ingram 2002 berg et al 2013 jones et al 2010 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 o gorman and schneider 2009a pall et al 2007 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 the greatest agreement with predicted changes in rainfall extremes using cc scaling has been found in mid latitudes pall et al 2007 deviations from cc scaling are observed in short duration rainfall extremes using century long records of hourly rainfall observations in de bilt netherlands lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 the validity of cc relationship for different seasons is investigated by berg et al 2009 using observed and simulated datasets in europe the extreme rainfall intensity is observed to increase in winter and decrease in summer cc scaling controls the peak of large scale precipitation with increasing temperature in winter whereas availability of moisture is the dominant factor than the capacity of atmosphere to hold moisture in summer the applicability of cc relationship to limit maximum rainfall intensity varies from region to region and in different seasons as well shaw et al 2011 generally daily rainfall intensities increase slowly with increase in temperature compared to hourly intensities the effect of temporal resolution on the scaling of extreme rainfall intensity with temperature is investigated by utsumi et al 2011 the cc scaling was found to be valid on sub hourly timescale even in those regions where the scaling relationship was not valid on daily timescale changes in moist adiabatic temperature lapse rate upward velocity and in temperature when rainfall extreme occur forms the physical basis for changes in rainfall extremes o gorman and schneider 2009b the scaling relationship between rainfall and temperature does not imply cause and effect as the moisture availability can be a limitation therefore thermodynamics of moisture holding capacity dynamics of atmospheric circulation and moisture advection should be considered jones et al 2010 clausius clapeyron relationship unequivocally provides a reason to study the interaction of rainfall and temperature but its validity at regional scale is in question rate of change of daily extreme rainfall with temperature might vary with geographic locations depending on the role of other physical processes responsible for generating the extreme rainfall event thus it is important to first identify and isolate the effects of physical drivers on extreme rainfall of the region under study rainfall in india is highly variable increasing spatial variability in extreme rainfall was reported by ghosh et al 2011 a major driver responsible for climate variability on inter annual timescale is el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon the relationship of indian summer monsoon rainfall and enso is extensively studied azad and rajeevan 2016 gadgil et al 2004 kumar et al 1999 pant and parthasarathy 1981 rasmusson and carpenter 1983 sikka 1980 therefore it is important to examine the association of enso with extreme rainfall of the study area increase in extreme rainfall events of india under anthropogenic warming climate is confirmed in a recent study by mukherjee et al 2018 therefore the choice of human induced global warming as another important physical driver influencing the rainfall extremes is appropriate mondal and mujumdar 2015 modelled the non stationarities in extreme rainfall characteristics of india local temperature changes have been found to be more significantly affecting the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall spells of india thus local atmospheric warming is considered as another important process associated with the changing character of extremes selection of physical drivers is discussed in detail in section 3 2 in this study the association of extreme rainfall of a flood prone region of india is examined with el niño southern oscillation global average surface air temperature anomaly series and local mean temperature anomaly series via non stationary extreme value modelling this study is an attempt to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship of extreme rainfall with the most significant physical driver after establishing the conclusion that local mean temperature is significantly influencing the rainfall extremes the curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed the mean temperature values associated with the strongest extreme rainfall events are determined further the dependence of these two variables is quantified through a rank based correlation coefficient the copula theory is applied to determine probabilities of extreme rainfall conditioned on mean temperature values where peaks in extreme rainfall are observed the paper is organized as follows selection of the study area is justified in section 2 data used and selection of covariates for developing non stationary extreme value models is described in section 3 the methodology to achieve the objectives is defined in section 4 the results are shown and interpreted in section 5 section 6 provides a discussion on the findings limitations of the present work and possible extensions 2 study area mahanadi river basin shown in fig 1 is selected as the study area this basin has witnessed frequent heavy floods in the recent past the river originates in chhattisgarh and traverses a length of 851 km with the catchment area of 1 41 589 km2 extending from 80 28 e to 86 43 e longitudes and 19 8 n to 23 32 n latitudes before it discharges into bay of bengal mahanadi is one of the major rivers of the country and this river is mainly rain fed in the summer monsoon season from june to september major floods from 1960 to 2008 have caused significant damages in the basin there is increase in number of affected districts in nineties but this number is significantly high for the floods which occurred in 2001 2003 2006 and 2008 this hints at an increase in spatial extent of rainfall extremes heavy rainfall leading to a flash flood in september 2011 has inundated those villages above hirakud dam which were never affected before the basin is expected to be the worst affected in terms of occurrences of floods due to climate change gosain et al 2006 the projected climate conditions also show an increase in the intensity of floods ashokan and dutta 2008 increase in number of wet days and wet day precipitation amounts is predicted with conditional random field based downscaling raje and mujumdar 2009 a recent study has shown an increasing trend in mahanadi floods the study reveals that major incidences of high floods are occurring due to an increase in extreme rainfall in the middle reaches of the basin jena et al 2014 thus it is important to identify the physical driver which is significantly influencing the extreme rainfall of this region 3 data description 3 1 rainfall and temperature data high resolution gridded 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude daily rainfall dataset developed from 6995 rain gauge stations pai et al 2014 and high resolution daily gridded temperature dataset 1 latitude 1 longitude developed from 395 quality controlled stations srivastava et al 2009 are used in this study common period of 60 years from 1951 to 2010 is chosen for this study based on the data availability for rainfall temperature and the covariates defined subsequently temperature data is re gridded to the same scale of rainfall using bilinear interpolation temperature data is missing at 12 grids near the outfall into bay of bengal therefore 233 grids out of 245 are selected based on availability of data for the selected variables mahanadi river basin receives most of the rain in summer monsoon season therefore data for four monsoon months june september is used in this study 3 2 data for covariates three physical covariates are used in this study to formulate non stationary models for annual maximum daily rainfall extremes the el niño southern oscillation is an indicator of large scale natural climate variability which affects heavy rainfall events over many parts of the world influence of enso on extreme rainfall at global scale is examined by kenyon and hegerl 2010 they observe strong increase in extreme rainfall in united states central america and india while moderate to strongly moderate decrease is seen in southern africa southeast asia australia and pacific northwest at regional scale effects of enso on extreme rainfall are studied in western united states cayan et al 1999 contiguous united states gershunov and barnett 1998 schubert et al 2008 north america whan and zwiers 2017 south america grimm and tedeschi 2009 and india mondal and mujumdar 2015 enso is a large complex and multifaceted system involving various aspects of ocean and atmosphere interactions in tropical pacific there are different ways to measure enso based on mean sea level pressure difference sea surface temperature outgoing longwave radiation and wind across the tropical pacific southern oscillation index soi is the widely used enso index measuring the sea level pressure difference at tahiti and darwin another popular enso indicator is based on sea surface temperature sst anomalies of central and eastern equatorial pacific southern oscillation index soi el adlouni et al 2007 katz et al 2002 min et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 niño3 4 sst anomalies katz et al 2002 maity and kumar 2006 mondal and mujumdar 2015 are used as covariates to study the effect of large scale variability on extreme rainfall to integrate more information on coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon multivariate enso index mei is introduced wolter and timlin 1993 mei is based on six parameters sea level pressure sea surface temperature zonal and meridional components of surface wind surface air temperature and cloudiness mei is the first unrotated principal component of these six parameters since mei is derived from significant climate features it is less vulnerable to non enso related variability arising due to single variable consideration wolter and timlin 1998 2011 in an attempt to identify the enso induced rainfall and runoff variability in australia mei is found to outperform soi and sst kiem and franks 2001 in this study mei index averaged over winter season shown in fig 2 a is chosen as a physical covariate to investigate the effect of enso on extreme rainfall of the study area global hydrologic cycle is expected to intensify in a warming climate allen and ingram 2002 past research has established global warming to be a major cause for intensification of rainfall extremes on local as well as regional scale allan and soden 2008 o gorman 2015 utsumi et al 2011 climate models show an increase of 1 3 per kelvin in global mean rainfall due to surface warming held and soden 2006 vecchi and soden 2007 but observational datasets suggest an increased rate the response of rainfall and total atmospheric water to global warming is assessed by wentz et al 2007 based on satellite observations for the period 1987 2006 they found the rate of increase to be about 7 per kelvin of surface warming which is close to clausius clapeyron scaling global average temperature is the most robust indicator of human induced climate change hegerl et al 2007 to study changes in extreme rainfall across the globe due to global warming global average temperature was used as a covariate by westra et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2016 identified linear scaling of heavy rainfall events with global mean temperature changes for different emission scenarios wartenburger et al 2017 investigated the changes in regional climate extremes as a function of global mean temperature as a follow up to this study changes in rainfall extremes are investigated in west and central africa by diedhiou et al 2018 to address the implications of 1 5 c and 2 c global warming with reference to the pre industrial period it is important to address the question of how global warming is influencing the extreme rainfall of the study area therefore global average temperature anomaly series is used as an indicator of global warming nasa gistemp hansen et al 2010 gistemp team 2018 global surface air temperature anomaly series with respect to 1951 1980 mean shown in fig 2b is used as a covariate to develop non stationary extreme value models rainfall within a catchment basin is governed by two sources external moisture advected by the winds into the region or internal water vapours formed by local evaporation regional water cycle is complicated as it has contributions from external and internal moisture sources and flows in rivers and groundwater reservoirs are additional boundary fluxes eltahir and bras 1996 floods are often fairly local and develop on shorter time scale trenberth 2011 external advective moisture initiates monsoon rainfall in india but availability of local moisture can contribute to large amount of rainfall leading to flooding of a particular region contribution of local evaporation to local precipitation is generally measured by precipitation recycling the concept of precipitation recycling is used in several studies to identify the contribution of regional moisture to generation of precipitation in the same region brubaker et al 1993 dominguez and kumar 2008 eltahir and bras 1996 guo et al 2018 pathak et al 2014 trenberth 1999 these studies suggest that local evaporation contributes to the total amount of rainfall in the region and local temperature significantly controls the evaporation process therefore it is important to examine how local temperature changes are influencing the extreme rainfall of the region mondal and mujumdar 2015 found non stationary associations between intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall with local mean temperature in india sun et al 2017 studied the impact of enso and local temperature changes on extreme rainfall at global scale using non stationary generalized extreme value models for the period 1979 2015 they found that stationary models dominate over 52 of global land surface local mean temperature is the most significant covariate over 26 of global land and enso dominates over 22 of global land thus selection of local mean temperature as a physical driver influencing the extreme rainfall is justified annual mean temperature anomaly series based on 1951 1980 mean at each grid is considered as a covariate to investigate the effect of localized changes on rainfall extremes in this study fig 2c shows the location of grids where temperature is available after re gridding and fig 2d shows the slope of trends in annual average local mean temperature at each grid slope of the trends is positive at many grids with high magnitude in the left most section of the basin which decreases on moving from left to right negative slopes of trends are also observed in the upper right section of the basin 4 methodology 4 1 detection of non stationarity non parametric mann kendall trend test is employed in most of the studies to quantify the magnitude of changes in hydrologic extremes but it is important to find the cause of changing patterns on regional as well as global scale since a hydrologic series can possess non stationarity due to various reasons detailed investigation of non stationarity is necessary to understand the underlying processes detecting trends and non stationarity in a hydrologic time series may help us to understand the possible links between hydrological processes and changes in global environment gelder et al 2007 non stationarities in annual maximum rainfall extremes are detected with phillips perron pp test and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test these tests are complementary and jointly used to detect departures from stationary behaviour 4 1 1 phillips perron test this test was developed by phillips and perron 1988 to detect the presence of unit root in a wide class of time series models it accommodates the general class of weakly dependent and heterogeneously distributed data through nonparametric approach pp test is based on the model 1 x t μ α t π x t 1 u t where μ and α are the parameters of a first order polynomial regression and u t is not assumed to be white noise pp test corrects for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity present in the errors by modifying dickey fuller dickey and fuller 1979 test statistic the unit root null is tested with h 0 π 1 against the alternative h a π 1 4 1 2 kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test this test was proposed by kwiatkowski et al 1992 it complements the unit root test by testing the null hypothesis of stationarity either around a fixed level or around a deterministic trend against the alternative of difference stationary series the series x t is expressed as the sum of deterministic trend α t random walk r t stationary error ε t and the test is lagrange multiplier test of the hypothesis that the random walk has zero variance 2 x t α t r t ε t 3 r t r t 1 u t w h e r e u t a r e i i d 0 σ 2 to check the stationarity around a deterministic trend trend stationarity the null hypothesis h 0 σ u 2 0 is tested against the alternative h a σ u 2 0 to check the level stationarity the null is h 0 σ u 2 0 α 0 against the alternative same as that of trend stationarity 4 2 non stationary extreme value model formulation the entire range of models namely gumbel fréchet and weibull for maximum of the process are given by extremal types theorem these three families can be combined into a single family known as generalized extreme value family of distributions with μ σ ξ as location scale and shape parameters respectively coles 2001 the cdf of gev distribution is given by 4 g x μ σ ξ exp exp x μ σ f o r ξ 0 exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 1 ξ x μ σ 0 the shape parameter governs the tail behaviour ξ 0 leads to gumbel family ξ 0 results in fréchet family and family with ξ 0 is interpreted as weibull family a time series x t is strictly stationary if the joint probability distribution of random variables doesn t change after an arbitrary shift in time generally the weak or second order stationarity is considered in practice which requires the mean variance and auto covariance to remain unaltered with shifts in time thus a non stationary series can possess non stationarity in mean non stationarity in variance or non stationarity in auto covariance the simplest way to introduce non stationarity in annual maxima model is by expressing one or more of the parameters of gev distribution as a function of time t year in the following form 5 μ t μ 0 μ 1 t ln σ t σ 0 σ 1 t ξ t ξ the candidate non stationary model consists of linear trends in location and log transformed scale parameters to ensure positivity of σ for all values of time t but no trend in shape parameter is considered as it is difficult to estimate and vary ξ smoothly with time a different situation arises when extremal behaviour of one series is related to the other variable referred to as covariate coles 2001 in this case the terms μ 1 t and σ 1 t are replaced with μ 1 c o v a r i a t e t and σ 1 c o v a r i a t e t theoretical developments in extreme value theory are explored in this study for investigating the association of rainfall extremes with physical covariates the selection of covariates is done as per the discussion in section 3 2 4 2 1 model selection and diagnosis statistical significance of non stationary parameters in the model m1 against stationary gev sub model m0 is commonly evaluated with likelihood ratio test if l1 m1 and l0 m0 are maximized log likelihoods for the non stationary and stationary model respectively the large value of deviance statistic d 2 l 1 m 1 l 0 m 0 indicates that non stationary model explains more variability of data but how large is large for d should be determined from asymptotic distribution of deviance function null hypothesis of m0 is rejected at α level of significance if d c α where c α is the 1 α quantile of χ 2 distribution whose degree of freedom is the difference in dimensionality of models selection of appropriate model among multiple candidate models can be done using akaike s information criterion aic or bayesian information criterion bic but the basic principal of parsimony should not be sacrificed for explaining more variability of data with complex models because complexity brings additional uncertainty to ensure the adequacy of selected extreme value model standard diagnostic checks like probability plots and quantile plots are used these tools are based on the assumption of identical distribution which is violated in the non stationary case therefore some modification is required to account for lack of homogeneity in distributional assumptions the variable x t g e v μ t σ t ξ is standardized to stationary standardized variable x t defined as 6 x t 1 ξ l o g 1 ξ x t μ t σ t standardized variable x t follows standard gumbel distribution with μ 0 σ 1 and both the diagnostic plots can be made with reference to this distribution for the ordered values of standardized variable probability plot consists of points i m 1 e x p e x i and quantile plot is the plot of pairs x i l o g l o g i m 1 these plots present the same information on different scales all the points should lie close to the diagonal for a reasonable model any departure from linearity indicates that the selected model is not suitable for representing the data 4 2 2 field significance test it is important to assess the collective significance of individual statistical tests as the spatial datasets generally exhibit strong spatial correlations with nearby geographic locations variability in one geographic location is often correlated with the variability in neighbouring location suppose temperature at some grid has strong correlation with a randomly chosen time series then the temperature at nearby location will also show correlation with that random time series because temperature has high spatial correlation unfortunately this will affect the hypothesis testing results at different grids in the study area therefore the question arises what is the probability that we are getting these results purely by chance a description of probability distribution of percentage area will help in answering this question livezey and chen 1983 resampling based field significance test livezey and chen 1983 wilks 1997 are used in few studies mondal and mujumdar 2015 westra et al 2013 to evaluate the significance of test statistic percentage of locations where a covariate is found to be significantly influencing the rainfall extremes is the test statistic the original data matrix is resampled by random draws with replacement this process is repeated 1000 times and test statistic is computed each time a probability distribution of percentage of locations where a particular covariate is found to be significant is generated in this way if the observed area lies in 5 tail of the probability distribution it has field significance in simple words it is highly unlikely that the non stationarities in extreme rainfall are associated with the covariate by random chance 4 3 binning method for scaling the scaling behaviour of daily extreme rainfall with temperature is identified using binning method the rainfall extremes are defined by conditioning on daily mean temperature the temperature data is sorted and paired with daily rainfall data paired temperature rainfall data is placed in bins with varying temperature range each bin contains equal number of paired samples the median value of temperature is selected as representative for a particular bin rainfall intensities corresponding to different percentiles are estimated for each bin linear regression is fitted to the logarithm of rainfall values for all percentiles the expression relating rainfall r to change in temperature δt is given by 7 r 2 r 1 1 α δ t where α 0 068 is equivalent to clausius clapeyron scaling of 6 8 per degree celsius at 25 c 4 4 dependence modelling graphs generally convey more information about the dependence structure in contrast to summary statistics where information is limited to single form of association graphical tools like chi plot based on ranks fisher and switzer 1985 and kendall plot k plot which adapts the concept of probability plot genest and boies 2003 are used in this study to investigate possible association of two variables suppose we have n pairs of random variables x and y then for a given pair x i y i 8 χ i h i f i g i f i 1 f i g i 1 g i where h i 1 n 1 j i i x j x i y j y i f i 1 n 1 j i i x j x i and g i 1 n 1 j i i y j y i 9 λ i 4 s i g n f i 0 5 g i 0 5 max f i 0 5 2 g i 0 5 2 the scatter plot of λ i χ i is the chi plot for all λ i 4 1 n 1 0 5 2 the control limits are placed at c p n and c p represents the proportion of observations which falls within horizontal bounds as might be the case under independence k plot is based on the concept of q q plot for a random sample of pairs x 1 y 1 x n y n it plots the pairs of w i n h i for i 1 n specifically h i is computed for each pair as described above and ordered here w i n is the expected value of i th order statistic in a random sample of size n from random variable w h x y under the null hypothesis of independence expressed as 10 w i n n n 1 i 1 0 1 w k 0 w i 1 1 k 0 w n i d k 0 w where k 0 w p h x y w for 0 w 1 is the corresponding density measuring the association between variables is a central issue in modelling extremes and copulas provide a platform to model this association a widely known scale invariant numerical measure of association kendall s τ which measures the concordance between two random variables play an important role in quantifying statistical dependence and fitting copulas one reason for choosing this rank based correlation coefficient over pearson s correlation coefficient is that it is sensitive to non linear dependence let x rainfall and y temperature are two correlated random variables with marginal cumulative distribution functions u f x x and v f y y respectively let x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 be iid vectors of rainfall and temperature random variables the difference between probability of concordance and probability of discordance defines the kendall s τ two random variables are said to be concordant if high values of one are associated with high values of the other and similarly low values are likely to be associated with low values of the other variable if the opposite happens they are called discordant the difference is expressed as 11 τ p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 p x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 0 copulas are the functions that connect the multivariate probability distributions to their one dimensional marginal probability distributions nelsen 2006 archimedean class of copulas is used to model the dependence structure of rainfall and local mean temperature extremes kendall s τ is defined as a function of generator γ for the archimedean case salvadori et al 2007 the expression is given by 12 τ c 1 4 0 1 γ t γ t goodness of fit tests defined based on cramér von mises test statistic are used to select the best suited copula genest et al 2011 2009 genest and rémillard 2008 these tests are based on the empirical processes comparing the distance between empirical copula and parametric estimate of the copula derived under the null hypothesis h 0 c c 0 for some class c 0 of copulas approximate p values for the cramér von mises test statistic are obtained using parametric bootstrap the non exceedance probabilities of rainfall conditioned on local temperature values are computed by taking partial derivative of the best suited copula 13 p u u v v δ c u v δ v lim δ v 0 c u v δ v c u v δ v 5 results 5 1 non stationary extreme value modelling pp test and kpss test are jointly applied at the 233 grid points to detect non stationarities in annual maximum daily rainfall extremes the results of hypothesis testing are not presented here for brevity unit root null hypothesis in phillips perron test was rejected for all the considered annual maximum daily rainfall time series similar results were obtained in studies conducted by fatichi et al 2009 and saidi et al 2015 this test suffers appreciable size distortions and is not recommended for models with moving average errors and negative serial correlation phillips and perron 1988 the extreme rainfall time series is on annual scale and contains only 60 values which might be a reason for low power of pp test rejection of unit root null indicates that hydrologic extremes are not following a random walk kpss test fails to reject the null hypothesis of a deterministic trend at 129 grids which concludes that departure of stationarity in these extreme rainfall time series should be considered as a result of stochastic behaviour fig 3 a shows the presence of non stationarities detected at 129 grids non stationary rainfall grids are spread all over the basin however the number of non stationary grids is high in the left part of the basin high magnitude of positive slope of trends in annual average local mean temperature was observed in left section of the basin in fig 2d this hints towards the relation of local mean temperature to heavy rainfall events in left part of the basin further investigation is performed through non stationary extreme value modelling the non stationary gev models with linear trends in location and log transformed scale parameters with three covariates discussed in section 4 2 are developed at all the non stationary rainfall grids the test results for presence of trends and non stationarity in annual maximum daily rainfall series are presented in table 1 at one grid point 82e 21 5n table 2 provides the details of extreme value models fitted to answer the question of which physical covariate influences the stationary behaviour of rainfall extremes at this grid similar statistical models are fitted for 129 non stationary grid points and best selected model is declared to be appropriate after checking the diagnostic plots fig 3b shows that about 44 21 of locations are found to be stationary 9 87 possess non stationarities due to enso 18 03 are non stationary due to global warming and non stationary effects of local temperature changes are significant at 65 grids around 27 89 of total area adequacy of best selected model is checked with two graphical diagnostic plots probability plots and quantile plots shown in fig 4 standardization to the gumbel distribution is required for obtaining the diagnostic plots after scrutinizing non stationary extreme value modelling results it can be concluded that localized temperature changes are significantly influencing the rainfall extremes of the region the package extremes developed by gilleland and katz 2016 for the open source statistical programming language r is used to obtain non stationary extreme value modelling results present in table 2 http cran r project org web packages extremes 5 2 field significance to assess the collective significance of a finite set of individual statistical tests resampling based field significance test is used the results to test the significance of association of extreme rainfall intensities with covariates are shown in fig 5 the observed values of percentage of locations found to be non stationary due to local mean temperature and global warming fall outside the distribution of null hypothesis this indicates that individual tests have field significance thus it is highly unlikely that these covariates are associated with extreme rainfall intensities purely by chance it can be concluded based on highest percentage of locations and field significance that effects of local mean temperature are most significant 5 3 scaling of daily rainfall extremes with local temperature scaling relationship using linear regression is developed at all the grids but results for few locations are shown in fig 6 a peaked structure is observed at all locations and the patterns followed by most of the grids are shown here a decrease in the intensity of rainfall extremes with temperature is observed at high range of local mean temperature except four grids of the river basin near its confluence with bay of bengal these four grids follow the pattern shown in fig 6d daily rainfall extremes show a peaked structure at low 25 c to medium 30 c range of temperature over most of the locations these two values represent the temperature of strongest extreme rainfall events the residence time of water in the atmosphere is around 9 days scaling relationship is examined with time lag varying from 1 to 9 days between extreme rainfall and mean temperature no change in the pattern of this relationship is observed so the graphs are not shown here for brevity this kind of peak structure in daily data is observed in few earlier studies berg et al 2009 wang et al 2017 the temperature dependence of rainfall intensity depends on the relative contribution of large scale and convective rainfall berg et al 2009 several factors like time and spatial averaging type of temperature data used for scaling vertical velocity in updrafts precipitation efficiency can contribute to departure from cc scaling drobinski et al 2016 5 4 conditional probabilities kendall s tau which measures concordance is used to summarize the association of annual maximum daily rainfall and local mean temperature the values of this measure of association for different grids in the river basin are shown in fig 7 a negative association is observed in the lower part of the basin but it strengthens while moving to the upper part positive dependence simply means that high values of extreme rainfall are associated with high values of local mean temperature and similarly low values are associated with the low values the field significance of kendall s τ is examined to confirm that this association is not observed simply by chance as the neighbouring grids behave similarly the null hypothesis of independence is tested on 1000 randomly generated samples through the resampling approach discussed in section 4 2 2 the randomly generated time series of rainfall cannot be related to local temperature in the same way therefore null hypothesis of independence is achieved histogram of the results for 1000 trials is shown in fig 7b note that the observed percentage of area with positive kendall s τ lies outside the histogram so it can be concluded that the association measure has field significance to detect the presence of dependence in annual maximum rainfall and local mean temperature extremes two rank based graphical tools called chi plot and kendall plot are employed at a randomly chosen grid located at 82e 21 5n which exhibit positive dependence the points in the chi plot are lying above the upper limit in fig 8 a indicating the positive association in fig 8b values are located above the diagonal line pointing towards the positive dependence among the variables gev distribution is used to model annual maximum time series of both the variables and their validity is tested using goodness of fit kolmogorov smirnov ks test at 5 significance level the parameters estimated using maximum likelihood estimation method are reported in table 3 to model the joint behavior of rainfall and temperature extremes copulas are fitted using the copbasic package asquith 2018 gumbel hougaard copula with parameter 1 336 0 143 is found to be best suited using the goodness of fit test based on cramér von mises function the standard expression for gumbel hougaard family is 14 c θ u v e ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where u v are uniformly distributed probabilistic counterparts of x rainfall and y temperature and θ is the dependence parameter the relationship of θ and kendall s τ is given by 15 τ θ θ 1 θ our aim is to evaluate the conditional probability of annual rainfall extremes conditioned on mean temperature values where the peaks in rainfall intensity are observed let a ln u θ and b ln v θ then the expression for partial derivative of gumbel hougaard copula is given by 16 p u u v v δ c u v δ v exp a b 1 θ 1 a b 1 1 θ v partial derivative of gumbel hougaard copula with dependence parameter θ 1 336 kendall s τ 0 251 and upper tail dependence λ u 2 2 1 θ 0 320 is computed conditioned on temperature values of 25 c and 30 c the conditional probabilities of annual maximum rainfall conditioned on these two mean temperature values are shown in fig 9 it is clear from the figure that the cdf of rainfall extremes conditioned on 30 c is located below the cdf of 25 c i e p x x y 30 p x x y 25 this implies that on an average more strong rainfall events are occurring at 30 c as compared to 25 c similar results are observed at other grids of the basin 6 summary and conclusion extreme rainfall and associated hazardous events are increasing across the globe a better understanding of relationship between extreme rainfall and mechanisms responsible for generation of such events is needed to improve their predictability this study presents a methodology to explore this relationship with the application to mahanadi river basin of india the basin has witnessed heavy floods in the last decade due to increase in extreme rainfall in this study the association of extreme rainfall with natural climate variability human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming is investigated our aim is to find out the physical driver which is significantly influencing the rainfall extremes of the study area non stationary extreme value models with multivariate enso index global average temperature anomaly series and local mean temperature anomaly series as covariates are fitted at non stationary rainfall grids non stationarities are detected with phillips perron pp test and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss test in annual maximum rainfall extremes best fitted non stationary model with one physical covariate is selected at each grid the covariate in the best fitted model represents the most significant physical driver influencing the extreme rainfall of a grid the number of best chosen non stationary models is high with local mean temperature as covariate compared to models with other physical drivers thus local mean temperature is found to be significantly influencing the rainfall extremes of the region the collective significance of individual statistical tests is evaluated using a resampling based field significance test the test results conclude that it is highly unlikely that local mean temperature is associated with extreme rainfall purely by chance association of rainfall extremes with the physical processes varies with geographic locations depending upon their contribution in generating the extremes of the region response of rainfall extremes due to thermodynamic contribution is well understood but the contributions from changes in thermodynamics dynamics and precipitation efficiency have all been found to be important for changes in rainfall extremes o gorman 2015 in an attempt to understand the physical mechanisms causing differences at regional scale emori and brown 2005 decomposed the regional signal into thermodynamic due to changes in atmospheric moisture content and dynamic contributions due to changes in atmospheric motion using statistical approach which is not valid at all locations pfahl et al 2017 decomposed the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using robust physical diagnostic for improving the understanding of changes in daily regional scale extreme rainfall they showed that thermodynamics alone leads to a spatially homogeneous fractional increase however the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses dynamics is responsible for amplifying the increases in asian monsoon region while weakening them across australia south africa and the mediterranean these arguments suggest that the results of this study are not directly generalizable to other regions due to different response of rainfall extremes to physical mechanisms in different regions however our methodology can be followed to study the relationship of extreme rainfall with physical drivers which contribute to the extreme rainfall of the region clausius clapeyron relationship is a highly relevant constraint on extreme rainfall in a warming climate scaling relationships between extreme rainfall and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids of the basin significant deviations from expected cc scaling curves are observed at all the grids a peak in daily extreme rainfall is observed at low 25 c to medium 30 c range of local mean temperature extreme rainfall intensities show a decrease beyond the medium range of temperature to examine the validity of cc scaling daily mean temperature is used as a proxy for atmospheric water vapour but the atmospheric variables which influence the intensity of rainfall covary with temperature it is difficult to separate the effect of temperature on rainfall extremes from the combined effect of multiple atmospheric variables thus it is important to understand the interactions between atmospheric variables and physical processes to correctly interpret the scaling results westra et al 2014 changes in relative humidity were found to affect cc scaling at higher temperatures by jones et al 2010 a reduction in relative humidity was observed above 24 c hinting towards a decrease in moisture content at higher temperatures changes in rainfall types convective and large scale rainfall with temperature can also affect the cc scaling relationship berg et al 2013 time scale of the rainfall event strongly influences the scaling relationship beuchat et al 2011 jones et al 2010 temporary local cooling effect of extreme rainfall event and associated synoptic conditions on local temperature significantly influences the scaling rates bao et al 2017 this cooling effect is a fundamental problem in binning method the cooling artefacts are minimized by developing the scaling curves with a time lag of 1 9 days this time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere however no change in the relationship structure is observed at any grid of the basin deviations from scaling curves still remain debatable multiple mechanisms are responsible for the peaked shape in scaling relationship and which one is dominant is probably region specific wang et al 2017 exploring the physics behind the deviation of extreme rainfall and temperature relationship from cc scaling is beyond the scope of this study further investigation is needed to address the departure from clausius clapeyron expectations the dependence between rainfall and local mean temperature extremes is summarized using kendall s τ the grids in upper part of mahanadi exhibit positive dependence while the extremes are found to be negatively associated in lower part percentage of locations with positive association shows field significance the concept of copulas is used to determine the conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall conditioned on local mean temperature values where the strongest extreme rainfall events are observed we find that the strength of extreme rainfall events is stronger at 30 c compared to that of events at 25 c occurring in the basin this finding is in agreement with the fact that intensity of extreme rainfall events increases with increase in temperature intensities of extreme rainfall over land could rise at a higher rate than cc scaling rate because of the additional latent heat released from increased moisture liu et al 2009 thermodynamic component contributes more towards strengthening the intensity of rainfall events due to increased water availability the dynamic component on the other hand reduces the intensity of rainfall except for the heaviest rainfall events chou et al 2012 further research on how the dynamic component is contributing towards the extreme rainfall of the region might reveal valuable information for better understanding of underlying processes only annual maximum extremes are considered in this study but second highest extreme event of the year could be more disastrous than extremes in other years identifying extreme events by peak over threshold pot method is a way to use the information of extremes more efficiently this work can be further extended by defining extremes based on pot approach to capture more information on extreme events this might help in improving the understanding of extreme rainfall and temperature dependence structure several studies discuss the importance of time scales for examining the dependence of extreme rainfall intensities on temperature these studies have a common conclusion that sub daily rainfall extremes are intensifying more than the daily time scale rainfall extremes berg and haerter 2013 haerter et al 2010 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 2010 one potential limitation of this study is the selection of daily time scale due to data limitations further research at sub daily scale can reveal important information which the daily data has not revealed in this study conflict of interest none

6583,few studies have fully considered how hydrological inputs and climate influence the linkage between the oxygen isotopic composition of α cellulose δ18ocell and their source waters in vascular plant dominated alpine peatlands in this study in order to test whether δ18ocell can be used as a hydroclimatic indicator we investigated the relationship between the δ18o values of cellulose extracted from the dominant plant species carex pamirensis and those of potential source waters during two growing seasons from may to september in the sahara sand peatland in the southern altai mountains concurrently the roden lin ehleringer rle mechanistic model was applied to better understand oxygen isotopic fractionation during cellulose synthesis we found that the meltwater from snow ice cover and seasonally frozen soil played a critical role in controlling the hydrological processes in this alpine peatland the δ18o values of both swale water and soil water responded more sensitively to variations in inflow meltwater than did summer precipitation isosource modelling demonstrated that the mean 76 24 split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs determined the overall isotopic composition of the peatland water the slopes of the peatland water line 6 38 and meltwater line 6 87 were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl 7 72 suggesting limited evaporation from these external water sources due to the relatively high humidity 73 80 in the studied fen however the slopes of the stem water line 4 53 and leaf water line 3 57 were generally lower than that of the lmwl indicating that the internal plant waters have experienced isotopic enrichment during transpiration interestingly the variations of δ18ocell of shoots stems and leaves fall within a relatively narrow range 3 which is mainly attributed to a nearly constant monthly net 18o enrichment factor 11 13 1 07 for δmodelled together with a smoothing effect furthermore empirical correlation and rle modeling both showed the co variation of external source water and cellulose synthesis demonstrating that the cellulose oxygen isotope composition of c pamirensis can faithfully reflect variations in soil swale water these findings strongly suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant water source in determining δ18ocell implying that the δ18op signals of precipitation in the winter half year october april may be inherited by the δ18ocell values of c pamirensis at the study site therefore our results provide important insights for the hydroclimatic interpretation of past variations in δ18ocell values in vascular plants in alpine peatlands keywords isotopic hydrology oxygen isotope cellulose meltwater altai mountains 1 introduction the oxygen isotopic composition of α cellulose δ18ocell in tree rings and other fossil plant tissues has been extensively used for retrieving past hydroclimatic information e g an et al 2014 sano et al 2017 mayr et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 because the source water δ18o signal is recorded by δ18ocell samuel and silver 1965 epstein et al 1977 deniro and epstein 1979 initially δ18ocell was recognized as a paleo thermometer libby et al 1976 because of the significant positive correlation between local temperature and the δ18o of precipitation δ18op especially in middle and high latitudes dansgaard 1964 however this linkage is indirect since leaf temperature is only weakly related to ambient temperature helliker and richter 2008 furthermore variations in precipitation amount relative humidity and moisture sources can also influence the source water δ18o values resulting in these signals potentially being preserved in plant α cellulose e g daley et al 2010 an et al 2014 sano et al 2017 in addition to these external environmental factors isotopic fractionation processes occur during cellulose synthesis associated with autotrophic and heterotrophic carbohydrate metabolism which can further modify the original δ18o signal of the source water sternberg and deniro 1983 yakir and deniro 1990 luo and sternberg 1992 this is demonstrated by the position specific effect of oxygen isotope ratios in the glucose units of the cellulose molecule sternberg et al 2006 waterhouse et al 2013 and by the temperature threshold of biochemical oxygen isotope fractionation sternberg and ellsworth 2011 despite the numerous potential influencing factors δ18ocell data from peat deposits has been widely used for paleoclimatic and paleohydrological reconstruction e g brenninkmeijer et al 1982 aucour et al 1996 moschen et al 2009 kaislahti tillman et al 2010 daley et al 2010 jones et al 2014 in these studies sphagnum dominated bogs are the most common study sites because in the case of ombrotrophic peatlands the source water used for plant α cellulose synthesis is derived solely from precipitation ménot combes et al 2002 loader et al 2016 however the use of δ18ocell for paleoclimatic reconstruction in vascular plant dominated peatlands is comparatively limited hong et al 2000 2009 despite their widespread occurrence in mid latitude regions and their great potential for improving our understanding of past climatic changes amesbury et al 2015 even given the same water source the δ18ocell values of vascular and non vascular plants can be quite different largely due to the presence absence of stomata capable of regulating moisture gas exchange ménot combes et al 2002 nichols et al 2010 as a non vascular plant sphagnum does not possess functioning guard cells rydin 1986 and therefore cannot control water loss thus it can potentially provide a direct record of variations in source water δ18o used in cellulose synthesis ménot combes et al 2002 zanazzi and mora 2005 hence sphagnum moss δ18ocell has been interpreted as a proxy for precipitation moisture source daley et al 2010 by comparison the δ18ocell values of vascular sedges in holocene records from chinese herbaceous peats were thought to mainly reflect changes in surface air temperature hong et al 2000 2009 although this view has been reassessed using inverse proxy modelling yu et al 2011 yu 2013 these studies lack the support of modern process studies furthermore comprehensive recent studies proposed that δ18ocell δdcell values have the potential for quantitative reconstruction of hydrological processes zanazzi and mora 2005 mora and zanazzi 2017 therefore additional investigations of the relationship between hydroclimatic processes and δ18ocell in modern peatland plants are clearly needed especially for vascular plant dominated peatlands to better understand peat δ18ocell data hydrological inputs especially summer rainfall or snowmelt or groundwater input temperature and relative humidity in the peatlands must be considered zanazzi and mora 2005 royles et al 2013 loader et al 2016 because these factors can modify δ18ocell values roden et al 2000 waterhouse et al 2002 for example snowmelt shallow groundwater inflow and surface runoff from the surrounding uplands could dominate the hydrological processes of the peatlands and thereby control the isotopic composition of the source water zanazzi and mora 2005 royles et al 2013 in fact this specific hydrological influence could potentially be amplified at high altitudes where winter season precipitation can be stored in snow ice and seasonally frozen soil subsequently during the growing season these solid phase water resources will gradually become available and be mixed with summer precipitation influencing the isotope hydrology of the peatlands it is well known that winter precipitation in such regions has more negative δ18o values than summer precipitation dansgaard 1964 however this isotopic duality of source water caused by meltwater and summer rainfall contributions in vascular plant dominated alpine peatlands has received insufficient attention which limits our understanding of peat δ18ocell data moreover evaporative enrichment is also poorly documented for emergent plants compared with sphagnum and aquatic plants partly because the methods needed to obtain leaf water are complicated and mainly depend on application of the vacuum distillation technique west et al 2006 however process models already provide the possibility of quantifying the evaporative effect based on climatic parameters such as temperature and relative humidity majoube 1971 dongmann et al 1974 roden et al 2000 yu et al 2014 therefore more detailed and systematic observations of both hydrological and local microclimatic conditions in such peatlands can help improve our understanding of the linkage between the δ18o values of source water and plant α cellulose in this study we attempt to evaluate the potential paleoclimatic application of δ18ocell data in a vascular plant dominated alpine peatland of the altai mountains in northwesternmost china to this end we conducted a two year investigation of the relationship between δ18ocell and potential source waters namely inflow meltwater derived from snow and ice cover and seasonally frozen soil precipitation swale water soil water stem water and leaf water we focused solely on the vascular sedge carex pamirensis because this species is dominant in the local plant community fig 1 d and its remains are the main constituents ca 70 80 of the peat deposits of such regions based on pollen and plant macrofossil composition data feng et al 2017 rao et al 2019 thus they enable us to use bulk peat cellulose for paleoclimatic reconstruction zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 our specific aims were as follows 1 to determine the relative contributions of meltwater and summer precipitation taken up by vascular sedge plants during the growing season 2 to determine the effect of evaporative enrichment on plant α cellulose δ18o values during the summer months and 3 to determine whether the variations of source water δ18o values can be captured by the δ18ocell values of c pamirensis in this alpine peatland 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we conducted the study in the sahara sand peatland 48 7 13 5 n 88 21 26 4 e 2450 m a s l which is situated within wuqilike national wetland park in the southern altai mountains northern xinjiang uygur autonomous region northwestern china in arid central asia fig 1a the study area lies in a typical intermontane depression which provides excellent environmental conditions for peat development fig 1b the peat area is 2 km2 whereas the catchment area of the basin is 17 25 km2 thus the peatland is fed mainly by precipitation and surface runoff from the surrounding upland slopes including snowmelt in the early growing season from may to july fig 1c the wetland has a ph of about 5 2 and can be classified as a transitional fen i e intermediate between minerotrophic and ombrotrophic wetland moore and bellamy 1974 the predominant species in this peatland is carex pamirensis accounting for more than 80 of the total above ground biomass fig 1d other species include carex altaica eriophorum scheuchzeri and the moss aulacomnium palustre the climate of the area is characterized by a long cold winter from october to april and a very short cool summer from june to august the annual precipitation from 1971 to 2000 at altay meteorological station 68 km from the peatland 47 44 n 88 05 e 737 m a s l was 191 3 mm with 53 occurring in the winter months from october to april fig 1e the high mountain areas to the northeast receive an annual precipitation of 350 600 mm with a relatively high proportion more than 60 as winter snowfall liu and you 1982 during the growing season from may to september in the peatland the mean temperature is 9 1 c fig 2 a and the relative humidity is as high as 73 80 fig 2b 2 2 field sampling and observations in 2014 we obtained samples of c pamirensis recently grown shoots three potential external source water samples swale water summer precipitation inflow meltwater at plot1 on 24 may 23 june 24 july 25 august and 22 september in 2017 in order to obtain more comprehensive data and to test the potential effect of microtopography on evaporative enrichment we took samples of c pamirensis recently grown shoots older stems and leaves and water samples from multiple sources swale water summer precipitation inflow meltwater outlet water soil water stem water and leaf water at the two locations plot1 and plot2 see fig 1c on 31 may 28 june 30 july 4 august and 25 september at the same time three quadrats of 0 25 m2 area 50 cm 50 cm were deployed at each location monthly to survey the new plant growth and seasonal changes in the above ground biomass of the monodominant community of c pamirensis in the peatland fig 1d and supplementary fig s1 sampling was conducted on sunny days to minimize the influence of recent rainwater at each sampling location at monthly intervals 15 20 living individuals of c pamirensis with similar degrees of maturity and the same height were cut off from the soil surface and different types of plant tissue including recently grown shoots older stems leaves and roots collected only on 25 september 2017 were manually divided and combined into a single sample and then stored in polyethylene bags to collect plant water several samples of living stem leaf and root materials were cut into segments at the same time and immediately placed in eight 10 ml glass tubes which were then sealed with caps and wrapped with parafilm subsequently free water within stems leaves and roots was extracted from these samples using a cryogenic vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china in the laboratory west et al 2006 swale water samples were collected monthly from the pond water reservoir fig 1c placed in a 20 ml vial and wrapped with parafilm soil water samples 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm were obtained monthly by squeezing soil samples at 10 or 20 cm intervals from a 40 cm long peat core using a 10 ml plastic syringe and placed in three 5 ml glass tubes and wrapped with parafilm this simple method can minimize isotopic fractionation and has been widely used in peatlands to obtain samples of soil water from vertical peat profiles as well as moss water samples e g ménot combes et al 2002 zanazzi and mora 2005 nichols et al 2010 amesbury et al 2015 in this study the meltwater samples include accumulated snow on the peatland surface in spring at the end of may and meltwater from snow ice cover and seasonally frozen soil of the surrounding upland slopes in the summer months all are hereafter termed inflow meltwater the solid snow ice samples were collected from several 30 150 cm thick snow pack accumulations on the peatland surface on 27 may 2017 and the liquid meltwater samples were collected monthly from the point of entry of snowmelt streams draining the surrounding sunny and shaded slopes outlet water samples were collected monthly from the export of surface runoff that flowed out of the peatland monthly rainfall samples were collected from a location within 2 km of the peatland using three stainless steel funnels attached to three 5 l plastic containers to each of which 10 mm of paraffin oil was added in advance to prevent evaporation the containers were replaced at the end of each calendar month daley et al 2010 in the field the meltwater and rainwater samples were collected with 10 ml plastic syringes filtered with cameo 0 45 μm nylon and placed in 20 ml vials that were entirely filled with water capped and sealed with a layer of parafilm zanazzi and mora 2005 finally a total of 182 water associated samples and 37 plant samples were stored in an airtight container at 4 c and transported back to the laboratory as quickly as possible in addition local meteoric precipitation samples in summer and winter at altay city 55 km from the peatland at 908 m a s l were collected from may to september 2014 and from march 2017 to may 2018 the liquid water samples were collected immediately after the end of rainfall whereas the solid snowfall samples were melted at room temperature before being sealed in a plastic bottle a total of 85 event based precipitation samples were collected at altay city we also obtained weighted monthly precipitation δd δ18o data from june 2000 to december 2002 at altay station tian et al 2007 which were combined with our monthly mean data in 2014 2017 2018 to provide more information about the seasonal variation of the isotopic composition of precipitation in the region although altay city and the weather station are located at the foot of the mountains fig 1b the two sites are very close to the peatland which reduces the possible influence of an altitude effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation four button sized temperature and relative humidity data loggers ibuttontm maxim integrated dallas tx u s a were installed 1 cm above the vegetation canopy at the two locations to monitor the microclimate the data loggers were shielded by a rubber cap to reduce the effects of wind and direct insolation heating loader et al 2016 and were set to record at 2 h intervals for an entire growing season from 27 may to 24 september in 2017 at the same time 2 h observations of water table depth and water temperature were recorded daily using a pressure transducer hobo u20 water level onset u s a at the four locations plot1 plot2 inlet water and outlet water see fig 1c and summer precipitation events were automatically logged using a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset u s a located 0 8 m above the surface 2 3 cellulose extraction isotopic analyses and statistical methods all plant samples 15 shoots 10 stems 10 leaves 2 roots were washed with pure deionized water using an ultrasonic device freeze dried for 48 h and cut into very small pieces 1 mm with scissors subsequently α cellulose was extracted using a modified standard treatment with acidified sodium chlorite solution and sodium hydroxide loader et al 1997 huang et al 2015 rao et al 2019 briefly lignin was removed by treating the samples with acetic acid and sodium chlorite at 80 c for 1 h the bleaching stage was repeated 6 8 times until the samples were visually pure white after rinsing the samples were treated with 17 sodium hydroxide to remove hemicellulose polysaccharides were removed with 10 sodium hydroxide for 15 min samples were neutralized with 1 hydrochloric acid and then repeatedly rinsed using distilled water finally the α cellulose samples were homogenized by ultrasonic processing and freeze dried for 2 days all water samples were analyzed for stable hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotopic composition using a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i picarro u s a at the key laboratory of western china s environmental systems ministry of education lanzhou university we used the lgr working standard 3a δdvsmow 96 4 0 5 δ18ovsmow 13 1 0 15 lgr

samples a total of 6 repeat measurements were made for each water sample but the mean value of the final three measurements were adopted in our study the isotopic ratios are expressed using the δ notation in per mil relative to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water and the analytical errors were less than 0 1 for δ18o and less than 0 5 for δd dry α cellulose samples ca 0 28 0 30 mg were weighed into silver foil capsules and the δ18o values were measured online with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer at 1350 c coupled with a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer thermo

sigma aldrich buchs germany δ18o 28 2 0 3 and benzoic acid iaea 601 δ18o 23 3 0 3 were used to calibrate the δ18o measurements the δ18o values are reported as per mil deviations from the vsmow standard the δ18o values had acceptable reproducibility with an analytical error of 0 2 to compare δ18o values between two different sets of samples a parametric t test homoscedastic t test was applied with a 5 threshold however when the variances of the samples were non homogeneous then a non parametric test mann whitney u was applied one way analysis of variance anova was used to examine differences between the different parts of the plants and soil water at different depths the least significant difference lsd test was performed to determine the significance of treatment means at p 0 05 all the statistical analyses were performed using spss version 16 0 2 4 model of oxygen isotopic fractionation in cellulose we used the roden lin ehleringer rle mechanistic modeling approach to predict the expected oxygen isotope ratios of plant α cellulose this model involves two major components 1 the biophysical processes leading to the enrichment of the δ18o values in leaf water and 2 the biochemical processes governing the oxygen isotopic exchange between different organic components during cellulose synthesis first the oxygen isotopic composition of leaf water δ18olw can be described by the modified craig gordon model under the isotopic steady state condition craig and gordon 1965 farquhar and gan 2003 given by 1 δ 18 o lw δ 18 o sw ε e ε k δ 18 o atm δ 18 o sw ε k e a e i here δ18osw and δ18oatm are the oxygen isotopic composition of the source water and atmospheric water vapor respectively ea ei is the ratio of ambient vapor pressure to intercellular vapor pressure which can be assumed to be equal to the relative humidity h of the ambient air craig and gordon 1965 dongmann et al 1974 εk is the liquid vapor kinetic enrichment effect which depends on the relative humidity over the evaporating surface and the relative rate of molecular diffusion of 16o and 18o in the leaf boundary layer buhay et al 1996 and εe is the liquid vapor equilibrium effect associated with the leaf water enrichment which can be expressed as a function of absolute temperature t c 273 15 t c in degrees kelvin majoube 1971 yu et al 2011 yu 2013 as follows 2 ε e exp 1137 t 2 0 4156 t 0 0020667 1 1000 assuming the meteoric water is dominated by the well mixed regional air mass that is in equilibrium with the source water then we can use the source water δ18o to estimate the oxygen isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor i e δ18oatm δ18osw εe thus eq 1 can be simplified to 3 δ 18 o lw δ 18 o sw ε e ε k 1 h in addition photosynthesis can increase the leaf cellulose δ18o value by 27 3 during the interaction between carbonyl and leaf water sternberg and deniro 1983 yakir and deniro 1990 the biochemical fractionation factor εb is likely to be temperature insensitive yakir and deniro 1990 despite some evidence to the contrary sternberg and ellsworth 2011 after the original incorporation of leaf water and autotrophic fractionation into photosynthetic sugars secondary fractionation may occur if there is re equilibrium exchange between the synthesized carbohydrate and water within the cell fortunately the physiological and biochemical complexities involving oxygen during cellulose synthesis are well described by the rle mechanistic model roden et al 2000 and can be expressed as 4 δ 18 o cell f o δ 18 o sw ε b 1 f o δ 18 o lw ε b here δ18ocell is the oxygen isotopic composition in cellulose εb 27 3 is the same for autotrophic and heterotrophic fractionation of oxygen yakir and deniro 1990 and fo 0 42 is the proportion of the carbon bound oxygen undergoing exchange with the source water roden et al 2000 combined with eqs 3 and 4 can be simplified to 5 δ 18 o cell δ 18 o sw ε b 1 f o 1 h ε e ε k if we assume that the net 18o enrichment factor 6 δ 1 f o 1 h ε e ε k then δ18ocell can be calculated by 7 δ 18 o cell δ 18 o sw ε b δ finally δ18ocell is reduced to a simple linear function and therefore eq 7 can theoretically be used to evaluate δ18ocell or δ18osw in our study we ran the model for δ18ocell i e δ18ocell δ18osw εb δ and δ18osw i e δ18osw δ18ocell εb δ using our monthly mean measured data of source water δ18o cellulose oxygen isotopes relative humidity and air temperature from may to september modeled oxygen isotope ratios were compared with monthly observed measurements of δ18o i e modeled measured δ18o offset to evaluate the simulation results all the variables defined in the above equations are listed and defined in supplementary table s1 2 5 stable isotope mixing model based on the principles of water balance and isotopic mass conservation a linear mixing model has been established to calculate plant water uptake from different water sources phillips and gregg 2003 in this model at least n isotope systems are used to determine the proportional contributions of n 1 sources to a mixture and thus δd and δ18o are limited to solve plant water uptake from two or three water sources in our study we assumed that the swale soil water for plant root uptake in the peatland was predominantly a mixture of inflow meltwater and summer precipitation namely that the δd and δ18o values of swale soil water were determined by the two potential water sources thus the proportional contributions of the two potential water sources can be estimated by the two source mixing model isosource model phillips and gregg 2003 for one isotope system and two sources the following system of mass balance equations can be solved to determine the proportions f a f b of source isotopic signatures δa δb which coincide with the observed signature of the mixture δm 8 δ m f a δ a f b δ b 9 1 f a f b here δm is swale water soil water 0 40 cm δ a is summer precipitation δ b is inflow meltwater f a is the relative proportion of summer precipitation and f b is the relative proportion of inflow meltwater both of the monthly mean values of measured δd and δ18o data from may to september were used to determine the contribution ratios of the two potential water sources and then the averaged contribution ratios from both hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were taken as the monthly results 3 results 3 1 meteorology and hydrology there was a significant diurnal variability in temperature and relative humidity in the peatland during the growing season from 27 may to 24 september in 2017 fig 2a and 2b within a whole day the mean monthly temperature varied between 4 3 0 34 c and 11 9 1 05 c mean 9 1 0 24 c and the mean monthly relative humidity varied between 73 0 1 92 and 80 4 1 16 mean 77 5 0 19 at daytime 08 00

21 00 07 00 the mean monthly temperature varied between 3 2 0 57 c and 3 2 0 43 c mean 1 0 0 05 c and the mean monthly relative humidity approached 100 the water table depth at plot1 ranged from 2 to 28 cm mean 15 cm and the water table depth at plot2 ranged from 11 to 32 cm mean 24 cm the range of water table depths for the surface runoff was 12 39 cm inlet water mean 21 cm and 12 75 cm outlet water mean 28 cm fig 2c in addition the mean water temperature during the growing season for plot2 11 32 3 40 c was higher than for plot1 8 17 3 54 c fig 2d this water temperature difference is caused mainly by the microtopography of the two sampling locations plot2 is located on higher ground and is distant from the inflow water source resulting in the surface ponded water at plot2 having a smaller exchangeability with cold meltwater relative to plot1 and making it susceptible to solar radiation heating fig 1c 3 2 source waters the stable isotopic compositions of the different water bodies were significantly different fig 3 precipitation showed a broad range of isotopic composition δ18o ranged from 26 4 to 5 9 and δd ranged from 191 2 to 29 8 the respective mean values of δ18o and δd were 19 0 4 2 and 139 33 7 for winter precipitation october april and 8 4 1 8 and 58 1 13 9 for summer precipitation may september inflow meltwater was characterized by more negative isotopic values compared with other source waters during the growing seasons with δ18o varying between 21 6 and 11 3 and δd between 158 2 and 85 3 the respective mean values were 15 8 2 6 and 115 4 18 the outlet water had slightly higher isotopic values than the inflow meltwater δ18o ranged from 17 6 to 12 2 mean 15 4 1 8 and δd ranged from 128 1 to 90 5 mean 111 7 12 8 soil water 0 40 cm had higher

of variability during the two growing seasons fig 4 a in 2014 from may to september the δ18ocell values for shoots ranged from 23 9 to 27 2 with a mean of 25 1 1 4 in 2017 the δ18ocell values also had a very narrow range of variability during the growing season 2 3 for shoots 1 6 for leaves and 3 for stems the shoot δ18ocell values ranged from 24 9 to 27 2 mean 26 1 0 7 the stem δ18ocell values from 24 1 to 27 1 mean 26 0 1 0 the leaf δ18ocell values from 25 3 to 26 9 mean 25 7 0 6 and the mean δ18ocell value of roots collected on 25 september 2017 was 24 5 0 8 on the whole there was little difference in δ18ocell between the two years however the mean δ18ocell value of 25 8 0 96 in 2017 was slightly higher than that in 2014 a comparison of the δ18o values of swale and soil water and inflow meltwater reveals similar trends of variation fig 4b in 2014 the δ18o of swale water mean 13 2 1 2 was very close to that of inflow meltwater mean 14 8 1 7 but substantially different to that

source waters fig 4b 3 4 isosource modelling the two source mixing model isosource model showed that the mean relative contribution of inflow meltwater was up to 76 whereas the summer precipitation only accounted for 24 fig 5 notably we also found that the interannual variations in the proportions of winter and summer precipitation could influence the relative contributions of the source water in the peatland in 2013 2014 the relative contribution of inflow meltwater for source water exceeded 80 especially in may june and july while the summer precipitation contributed less than 20 during these months the relatively large proportion of inflow meltwater was mainly contributed by the higher proportion of winter precipitation up to 66 very close to the average for many years fig 1e in 2013 2014 fig 5a by contrast the proportion of winter precipitation accounted for 45 of annual precipitation in 2016 2017 hence the mean relative contribution of summer precipitation during the entire growing season was up to 39 higher than the 16 in 2013 2014 nonetheless the relative contribution of inflow meltwater in the early growing season still comprised a proportion greater than 80 particularly in may and june of 2017 fig 5b 3 5 mechanistic modelling a simple but valid rle mechanistic model namely eq 7 can be used to capture the variations of δ18osw or δ18ocell in the studied alpine peatland first in the case of cellulose synthesis during photosynthesis eq 6 i e δmodelled 1 fo 1 h εe εk allows us to quantitatively estimate the net 18o enrichment factor δ depending on the mean monthly temperature t and a narrow range of mean monthly relative humidity h values in daytime fig 2a and 2b the results can also be examined using a variant of eq 7 i e δcalculated δ18ocell δ18osw εb if the values of δ18ocell and δ18osw are precisely measured the mean value of δmodelled 11 13 1 07 was not statistically different to that of δcalculated mean 11 56 0 89 mann whitney u n 10 p 0 496 which did not include the input values of summer precipitation and leaf water as the source water fig 6 a more importantly the results for the two variants were less variable during the growing season from may to september specifically δmodelled ranged from 10 47 0 18 to 11 87 2 22 and δcalculated ranged from 9 80 0 42 to 12 49 0 04 fig 6b second the modelled δ18osw values mean 12 35

06 homoscedastic t test n 5 p 0 278 specifically the mean offsets of modelled δ18osw minus measured swale soil water δ18o were much lower than error 1 unfortunately the mean offsets between modelled δ18osw and measured δ18osw in summer precipitation and leaf water had the much larger error of 3 which is an unacceptable error margin fig 7 a and supplementary table s2 on average using inflow meltwater soil water 0 40 cm swale water and stem water as the source water for cellulose synthesis the modelled δ18ocell values were very close to the values of measured δ18ocell fig 7b and supplementary table s3 specifically using soil water 0 40 cm and swale water as the input values for source water resulted in mean modelled measured offsets for δ18ocell values of 1 for shoots and using inflow meltwater and stem water as the source water the mean offsets of δ18ocell values for shoots were 2 however if summer precipitation and leaf water are used as the source water the mean offsets for shoots δ18ocell values are 3 which is also an unacceptable degree of error 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological processes within the studied alpine peatland the continuous observation data from 27 may to 24 september 2017 showed that the water table depth in the peatland was highest during the early growing season and that it gradually declined during subsequent months fig 2c several studies have pointed out that the thawing of snow ice cover and frozen soil has an important effect on hydrological processes in alpine regions e g zhang et al 1985 yang et al 2017 in the study area this is because of the following reasons first due to the influence of the siberian cold air mass and the high altitude the duration of the snowpack can be up to 240 d during the cold season october through may fig 1c and the maximum values of snow ice cover thickness can reach 150 250 cm in the middle mountain regions zhang et al 1985 second the soil begins to freeze at the end of september e g the air temperature fell to below zero in 23 september of 2017 and freezing conditions can persist until the end of july or even later particularly on shaded slopes in addition in the southern altai mountains the thickness of the seasonally frozen soil layer increases with increasing altitude zhang et al 1985 the precipitation storage represented by the snow ice cover within the peatland and distal slopes is rapidly released during snow melting in spring and early summer hence we observed that the highest water table depth occurred at the beginning of the growing season subsequently until early august the water table depth began to decline due to the complete depletion of the snow ice cover surprisingly the inflow water still maintained lower δ18o values even at the end of august and september fig 4b which suggests that the meltwater generated by the seasonally frozen soils on the surrounding upland slopes continued to drain into the peatland probably because of the large ratio 8 6 1 of catchment area to peat area in high mountainous areas extreme rainfall is one of the main forms of summer precipitation that can generate fluctuations in surface runoff in the peatland fig 2c in 2017 summer precipitation accounted for a considerable amount 176 4 mm during the observation period in the peatland but it was mainly derived from five extreme rainfall events for example we clearly observed five of the largest heavy rainfall events 10 mm that occurred on 8 june 10 8 mm 24 25 june 35 4 mm 30 june 2 july 33 2 mm 22 23 august 14 5 mm and 12 september 19 1 mm the five extreme rainfall events accounted for about 64 of total cumulative rainfall during the growing season we also found that the water levels rose rapidly in response to heavy rainfall and then fell abruptly after its cessation the five extreme rainfall events caused the levels of the outlet water to increase by 4 5 cm 30 9 cm 18 2 cm 4 7 cm and 16 3 cm respectively while the water levels declined to normal during the subsequent 16 h 36 h 38 h 20 h and 34 h respectively in addition there were smaller fluctuations in water level within the peatland plot1 and plot2 compared to the surface runoff inlet water and outlet water which suggests that the precipitation from heavy rainfall events drained rapidly into the river therefore the water table depth responded rapidly to the extreme summer rainfall whereas the uninterrupted meltwater input derived from snow ice cover and seasonally frozen soil plays a critical role in controlling the hydrological dynamics especially in the early growing season 4 2 relationships between different source waters there is an apparent temperature effect in δd and δ18o in the altai mountains with enriched values occurring in summer and depleted values in winter fig 3a this is despite the westerlies transport of moisture from the atlantic ocean during summer together with a large proportion ca 45 50 of the moisture in winter from polar regions liu and you 1982 tian et al 2007 the peatland water line δd 6 38 δ18o 13 46 r 0 98 p 0 001 is almost parallel to that of the meltwater line δd 6 87 δ18o 6 78 r 0 99 p 0 001 which implies that the inflow meltwater is likely to be the main water source for the peatland fig 3a the slopes of the peatland water line 6 38 and meltwater line 6 87 are very similar but the intercepts are different this because the peatland water i e swale and soil water as defined here could be affected to some degree by summer rainfall and evaporation compared with precipitation the slopes of the two water lines were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl slope of 7 72 and the global meteoric water line gmwl slope of 8 and the deviations were probably influenced by sublimation fractionation of the snow ice cover the evaporation of seasonally frozen soil and the minor recharge of summer precipitation yang et al 2017 the isotopic data points except for leaf water collected in june july and august in 2017 are mainly distributed within the range of precipitation and most of the values for soil water swale water and stem water values overlap with those of inflow meltwater and are closer to the values of the winter seasons which indicates substantial replenishment from winter precipitation only seven samples i e swale water and surface soil water collected in june and july 2017 at the location of the plot2 were close to the values of summer precipitation fig 3 and it is possible that the summer rainfall or evaporation effect may have affected the isotopic values of these samples evidently the δ18o values of swale water in 2014 and soil water in 2017 responded more strongly to the variations of inflow meltwater rather than to summer precipitation r 0 72 n 15 p 0 002 figs 4b and 8 a despite the significant positive correlation of the δ18o values of swale water and soil water r 0 99 n 10 p 0 001 fig 8b the δ18o values of the swale water were less negative and had a larger range of variability compared with the soil water fig 3c this seems reasonable since the surface swale water can be more easily influenced by rainwater supply and evaporation from the water air interface for instance we found that the summer rainfall in 2017 182 6 mm was 3 3 times greater than in 2014 55 2 mm fig 5 and thus the greater rainwater input in 2017 may have been responsible for the higher δ18o values of the swale water than was the case in 2014 fig 4b however the deeper soil water was much less influenced by these external factors with the δ18o values of the deeper soil water remaining more homogeneous and negative by virtue of the greater meltwater inflow to the fen zanazzi and mora 2005 in fact the oxygen isotope values for swale soil water were systematically higher than in inflow meltwater fig 4b the higher isotopic values for swale soil water suggest a superimposed contribution of summer rainwater and therefore we speculate that the source water for uptake by vascular sedge plant roots is a mixture of meltwater and summer precipitation the quantitative results from the isosource modelling further showed that the source water inputs are dominated by inflow meltwater formed by winter precipitation the mean input from isosource modelling was 76 with direct summer precipitation having a much smaller influence mean 24 on the overall composition of the source water fig 5 it is worth noting that the mean relative contribution of summer precipitation was up to 39 in 2017 due to the larger proportion of summer precipitation up to 55 during 2016 2017 fig 5b however the effect of summer precipitation on the deep soil water is still limited because the rainwater from the five short duration heavy rainfall events drained rapidly from the surface of the peatland fig 2c in support of this interpretation we found that the δ18o values of deep soil water were considerably lower and closer to the values of inflow meltwater during the entire growing season in 2017 fig 4b on the other hand although the contribution of summer precipitation may increase in the late growing season due to the decrease of the meltwater input fig 5 most of the growth of the living plants would have occurred during the early growing season mainly from may to july supplementary fig s1 and the availability of summer rainfall is very much lower at this time these findings suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant source of water for the alpine peatland while summer precipitation is less important 4 3 effect of evapotranspiration on isotopic fractionation the lmwl meltwater line and peatland water lines are all closely aligned suggesting minimal evaporative isotopic enrichment from those external source waters fig 3a the high relative humidity 73 80 fig 2b of the fen site during the growing season limits the extent of kinetic enrichment that may be caused by evaporation craig and gordon 1965 thus it is reasonable to expect a limited effect of evaporation on the water balance of the ponds in the fen ménot combes et al 2002 a similar phenomenon was observed by wolfe and edwards 1997 in lakes of the western taimyr peninsula rh 70 80 during july and zanazzi and mora 2005 in the wetlands of lake superior rh 74 furthermore the effects of possible evaporation on swale soil water will to some degree be offset by mixing with meltwater and summer rainfall during the growing season ménot combes et al 2002 thus extremely enriched isotopic values were not observed for these external source waters in our sampling regimes fig 4b however the slopes of the stem water line 4 53 and the leaf water line 3 57 are at an angle i e they have a lower slope compared to the lmwl 7 72 indicating that the internal plant waters especially leaf water have been subjected to substantial evaporative enrichment fig 3a in general there is no isotopic fractionation by the roots during water uptake until the water reaches the leaves or non suberized stems undergoing water loss ehleringer and dawson 1992 as a result compared to swale soil water leaf water experienced apparent isotopic enrichment during transpiration due to equilibrium and kinetic effects farquhar and gan 2003 however stem water was less enriched in δ18o and δd relative to leaf water mainly because the water within stem xylem did not experience extreme isotopic fractionation during water transport ehleringer and dawson 1992 the slight enrichment of the stem water may result from the fact that little non suberized stem tissue was collected during sampling accordingly the δ18o and δd variations of swale soil water especially for deeper soil water can directly reflect that of precipitation but not the plant water in the peatland in fact free water δ18o within the leaf could be easily influenced by the relative humidity during plant transpiration dongmann et al 1974 and subsequently the incorporation of the isotopic enrichment of leaf water into organic compounds affects the δ18o values of plant α cellulose during biosynthesis yakir and deniro 1990 roden et al 2000 according to eqs 6 and 7 decreasing relative humidity can lead to increasing δ and δ18ocell values interestingly there was little seasonal variation of the mean monthly relative humidity in daytime 08 00 20 00 rh 47 58 fig 2b to quantify its impact on the studied plant species based on eqs 6 and 7 we can demonstrate that the low variability of δ18ocell values 3 fig 4a mainly results from the nearly constant net 18o enrichment factor δ during the growing season 11 13 1 07 for δmodelled and 11 56 0 89 for δcalculated fig 6 this lower variability of the net 18o enrichment factor on the monthly timescale 3 has important implications for paleoclimatic studies based on cellulose oxygen isotopes in the alpine peatland 4 4 variability of the oxygen isotopes the δ18o values for the temporal i e related to seasonality and spatial i e related to microtopography datasets showed that the total variability of source waters was considerably greater than that of the cellulose values figs 4 and 9 for instance swale water δ18o varied by close to 6 5 and leaf water by up to 15 7 both of which are larger than the fluctuations in δ18ocell 3 there are several possible hypotheses explaining the discrepancy between the isotopic variability in water and the corresponding response in the plant a possible scenario which could account for this narrow range of δ18ocell values involves an averaging effect in which a given cellulose sample reflects plant tissue growth over several weeks or even a few months zanazzi and mora 2005 mora and zanazzi 2017 in other words plant α cellulose can integrate the large variations observed in source water isotopic compositions over a long period and thus more closely reflect the average isotopic composition of the source water ménot combes et al 2002 daley et al 2010 such high variability of δ18o in the source waters mainly reflects transient climatic features during our sampling campaign while these attributes would be dampened in plant α cellulose another possibility involves an ecological scenario in which the root system of vascular plants withdraws water from deeper within the soil layer 20 40 cm and this deeper soil water is much more homogeneous in its isotopic composition than the surface swale water fig 4b as a result the vascular sedge plants are less likely to experience fluctuating δ18oswale values resulting from episodic evaporative enrichment that could only occur within swale water campbell and williamson 1997 ménot combes et al 2002 price et al 2009 alternatively the low variability of the δ18ocell values could be the result of the ecology of c pamirensis the preferred habitat of this emergent species is a perennial stagnant water microenvironment average water level 15 cm and more than half of the plant tissue i e roots stems and parts of leaves grows completely submerged thereby decreasing the possible effect of evaporation on δ18ocell values zanazzi and mora 2005 nichols et al 2010 however the leaf water and stem water have more enriched δ18o values which makes this scenario unlikely another possible explanation is a biochemical constraint the maximal enrichment according to the craig gordon model is only reached at evaporating surfaces craig and gordon 1965 dongmann et al 1974 however bulk leaf water is less enriched because a part of the water in stem xylem from the deeper soil layers can move into the leaf via transpiration flux in re equilibrium conditions sternberg et al 1986 roden et al 2000 this means that not all the free water δ18o of the leaf is subjected to evaporation buhay et al 1996 and this exchange might reinforce the soil water oxygen isotopic signature in plant α cellulose yu et al 2014 although we cannot determine with certainty which of these scenarios best explains the discrepancy it is evident that vascular plants could smooth the high δ18o variability of the source waters 4 5 hydroclimatic significance of δ18o in plant α cellulose the measured shoot δ18ocell values are positively correlated with measured δ18osoil water and δ18oswale water r 0 56 n 15 p 0 03 fig 10 a consistent with other studies e g sternberg et al 2007 mayr et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 loader et al 2016 granath et al 2018 similarly a positive relationship is also observed between measured shoot δ18ocell and modelled δ18osw but the correlation is much better constrained r 0 88 n 10 p 0 001 fig 10b the observed slope is considerably less 0 33 which suggests that the relationship between measured δ18ocell and measured δ18osw is damped this is because the measured δ18osw values of surface swale soil water collected in the field may to some degree be affected by evaporation or only by the input of summer rainfall which would result in the oxygen isotopic values of swale soil water being more scattered however it is possible that the modelled δ18osw values are a genuine reflection of mixed source water that has a major contribution from inflow meltwater and a minor contribution from summer precipitation a negative relationship between root δ18ocell and precipitation δ18o values was observed in the vascular plant dominated peatlands of the southern hemisphere due to seasonal differences in the physiological processes of empodisma spp amesbury et al 2015 however in our study the co variations suggest a tight coupling between external source water and cellulose synthesis implying that the variations in δ18ocell of c pamirensis are mainly controlled by those of δ18o in swale soil waters because of which overridden the influence of other climatic factors such as relative humidity for example δ18ocell at the end of may was more negative which faithfully reflected the more negative measured δ18osw values in spring that are very close to those of winter precipitation and similar results have been reported in the literature zanazzi and mora 2005 royles et al 2013 the relatively higher δ18ocell values observed in late summer may reflect the influence of increasing inputs of summer rainfall on the overall isotopic composition of the source water but the influence of summer precipitation is still very limited in view of the relatively narrow variations of δ18ocell 3 for this specific species the above analysis demonstrates that the variations in δ18o values of swale soil water were primarily controlled by meltwater input that is essentially replenished from winter precipitation fig 3a and fig 8a consequently we conclude that the δ18op signals of precipitation in the winter half year october april are preserved in δ18ocell values of c pamirensis in the peatland in line with expectations the results of the rle mechanistic model are in excellent agreement with our assumption of using the source water except for summer precipitation and leaf water as input values to predict δ18ocell fig 7b or to predict δ18osw via a reverse modelling exercise fig 7a however the underlying assumptions of this model mainly depend on the values used for different fractionation processes and several restrictive conditions waterhouse et al 2002 amesbury et al 2015 first the rle model requires knowledge of the source water used by vascular sedge plants which for c pamirensis in this study is a mixture of meltwater and summer precipitation it follows that if the model is to be used to derive the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation from cellulose oxygen isotopes then knowledge of this mixing is required waterhouse et al 2002 based on the isosource modelling we created a mixed source water using a value based on the mean 76 24 split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs i e δ18osw 0 76δ18omw 0 24δ18op that should be the best predictor of the measured oxygen isotope ratios of plant α cellulose second the predicted values of δ18ocell or δ18osw from the rle model also depend on the time of day at which relative humidity is measured for example waterhouse et al 2002 found that the best fit with observed values of δ18ocell for relative humidity was at 10 00 and 18 00 in our study the values of relative humidity in daytime from 08 00 to 20 00 exhibited the best predicted values for δ18ocell or δ18osw it is suggesting that relative humidity measured in daytime probably provides a better representation of conditions under which the most of the evapotranspiration occurs than values taken during the entire day third εb is reported to fall within the range of 27 3 that has generally been considered to be temperature independent yakir and deniro 1990 however sternberg and ellsworth 2011 found a possible temperature threshold for εb that can up to 31 at temperatures below 10 c in our study the daytime temperature in late spring and summer was above 10 c fig 2a and thus the εb value of 27 3 was adopted which has been widely accepted and applied in many previous studies e g yakir and deniro 1990 aucour et al 1996 ménot combes et al 2002 waterhouse et al 2002 zanazzi and mora 2005 daley et al 2010 yu et al 2011 yu 2013 amesbury et al 2015 fourth the calculated values for εe based on eq 2 fall within a narrow range from 10 5 at 12 c to 9 6 at 22 c using the daytime monitoring data supplementary table s2 there is a relatively large degree of uncertainty in the value of εk ranging from 16 for a turbulent boundary layer dongmann et al 1974 buhay et al 1996 to 28 for a stagnant boundary layer e g aucour et al 1996 ménot combes et al 2002 however the upper limit of 28 5 is arguably an acceptable value given the scale like leaves and dense canopy of vascular plants amesbury et al 2015 the factor of fo was introduced into the model to account for the heterogeneity of the leaf water reservoir and for the alteration of the isotopic composition of carbohydrates due to exchange with xylem water prior to cellulose formation yakir and deniro 1990 roden et al 2000 ménot combes et al 2002 a value of fo of 0 42 is consistent with the range of 0 40 0 45 observed by yakir and deniro 1990 and its use has also been examined in other studies roden et al 2000 sternberg and ellsworth 2011 mora and zanazzi 2017 furthermore there is little variation between different plant tissues 25 8 1 1 for shoots 26 0 1 0 for stems 25 7 0 6 for leaves and 24 5 0 8 for roots and the 24 27 range of δ18ocell values for the target plant falls well within most published ranges e g 27 30 brenninkmeijer et al 1982 24 ménot combes et al 2002 20 25 hong et al 2009 hence at our study site it is unnecessary to separate different vascular plant parts leaves stems and roots due to their indistinguishable δ18ocell values one way anova f 2 58 p 0 117 it can be shown from the above analysis that there are numerous errors and uncertainties in estimating the relationship between plant α cellulose oxygen isotopes and the δ18o of source waters nevertheless the modern calibration approach in our study may allow us to estimate the original δ18osw values from the measured δ18ocell values using the rle mechanistic model and thus to quantitatively reconstruct the paleoclimate and paleohydrology of this alpine peatland 5 conclusions we investigated the hydro climatology δ18o values of α cellulose of c pamirensis and environmental waters during two growing seasons in a vascular plant dominated peatland in the southern altai mountains for this snow ice dominated alpine peatland inflow meltwater is the dominant water source which is ultimately supplied during the winter season october april while the availability of summer precipitation is very much lower since vascular plants primarily used the deeper soil water in the early growing season to synthesize organic matter the isotopic results indicate only a limited effect of evaporation on the external source waters and the strong control of meltwater input on the isotopic composition of swale soil water given a series of ecological constraints the plant α cellulose can smooth the large oxygen isotopic variations in the source waters both measured and modelled data demonstrated that the primary environmental control on δ18ocell values is swale soil water δ18o therefore we conclude that winter precipitation plays the predominant role in determining the δ18ocell values of c pamirensis in the study region our results indicated that we can use the rle mechanistic model to reliably predict the α cellulose oxygen isotopic composition of c pamirensis from that of the potential source waters however several variables are required to be either constant or are known to enable this linear equation to be applied although the external source waters i e soil and swale water formed by the mixing of 76 meltwater and 24 summer precipitation are valid predictors of the cellulose values it is of course the internal plant waters that the plant directly uses to synthesize cellulose in our study the net 18o enrichment factor δ in cellulose caused by enriched leaf water was less variable 11 13 1 07 for δmodelled during the growing season from may to september due to the very limited variation of relative humidity during daytime 08 00 20 00 on the monthly timescale therefore the leaf water isotope study for the vascular plants is essential to specify the degree of evapotranspiration enrichment and its contribution to the δ18o of plant α cellulose further it is possible to reduce underlying uncertainties and provide more valuable information about past source waters if cellulose δd and δ18o values are combined nonetheless our results demonstrate the interesting phenomenon that the isotopic signature of winter precipitation derived inflows into the peatland via stable meltwater flow is recorded by the vascular plants which grow mainly during the summer season this novel finding provides a firm basis for the

extracted from the dominant plant species carex pamirensis and those of potential source waters during two growing seasons from may to september in the sahara sand peatland in the southern altai mountains concurrently the roden lin ehleringer rle mechanistic model was applied to better understand oxygen isotopic fractionation during cellulose synthesis we found that the meltwater from snow ice cover and seasonally frozen soil played a critical role in controlling the hydrological processes in this alpine peatland the δ18o values of both swale water and soil water responded more sensitively to variations in inflow meltwater than did summer precipitation isosource modelling demonstrated that the mean 76 24 split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs determined the overall isotopic composition of the peatland water the slopes of the peatland water line 6 38 and meltwater line 6 87 were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl 7 72 suggesting limited evaporation from these external water sources due to the relatively high humidity 73 80 in the studied fen however the slopes of the stem water line 4 53 and leaf water line 3 57 were generally lower than that of the lmwl indicating that the internal plant waters have experienced isotopic enrichment during transpiration interestingly the variations of δ18ocell of shoots stems and leaves fall within a relatively narrow range 3 which is mainly attributed to a nearly constant monthly net 18o enrichment factor 11 13 1 07 for δmodelled together with a smoothing effect furthermore empirical correlation and rle modeling both showed the co variation of external source water and cellulose synthesis demonstrating that the cellulose oxygen isotope composition of c pamirensis can faithfully reflect variations in soil swale water these findings strongly suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant water source in determining δ18ocell implying that the δ18op signals of precipitation in the winter half year october april may be inherited by the δ18ocell values of c pamirensis at the study site therefore our results provide important insights for the hydroclimatic interpretation of past variations in δ18ocell values in vascular plants in alpine peatlands keywords isotopic hydrology oxygen isotope cellulose meltwater altai mountains 1 introduction the oxygen isotopic composition of α cellulose δ18ocell in tree rings and other fossil plant tissues has been extensively used for retrieving past hydroclimatic information e g an et al 2014 sano et al 2017 mayr et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 because the source water δ18o signal is recorded by δ18ocell samuel and silver 1965 epstein et al 1977 deniro and epstein 1979 initially δ18ocell was recognized as a paleo thermometer libby et al 1976 because of the significant positive correlation between local temperature and the δ18o of precipitation δ18op especially in middle and high latitudes dansgaard 1964 however this linkage is indirect since leaf temperature is only weakly related to ambient temperature helliker and richter 2008 furthermore variations in precipitation amount relative humidity and moisture sources can also influence the source water δ18o values resulting in these signals potentially being preserved in plant α cellulose e g daley et al 2010 an et al 2014 sano et al 2017 in addition to these external environmental factors isotopic fractionation processes occur during cellulose synthesis associated with autotrophic and heterotrophic carbohydrate metabolism which can further modify the original δ18o signal of the source water sternberg and deniro 1983 yakir and deniro 1990 luo and sternberg 1992 this is demonstrated by the position specific effect of oxygen isotope ratios in the glucose units of the cellulose molecule sternberg et al 2006 waterhouse et al 2013 and by the temperature threshold of biochemical oxygen isotope fractionation sternberg and ellsworth 2011 despite the numerous potential influencing factors δ18ocell data from peat deposits has been widely used for paleoclimatic and paleohydrological reconstruction e g brenninkmeijer et al 1982 aucour et al 1996 moschen et al 2009 kaislahti tillman et al 2010 daley et al 2010 jones et al 2014 in these studies sphagnum dominated bogs are the most common study sites because in the case of ombrotrophic peatlands the source water used for plant α cellulose synthesis is derived solely from precipitation ménot combes et al 2002 loader et al 2016 however the use of δ18ocell for paleoclimatic reconstruction in vascular plant dominated peatlands is comparatively limited hong et al 2000 2009 despite their widespread occurrence in mid latitude regions and their great potential for improving our understanding of past climatic changes amesbury et al 2015 even given the same water source the δ18ocell values of vascular and non vascular plants can be quite different largely due to the presence absence of stomata capable of regulating moisture gas exchange ménot combes et al 2002 nichols et al 2010 as a non vascular plant sphagnum does not possess functioning guard cells rydin 1986 and therefore cannot control water loss thus it can potentially provide a direct record of variations in source water δ18o used in cellulose synthesis ménot combes et al 2002 zanazzi and mora 2005 hence sphagnum moss δ18ocell has been interpreted as a proxy for precipitation moisture source daley et al 2010 by comparison the δ18ocell values of vascular sedges in holocene records from chinese herbaceous peats were thought to mainly reflect changes in surface air temperature hong et al 2000 2009 although this view has been reassessed using inverse proxy modelling yu et al 2011 yu 2013 these studies lack the support of modern process studies furthermore comprehensive recent studies proposed that δ18ocell δdcell values have the potential for quantitative reconstruction of hydrological processes zanazzi and mora 2005 mora and zanazzi 2017 therefore additional investigations of the relationship between hydroclimatic processes and δ18ocell in modern peatland plants are clearly needed especially for vascular plant dominated peatlands to better understand peat δ18ocell data hydrological inputs especially summer rainfall or snowmelt or groundwater input temperature and relative humidity in the peatlands must be considered zanazzi and mora 2005 royles et al 2013 loader et al 2016 because these factors can modify δ18ocell values roden et al 2000 waterhouse et al 2002 for example snowmelt shallow groundwater inflow and surface runoff from the surrounding uplands could dominate the hydrological processes of the peatlands and thereby control the isotopic composition of the source water zanazzi and mora 2005 royles et al 2013 in fact this specific hydrological influence could potentially be amplified at high altitudes where winter season precipitation can be stored in snow ice and seasonally frozen soil subsequently during the growing season these solid phase water resources will gradually become available and be mixed with summer precipitation influencing the isotope hydrology of the peatlands it is well known that winter precipitation in such regions has more negative δ18o values than summer precipitation dansgaard 1964 however this isotopic duality of source water caused by meltwater and summer rainfall contributions in vascular plant dominated alpine peatlands has received insufficient attention which limits our understanding of peat δ18ocell data moreover evaporative enrichment is also poorly documented for emergent plants compared with sphagnum and aquatic plants partly because the methods needed to obtain leaf water are complicated and mainly depend on application of the vacuum distillation technique west et al 2006 however process models already provide the possibility of quantifying the evaporative effect based on climatic parameters such as temperature and relative humidity majoube 1971 dongmann et al 1974 roden et al 2000 yu et al 2014 therefore more detailed and systematic observations of both hydrological and local microclimatic conditions in such peatlands can help improve our understanding of the linkage between the δ18o values of source water and plant α cellulose in this study we attempt to evaluate the potential paleoclimatic application of δ18ocell data in a vascular plant dominated alpine peatland of the altai mountains in northwesternmost china to this end we conducted a two year investigation of the relationship between δ18ocell and potential source waters namely inflow meltwater derived from snow and ice cover and seasonally frozen soil precipitation swale water soil water stem water and leaf water we focused solely on the vascular sedge carex pamirensis because this species is dominant in the local plant community fig 1 d and its remains are the main constituents ca 70 80 of the peat deposits of such regions based on pollen and plant macrofossil composition data feng et al 2017 rao et al 2019 thus they enable us to use bulk peat cellulose for paleoclimatic reconstruction zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 our specific aims were as follows 1 to determine the relative contributions of meltwater and summer precipitation taken up by vascular sedge plants during the growing season 2 to determine the effect of evaporative enrichment on plant α cellulose δ18o values during the summer months and 3 to determine whether the variations of source water δ18o values can be captured by the δ18ocell values of c pamirensis in this alpine peatland 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we conducted the study in the sahara sand peatland 48 7 13 5 n 88 21 26 4 e 2450 m a s l which is situated within wuqilike national wetland park in the southern altai mountains northern xinjiang uygur autonomous region northwestern china in arid central asia fig 1a the study area lies in a typical intermontane depression which provides excellent environmental conditions for peat development fig 1b the peat area is 2 km2 whereas the catchment area of the basin is 17 25 km2 thus the peatland is fed mainly by precipitation and surface runoff from the surrounding upland slopes including snowmelt in the early growing season from may to july fig 1c the wetland has a ph of about 5 2 and can be classified as a transitional fen i e intermediate between minerotrophic and ombrotrophic wetland moore and bellamy 1974 the predominant species in this peatland is carex pamirensis accounting for more than 80 of the total above ground biomass fig 1d other species include carex altaica eriophorum scheuchzeri and the moss aulacomnium palustre the climate of the area is characterized by a long cold winter from october to april and a very short cool summer from june to august the annual precipitation from 1971 to 2000 at altay meteorological station 68 km from the peatland 47 44 n 88 05 e 737 m a s l was 191 3 mm with 53 occurring in the winter months from october to april fig 1e the high mountain areas to the northeast receive an annual precipitation of 350 600 mm with a relatively high proportion more than 60 as winter snowfall liu and you 1982 during the growing season from may to september in the peatland the mean temperature is 9 1 c fig 2 a and the relative humidity is as high as 73 80 fig 2b 2 2 field sampling and observations in 2014 we obtained samples of c pamirensis recently grown shoots three potential external source water samples swale water summer precipitation inflow meltwater at plot1 on 24 may 23 june 24 july 25 august and 22 september in 2017 in order to obtain more comprehensive data and to test the potential effect of microtopography on evaporative enrichment we took samples of c pamirensis recently grown shoots older stems and leaves and water samples from multiple sources swale water summer precipitation inflow meltwater outlet water soil water stem water and leaf water at the two locations plot1 and plot2 see fig 1c on 31 may 28 june 30 july 4 august and 25 september at the same time three quadrats of 0 25 m2 area 50 cm 50 cm were deployed at each location monthly to survey the new plant growth and seasonal changes in the above ground biomass of the monodominant community of c pamirensis in the peatland fig 1d and supplementary fig s1 sampling was conducted on sunny days to minimize the influence of recent rainwater at each sampling location at monthly intervals 15 20 living individuals of c pamirensis with similar degrees of maturity and the same height were cut off from the soil surface and different types of plant tissue including recently grown shoots older stems leaves and roots collected only on 25 september 2017 were manually divided and combined into a single sample and then stored in polyethylene bags to collect plant water several samples of living stem leaf and root materials were cut into segments at the same time and immediately placed in eight 10 ml glass tubes which were then sealed with caps and wrapped with parafilm subsequently free water within stems leaves and roots was extracted from these samples using a cryogenic vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china in the laboratory west et al 2006 swale water samples were collected monthly from the pond water reservoir fig 1c placed in a 20 ml vial and wrapped with parafilm soil water samples 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm were obtained monthly by squeezing soil samples at 10 or 20 cm intervals from a 40 cm long peat core using a 10 ml plastic syringe and placed in three 5 ml glass tubes and wrapped with parafilm this simple method can minimize isotopic fractionation and has been widely used in peatlands to obtain samples of soil water from vertical peat profiles as well as moss water samples e g ménot combes et al 2002 zanazzi and mora 2005 nichols et al 2010 amesbury et al 2015 in this study the meltwater samples include accumulated snow on the peatland surface in spring at the end of may and meltwater from snow ice cover and seasonally frozen soil of the surrounding upland slopes in the summer months all are hereafter termed inflow meltwater the solid snow ice samples were collected from several 30 150 cm thick snow pack accumulations on the peatland surface on 27 may 2017 and the liquid meltwater samples were collected monthly from the point of entry of snowmelt streams draining the surrounding sunny and shaded slopes outlet water samples were collected monthly from the export of surface runoff that flowed out of the peatland monthly rainfall samples were collected from a location within 2 km of the peatland using three stainless steel funnels attached to three 5 l plastic containers to each of which 10 mm of paraffin oil was added in advance to prevent evaporation the containers were replaced at the end of each calendar month daley et al 2010 in the field the meltwater and rainwater samples were collected with 10 ml plastic syringes filtered with cameo 0 45 μm nylon and placed in 20 ml vials that were entirely filled with water capped and sealed with a layer of parafilm zanazzi and mora 2005 finally a total of 182 water associated samples and 37 plant samples were stored in an airtight container at 4 c and transported back to the laboratory as quickly as possible in addition local meteoric precipitation samples in summer and winter at altay city 55 km from the peatland at 908 m a s l were collected from may to september 2014 and from march 2017 to may 2018 the liquid water samples were collected immediately after the end of rainfall whereas the solid snowfall samples were melted at room temperature before being sealed in a plastic bottle a total of 85 event based precipitation samples were collected at altay city we also obtained weighted monthly precipitation δd δ18o data from june 2000 to december 2002 at altay station tian et al 2007 which were combined with our monthly mean data in 2014 2017 2018 to provide more information about the seasonal variation of the isotopic composition of precipitation in the region although altay city and the weather station are located at the foot of the mountains fig 1b the two sites are very close to the peatland which reduces the possible influence of an altitude effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation four button sized temperature and relative humidity data loggers ibuttontm maxim integrated dallas tx u s a were installed 1 cm above the vegetation canopy at the two locations to monitor the microclimate the data loggers were shielded by a rubber cap to reduce the effects of wind and direct insolation heating loader et al 2016 and were set to record at 2 h intervals for an entire growing season from 27 may to 24 september in 2017 at the same time 2 h observations of water table depth and water temperature were recorded daily using a pressure transducer hobo u20 water level onset u s a at the four locations plot1 plot2 inlet water and outlet water see fig 1c and summer precipitation events were automatically logged using a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset u s a located 0 8 m above the surface 2 3 cellulose extraction isotopic analyses and statistical methods all plant samples 15 shoots 10 stems 10 leaves 2 roots were washed with pure deionized water using an ultrasonic device freeze dried for 48 h and cut into very small pieces 1 mm with scissors subsequently α cellulose was extracted using a modified standard treatment with acidified sodium chlorite solution and sodium hydroxide loader et al 1997 huang et al 2015 rao et al 2019 briefly lignin was removed by treating the samples with acetic acid and sodium chlorite at 80 c for 1 h the bleaching stage was repeated 6 8 times until the samples were visually pure white after rinsing the samples were treated with 17 sodium hydroxide to remove hemicellulose polysaccharides were removed with 10 sodium hydroxide for 15 min samples were neutralized with 1 hydrochloric acid and then repeatedly rinsed using distilled water finally the α cellulose samples were homogenized by ultrasonic processing and freeze dried for 2 days all water samples were analyzed for stable hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotopic composition using a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i picarro u s a at the key laboratory of western china s environmental systems ministry of education lanzhou university we used the lgr working standard 3a δdvsmow 96 4 0 5 δ18ovsmow 13 1 0 15 lgr

samples a total of 6 repeat measurements were made for each water sample but the mean value of the final three measurements were adopted in our study the isotopic ratios are expressed using the δ notation in per mil relative to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water and the analytical errors were less than 0 1 for δ18o and less than 0 5 for δd dry α cellulose samples ca 0 28 0 30 mg were weighed into silver foil capsules and the δ18o values were measured online with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer at 1350 c coupled with a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer thermo

sigma aldrich buchs germany δ18o 28 2 0 3 and benzoic acid iaea 601 δ18o 23 3 0 3 were used to calibrate the δ18o measurements the δ18o values are reported as per mil deviations from the vsmow standard the δ18o values had acceptable reproducibility with an analytical error of 0 2 to compare δ18o values between two different sets of samples a parametric t test homoscedastic t test was applied with a 5 threshold however when the variances of the samples were non homogeneous then a non parametric test mann whitney u was applied one way analysis of variance anova was used to examine differences between the different parts of the plants and soil water at different depths the least significant difference lsd test was performed to determine the significance of treatment means at p 0 05 all the statistical analyses were performed using spss version 16 0 2 4 model of oxygen isotopic fractionation in cellulose we used the roden lin ehleringer rle mechanistic modeling approach to predict the expected oxygen isotope ratios of plant α cellulose this model involves two major components 1 the biophysical processes leading to the enrichment of the δ18o values in leaf water and 2 the biochemical processes governing the oxygen isotopic exchange between different organic components during cellulose synthesis first the oxygen isotopic composition of leaf water δ18olw can be described by the modified craig gordon model under the isotopic steady state condition craig and gordon 1965 farquhar and gan 2003 given by 1 δ 18 o lw δ 18 o sw ε e ε k δ 18 o atm δ 18 o sw ε k e a e i here δ18osw and δ18oatm are the oxygen isotopic composition of the source water and atmospheric water vapor respectively ea ei is the ratio of ambient vapor pressure to intercellular vapor pressure which can be assumed to be equal to the relative humidity h of the ambient air craig and gordon 1965 dongmann et al 1974 εk is the liquid vapor kinetic enrichment effect which depends on the relative humidity over the evaporating surface and the relative rate of molecular diffusion of 16o and 18o in the leaf boundary layer buhay et al 1996 and εe is the liquid vapor equilibrium effect associated with the leaf water enrichment which can be expressed as a function of absolute temperature t c 273 15 t c in degrees kelvin majoube 1971 yu et al 2011 yu 2013 as follows 2 ε e exp 1137 t 2 0 4156 t 0 0020667 1 1000 assuming the meteoric water is dominated by the well mixed regional air mass that is in equilibrium with the source water then we can use the source water δ18o to estimate the oxygen isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor i e δ18oatm δ18osw εe thus eq 1 can be simplified to 3 δ 18 o lw δ 18 o sw ε e ε k 1 h in addition photosynthesis can increase the leaf cellulose δ18o value by 27 3 during the interaction between carbonyl and leaf water sternberg and deniro 1983 yakir and deniro 1990 the biochemical fractionation factor εb is likely to be temperature insensitive yakir and deniro 1990 despite some evidence to the contrary sternberg and ellsworth 2011 after the original incorporation of leaf water and autotrophic fractionation into photosynthetic sugars secondary fractionation may occur if there is re equilibrium exchange between the synthesized carbohydrate and water within the cell fortunately the physiological and biochemical complexities involving oxygen during cellulose synthesis are well described by the rle mechanistic model roden et al 2000 and can be expressed as 4 δ 18 o cell f o δ 18 o sw ε b 1 f o δ 18 o lw ε b here δ18ocell is the oxygen isotopic composition in cellulose εb 27 3 is the same for autotrophic and heterotrophic fractionation of oxygen yakir and deniro 1990 and fo 0 42 is the proportion of the carbon bound oxygen undergoing exchange with the source water roden et al 2000 combined with eqs 3 and 4 can be simplified to 5 δ 18 o cell δ 18 o sw ε b 1 f o 1 h ε e ε k if we assume that the net 18o enrichment factor 6 δ 1 f o 1 h ε e ε k then δ18ocell can be calculated by 7 δ 18 o cell δ 18 o sw ε b δ finally δ18ocell is reduced to a simple linear function and therefore eq 7 can theoretically be used to evaluate δ18ocell or δ18osw in our study we ran the model for δ18ocell i e δ18ocell δ18osw εb δ and δ18osw i e δ18osw δ18ocell εb δ using our monthly mean measured data of source water δ18o cellulose oxygen isotopes relative humidity and air temperature from may to september modeled oxygen isotope ratios were compared with monthly observed measurements of δ18o i e modeled measured δ18o offset to evaluate the simulation results all the variables defined in the above equations are listed and defined in supplementary table s1 2 5 stable isotope mixing model based on the principles of water balance and isotopic mass conservation a linear mixing model has been established to calculate plant water uptake from different water sources phillips and gregg 2003 in this model at least n isotope systems are used to determine the proportional contributions of n 1 sources to a mixture and thus δd and δ18o are limited to solve plant water uptake from two or three water sources in our study we assumed that the swale soil water for plant root uptake in the peatland was predominantly a mixture of inflow meltwater and summer precipitation namely that the δd and δ18o values of swale soil water were determined by the two potential water sources thus the proportional contributions of the two potential water sources can be estimated by the two source mixing model isosource model phillips and gregg 2003 for one isotope system and two sources the following system of mass balance equations can be solved to determine the proportions f a f b of source isotopic signatures δa δb which coincide with the observed signature of the mixture δm 8 δ m f a δ a f b δ b 9 1 f a f b here δm is swale water soil water 0 40 cm δ a is summer precipitation δ b is inflow meltwater f a is the relative proportion of summer precipitation and f b is the relative proportion of inflow meltwater both of the monthly mean values of measured δd and δ18o data from may to september were used to determine the contribution ratios of the two potential water sources and then the averaged contribution ratios from both hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were taken as the monthly results 3 results 3 1 meteorology and hydrology there was a significant diurnal variability in temperature and relative humidity in the peatland during the growing season from 27 may to 24 september in 2017 fig 2a and 2b within a whole day the mean monthly temperature varied between 4 3 0 34 c and 11 9 1 05 c mean 9 1 0 24 c and the mean monthly relative humidity varied between 73 0 1 92 and 80 4 1 16 mean 77 5 0 19 at daytime 08 00

28 cm mean 15 cm and the water table depth at plot2 ranged from 11 to 32 cm mean 24 cm the range of water table depths for the surface runoff was 12 39 cm inlet water mean 21 cm and 12 75 cm outlet water mean 28 cm fig 2c in addition the mean water temperature during the growing season for plot2 11 32 3 40 c was higher than for plot1 8 17 3 54 c fig 2d this water temperature difference is caused mainly by the microtopography of the two sampling locations plot2 is located on higher ground and is distant from the inflow water source resulting in the surface ponded water at plot2 having a smaller exchangeability with cold meltwater relative to plot1 and making it susceptible to solar radiation heating fig 1c 3 2 source waters the stable isotopic compositions of the different water bodies were significantly different fig 3 precipitation showed a broad range of isotopic composition δ18o ranged from 26 4 to 5 9 and δd ranged from 191 2 to 29 8 the respective mean values of δ18o and δd were 19 0 4 2 and 139 33 7 for winter precipitation october april and 8 4 1 8 and 58 1 13 9 for summer precipitation may september inflow meltwater was characterized by more negative isotopic values compared with other source waters during the growing seasons with δ18o varying between 21 6 and 11 3 and δd between 158 2 and 85 3 the respective mean values were 15 8 2 6 and 115 4 18 the outlet water had slightly higher isotopic values than the inflow meltwater δ18o ranged from 17 6 to 12 2 mean 15 4 1 8 and δd ranged from 128 1 to 90 5 mean 111 7 12 8 soil water 0 40 cm had higher

13 0 to 3 6 and δd from 102 7 to 37 7 the respective averages were 4 8 6 8 and 72 9 25 1 3 3 seasonal variations in oxygen isotopic composition for plant α cellulose shoot δ18ocell had a similar trend of variability during the two growing seasons fig 4 a in 2014 from may to september the δ18ocell values for shoots ranged from 23 9 to 27 2 with a mean of 25 1 1 4 in 2017 the δ18ocell values also had a very narrow range of variability during the growing season 2 3 for shoots 1 6 for leaves and 3 for stems the shoot δ18ocell values ranged from 24 9 to 27 2 mean 26 1 0 7 the stem δ18ocell values from 24 1 to 27 1 mean 26 0 1 0 the leaf δ18ocell values from 25 3 to 26 9 mean 25 7 0 6 and the mean δ18ocell value of roots collected on 25 september 2017 was 24 5 0 8 on the whole there was little difference in δ18ocell between the two years however the mean δ18ocell value of 25 8 0 96 in 2017 was slightly higher than that in 2014 a comparison of the δ18o values of swale and soil water and inflow meltwater reveals similar trends of variation fig 4b in 2014 the δ18o of swale water mean 13 2 1 2 was very close to that of inflow meltwater mean 14 8 1 7 but substantially different to that

source waters fig 4b 3 4 isosource modelling the two source mixing model isosource model showed that the mean relative contribution of inflow meltwater was up to 76 whereas the summer precipitation only accounted for 24 fig 5 notably we also found that the interannual variations in the proportions of winter and summer precipitation could influence the relative contributions of the source water in the peatland in 2013 2014 the relative contribution of inflow meltwater for source water exceeded 80 especially in may june and july while the summer precipitation contributed less than 20 during these months the relatively large proportion of inflow meltwater was mainly contributed by the higher proportion of winter precipitation up to 66 very close to the average for many years fig 1e in 2013 2014 fig 5a by contrast the proportion of winter precipitation accounted for 45 of annual precipitation in 2016 2017 hence the mean relative contribution of summer precipitation during the entire growing season was up to 39 higher than the 16 in 2013 2014 nonetheless the relative contribution of inflow meltwater in the early growing season still comprised a proportion greater than 80 particularly in may and june of 2017 fig 5b 3 5 mechanistic modelling a simple but valid rle mechanistic model namely eq 7 can be used to capture the variations of δ18osw or δ18ocell in the studied alpine peatland first in the case of cellulose synthesis during photosynthesis eq 6 i e δmodelled 1 fo 1 h εe εk allows us to quantitatively estimate the net 18o enrichment factor δ depending on the mean monthly temperature t and a narrow range of mean monthly relative humidity h values in daytime fig 2a and 2b the results can also be examined using a variant of eq 7 i e δcalculated δ18ocell δ18osw εb if the values of δ18ocell and δ18osw are precisely measured the mean value of δmodelled 11 13 1 07 was not statistically different to that of δcalculated mean 11 56 0 89 mann whitney u n 10 p 0 496 which did not include the input values of summer precipitation and leaf water as the source water fig 6 a more importantly the results for the two variants were less variable during the growing season from may to september specifically δmodelled ranged from 10 47 0 18 to 11 87 2 22 and δcalculated ranged from 9 80 0 42 to 12 49 0 04 fig 6b second the modelled δ18osw values mean 12 35 2 05 using shoot δ18ocell as the input values was indistinguishable from the measured δ18osw values in swale water mean 12 34 1 97 homoscedastic t test n 10 p 0 995 and soil water 0 40 cm mean 12 20 1 06 homoscedastic t test n 5 p 0 278 specifically the mean offsets of modelled δ18osw minus measured swale soil water δ18o were much lower than error 1 unfortunately the mean offsets between modelled δ18osw and measured δ18osw in summer precipitation and leaf water had the much larger error of 3 which is an unacceptable error margin fig 7 a and supplementary table s2 on average using inflow meltwater soil water 0 40 cm swale water and stem water as the source water for cellulose synthesis the modelled δ18ocell values were very close to the values of measured δ18ocell fig 7b and supplementary table s3 specifically using soil water 0 40 cm and swale water as the input values for source water resulted in mean modelled measured offsets for δ18ocell values of 1 for shoots and using inflow meltwater and stem water as the source water the mean offsets of δ18ocell values for shoots were 2 however if summer precipitation and leaf water are used as the source water the mean offsets for shoots δ18ocell values are 3 which is also an unacceptable degree of error 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological processes within the studied alpine peatland the continuous observation data from 27 may to 24 september 2017 showed that the water table depth in the peatland was highest during the early growing season and that it gradually declined during subsequent months fig 2c several studies have pointed out that the thawing of snow ice cover and frozen soil has an important effect on hydrological processes in alpine regions e g zhang et al 1985 yang et al 2017 in the study area this is because of the following reasons first due to the influence of the siberian cold air mass and the high altitude the duration of the snowpack can be up to 240 d during the cold season october through may fig 1c and the maximum values of snow ice cover thickness can reach 150 250 cm in the middle mountain regions zhang et al 1985 second the soil begins to freeze at the end of september e g the air temperature fell to below zero in 23 september of 2017 and freezing conditions can persist until the end of july or even later particularly on shaded slopes in addition in the southern altai mountains the thickness of the seasonally frozen soil layer increases with increasing altitude zhang et al 1985 the precipitation storage represented by the snow ice cover within the peatland and distal slopes is rapidly released during snow melting in spring and early summer hence we observed that the highest water table depth occurred at the beginning of the growing season subsequently until early august the water table depth began to decline due to the complete depletion of the snow ice cover surprisingly the inflow water still maintained lower δ18o values even at the end of august and september fig 4b which suggests that the meltwater generated by the seasonally frozen soils on the surrounding upland slopes continued to drain into the peatland probably because of the large ratio 8 6 1 of catchment area to peat area in high mountainous areas extreme rainfall is one of the main forms of summer precipitation that can generate fluctuations in surface runoff in the peatland fig 2c in 2017 summer precipitation accounted for a considerable amount 176 4 mm during the observation period in the peatland but it was mainly derived from five extreme rainfall events for example we clearly observed five of the largest heavy rainfall events 10 mm that occurred on 8 june 10 8 mm 24 25 june 35 4 mm 30 june 2 july 33 2 mm 22 23 august 14 5 mm and 12 september 19 1 mm the five extreme rainfall events accounted for about 64 of total cumulative rainfall during the growing season we also found that the water levels rose rapidly in response to heavy rainfall and then fell abruptly after its cessation the five extreme rainfall events caused the levels of the outlet water to increase by 4 5 cm 30 9 cm 18 2 cm 4 7 cm and 16 3 cm respectively while the water levels declined to normal during the subsequent 16 h 36 h 38 h 20 h and 34 h respectively in addition there were smaller fluctuations in water level within the peatland plot1 and plot2 compared to the surface runoff inlet water and outlet water which suggests that the precipitation from heavy rainfall events drained rapidly into the river therefore the water table depth responded rapidly to the extreme summer rainfall whereas the uninterrupted meltwater input derived from snow ice cover and seasonally frozen soil plays a critical role in controlling the hydrological dynamics especially in the early growing season 4 2 relationships between different source waters there is an apparent temperature effect in δd and δ18o in the altai mountains with enriched values occurring in summer and depleted values in winter fig 3a this is despite the westerlies transport of moisture from the atlantic ocean during summer together with a large proportion ca 45 50 of the moisture in winter from polar regions liu and you 1982 tian et al 2007 the peatland water line δd 6 38 δ18o 13 46 r 0 98 p 0 001 is almost parallel to that of the meltwater line δd 6 87 δ18o 6 78 r 0 99 p 0 001 which implies that the inflow meltwater is likely to be the main water source for the peatland fig 3a the slopes of the peatland water line 6 38 and meltwater line 6 87 are very similar but the intercepts are different this because the peatland water i e swale and soil water as defined here could be affected to some degree by summer rainfall and evaporation compared with precipitation the slopes of the two water lines were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line lmwl slope of 7 72 and the global meteoric water line gmwl slope of 8 and the deviations were probably influenced by sublimation fractionation of the snow ice cover the evaporation of seasonally frozen soil and the minor recharge of summer precipitation yang et al 2017 the isotopic data points except for leaf water collected in june july and august in 2017 are mainly distributed within the range of precipitation and most of the values for soil water swale water and stem water values overlap with those of inflow meltwater and are closer to the values of the winter seasons which indicates substantial replenishment from winter precipitation only seven samples i e swale water and surface soil water collected in june and july 2017 at the location of the plot2 were close to the values of summer precipitation fig 3 and it is possible that the summer rainfall or evaporation effect may have affected the isotopic values of these samples evidently the δ18o values of swale water in 2014 and soil water in 2017 responded more strongly to the variations of inflow meltwater rather than to summer precipitation r 0 72 n 15 p 0 002 figs 4b and 8 a despite the significant positive correlation of the δ18o values of swale water and soil water r 0 99 n 10 p 0 001 fig 8b the δ18o values of the swale water were less negative and had a larger range of variability compared with the soil water fig 3c this seems reasonable since the surface swale water can be more easily influenced by rainwater supply and evaporation from the water air interface for instance we found that the summer rainfall in 2017 182 6 mm was 3 3 times greater than in 2014 55 2 mm fig 5 and thus the greater rainwater input in 2017 may have been responsible for the higher δ18o values of the swale water than was the case in 2014 fig 4b however the deeper soil water was much less influenced by these external factors with the δ18o values of the deeper soil water remaining more homogeneous and negative by virtue of the greater meltwater inflow to the fen zanazzi and mora 2005 in fact the oxygen isotope values for swale soil water were systematically higher than in inflow meltwater fig 4b the higher isotopic values for swale soil water suggest a superimposed contribution of summer rainwater and therefore we speculate that the source water for uptake by vascular sedge plant roots is a mixture of meltwater and summer precipitation the quantitative results from the isosource modelling further showed that the source water inputs are dominated by inflow meltwater formed by winter precipitation the mean input from isosource modelling was 76 with direct summer precipitation having a much smaller influence mean 24 on the overall composition of the source water fig 5 it is worth noting that the mean relative contribution of summer precipitation was up to 39 in 2017 due to the larger proportion of summer precipitation up to 55 during 2016 2017 fig 5b however the effect of summer precipitation on the deep soil water is still limited because the rainwater from the five short duration heavy rainfall events drained rapidly from the surface of the peatland fig 2c in support of this interpretation we found that the δ18o values of deep soil water were considerably lower and closer to the values of inflow meltwater during the entire growing season in 2017 fig 4b on the other hand although the contribution of summer precipitation may increase in the late growing season due to the decrease of the meltwater input fig 5 most of the growth of the living plants would have occurred during the early growing season mainly from may to july supplementary fig s1 and the availability of summer rainfall is very much lower at this time these findings suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant source of water for the alpine peatland while summer precipitation is less important 4 3 effect of evapotranspiration on isotopic fractionation the lmwl meltwater line and peatland water lines are all closely aligned suggesting minimal evaporative isotopic enrichment from those external source waters fig 3a the high relative humidity 73 80 fig 2b of the fen site during the growing season limits the extent of kinetic enrichment that may be caused by evaporation craig and gordon 1965 thus it is reasonable to expect a limited effect of evaporation on the water balance of the ponds in the fen ménot combes et al 2002 a similar phenomenon was observed by wolfe and edwards 1997 in lakes of the western taimyr peninsula rh 70 80 during july and zanazzi and mora 2005 in the wetlands of lake superior rh 74 furthermore the effects of possible evaporation on swale soil water will to some degree be offset by mixing with meltwater and summer rainfall during the growing season ménot combes et al 2002 thus extremely enriched isotopic values were not observed for these external source waters in our sampling regimes fig 4b however the slopes of the stem water line 4 53 and the leaf water line 3 57 are at an angle i e they have a lower slope compared to the lmwl 7 72 indicating that the internal plant waters especially leaf water have been subjected to substantial evaporative enrichment fig 3a in general there is no isotopic fractionation by the roots during water uptake until the water reaches the leaves or non suberized stems undergoing water loss ehleringer and dawson 1992 as a result compared to swale soil water leaf water experienced apparent isotopic enrichment during transpiration due to equilibrium and kinetic effects farquhar and gan 2003 however stem water was less enriched in δ18o and δd relative to leaf water mainly because the water within stem xylem did not experience extreme isotopic fractionation during water transport ehleringer and dawson 1992 the slight enrichment of the stem water may result from the fact that little non suberized stem tissue was collected during sampling accordingly the δ18o and δd variations of swale soil water especially for deeper soil water can directly reflect that of precipitation but not the plant water in the peatland in fact free water δ18o within the leaf could be easily influenced by the relative humidity during plant transpiration dongmann et al 1974 and subsequently the incorporation of the isotopic enrichment of leaf water into organic compounds affects the δ18o values of plant α cellulose during biosynthesis yakir and deniro 1990 roden et al 2000 according to eqs 6 and 7 decreasing relative humidity can lead to increasing δ and δ18ocell values interestingly there was little seasonal variation of the mean monthly relative humidity in daytime 08 00 20 00 rh 47 58 fig 2b to quantify its impact on the studied plant species based on eqs 6 and 7 we can demonstrate that the low variability of δ18ocell values 3 fig 4a mainly results from the nearly constant net 18o enrichment factor δ during the growing season 11 13 1 07 for δmodelled and 11 56 0 89 for δcalculated fig 6 this lower variability of the net 18o enrichment factor on the monthly timescale 3 has important implications for paleoclimatic studies based on cellulose oxygen isotopes in the alpine peatland 4 4 variability of the oxygen isotopes the δ18o values for the temporal i e related to seasonality and spatial i e related to microtopography datasets showed that the total variability of source waters was considerably greater than that of the cellulose values figs 4 and 9 for instance swale water δ18o varied by close to 6 5 and leaf water by up to 15 7 both of which are larger than the fluctuations in δ18ocell 3 there are several possible hypotheses explaining the discrepancy between the isotopic variability in water and the corresponding response in the plant a possible scenario which could account for this narrow range of δ18ocell values involves an averaging effect in which a given cellulose sample reflects plant tissue growth over several weeks or even a few months zanazzi and mora 2005 mora and zanazzi 2017 in other words plant α cellulose can integrate the large variations observed in source water isotopic compositions over a long period and thus more closely reflect the average isotopic composition of the source water ménot combes et al 2002 daley et al 2010 such high variability of δ18o in the source waters mainly reflects transient climatic features during our sampling campaign while these attributes would be dampened in plant α cellulose another possibility involves an ecological scenario in which the root system of vascular plants withdraws water from deeper within the soil layer 20 40 cm and this deeper soil water is much more homogeneous in its isotopic composition than the surface swale water fig 4b as a result the vascular sedge plants are less likely to experience fluctuating δ18oswale values resulting from episodic evaporative enrichment that could only occur within swale water campbell and williamson 1997 ménot combes et al 2002 price et al 2009 alternatively the low variability of the δ18ocell values could be the result of the ecology of c pamirensis the preferred habitat of this emergent species is a perennial stagnant water microenvironment average water level 15 cm and more than half of the plant tissue i e roots stems and parts of leaves grows completely submerged thereby decreasing the possible effect of evaporation on δ18ocell values zanazzi and mora 2005 nichols et al 2010 however the leaf water and stem water have more enriched δ18o values which makes this scenario unlikely another possible explanation is a biochemical constraint the maximal enrichment according to the craig gordon model is only reached at evaporating surfaces craig and gordon 1965 dongmann et al 1974 however bulk leaf water is less enriched because a part of the water in stem xylem from the deeper soil layers can move into the leaf via transpiration flux in re equilibrium conditions sternberg et al 1986 roden et al 2000 this means that not all the free water δ18o of the leaf is subjected to evaporation buhay et al 1996 and this exchange might reinforce the soil water oxygen isotopic signature in plant α cellulose yu et al 2014 although we cannot determine with certainty which of these scenarios best explains the discrepancy it is evident that vascular plants could smooth the high δ18o variability of the source waters 4 5 hydroclimatic significance of δ18o in plant α cellulose the measured shoot δ18ocell values are positively correlated with measured δ18osoil water and δ18oswale water r 0 56 n 15 p 0 03 fig 10 a consistent with other studies e g sternberg et al 2007 mayr et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 loader et al 2016 granath et al 2018 similarly a positive relationship is also observed between measured shoot δ18ocell and modelled δ18osw but the correlation is much better constrained r 0 88 n 10 p 0 001 fig 10b the observed slope is considerably less 0 33 which suggests that the relationship between measured δ18ocell and measured δ18osw is damped this is because the measured δ18osw values of surface swale soil water collected in the field may to some degree be affected by evaporation or only by the input of summer rainfall which would result in the oxygen isotopic values of swale soil water being more scattered however it is possible that the modelled δ18osw values are a genuine reflection of mixed source water that has a major contribution from inflow meltwater and a minor contribution from summer precipitation a negative relationship between root δ18ocell and precipitation δ18o values was observed in the vascular plant dominated peatlands of the southern hemisphere due to seasonal differences in the physiological processes of empodisma spp amesbury et al 2015 however in our study the co variations suggest a tight coupling between external source water and cellulose synthesis implying that the variations in δ18ocell of c pamirensis are mainly controlled by those of δ18o in swale soil waters because of which overridden the influence of other climatic factors such as relative humidity for example δ18ocell at the end of may was more negative which faithfully reflected the more negative measured δ18osw values in spring that are very close to those of winter precipitation and similar results have been reported in the literature zanazzi and mora 2005 royles et al 2013 the relatively higher δ18ocell values observed in late summer may reflect the influence of increasing inputs of summer rainfall on the overall isotopic composition of the source water but the influence of summer precipitation is still very limited in view of the relatively narrow variations of δ18ocell 3 for this specific species the above analysis demonstrates that the variations in δ18o values of swale soil water were primarily controlled by meltwater input that is essentially replenished from winter precipitation fig 3a and fig 8a consequently we conclude that the δ18op signals of precipitation in the winter half year october april are preserved in δ18ocell values of c pamirensis in the peatland in line with expectations the results of the rle mechanistic model are in excellent agreement with our assumption of using the source water except for summer precipitation and leaf water as input values to predict δ18ocell fig 7b or to predict δ18osw via a reverse modelling exercise fig 7a however the underlying assumptions of this model mainly depend on the values used for different fractionation processes and several restrictive conditions waterhouse et al 2002 amesbury et al 2015 first the rle model requires knowledge of the source water used by vascular sedge plants which for c pamirensis in this study is a mixture of meltwater and summer precipitation it follows that if the model is to be used to derive the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation from cellulose oxygen isotopes then knowledge of this mixing is required waterhouse et al 2002 based on the isosource modelling we created a mixed source water using a value based on the mean 76 24 split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs i e δ18osw 0 76δ18omw 0 24δ18op that should be the best predictor of the measured oxygen isotope ratios of plant α cellulose second the predicted values of δ18ocell or δ18osw from the rle model also depend on the time of day at which relative humidity is measured for example waterhouse et al 2002 found that the best fit with observed values of δ18ocell for relative humidity was at 10 00 and 18 00 in our study the values of relative humidity in daytime from 08 00 to 20 00 exhibited the best predicted values for δ18ocell or δ18osw it is suggesting that relative humidity measured in daytime probably provides a better representation of conditions under which the most of the evapotranspiration occurs than values taken during the entire day third εb is reported to fall within the range of 27 3 that has generally been considered to be temperature independent yakir and deniro 1990 however sternberg and ellsworth 2011 found a possible temperature threshold for εb that can up to 31 at temperatures below 10 c in our study the daytime temperature in late spring and summer was above 10 c fig 2a and thus the εb value of 27 3 was adopted which has been widely accepted and applied in many previous studies e g yakir and deniro 1990 aucour et al 1996 ménot combes et al 2002 waterhouse et al 2002 zanazzi and mora 2005 daley et al 2010 yu et al 2011 yu 2013 amesbury et al 2015 fourth the calculated values for εe based on eq 2 fall within a narrow range from 10 5 at 12 c to 9 6 at 22 c using the daytime monitoring data supplementary table s2 there is a relatively large degree of uncertainty in the value of εk ranging from 16 for a turbulent boundary layer dongmann et al 1974 buhay et al 1996 to 28 for a stagnant boundary layer e g aucour et al 1996 ménot combes et al 2002 however the upper limit of 28 5 is arguably an acceptable value given the scale like leaves and dense canopy of vascular plants amesbury et al 2015 the factor of fo was introduced into the model to account for the heterogeneity of the leaf water reservoir and for the alteration of the isotopic composition of carbohydrates due to exchange with xylem water prior to cellulose formation yakir and deniro 1990 roden et al 2000 ménot combes et al 2002 a value of fo of 0 42 is consistent with the range of 0 40 0 45 observed by yakir and deniro 1990 and its use has also been examined in other studies roden et al 2000 sternberg and ellsworth 2011 mora and zanazzi 2017 furthermore there is little variation between different plant tissues 25 8 1 1 for shoots 26 0 1 0 for stems 25 7 0 6 for leaves and 24 5 0 8 for roots and the 24 27 range of δ18ocell values for the target plant falls well within most published ranges e g 27 30 brenninkmeijer et al 1982 24 ménot combes et al 2002 20 25 hong et al 2009 hence at our study site it is unnecessary to separate different vascular plant parts leaves stems and roots due to their indistinguishable δ18ocell values one way anova f 2 58 p 0 117 it can be shown from the above analysis that there are numerous errors and uncertainties in estimating the relationship between plant α cellulose oxygen isotopes and the δ18o of source waters nevertheless the modern calibration approach in our study may allow us to estimate the original δ18osw values from the measured δ18ocell values using the rle mechanistic model and thus to quantitatively reconstruct the paleoclimate and paleohydrology of this alpine peatland 5 conclusions we investigated the hydro climatology δ18o values of α cellulose of c pamirensis and environmental waters during two growing seasons in a vascular plant dominated peatland in the southern altai mountains for this snow ice dominated alpine peatland inflow meltwater is the dominant water source which is ultimately supplied during the winter season october april while the availability of summer precipitation is very much lower since vascular plants primarily used the deeper soil water in the early growing season to synthesize organic matter the isotopic results indicate only a limited effect of evaporation on the external source waters and the strong control of meltwater input on the isotopic composition of swale soil water given a series of ecological constraints the plant α cellulose can smooth the large oxygen isotopic variations in the source waters both measured and modelled data demonstrated that the primary environmental control on δ18ocell values is swale soil water δ18o therefore we conclude that winter precipitation plays the predominant role in determining the δ18ocell values of c pamirensis in the study region our results indicated that we can use the rle mechanistic model to reliably predict the α cellulose oxygen isotopic composition of c pamirensis from that of the potential source waters however several variables are required to be either constant or are known to enable this linear equation to be applied although the external source waters i e soil and swale water formed by the mixing of 76 meltwater and 24 summer precipitation are valid predictors of the cellulose values it is of course the internal plant waters that the plant directly uses to synthesize cellulose in our study the net 18o enrichment factor δ in cellulose caused by enriched leaf water was less variable 11 13 1 07 for δmodelled during the growing season from may to september due to the very limited variation of relative humidity during daytime 08 00 20 00 on the monthly timescale therefore the leaf water isotope study for the vascular plants is essential to specify the degree of evapotranspiration enrichment and its contribution to the δ18o of plant α cellulose further it is possible to reduce underlying uncertainties and provide more valuable information about past source waters if cellulose δd and δ18o values are combined nonetheless our results demonstrate the interesting phenomenon that the isotopic signature of winter precipitation derived inflows into the peatland via stable meltwater flow is recorded by the vascular plants which grow mainly during the summer season this novel finding provides a firm basis for the

6584,climate change and urbanization are currently leading to a warming of the subsurface worldwide with yet unforeseen consequences for groundwater quality the temperature sensitivity of chemical and biological processes suggests that small temperature changes driven by current warming should have a detectable effect on the ecology of aquifers and the composition of groundwater itself but field observations covering temperatures that are environmentally relevant are sparse the analysis of a large data set provides field scale evidence that within the naturally occurring temperature range between 5 and 20 c temperature affects the quality of groundwater a difference in temperature of 1 k is linked to a 4 decline in oxygen saturation and a ph drop of 0 02 due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide further warmer groundwater shows signs of enhanced mineral weathering and higher concentrations of drinking water relevant elements such as manganese the observed trends in groundwater quality are consistent with a temperature associated intensification of microbial metabolic rates and enhanced organic matter mineralization at warmer temperatures either within the aquifers or in the overlying soils a times series analysis reveals that soil and groundwater temperatures in the studied area have been increasing at a rate of 0 1 0 4 k per decade comparable to recent global warming driving subtle but distinct changes in groundwater ph and oxygen concentrations the results confirm that certain but central aspects of groundwater quality ph o2 pco2 mn doc change due to warming

globally used irrigation water is subtracted from groundwater siebert et al 2010 wwap 2009 the use of groundwater as a resource for different proposes critically depends on the amount and quality of the available groundwater while quantitative projections of the future availability of groundwater have been developed famiglietti 2014 rodell et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 projections of future groundwater quality are far from being realized many factors affect groundwater quality such as land use and land use change aquifer lithology or soil type which have been subject to past studies e g appelo and postma 2005 böhlke 2002 chapelle 2005 hansen et al 2018 scanlon et al 2005 but the effect of warming on the chemical composition of groundwater remains poorly quantified bates et al 2008 green et al 2011 klove et al 2014 lipczynska kochany 2018a sophocleous 2004 taniguchi et al 2007 this is surprising because temperature regulates key biological and chemical processes that affect the cycling of oxygen carbon and other elements in soil and groundwater examples of such temperature dependent processes are microbial respiration and growth rates mineral solubility s and diffusion rates of solutes in water addy et al 2016 appelo and postma 2005 jørgensen et al 2009 lloyd and taylor 1994 price and sowers 2004 most of the presently available knowledge on temperature associated changes in groundwater quality is derived from studies on geothermal energy use subsurface heat storage using primarily laboratory batch and column experiments in the temperature range between 0 and 100 c these studies concluded that temperature related changes in groundwater composition are only significant for temperatures 40 c except for as which was already mobilized at moderate temperature increases bonte et al 2013 brons et al 1991 griebler et al 2016 however a recent in situ subsurface heating experiment showed that even small temperature changes below 25 c may already have an impact on groundwater quality although the study was hampered by strong groundwater level fluctuations it found that a warming of the aquifer by only 7 k leads to observable changes in the concentration of elements and substances such as mg si li and ammonium saito et al 2016 more evidence for a temperature control on aquifer biogeochemistry comes from studies on the fate of organic matter and organic pollutants enhanced desorption of organic compounds such as natural organic matter or organic contaminants from soils and sediments has been observed as a result of increasing temperatures brons et al 1991 kaiser et al 2001 wang et al 2010 a warming induced increase in the solubility of pollutants either directly or by increasing the solubility of natural organic matter which in turn enhances the solubility of pollutants via complexation may therefore also be expected bloomfield et al 2006 sposito and weber 1986 the temperature induced mobilization of humic substances may further add to higher rates of pollutant degradation by stimulating microbial activity lipczynska kochany 2018b higher temperatures may also directly accelerate degradation of organic pollutants in groundwater for example an increase in reductive dechlorination after an increase of in situ temperatures from 10 to 25 c has been reported by ni et al 2015 further thermodynamic data suggests that concentrations of inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals should decrease with warming with the exception of those occurring as anions such as arsenic providing some evidence that temperature increases may be beneficial for water quality bonte et al 2014 temperature changes may also have an impact on the redox chemistry of groundwater for example in a set of column experiments warming from 10 to 70 c resulted in a shift of the observed redox conditions as the biogeochemical conditions changed from oxic respiration to iron and sulfate reduction jesußek et al 2013 there is also evidence that groundwater redox chemistry may be sensitive to natural temperature fluctuations of only a few degrees in a study on 65 groundwater samples from chihuahua mexico a moderately significant negative correlation between temperature and oxidation reduction potential has been observed prieto amparan et al 2018 studies on the influence of seasonally varying temperatures of surface waters recharging aquifers during bank filtration in france and germany found a positive correlation between temperature and mn concentrations as well as a negative correlation between temperature and oxygen concentrations bourg and bertin 2002 massmann et al 2008 other evidence from laboratory studies suggests that biological processes are easily affected by temperature changes warming of only a few degrees may already lead to a change in the microbial community structure and groundwater fauna brielmann et al 2009 however global warming will not only lead to temperature changes within aquifers anderson 2005 taniguchi et al 2007 it may also alter biogeochemical cycles in soils overlying the aquifers because recharge connects soil water with groundwater temperature induced changes in soil water chemistry should become detectable in the composition of groundwater in the long run although the exact response of the soil microbial community to warming is a matter of discussion there is ample evidence that warming may stimulate microbial respiration davidson and janssens 2006 it can be expected that the current increase in soil heterotrophic respiration bond lamberty et al 2018 will inevitably change the cycling of soil carbon and other elements in soils for example by increasing dissolved organic carbon production lipczynska kochany 2018a however other consequences of climate change such as changes in soil moisture and atmospheric co2 may strongly modulate the microbial response to warming castro et al 2010 especially soil moisture impacts microbial activity and the anticipated changes in global hydrological cycles huntington 2006 may therefore modify the response of soil microbial communities to warming to some extend mandal and neenu 2012 overall the findings

groundwater recharge varies generally recharge is highest in winter and spring when soils are saturated the geological setting of the study area shows a large variety of hydrogeological units fig 1 supplementary table s1 groundwater samples were taken from wells and springs located in a diverse range of geological units major hydrogeological units comprise fractured paleozoic rocks magmatic and metamorphic a mesozoic series of carbonate rocks and porous sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated cenozoic sediments groundwater chemistry shows a large variety as a result of the different hydrogeological settings i groundwater in paleozoic aquifers that mostly consist of igneous predominantly granitic and metamorphic rocks is slightly acidic and shows low mineralization ii groundwater in mesozoic and quaternary aquifers is mildly mineralized and mostly of the ca hco3 type evaporitic triassic rocks host waters of the ca so4 type as well as na cl rich waters the average groundwater

subject to elevated geothermal gradients in the upper few kilometers of the continental crust which did not show any effect on the here observed temperature distributions within the upper 40 m no apparent differences between shallow and deeper groundwater exists in the data set used except that deeper groundwater depth to groundwater table 30 m appears to be somewhat colder as compared to shallower groundwater supplementary fig s5 notably groundwaters sampled from fractured rocks in the regions with predominately mesozoic rocks usually exhibit somewhat lower temperatures probably because of a shorter residence time as compared to sandy quaternary aquifers 2 2 data analysis to quantify the effects of temperature and of temperature changes on groundwater quality data from a

in groundwater riedel and kübeck 2018 the monitoring network consists of a total of 2 021 sampling sites resulting in an observational density of 1 location per 20 km 2 fig 1 most sampling locations are monitoring wells or wells used for groundwater abstraction to produce drinking water about 530 locations are springs which have been excluded from the original analysis and were analyzed separately two types of springs emerge in the study area which can be separated using electric conductivity supplementary fig s4 springs with electric conductivities equal to or higher than 30 ms m 1 were defined as high mineralization springs accordingly springs with less than 30 ms m 1 were defined as low mineralization springs in this respect the terms high and low were chosen arbitrarily simply to distinguish between the two populations the data is part of a continuous groundwater quality monitoring and covers samples taken between january 2000 and december 2015 most locations were sampled two to six times per year however only samples taken during summer sampling campaigns july august were used in this study because they provide the most continuous record of groundwater temperature and quality samples from other periods of the year were taken less frequently as compared to the summer sampling campaigns and have therefore not been considered for the present analysis in order to avoid a potential bias in the data due to seasonality and sampling frequency for all samples oxygen ph conductivity and temperature data is available the parameters were immediately determined in the field during continuous pumping in addition for each sampling location well or spring at least one full scale analysis of the major ion chemistry was available in addition to the temperature ph and oxygen data allowing to investigate the relation between temperature and water quality in unprecedented detail all parameters were analyzed using iso international organization for standardization standardized methods the calculation of dissolved pco2 is derived from measurements of ph temperature and alkalinity appelo and postma 2005 samples outside the temperature range from 5 to 20 c were not considered because the low abundance would have not enabled a statistically sound analysis supplementary fig s3 in a first step the data set was used to establish a relation between groundwater temperature and composition based on data that is available for 1486 wells if more than one analysis was available for a given sampling location results were averaged to remove a potential bias towards the more frequently analyzed locations a linear regression model was then fitted to the data using matlab s mathworks 2013 polyfit function a test for the level of significance for each regression was performed using the corrcoef function significant results were defined for p values of less than 0 001 johnson 2013 in a second step a time series analysis was conducted using sampling locations with a continuous record of t oxygen concentrations and ph values from 2000 to 2015 for the time dependent analysis a data set including all observations was constructed again only data from the summer sampling campaigns was considered in order to remove a bias towards seasonality to facilitate comparison between the different sampling sites all of the t ph and oxygen saturation data of each time series were normalized to the respective average of a time series a linear regression model was then fitted to the time series data the resulting trends are expressed as change in value of parameter per year some samples exhibited concentrations of dissolved manganese fluoride dissolved organic carbon doc oxygen or potassium which were below the limit of quantification loq all values below the reported limit of quantification were censored to the reported loq to create a consistent data set this did not affect the presentation and interpretation of the data because the loq was always below the 5th quantile of all samples i e no more than 5 of the samples had concentrations of a certain parameter below the loq however by doing so gradients calculated on basis of the regression analysis were slightly lower as compared to other ways of data censoring such as replacing data below the loq with values of zero or with values of half the loq the estimated trends are therefore more conservative as gradients might be steeper than the ones reported here the list of loqs is shown in supplementary table s2 daily soil temperatures from three locations within the study area hosted by the deutsche wetterdienst offenbach germany were available for the years from 1970 to 2017 station1 bad mergentheim station 2 stuttgart station 3 freiburg the location of the respective stations is indicted in fig 1 the soil temperature was measured in 5 cm depth yearly values were obtained by averaging the daily observations for each year 3 results and discussion within the temperature range between 5 c and 20 c consistent trends in groundwater chemistry are observed groundwater sampled in wells was associated with lower ph values and lower oxygen saturations at higher temperatures as compared to groundwater with lower temperatures fig 2 ordinary least square regression analysis shows that a temperature difference of 1 k is on average accompanied by a difference of 4 for oxygen saturation and a ph drop by 0 02 units fig 2 dissolved organic carbon doc potassium fluoride manganese silicium and pco2 show the opposite trend i e values commonly increase at higher temperatures fig 2 groundwater sampled at springs generally exhibited cooler temperatures with an average of 9 c for comparison groundwater sampled in wells shows an average temperature of 12 5 c which is close to the average yearly air temperature of 9 5 c in the study area springs with high mineralization showed similar temperature associated changes in groundwater composition as compared to wells supplementary fig s1 also springs with low mineralization showed similar results to wells with the exception of pco2 and ph supplementary fig s2 this has been expected because springs with low mineralization often occur in terrains with fractured rocks springer and stevens 2009 where contact time with aquifer material is short and groundwater often is in contact with the atmosphere allowing rapid outgassing of co2 this time independent analysis can be validated by the predictions made from the findings rising temperatures increase concentrations of doc and potassium at a rate of 0 04 and 0 75 mg l 1 k 1 respectively this is comparable to those concentration changes observed during a recent subsurface heating and cooling experiment saito et al 2016 the time dependent analysis reveals a similar picture groundwater sampled at wells and springs showed significant increases in temperature in the study area table 1 the rate of temperature change is comparable to the rate of global warming during the past decades of 0 02 k yr 1 xu et al 2018 while temperature increased oxygen saturations and ph values decreased table 1 albeit the relatively short period of time 16 years the analysis shows that changes in groundwater chemistry due to warming are detectable in the present data set and follow patterns comparable to those observed in the time independent analysis fig 2 interestingly the observed temperature increases are comparable in magnitude to the increases observed in the upper soil at three different sites within the study area fig 3 this suggests that warming of the shallow subsurface is responsible for the observed temperature trends in groundwater notably t increases are higher in groundwater sampled at springs as compared to groundwater sampled in wells table 1 especially the temperature increase of 0 03 k yr 1 observed in springs is almost similar to the temperature changes of 0 03 0 04 k yr 1 observed in the upper soil horizons in the study area fig 3 this was an expected finding because springs often respond rather quickly to environmental changes because of the relatively short residence times of groundwater discharging at springs jyväsjärvi et al 2015 springer and stevens 2009 the observed temperature dependent trends in groundwater composition likely result from a number of different processes first microbial respiration is temperature dependent lloyd and taylor 1994 price and sowers 2004 absolute respiration rates are not available for the study site but temperature dependent changes in relative respiration rates generally show uniform trends across ecosystems and climates in soil and groundwater i e respiration rates commonly increase by a factor of approximately 3 to 4 when temperature increases from 5 to 20 c addy et al 2016 lloyd and taylor 1994 jørgensen et al 2009 higher respiration rates are well reflected by lower oxygen saturations as well as the greater accumulation of co2 in warmer groundwater as compared to colder groundwater fig 2 second as oxygen concentrations decrease an increase of doc concentrations is observed the relation between doc and t in wells is only moderately significant p 0 05 but is well supported the findings of previous research sorption of dissolved organic matter to soil material is temperature sensitive at higher temperatures a thermally induced mobilization of doc from the mineral matrix occurs which increases its availability as a microbial substrate brons et al 1991 kaiser et al 2001 as a result oxygen is increasingly depleted via microbial respiration whereas concentrations of manganese subsequently increase owing to a shift towards more reducing conditions a similar shift towards more reducing conditions as indicated by lower oxidation reduction potentials has been found in groundwater from an agricultural area in mexico prieto amparan et al 2018 the doc released appears to be more aromatic at higher temperatures because the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva measured as the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to the doc concentration also increases with 0 06 l mg 1 m 1 k 1 in wells p 0 001 data not shown one possible explanation is that the solubility of aromatic organic carbon increases with temperature another is that microbial respiration preferentially mineralizes non aromatic organic carbon leaving behind a more refractory aromatic carbon warmer groundwater was also associated with higher si k and f concentrations the latter being a groundwater contaminant of concern in several regions of the world these observations are attributed to an intensification of mineral dissolution for example feldspar dissolution which releases si and k is a function of temperature with higher dissolution rates occurring at higher temperatures welch and ullman 2000 dissolution rates at 20 c determined under abiotic conditions in the laboratory are two to three times higher than at 5 c welch and ullman 2000 warmer temperatures should thus lead to an enhanced release of k and si to groundwater from mineral dissolution the total concentration of k and si in solution will then only be limited by the subsequent formation of secondary minerals in addition the observed increase of pco2 in groundwater with increasing t suggests that more carbonic acid is present in warmer groundwater which is likely to further enhance mineral weathering hansen et al 2018 it is worth noting that the here observed trends are the result of biogeochemical processes in the soil groundwater continuum most groundwater recharge occurs after water has percolated through a soil kindler et al 2011 because shallow groundwater temperatures 30 m are mostly a function of the land surface temperature benz et al 2017 it is possible that some of the here observed trends point to temperature dependent biogeochemical processes that occurred prior to recharge in the soils overlying the respective aquifers this would mainly have consequences for the flux of gaseous components to groundwater for example soil warming results in an enhanced release of co2 some of which is dissolved in soil solution to form carbonic acid which either reacts with minerals or eventually recharges to groundwater kindler et al 2011 warmer recharge temperatures have indeed been found to correlate with groundwater pco2 jurgens et al 2010 however not all of the co2 released in soils by microbial respiration gets dissolved instead it rather directly emits to the atmosphere thus the exchange of soil air with the atmosphere limits the flux of co2 to groundwater another factor to consider when interpreting the results is irrigation recharge occurs primarily during the winter month in the study area when recharge is artificially increased in the warmer growing season due to enhanced irrigation in agricultural areas the composition and temperature of the soil water recharging to groundwater will change during the summer month more co2 is present in soils due to the combined effects of microbial and root respiration as a result irrigation of agriculturally used land in summer leads to the recharge of warmer water with more co2 dissolved in it hansen et al 2018 jurgens et al 2010 in these cases the relation between temperature and groundwater quality is the result of an increase in the proportion of recharge during the warmer summer month however irrigation is more pronounced in arid regions in the here studied area irrigation is currently not expected to play a major role although irrigation demand may increase in the future in summary because processes in soil cannot unambiguously be separated from those in groundwater with the currently available data the present study essentially identifies the cumulative effects of both one constraint of this study is that it is limited to a small region in central europe it remains to be seen if aquifers in other hydroclimatic settings respond similarly to temperature changes however the observed relation between certain groundwater quality parameters and temperature is statistically robust and in line with other studies from mexico and japan prieto amparan et al 2018 saito et al 2016 therefore the results add to the growing body of evidence that small temperature changes likely have a detectable effect on groundwater quality but the scatter in the data is large fig 2 because numerous other factors also influence the chemical composition of groundwater such as land use soil type and local geology for example urbanization influences groundwater quality not only by warming the subsurface urban heat island but also via other aspects such as pollution with nutrients salts or organic contaminants bruce and mcmahon 1996 hansen et al 2018 hobbie et al 2017 scanlon et al 2005 agriculturally used land receives large amounts of nutrients including k which eventually accumulates in soil and groundwater böhlke 2002 scanlon et al 2005 aquifer lithology is also important because the presence or absence of minerals as well as their solubilities dictates the ion composition of groundwater appelo and postma 2005 chapelle 2005 differences in mineral abundances in the diverse geological settings of the studied area fig 1 likely explain the scatter of the si k and f data finally water table depth has a large influence on the redox chemistry of groundwater shallow water table depths are often associated with higher doc and mn concentrations and lower oxygen concentrations as compared to deeper water tables pabich et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2019 it should further be noted that besides the here discussed increases in groundwater temperatures numerous other consequences of climate change and urbanization are expected that may also influence groundwater quality green et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 for example climate change induced changes in the hydrological cycle will lead to shifting recharge patterns taylor et al 2013 a shift of the timing of recharge in regions where soil microbial activity and vegetation show a pronounced seasonality may have an impact on the chemical composition of groundwater as well changes in soil moisture availability itself may also have an impact soil microbial community structure and activity castro et al 2010 droughts sea level rise and perhaps changes in vegetation may differently affect soil water and groundwater quality currently there are many different aspects of climate change besides warming whose effects on groundwater quality are difficult to predict hence there is a need for more studies dealing with the impact of hydroclimatic changes on soil water and groundwater quality 4 conclusions the analysis of a large data set provides evidence for a biogeochemical link between subsurface temperature and groundwater quality several implications arise from this observation with respect to a potential warming of soil and groundwater first groundwater biota i e stygobiotic organisms are sensitive to ambient conditions in groundwater and only thrive at high oxygen levels dole olivier et al 2009 maurice and bloomfield 2012 because oxygen is crucial for groundwater fauna a decrease in oxygen concentrations due to warming will turn some aquifers uninhabitable for these organisms second when groundwater is used as a resource for drinking water production in some cases quality deteriorations will make additional efforts for purification necessary lipczynska kochany 2018a for example increases in doc and mn will necessarily require higher dosages of flocculants to reduce the risk of microbial contamination to prevent the deposition of manganese oxides in drinking water distribution systems and to keep mn concentrations below guideline values this is further illustrated in fig 4 the fraction of samples with mn concentrations above the guideline value for drinking water in germany steadily increases from less than 10 to more than 30 in the temperature range between 5 and 20 c also formation of disinfection byproducts will increase at elevated doc concentrations when chlorine is used for disinfection further acidification due to elevated pco2 requires degassing neutralization in order to ensure that the produced drinking water is non corrosive third increases in weathering rates increase the salinity of groundwater which may enhance the problem of soil salinization in arid regions where irrigation demand is high hansen et al 2018 groundwater temperatures are expected to rise locally as well as globally as a result of urbanization and global warming bates et al 2008 beltrami et al 2006 huang et al 2000 menberg et al 2013 taniguchi et al 2007 modelling results indicate that increases of 3 4 k in shallow groundwater are possible within the next decades taylor and stefan 2009 additionally local temperature gradients of 3 7 k are observed underneath larger cities menberg et al 2013 however the influence of warming on subsurface biogeochemical cycles and on groundwater quality is currently not considered in projections of future freshwater availability bates et al 2008 famiglietti 2014 rodell et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 clearly as quality issues will further amplify the already existing problem of groundwater depletion due to climate change good groundwater governance needs to

6584,climate change and urbanization are currently leading to a warming of the subsurface worldwide with yet unforeseen consequences for groundwater quality the temperature sensitivity of chemical and biological processes suggests that small temperature changes driven by current warming should have a detectable effect on the ecology of aquifers and the composition of groundwater itself but field observations covering temperatures that are environmentally relevant are sparse the analysis of a large data set provides field scale evidence that within the naturally occurring temperature range between 5 and 20 c temperature affects the quality of groundwater a difference in temperature of 1 k is linked to a 4 decline in oxygen saturation and a ph drop of 0 02 due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide further warmer groundwater shows signs of enhanced mineral weathering and higher concentrations of drinking water relevant elements such as manganese the observed trends in groundwater quality are consistent with a temperature associated intensification of microbial metabolic rates and enhanced organic matter mineralization at warmer temperatures either within the aquifers or in the overlying soils a times series analysis reveals that soil and groundwater temperatures in the studied area have been increasing at a rate of 0 1 0 4 k per decade comparable to recent global warming driving subtle but distinct changes in groundwater ph and oxygen concentrations the results confirm that certain but central aspects of groundwater quality ph o2 pco2 mn doc change due to warming which may increase the costs for purification when drinking water is produced from groundwater resources and may turn some aquifers uninhabitable for groundwater biota keywords groundwater water quality groundwater ecology climate change geochemistry soil biogeochemistry 1 introduction roughly half of the world s population relies on groundwater for potable water supply and more than 40 of globally used irrigation water is subtracted from groundwater siebert et al 2010 wwap 2009 the use of groundwater as a resource for different proposes critically depends on the amount and quality of the available groundwater while quantitative projections of the future availability of groundwater have been developed famiglietti 2014 rodell et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 projections of future groundwater quality are far from being realized many factors affect groundwater quality such as land use and land use change aquifer lithology or soil type which have been subject to past studies e g appelo and postma 2005 böhlke 2002 chapelle 2005 hansen et al 2018 scanlon et al 2005 but the effect of warming on the chemical composition of groundwater remains poorly quantified bates et al 2008 green et al 2011 klove et al 2014 lipczynska kochany 2018a sophocleous 2004 taniguchi et al 2007 this is surprising because temperature regulates key biological and chemical processes that affect the cycling of oxygen carbon and other elements in soil and groundwater examples of such temperature dependent processes are microbial respiration and growth rates mineral solubility s and diffusion rates of solutes in water addy et al 2016 appelo and postma 2005 jørgensen et al 2009 lloyd and taylor 1994 price and sowers 2004 most of the presently available knowledge on temperature associated changes in groundwater quality is derived from studies on geothermal energy use subsurface heat storage using primarily laboratory batch and column experiments in the temperature range between 0 and 100 c these studies concluded that temperature related changes in groundwater composition are only significant for temperatures 40 c except for as which was already mobilized at moderate temperature increases bonte et al 2013 brons et al 1991 griebler et al 2016 however a recent in situ subsurface heating experiment showed that even small temperature changes below 25 c may already have an impact on groundwater quality although the study was hampered by strong groundwater level fluctuations it found that a warming of the aquifer by only 7 k leads to observable changes in the concentration of elements and substances such as mg si li and ammonium saito et al 2016 more evidence for a temperature control on aquifer biogeochemistry comes from studies on the fate of organic matter and organic pollutants enhanced desorption of organic compounds such as natural organic matter or organic contaminants from soils and sediments has been observed as a result of increasing temperatures brons et al 1991 kaiser et al 2001 wang et al 2010 a warming induced increase in the solubility of pollutants either directly or by increasing the solubility of natural organic matter which in turn enhances the solubility of pollutants via complexation may therefore also be expected bloomfield et al 2006 sposito and weber 1986 the temperature induced mobilization of humic substances may further add to higher rates of pollutant degradation by stimulating microbial activity lipczynska kochany 2018b higher temperatures may also directly accelerate degradation of organic pollutants in groundwater for example an increase in reductive dechlorination after an increase of in situ temperatures from 10 to 25 c has been reported by ni et al 2015 further thermodynamic data suggests that concentrations of inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals should decrease with warming with the exception of those occurring as anions such as arsenic providing some evidence that temperature increases may be beneficial for water quality bonte et al 2014 temperature changes may also have an impact on the redox chemistry of groundwater for example in a set of column experiments warming from 10 to 70 c resulted in a shift of the observed redox conditions as the biogeochemical conditions changed from oxic respiration to iron and sulfate reduction jesußek et al 2013 there is also evidence that

each time series were normalized to the respective average of a time series a linear regression model was then fitted to the time series data the resulting trends are expressed as change in value of parameter per year some samples exhibited concentrations of dissolved manganese fluoride dissolved organic carbon doc oxygen or potassium which were below the limit of quantification loq all values below the reported limit of quantification were censored to the reported loq to create a consistent data set this did not affect the presentation and interpretation of the data because the loq was always below the 5th quantile of all samples i e no more than 5 of the samples had concentrations of a certain parameter below the loq however by doing so gradients calculated on basis of the regression analysis were slightly lower as compared to other ways of data censoring such as replacing data below the loq with values of zero or with values of half the loq the estimated trends are therefore more conservative as gradients might be steeper than the ones reported here the list of loqs is shown in supplementary table s2 daily soil temperatures from three locations within the study area hosted by the deutsche wetterdienst offenbach germany were available for the years from 1970 to 2017 station1 bad mergentheim station 2 stuttgart station 3 freiburg the location of the respective stations is indicted in fig 1 the soil temperature was measured in 5 cm depth yearly values were obtained by averaging the daily observations for each year 3 results and discussion within the temperature range between 5 c and 20 c consistent trends in groundwater chemistry are observed groundwater sampled in wells was associated with lower ph values and lower oxygen saturations at higher temperatures as compared to groundwater with lower temperatures fig 2 ordinary least square regression analysis shows that a temperature difference of 1 k is on average accompanied by a difference of 4 for oxygen saturation and a ph drop by 0 02 units fig 2 dissolved organic carbon doc potassium fluoride manganese silicium and pco2 show the opposite trend i e values commonly increase at higher temperatures fig 2 groundwater sampled at springs generally exhibited cooler temperatures with an average of 9 c for comparison groundwater sampled in wells shows an average temperature of 12 5 c which is close to the average yearly air temperature of 9 5 c in the study area springs with high mineralization showed similar temperature associated changes in groundwater composition as compared to wells supplementary fig s1 also springs with low mineralization showed similar results to wells with the exception of pco2 and ph supplementary fig s2 this has been expected because springs with low mineralization often occur in terrains with fractured rocks springer and stevens 2009 where contact time with aquifer material is short and groundwater often is in contact with the atmosphere allowing rapid outgassing of co2 this time independent analysis can be validated by the predictions made from the findings rising temperatures increase concentrations of doc and potassium at a rate of 0 04 and 0 75 mg l 1 k 1 respectively this is comparable to those concentration changes observed during a recent subsurface heating and cooling experiment saito et al 2016 the time dependent analysis reveals a similar picture groundwater sampled at wells and springs showed significant increases in temperature in the study area table 1 the rate of temperature change is comparable to the rate of global warming during the past decades of 0 02 k yr 1 xu et al 2018 while temperature increased oxygen saturations and ph values decreased table 1 albeit the relatively short period of time 16 years the analysis shows that changes in groundwater chemistry due to warming are detectable in the present data set and follow patterns comparable to those observed in the time independent analysis fig 2 interestingly the observed temperature increases are comparable in magnitude to the increases observed in the upper soil at three different sites within the study area fig 3 this suggests that warming of the shallow subsurface is responsible for the observed temperature trends in groundwater notably t increases are higher in groundwater sampled at springs as compared to groundwater sampled in wells table 1 especially the temperature increase of 0 03 k yr 1 observed in springs is almost similar to the temperature changes of 0 03 0 04 k yr 1 observed in the upper soil horizons in the study area fig 3 this was an expected finding because springs often respond rather quickly to environmental changes because of the relatively short residence times of groundwater discharging at springs jyväsjärvi et al 2015 springer and stevens 2009 the observed temperature dependent trends in groundwater composition likely result from a number of different processes first microbial respiration is temperature dependent lloyd and taylor 1994 price and sowers 2004 absolute respiration rates are not available for the study site but temperature dependent changes in relative respiration rates generally show uniform trends across ecosystems and climates in soil and groundwater i e respiration rates commonly increase by a factor of approximately 3 to 4 when temperature increases from 5 to 20 c addy et al 2016 lloyd and taylor 1994 jørgensen et al 2009 higher respiration rates are well reflected by lower oxygen saturations as well as the greater accumulation of co2 in warmer groundwater as compared to colder groundwater fig 2 second as oxygen concentrations decrease an increase of doc concentrations is observed the relation between doc and t in wells is only moderately significant p 0 05 but is well supported the findings of previous research sorption of dissolved organic matter to soil material is temperature sensitive at higher temperatures a thermally induced mobilization of doc from the mineral matrix occurs which increases its availability as a microbial substrate brons et al 1991 kaiser et al 2001 as a result oxygen is increasingly depleted via microbial respiration whereas concentrations of manganese subsequently increase owing to a shift towards more reducing conditions a similar shift towards more reducing conditions as indicated by lower oxidation reduction potentials has been found in groundwater from an agricultural area in mexico prieto amparan et al 2018 the doc released appears to be more aromatic at higher temperatures because the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva measured as the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to the doc concentration also increases with 0 06 l mg 1 m 1 k 1 in wells p 0 001 data not shown one possible explanation is that the solubility of aromatic organic carbon increases with temperature another is that microbial respiration preferentially mineralizes non aromatic organic carbon leaving behind a more refractory aromatic carbon warmer groundwater was also associated with higher si k and f concentrations the latter being a groundwater contaminant of concern in several regions of the world these observations are attributed to an intensification of mineral dissolution for example feldspar dissolution which releases si and k is a function of temperature with higher dissolution rates occurring at higher temperatures welch and ullman 2000 dissolution rates at 20 c determined under abiotic conditions in the laboratory are two to three times higher than at 5 c welch and ullman 2000 warmer temperatures should thus lead to an enhanced release of k and si to groundwater from mineral dissolution the total concentration of k and si in solution will then only be limited by the subsequent formation of secondary minerals in addition the observed increase of pco2 in groundwater with increasing t suggests that more carbonic acid is present in warmer groundwater which is likely to further enhance mineral weathering hansen et al 2018 it is worth noting that the here observed trends are the result of biogeochemical processes in the soil groundwater continuum most groundwater recharge occurs after water has percolated through a soil kindler et al 2011 because shallow groundwater temperatures 30 m are mostly a function of the land surface temperature benz et al 2017 it is possible that some of the here observed trends point to temperature dependent biogeochemical processes that occurred prior to recharge in the soils overlying the respective aquifers this would mainly have consequences for the flux of gaseous components to groundwater for example soil warming results in an enhanced release of co2 some of which is dissolved in soil solution to form carbonic acid which either reacts with minerals or eventually recharges to groundwater kindler et al 2011 warmer recharge temperatures have indeed been found to correlate with groundwater pco2 jurgens et al 2010 however not all of the co2 released in soils by microbial respiration gets dissolved instead it rather directly emits to the atmosphere thus the exchange of soil air with the atmosphere limits the flux of co2 to groundwater another factor to consider when interpreting the results is irrigation recharge occurs primarily during the winter month in the study area when recharge is artificially increased in the warmer growing season due to enhanced irrigation in agricultural areas the composition and temperature of the soil water recharging to groundwater will change during the summer month more co2 is present in soils due to the combined effects of microbial and root respiration as a result irrigation of agriculturally used land in summer leads to the recharge of warmer water with more co2 dissolved in it hansen et al 2018 jurgens et al 2010 in these cases the relation between temperature and groundwater quality is the result of an increase in the proportion of recharge during the warmer summer month however irrigation is more pronounced in arid regions in the here studied area irrigation is currently not expected to play a major role although irrigation demand may increase in the future in summary because processes in soil cannot unambiguously be separated from those in groundwater with the currently available data the present study essentially identifies the cumulative effects of both one constraint of this study is that it is limited to a small region in central europe it remains to be seen if aquifers in other hydroclimatic settings respond similarly to temperature changes however the observed relation between certain groundwater quality parameters and temperature is statistically robust and in line with other studies from mexico and japan prieto amparan et al 2018 saito et al 2016 therefore the results add to the growing body of evidence that small temperature changes likely have a detectable effect on groundwater quality but the scatter in the data is large fig 2 because numerous other factors also influence the chemical composition of groundwater such as land use soil type and local geology for example urbanization influences groundwater quality not only by warming the subsurface urban heat island but also via other aspects such as pollution with nutrients salts or organic contaminants bruce and mcmahon 1996 hansen et al 2018 hobbie et al 2017 scanlon et al 2005 agriculturally used land receives large amounts of nutrients including k which eventually accumulates in soil and groundwater böhlke 2002 scanlon et al 2005 aquifer lithology is also important because the presence or absence of minerals as well as their solubilities dictates the ion composition of groundwater appelo and postma 2005 chapelle 2005 differences in mineral abundances in the diverse geological settings of the studied area fig 1 likely explain the scatter of the si k and f data finally water table depth has a large influence on the redox chemistry of groundwater shallow water table depths are often associated with higher doc and mn concentrations and lower oxygen concentrations as compared to deeper water tables pabich et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2019 it should further be noted that besides the here discussed increases in groundwater temperatures numerous other consequences of climate change and urbanization are expected that may also influence groundwater quality green et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 for example climate change induced changes in the hydrological cycle will lead to shifting recharge patterns taylor et al 2013 a shift of the timing of recharge in regions where soil microbial activity and vegetation show a pronounced seasonality may have an impact on the chemical composition of groundwater as well changes in soil moisture availability itself may also have an impact soil microbial community structure and activity castro et al 2010 droughts sea level rise and perhaps changes in vegetation may differently affect soil water and groundwater quality currently there are many different aspects of climate change besides warming whose effects on groundwater quality are difficult to predict hence there is a need for more studies dealing with the impact of hydroclimatic changes on soil water and groundwater quality 4 conclusions the analysis of a large data set provides evidence for a biogeochemical link between subsurface temperature and groundwater quality several implications arise from this observation with respect to a potential warming of soil and groundwater first groundwater biota i e stygobiotic organisms are sensitive to ambient conditions in groundwater and only thrive at high oxygen levels dole olivier et al 2009 maurice and bloomfield 2012 because oxygen is crucial for groundwater fauna a decrease in oxygen concentrations due to warming will turn some aquifers uninhabitable for these organisms second when groundwater is used as a resource for drinking water production in some cases quality deteriorations will make additional efforts for purification necessary lipczynska kochany 2018a for example increases in doc and mn will necessarily require higher dosages of flocculants to reduce the risk of microbial contamination to prevent the deposition of manganese oxides in drinking water distribution systems and to keep mn concentrations below guideline values this is further illustrated in fig 4 the fraction of samples with mn concentrations above the guideline value for drinking water in germany steadily increases from less than 10 to more than 30 in the temperature range between 5 and 20 c also formation of disinfection byproducts will increase at elevated doc concentrations when chlorine is used for disinfection further acidification due to elevated pco2 requires degassing neutralization in order to ensure that the produced drinking water is non corrosive third increases in weathering rates increase the salinity of groundwater which may enhance the problem of soil salinization in arid regions where irrigation demand is high hansen et al 2018 groundwater temperatures are expected to rise locally as well as globally as a result of urbanization and global warming bates et al 2008 beltrami et al 2006 huang et al 2000 menberg et al 2013 taniguchi et al 2007 modelling results indicate that increases of 3 4 k in shallow groundwater are possible within the next decades taylor and stefan 2009 additionally local temperature gradients of 3 7 k are observed underneath larger cities menberg et al 2013 however the influence of warming on subsurface biogeochemical cycles and on groundwater quality is currently not considered in projections of future freshwater availability bates et al 2008 famiglietti 2014 rodell et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 clearly as quality issues will further amplify the already existing problem of groundwater depletion due to climate change good groundwater governance needs to include a thorough management of groundwater temperatures to secure groundwater quality and quantity in the future acknowledgments comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript by r becker and t aus
