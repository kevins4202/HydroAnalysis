1545,in a deep geological repository for radioactive waste in the opalinus clay disposal canisters may be corroded due to sulphide produced by sulphate reducing bacteria srb this paper presents two computational models a reactive transport model rtm and a simplified semi analytical model sm to evaluate the potential of srb to generate elevated sulphide concentrations to assess sulphide fluxes to the canister and in a simplified manner the resulting canister corrosion calculations performed in the context of the repository s safety assessment based on a shared conceptual model reveal that the two computational models are complementary the reactive transport model incorporates state of the art understanding of the system s geochemistry but is currently too computationally demanding to be applied in probabilistic safety assessment sensitivity analyses the simplified model is fast and efficient but some of its assumptions need to be verified and some parameter values need to be calibrated using the more complete reactive transport model nonetheless given the same set of assumptions the two models predict comparable magnitudes of sulphide fluxes to the canister and comparable

has been considering a several millimetre thick copper coating of the carbon steel disposal canisters as an option offering a significantly longer canister lifetime than carbon steel alone holdsworth et al 2014 diomidis et al 2017 the presence of sulphide leads to copper corrosion and the potentially deleterious effects of sulphide on the performance of a copper coated canister have been studied in safety assessments by various organisations e g ski 1996 ski 1999 ssm 2011 to this end a variety of approaches have been applied ranging from simplified bounding mass balance and transport considerations e g skb 1992 skb 2010 to explicit 3d transport calculations with a simplified representation of reactions briggs et al 2016 2017 and to multi component reactive transport calculations wersin et al 2014 cloet et al 2017 pekala et al 2019a b in the swiss concept after repository closure dissolved sulphide concentrations in the bentonite buffer and opa porewaters are expected to be very low ca 10 11 mol l due to solubility control by pyrite under reducing redox conditions pearson et al 2003 considerable quantities of sulphate will be present in the repository e g as gypsum in the bentonite buffer which could potentially be reduced to sulphide under certain circumstances although inorganic non biological sulphate reduction to sulphide in aqueous solutions at near room temperatures is immeasurably slow due to kinetic inhibition e g berner 1971 krauskopf 1979 it is conceivable that following repository closure once anaerobic conditions are established microbially assisted biological sulphide production could take place in some locations this could increase sulphide fluxes to the canister and hence increase canister corrosion back of the envelope mass balance calculations based on a simplified disposal geometry yield corrosion depth estimates in the order of millimetres these calculations assume that all sulphate in the bentonite buffer gypsum is completely converted into sulphide and instantly consumed by a reaction that produces chalcocite cu2s the opa constitutes an additional large reservoir of sulphate that could further contribute to microbial sulphide production and canister corrosion such simplified calculations are however highly conservative since they do not take into account important physical chemical and biological constraints on the sulphide flux to the canister moreover these calculations do not offer any insights as to corrosion rates and canister failure times in order to obtain improved estimates of the potential canister corrosion more elaborate approaches are required cloet et al 2017 performed calculations employing two models in support of the safety case for the swiss repository a simplified mass balance and transport model sm and multi component reactive transport model rtm pekala et al 2019a present the rtm with a special discussion of the assumptions underlying the geochemical model model parameterisation and uncertainty evaluation in this paper we present the sm with its assumptions and mathematical formulation compared with the bounding mass balance calculations mentioned above the sm includes a more mechanistic process representation whereby mass conservation is directly coupled to mass transfer furthermore a detailed and systematic comparison of the sm and rtm models is made showing their relative advantages and limitations and how they can be jointly used in the context of safety assessment for the planned swiss repository 2 conceptual model the following conceptual model describes common understanding of the main processes involved in potential sulphide production in the near field of the repository and provides a common foundation for both the rtm and the sm discussed in this paper sulphate minerals present in the bentonite gypsum and in opa celestite constitute the source of dissolved sulphate solid organic matter som present in the bentonite and in the opa is the source of dissolved organic matter dom srb can utilise dom as the electron donor and sulphate as the electron acceptor in their metabolic activities note that primary sulphide minerals mainly pyrite are present in bentonite from the outset however their presence is neglected due to their low solubility under reducing conditions srb are inactive in the undisturbed opa stroes gascoyne et al 2007 furthermore bentonite when emplaced as a buffer material at high enough density e g dry density 1 45 g cm3 will once saturated produce a high swelling pressure and a low free pore space thus preventing microbial activity pedersen et al 2000 masurat et al 2010 stroes gascoyne et al 2010 stone et al 2016 the sole microbially active zone is the excavation disturbed zone edz around the horizontal emplacement tunnels where for a limited time the presence of small cracks could provide viable space for srb and hence sulphate may be reduced to sulphide a portion of the generated sulphide precipitates as mackinawite in the edz due to solubility constraints while the rest is transported either towards the canister or away from the canister into the opa solute transport in the buffer and in the opa is dominated by diffusion since advection is negligible gimmi et al 2007 mazurek et al 2011 wersin et al 2013 mazurek and haller 2017 yu et al 2018 wersin et al 2018 at the canister surface sulphide is consumed instantaneously and completely by a reaction with copper canister corrosion is controlled by the rate of sulphide transport towards the canister surface king et al 2017 and is therefore proportional to the time integrated sulphide flux 3 main model assumptions and simplifications the following assumptions and simplifications are also common to both models the repository near field is represented using a 1 d cylindrical geometry fig 1 all materials except the canister are represented as porous equivalent compartments with homogenous and isotropic transport properties properties of the bentonite buffer are based on those of wyoming mx 80 bentonite srb activity is restricted to the edz which is assumed to be viable for the entire period of consideration compartments are fully water saturated and isothermal the short initial thermal phase is ignored mass transfer is by diffusion advection being negligible in every compartment a single total porosity is assumed while all aqueous species share the same effective diffusion coefficient sulphide reaching the canister surface is consumed instantaneously and completely by a reaction with copper therefore canister corrosion rate is limited by transport of sulphide to the canister surface 4 description of the models 4 1 reactive transport model rtm 4 1 1 geochemical model pekala et al 2019a

thermodynamic data base v 9b giffaut et al 2014 including the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl aqueous activity model 4 1 2 initial and boundary transport conditions initial geochemical conditions are presented in table 1 the opa pore water is calculated by assuming equilibrium with calcite dolomite quartz celestite and siderite and considering co2 g partial pressure of 10 2 22 bar mäder 2009 the fixed exchanger composition reported by mäder 2009 is used to calculate the equilibrium concentration of na mg2 k and sr2 it is assumed that the mineral and porewater composition of the edz corresponds to that of the undisturbed opa the bentonite pore water is calculated by equilibrating the opa pore water reported by mäder 2009 assuming equilibrium with gypsum calcite quartz goethite at partial pressure of co2 g equal 10 2 2 bar the fixed cation exchanger reported by bradbury and baeyens 2003 is used to calculate the concentrations of na mg2 k in the buffer 4 1 3

estimated to be 0 1 wt based on wersin et al 2014 the remaining mineralogical composition of the buffer is simplified after kiviranta and kumpulainen 2011 to include montmorillonite only for surface protonation and ion exchange reactions gypsum calcite and quartz the models and parameterisation of bradbury and baeyens 2003 and bradbury and baeyens 1997 are used for cation exchange and surface protonation in the buffer respectively solid organic matter in the opa is taken to be present at 0 6 wt nagra 2014a the remaining mineralogical composition of the opa is simplified after nagra 2014a to include calcite siderite dolomite and quartz celestite is estimated based on wersin et al 2013 a generic exchanger is implemented to represent cation exchange reactions with total cec and composition reported by pearson 2002 rtm calculations are performed using the code pflotran www pflotran org with the thermochimie thermodynamic database v 9 0b giffaut et al 2014 diffusive transport and chemical reactions are solved in a one step global implicit manner the calculations consider a 1d cylindrical model domain fig 1 a constant opa pore water composition is assumed at the external model boundary table 1 although the canister is included in the model geometry to correctly represent dimensions and volumes in a cylindrical geometry it is considered both chemically inert except implicitly for the corrosion reaction and impermeable sulphide consumption at the canister surface is simplistically represented by defining an arbitrary small space single cell of 1 cm length within the outer canister surface in which this reaction takes place all calculations are performed up to 1 million years 4 2 simplified model sm the equations underlying the sm and their derivation are presented in appendix a as electronic supplementary data below the model is briefly described in terms of the main processes and their implementation the main fluxes and processes represented in the sm are illustrated schematically in fig 2 at the start of the calculation celestite initially present in the edz dissolves instantaneously and completely and the sulphate thus released is reduced instantaneously and completely to sulphide the aqueous concentration of sulphide in the edz is subject to a user defined solubility constraint the mass of the produced sulphide which is in excess of the solubility level precipitates as mackinawite due to the initial sulphate depletion in the edz dissolved sulphate from the buffer and from the opa diffuses towards the edz the diffusive sulphate fluxes from the buffer to the edz and from the opa to the edz are calculated assuming pseudo steady state a sequence of steady states in time in the calculation of the sulphate flux spatial steady state distributions of dissolved sulphate concentrations are used with diffusion distances determined by the transient positions of the dissolution fronts within these media the fraction of dissolved sulphide produced in the edz i e sulphide not precipitated as mackinawite can diffuse towards the canister and into the opa as in the case of diffusive sulphate flux the diffusive flux of sulphide from the edz towards the canister is approximated considering a time sequence of steady states of sulphide concentration distributions in the buffer in cylindrical coordinates the diffusive sulphide flux from the edz to the opa is based on a 1d cartesian steady state sulphide concentration profile with the diffusion distance taken to be the distance from the centre of the tunnel to the upper or lower host rock boundaries the rate of canister corrosion is proportional to the diffusive sulphide flux from the edz to the canister srb activity is restricted to the edz while sulphate concentrations in the buffer and in the opa are solubility limited as a result dissolution fronts develop in these media separating areas enriched and depleted in sulphate minerals the dissolution fronts migrate over time away from the interfaces of their respective media with the edz as schematically shown in fig 2 as discussed earlier section 2 due to limited importance advective transport is not considered in the present calculations in a general case however it is possible to calculate advective flux of sulphate from the opa to the edz and of sulphide from the edz to the opa the formulae for calculating these advective fluxes are presented in cloet et al 2017 5 parameterisation and calculation cases parameter values used jointly by the rtm and sm are shown in table 2 calculation cases considered in this study together with their corresponding parameter values are shown in table 3 the rtm cases rtm dom rtm sulf and rtm srb are defined based on scoping calculations and represent three distinct regimes whereby sulphide production is controlled by 1 slow som dissolution and limited dom transport to the edz 2 limited sulphate transport to the edz and 3 limited srb activity under full availability of sulphate and dom respectively in addition an rtm case rtm red table 3 is considered whereby the chemical system is simplified and parameter values are adjusted in order to approximate as far as possible the behaviour of the sm the purpose of this model is to bridge the rtm and sm calculation cases and to allow the behaviour of these two different models to be meaningfully compared in the rtm red case only three dissolved species are included sulphate dom and sulphide with no aqueous speciation the initial dissolved concentrations of sulphate in the buffer and opa edz correspond to the total dissolved concentrations reported in table 1 for the rtm these concentrations are maintained by dummy mineral phases representing gypsum and celestite and characterized by fixed solubilities the contents of these minerals gypsum and celestite are also shown in table 1 in order to approximate the sm the concentration of dom and som dissolution rate are set high so that dom availability does not limit sulphide production the som content is also fixed at a sufficiently high value that it is never consumed anywhere in the model domain during the simulation furthermore the maximum intrinsic rate of srb activity k srb in eq 6 is such that it is never rate limiting for sulphide production even at high concentration of dom consequently the effective srb activity in the edz is controlled by the transport of sulphate in an analogous way to the rtm sulf case dissolved sulphide concentrations are limited to 10 4 mol l by the precipitation of a dummy mackinawite mineral moreover three special cases are studied using the rtm where the concentration of sulphide in the edz is maintained constant at three distinct values 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 mol l cases rtm c1 rtm c2 and rtm c3 table 3 respectively these calculation cases aim to evaluate the effect of time dependent diffusion as compared with the sequence of steady states assumed by the sm for the sm three calculation cases are studied considering sulphide solubility limits in the edz of 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 mol l cases sm s1 sm s2 and sm s3 table 3 respectively 6 results and discussion the discussion of the two models focuses first section 6 1 on the main differences that can be identified based on the descriptions presented in section 4 these key differences are illustrated using selected results calculated by the two models in section 6 2 additional aspects of the models are briefly presented thereafter sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths calculated by the simplified and reactive transport models are discussed in section 6 3 6 1 comparison of key model features comparing the assumptions and simplifications underpinning the sm and the rtm section 4 it can be seen that the former makes simplifying assumptions regarding the following a representation of diffusive transport b control of sulphide production rate in the edz c control of sulphide concentration in the edz these aspects are discussed in detail below 6 1 1 diffusive transport unlike in the rtm where the time dependent diffusion equation is solved the sm approximates diffusive transport by a sequence of pseudo steady states fig 3 shows a comparison of the canister corrosion depths calculated by the sm cases sm s1 sm s2 and sm s3 and by the rtm cases assuming a fixed sulphide concentration in the edz cases rt c1 rt c2 rt c3 the figure indicates that for a given sulphide solubility limit in the edz the canister corrosion depths calculated by the rtm cases lag behind those calculated by the sm during the initial several thousand years and converge thereafter this is due to transient time dependent initially slower diffusive transport calculated in the rtm cases after approximately ten thousand years the two models yield practically identical results as steady state diffusive profiles across the buffer are established and as the initially accrued sulphide fluxes become progressively insignificant a time integrated effect over the assessment time frame of one million years the transient transport effects associated with the rtm are short and of little significance to the final results the above is further corroborated by fig 4 which compares the dissolved sulphate concentration profiles in the opa calculated by the rtm rtm red with the steady state concentrations calculated by the sm at selected times coincidence of the symbols rtm with the solid lines sm shows that at the indicated times sulphate transport in the opa calculated by the rtm is at near steady state it can therefore be concluded that by assuming a sequence of steady states the sm is conservative in the sense that it tends to over estimate diffusive transport of both sulphate to the edz and sulphide to the canister however the effect becomes insignificant on the scales of tens and hundreds of thousands of years 6 1 2 rate of sulphide production in the edz the sm assumes that sulphide production in the edz due to srb activity is controlled by the transport of sulphate while the availability of the electron donor is never rate limiting for the srb furthermore in the sm sulphate reduction in the edz is instantaneous and complete in contrast in the rtm the rate of sulphide production due to srb activity depends on the specific model parameterisation assumed especially the rate of som dissolution the intrinsic rate of srb activity the solubility of som and gypsum and material diffusivity in a general case three scenarios can be envisaged where the rate of sulphide production is defined by the rate of slow som dissolution and limited dom transport to the edz rtm dom limited sulphate transport to the edz rtm sulf limited srb activity under full availability of sulphate and dom rtm srb these sulphide production regimes are represented by the rtm dom rtm sulf and rtm srb calculation cases respectively fig 5 note that for all three scenarios model transport parameters are the same as defined in section 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the scenario where sulphide production in the edz is controlled by the transport of sulphate rtm sulf results in the highest sulphide production rates locally at the contact with the buffer and opa these increased sulphide production rates lead to elevated dissolved sulphide concentrations and enhanced sulphide fluxes to the canister as discussed in the following section in addition the comparison of the global sulphide production calculated for the three scenarios section 6 2 further supports the assertion that the reactive transport case where sulphide production in the edz is controlled by the transport of sulphate rtm sulf leads to highest overall sulphide production note that for both rtm dom and rtm sulf the srb reaction rate is taken to be the same despite this the latter yields much higher sulphide production this is because of the relative concentrations of sulphate and dom the former being ca 1000 times greater than the latter and the related fluxes to the edz 6 1 3 dissolved sulphide concentration in the edz the sm calculation cases sm s1 sm s2 sm s3 and the rtm case rtm red consider a fixed modeller defined sulphide solubility limit in the edz table 3 in contrast in the rtm calculations rtm dom rtm sulf and rtm srb sulphide concentration in the edz is calculated according to eq 7 as a function of ph and the concentration of fe2 aq assuming equilibrium with mackinawite as discussed in pekala et al 2019a ph evolution in the edz depends on the rate of acidification due to srb activity the rate of diffusive mass transfer with adjacent regions especially the transport of protons carbonates and dissolved fe and the rate of buffering by chemical reactions mainly by calcite precipitation the effect of srb activity rate is particularly important other factors being equal faster srb activity generates lower ph values and increases sulphide concentration under mackinawite equilibrium fig 6 which is especially pronounced in the rtm sulf case this is relevant as sulphide concentrations in the edz directly define sulphide fluxes to the canister as shown in fig 7 for the rtm dom case 6 2 other aspects of the models the rtm represents the dissolved and solid sulphate and sulphide inventories e g the dissolved sulphate and gypsum or celestite explicitly while in the sm the two inventories are lumped into the solid therefore for example if the total initial sulphate inventories are to be represented consistently there will be a difference in the solid sulphate inventories gypsum in the buffer and celestite in the opa edz between the two models note that the dissolved sulphate in the buffer porewater in equilibrium with gypsum constitutes about 40 of the bulk buffer sulphate the sum of dissolved and as gypsum in the opa the dissolved sulphate in equilibrium with celestite is about 20 of the bulk sulphate content in the simplified model the dissolved equilibrium sulphate value derived from the geochemical model table 1 was added to the solid sulphate inventory as an equivalent wt of the solid consequently in comparison to the rtm the sm features ca 65 wt more gypsum in the buffer and ca 23 wt more celestite in the edz opa the effect of this initial difference in sulphate inventories is observable in the sulphate consumption rates predicted by the sm and by the rtm red case as shown in fig 8 note that all sm cases yield the same result it can be seen in fig 8 that the time to complete gypsum consumption in the buffer predicted by the case rtm red is shorter than the time predicted by the sm it should be further noted that this is despite the slower time dependent diffusive transport calculated by the rtm which as discussed in section 6 1 1 is relevant during this time likewise the propagation of the celestite dissolution front into the opa is also somewhat faster in the rtm case rt red than in the sm overall however this effect is limited in the present model set up both the rtm and the sm allow a global and local mass balance of the consumed sulphate and the generated sulphide to be evaluated in the case of the rtm this is inherent to the mass conservation equation solved the mass balance includes the dissolved solid and exchanged masses in the sm the mass of sulphide produced is calculated from the mass of sulphate consumed within a given time increment the mass of consumed solid sulphate is considered instantaneously converted into sulphide this implies instant transfer of the dissolved sulphate to the edz the dissolved sulphate mass is therefore ignored in this calculation this effect is negligible at early times when the distances for diffusive transport are short but increases gradually later when the celestite dissolution front retreats deeper into the opa fig 9 shows this by comparing the sm predictions with the rtm case rtm red at one million years the difference in the global mass of sulphide produced is however relatively small 173 mol or several percent of the total sulphide produced as discussed earlier the sm performs mass balance on sulphate and sulphide because of continued srb activity in the edz sulphide precipitated as mackinawite is always present in the edz controlling dissolved sulphide concentrations therefore under the specific conditions considered here the tracking of sulphide mass is not critical as the system could be simply represented by a constant sulphide concentration in the edz however under different circumstances e g where srb activity stops or is greatly reduced following an initial period of bacterial activity such sulphide mass tracking is necessary to correctly represent continued sulphide fluxes to the canister due to mackinawite re dissolution 6 3 sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths having compared key aspects of the rtm and the sm sulphide fluxes to the canister and canister corrosion depths predicted by the models fig 10 can be discussed in the sm all sulphate initially present in the edz including as celestite is at the start of the calculation instantaneously converted to sulphide and precipitated as mackinawite subject to a fixed assumed solubility constraint it should be further noted that as sulphate transport to the edz never ceases during the simulation large reservoir of celestite in opa sulphide production and mackinawite precipitation and therefore sulphide solubility control continue at all times in combination with the steady state diffusive transport assumption this results in constant sulphide fluxes from the edz to the canister surface fig 10 shows that sulphide fluxes calculated by the rtm are initially very low and increase steeply during the initial several hundred years as discussed previously section 6 1 1 this initial sulphide flux is due to the time dependent diffusive transport and the build up of steady state concentration distributions across the buffer following the initial increase sulphide fluxes predicted by the different rtm cases undergo a transient phase that lasts up to ca 100 000 years note that as discussed in section 6 1 3 sulphide fluxes to the canister predicted by the rtm are a direct function of dissolved sulphide concentrations in the edz during this time the fluxes to the canister fig 10 top are controlled by the shifting sulphide solubility in the edz fig 11 therefore for example the relatively high sulphide concentrations in the edz calculated for the rtm sulf case are the result of fast srb activity and increased sulphide solubility under decreased porewater ph this is expected to translate into enhanced sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths after about 100 000 years the rtm predicts the establishment of a near steady state due to a combination of diffusive transport and chemical ph buffering following that corrosion becomes a linear function of time as in the sm 7 conclusions following repository closure sulphide production by srb in the near field of the planned repository is conceivable and its potential impact on the performance of the copper coated disposal canister requires a quantitative evaluation due to complexity of the processes involved and presence of uncertainties realistic quantitative predictions of srb mediated sulphide generation in the repository near field are currently not possible especially over time scales relevant to safety assessment pekala et al 2019a however pessimistic estimates based on conservative modelling of processes and conservative parameter value selection are feasible simplistic mass balance calculations yield unrealistically high corrosion depth estimates in the order of millimetres we discuss the relative advantages of two more sophisticated models and how they can be jointly used in the context of the repository safety assessment quantitative comparison of the two models is performed for a specific srb activity scenario based on a shared conceptual process model relative to the simplified semi analytical model sm the reactive transport model rtm offers a flexible and generalised framework within which a variety of disposal concepts e g geometries and conceptual srb activity models can be evaluated by employing a mechanistic representation the rtm can be used to identify system controlling processes and offers quantitative insights into the complex behaviour characteristic of srb activity in the near field on the other hand the rtm calculations are more time and resource consuming and require considerable expertise furthermore they are often characterized by a large number of parameters some of which are not well constrained in comparison the sm replaces conceptual and parametric uncertainties with extra layers of conservativism this simplifies model structure and helps increase the transparency of the results moreover the sm calculations are fast to carry out which lends itself to probabilistic and parametric studies a single sm calculation is performed in approximately 15 s on a standard desktop computer compared to some 20 30 min required by the rtm using fast 20 processors on the university of bern cluster computer https docs id unibe ch ubelix therefore if run in series only ca 4 h computing time would be needed by the sm to produce 1000 realisations compared to 12 21 days for the rtm both the transparency and calculation speed are particularly attractive from the point of view of safety performance assessment calculations in addition the sm is flexible and formulae can be derived for a variety of conceptual scenarios of srb activity see cloet et al 2017 rtm calculations can be implemented at various levels of detail for example the geochemical model presented can be significantly and conservatively simplified e g as was done in the rtm red case this has the advantage of increasing the overall model transparency and readability however just as in the case of the sm it requires crucial model parameters sulphide solubility limits to be defined based on expert judgment or using external geochemical calculations the analysis performed indicates that for the same set of assumptions and model parameterisation especially the sulphide solubility limits the two models yield comparable results in terms of sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths minor differences between the model implementations e g representation of diffusive transport and mass balance calculation lead to small and mostly negligible differences in the results especially considering the overall model uncertainties and tend to be pessimistic in the sm the two presented models are complementary in particular expert judgment based estimates of a key parameter in the sm the solubility of sulphide in the edz can be better constrained based on the results of the rtm moreover system understanding derived from the rtm calculations can be used to support the choice of processes included in the sm for example analysis of the rtm calculations indicates that the implicit assumption underlying the sm that srb activity is limited only by the transport of sulphate to the edz is indeed conservative in terms of sulphide production and canister corrosion also comparison against the rtm shows that the simplifying assumption of steady state diffusion made by the sm is acceptable and has negligible effects for the results at 1 million years on the other hand once the conceptual model and its parameterisation have been established the sm model can be used to perform burdensome parameter sweep or probabilistic calculations in view of the present knowledge gaps both models tend to make conservative assumptions and therefore yield pessimistic estimates of possible corrosion of the cu canister coating due to sulphide pekala et al 2019a discuss the various types of conservative assumptions underlying the rtm including the nature of the sulphide solubility limiting mineral phase the availability of dom extractability and dissolution rate of som the source of fe for sulphide precipitation and the intrinsic rate of srb activity the ability of srb to utilise sulphate and dom similar assumptions but typically defined in a more conservative manner compared with the rtm are implicit to the sm for example the sm implicitly assumes that an electron donor for the sulphate reduction reaction is always available and never rate limiting in the rtm terminology this implies presence of excess dom concentration due to fast som dissolution and unlimited diffusive transport in section 6 1 2 we show that in combination with the assumption of fast intrinsic srb reaction rates such an assumption is conservative in a similar manner the sm implicitly assumes an unlimited availability of fe required for sulphide precipitation as mackinawite while in the rtm this is limited by the solubility of siderite in the opa and diffusive transport of fe the sm further assumes that the srb reaction rates are infinitely high instantaneous whereas this rate is finite in the rtm it should be mentioned that both models are conservative in terms of the rate of srb activity which over the assessment period of 1 million years is assumed to be limited only by the availability of sulphate and dom for instance cracks in the edz which are assumed to provide the habitable space for srb are only expected to remain open during the relatively short thermal period following that period saturation of the edz with water is expected to seal the cracks thus preventing further srb activity other factors such as toxic effects of sulphide or insufficient availability of trace metals needed for bacterial metabolism might further inhibit bacterial growth in the present paper the two models are discussed in view of a specific application case however variants to this conceptual model can readily be accommodated by both models for example srb activity in the buffer and sulphide generation directly at the canister surface can easily be represented moreover if desired advective transport of sulphate and sulphide between the rock and the edz can also readily be incorporated into both models the implementation of these and other variations of the conceptual process model into the simplified semi analytical

wersin et al 2014 cloet et al 2017 pekala et al 2019a b in the swiss concept after repository closure dissolved sulphide concentrations in the bentonite buffer and opa porewaters are expected to be very low ca 10 11 mol l due to solubility control by pyrite under reducing redox conditions pearson et al 2003 considerable quantities of sulphate will be present in the repository e g as gypsum in the bentonite buffer which could potentially be reduced to sulphide under certain circumstances although inorganic non biological sulphate reduction to sulphide in aqueous solutions at near room temperatures is immeasurably slow due to kinetic inhibition e g berner 1971 krauskopf 1979 it is conceivable that following repository closure once anaerobic conditions are established microbially assisted biological sulphide production could take place in some locations this could increase sulphide fluxes to the canister and hence increase canister corrosion back of the envelope mass balance calculations based on a simplified disposal geometry yield corrosion depth estimates in the order of millimetres these calculations assume that all sulphate in the bentonite buffer gypsum is completely converted into sulphide and instantly consumed by a reaction that produces chalcocite cu2s the opa constitutes an additional large reservoir of sulphate that could further contribute to microbial sulphide production and canister corrosion such simplified calculations are however highly conservative since they do not take into account important physical chemical and biological constraints on the sulphide flux to the canister moreover these calculations do not offer any insights as to corrosion rates and canister failure times in order to obtain improved estimates of the potential canister corrosion more elaborate approaches are required cloet et al 2017 performed calculations employing two models in support of the safety case for the swiss repository a simplified mass balance and transport model sm and multi component reactive transport model rtm pekala et al 2019a present the rtm with a special discussion of the assumptions underlying the geochemical model model parameterisation and uncertainty evaluation in this paper we present the sm with its assumptions and mathematical formulation compared with the bounding mass balance calculations mentioned above the sm includes a more mechanistic process representation whereby mass conservation is directly coupled to mass transfer furthermore a detailed and systematic comparison of the sm and rtm models is made showing their relative advantages and limitations and how they can be jointly used in the context of safety assessment for the planned swiss repository 2 conceptual model the following conceptual model describes common understanding of the main processes involved in potential sulphide production in the near field of the repository and provides a common foundation for both the rtm and the sm discussed in this paper sulphate minerals present in the bentonite gypsum and in opa celestite constitute the source of dissolved sulphate solid organic matter som present in the bentonite and in the opa is the source of dissolved organic matter dom srb can utilise dom as the electron donor and sulphate as the electron acceptor in their metabolic activities note that primary sulphide minerals mainly pyrite are present in bentonite from the outset however their presence is neglected due to their low solubility under reducing conditions srb are inactive in the undisturbed opa stroes gascoyne et al 2007 furthermore bentonite when emplaced as a buffer material at high enough density e g dry density 1 45 g cm3 will once saturated produce a high swelling pressure and a low free pore space thus preventing microbial activity pedersen et al 2000 masurat et al 2010 stroes gascoyne et al 2010 stone et al 2016 the sole microbially active zone is the excavation disturbed zone edz around the horizontal emplacement tunnels where for a limited time the presence of small cracks could provide viable space for srb and hence sulphate may be reduced to sulphide a portion of the generated sulphide precipitates as mackinawite in the edz due to solubility constraints while the rest is transported either towards the canister or away from the canister into the opa solute transport in the buffer and in the opa is dominated by diffusion since advection is negligible gimmi et al 2007 mazurek et al 2011 wersin et al 2013 mazurek and haller 2017 yu et al 2018 wersin et al 2018 at the canister surface sulphide is consumed instantaneously and completely by a reaction with copper canister corrosion is controlled by the rate of sulphide transport towards the canister surface king et al 2017 and is therefore proportional to the time integrated sulphide flux 3 main model assumptions and simplifications the following assumptions and simplifications are also common to both models the repository near field is represented using a 1 d cylindrical geometry fig 1 all materials except the canister are represented as porous equivalent compartments with homogenous and isotropic transport properties properties of the bentonite buffer are based on those of wyoming mx 80 bentonite srb activity is restricted to the edz which is assumed to be viable for the entire period of consideration compartments are fully water saturated and isothermal the short initial thermal phase is ignored mass transfer is by diffusion advection being negligible in every compartment a single total porosity is assumed while all aqueous species share the same effective diffusion coefficient sulphide reaching the canister surface is consumed instantaneously and completely by a reaction with copper therefore canister corrosion rate is limited by transport of sulphide to the canister surface 4 description of the models 4 1 reactive transport model rtm 4 1 1 geochemical model pekala et al 2019a

and chemical reactions are solved in a one step global implicit manner the calculations consider a 1d cylindrical model domain fig 1 a constant opa pore water composition is assumed at the external model boundary table 1 although the canister is included in the model geometry to correctly represent dimensions and volumes in a cylindrical geometry it is considered both chemically inert except implicitly for the corrosion reaction and impermeable sulphide consumption at the canister surface is simplistically represented by defining an arbitrary small space single cell of 1 cm length within the outer canister surface in which this reaction takes place all calculations are performed up to 1 million years 4 2 simplified model sm the equations underlying the sm and their derivation are presented in appendix a as electronic supplementary data below the model is briefly described in terms of the main processes and their implementation the main fluxes and processes represented in the sm are illustrated schematically in fig 2 at the start of the calculation celestite initially present in the edz dissolves instantaneously and completely and the sulphate thus released is reduced instantaneously and completely to sulphide the aqueous concentration of sulphide in the edz is subject to a user defined solubility constraint the mass of the produced sulphide which is in excess of the solubility level precipitates as mackinawite due to the initial sulphate depletion in the edz dissolved sulphate from the buffer and from the opa diffuses towards the edz the diffusive sulphate fluxes from the buffer to the edz and from the opa to the edz are calculated assuming pseudo steady state a sequence of steady states in time in the calculation of the sulphate flux spatial steady state distributions of dissolved sulphate concentrations are used with diffusion distances determined by the transient positions of the dissolution fronts within these media the fraction of dissolved sulphide produced in the edz i e sulphide not precipitated as mackinawite can diffuse towards the canister and into the opa as in the case of diffusive sulphate flux the diffusive flux of sulphide from the edz towards the canister is approximated considering a time sequence of steady states of sulphide concentration distributions in the buffer in cylindrical coordinates the diffusive sulphide flux from the edz to the opa is based on a 1d cartesian steady state sulphide concentration profile with the diffusion distance taken to be the distance from the centre of the tunnel to the upper or lower host rock boundaries the rate of canister corrosion is proportional to the diffusive sulphide flux from the edz to the canister srb activity is restricted to the edz while sulphate concentrations in the buffer and in the opa are solubility limited as a result dissolution fronts develop in these media separating areas enriched and depleted in sulphate minerals the dissolution fronts migrate over time away from the interfaces of their respective media with the edz as schematically shown in fig 2 as discussed earlier section 2 due to limited importance advective transport is not considered in the present calculations in a general case however it is possible to calculate advective flux of sulphate from the opa to the edz and of sulphide from the edz to the opa the formulae for calculating these advective fluxes are presented in cloet et al 2017 5 parameterisation and calculation cases parameter values used jointly by the rtm and sm are shown in table 2 calculation cases considered in this study together with their corresponding parameter values are shown in table 3 the rtm cases rtm dom rtm sulf and rtm srb are defined based on scoping calculations and represent three distinct regimes whereby sulphide production is controlled by 1 slow som dissolution and limited dom transport to the edz 2 limited sulphate transport to the edz and 3 limited srb activity under full availability of sulphate and dom respectively in addition an rtm case rtm red table 3 is considered whereby the chemical system is simplified and parameter values are adjusted in order to approximate as far as possible the behaviour of the sm the purpose of this model is to bridge the rtm and sm calculation cases and to allow the behaviour of these two different models to be meaningfully compared in the rtm red case only three dissolved species are included sulphate dom and sulphide with no aqueous speciation the initial dissolved concentrations of sulphate in the buffer and opa edz correspond to the total dissolved concentrations reported in table 1 for the rtm these concentrations are maintained by dummy mineral phases representing gypsum and celestite and characterized by fixed solubilities the contents of these minerals gypsum and celestite are also shown in table 1 in order to approximate the sm the concentration of dom and som dissolution rate are set high so that dom availability does not limit sulphide production the som content is also fixed at a sufficiently high value that it is never consumed anywhere in the model domain during the simulation furthermore the maximum intrinsic rate of srb activity k srb in eq 6 is such that it is never rate limiting for sulphide production even at high concentration of dom consequently the effective srb activity in the edz is controlled by the transport of sulphate in an analogous way to the rtm sulf case dissolved sulphide concentrations are limited to 10 4 mol l by the precipitation of a dummy mackinawite mineral moreover three special cases are studied using the rtm where the concentration of sulphide in the edz is maintained constant at three distinct values 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 mol l cases rtm c1 rtm c2 and rtm c3 table 3 respectively these calculation cases aim to evaluate the effect of time dependent diffusion as compared with the sequence of steady states assumed by the sm for the sm three calculation cases are studied considering sulphide solubility limits in the edz of 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 mol l cases sm s1 sm s2 and sm s3 table 3 respectively 6 results and discussion the discussion of the two models focuses first section 6 1 on the main differences that can be identified based on the descriptions presented in section 4 these key differences are illustrated using selected results calculated by the two models in section 6 2 additional aspects of the models are briefly presented thereafter sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths calculated by the simplified and reactive transport models are discussed in section 6 3 6 1 comparison of key model features comparing the assumptions and simplifications underpinning the sm and the rtm section 4 it can be seen that the former makes simplifying assumptions regarding the following a representation of diffusive transport b control of sulphide production rate in the edz c control of sulphide concentration in the edz these aspects are discussed in detail below 6 1 1 diffusive transport unlike in the rtm where the time dependent diffusion equation is solved the sm approximates diffusive transport by a sequence of pseudo steady states fig 3 shows a comparison of the canister corrosion depths calculated by the sm cases sm s1 sm s2 and sm s3 and by the rtm cases assuming a fixed sulphide concentration in the edz cases rt c1 rt c2 rt c3 the figure indicates that for a given sulphide solubility limit in the edz the canister corrosion depths calculated by the rtm cases lag behind those calculated by the sm during the initial several thousand years and converge thereafter this is due to transient time dependent initially slower diffusive transport calculated in the rtm cases after approximately ten thousand years the two models yield practically identical results as steady state diffusive profiles across the buffer are established and as the initially accrued sulphide fluxes become progressively insignificant a time integrated effect over the assessment time frame of one million years the transient transport effects associated with the rtm are short and of little significance to the final results the above is further corroborated by fig 4 which compares the dissolved sulphate concentration profiles in the opa calculated by the rtm rtm red with the steady state concentrations calculated by the sm at selected times coincidence of the symbols rtm with the solid lines sm shows that at the indicated times sulphate transport in the opa calculated by the rtm is at near steady state it can therefore be concluded that by assuming a sequence of steady states the sm is conservative in the sense that it tends to over estimate diffusive transport of both sulphate to the edz and sulphide to the canister however the effect becomes insignificant on the scales of tens and hundreds of thousands of years 6 1 2 rate of sulphide production in the edz the sm assumes that sulphide production in the edz due to srb activity is controlled by the transport of sulphate while the availability of the electron donor is never rate limiting for the srb furthermore in the sm sulphate reduction in the edz is instantaneous and complete in contrast in the rtm the rate of sulphide production due to srb activity depends on the specific model parameterisation assumed especially the rate of som dissolution the intrinsic rate of srb activity the solubility of som and gypsum and material diffusivity in a general case three scenarios can be envisaged where the rate of sulphide production is defined by the rate of slow som dissolution and limited dom transport to the edz rtm dom limited sulphate transport to the edz rtm sulf limited srb activity under full availability of sulphate and dom rtm srb these sulphide production regimes are represented by the rtm dom rtm sulf and rtm srb calculation cases respectively fig 5 note that for all three scenarios model transport parameters are the same as defined in section 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the scenario where sulphide production in the edz is controlled by the transport of sulphate rtm sulf results in the highest sulphide production rates locally at the contact with the buffer and opa these increased sulphide production rates lead to elevated dissolved sulphide concentrations and enhanced sulphide fluxes to the canister as discussed in the following section in addition the comparison of the global sulphide production calculated for the three scenarios section 6 2 further supports the assertion that the reactive transport case where sulphide production in the edz is controlled by the transport of sulphate rtm sulf leads to highest overall sulphide production note that for both rtm dom and rtm sulf the srb reaction rate is taken to be the same despite this the latter yields much higher sulphide production this is because of the relative concentrations of sulphate and dom the former being ca 1000 times greater than the latter and the related fluxes to the edz 6 1 3 dissolved sulphide concentration in the edz the sm calculation cases sm s1 sm s2 sm s3 and the rtm case rtm red consider a fixed modeller defined sulphide solubility limit in the edz table 3 in contrast in the rtm calculations rtm dom rtm sulf and rtm srb sulphide concentration in the edz is calculated according to eq 7 as a function of ph and the concentration of fe2 aq assuming equilibrium with mackinawite as discussed in pekala et al 2019a ph evolution in the edz depends on the rate of acidification due to srb activity the rate of diffusive mass transfer with adjacent regions especially the transport of protons carbonates and dissolved fe and the rate of buffering by chemical reactions mainly by calcite precipitation the effect of srb activity rate is particularly important other factors being equal faster srb activity generates lower ph values and increases sulphide concentration under mackinawite equilibrium fig 6 which is especially pronounced in the rtm sulf case this is relevant as sulphide concentrations in the edz directly define sulphide fluxes to the canister as shown in fig 7 for the rtm dom case 6 2 other aspects of the models the rtm represents the dissolved and solid sulphate and sulphide inventories e g the dissolved sulphate and gypsum or celestite explicitly while in the sm the two inventories are lumped into the solid therefore for example if the total initial sulphate inventories are to be represented consistently there will be a difference in the solid sulphate inventories gypsum in the buffer and celestite in the opa edz between the two models note that the dissolved sulphate in the buffer porewater in equilibrium with gypsum constitutes about 40 of the bulk buffer sulphate the sum of dissolved and as gypsum in the opa the dissolved sulphate in equilibrium with celestite is about 20 of the bulk sulphate content in the simplified model the dissolved equilibrium sulphate value derived from the geochemical model table 1 was added to the solid sulphate inventory as an equivalent wt of the solid consequently in comparison to the rtm the sm features ca 65 wt more gypsum in the buffer and ca 23 wt more celestite in the edz opa the effect of this initial difference in sulphate inventories is observable in the sulphate consumption rates predicted by the sm and by the rtm red case as shown in fig 8 note that all sm cases yield the same result it can be seen in fig 8 that the time to complete gypsum consumption in the buffer predicted by the case rtm red is shorter than the time predicted by the sm it should be further noted that this is despite the slower time dependent diffusive transport calculated by the rtm which as discussed in section 6 1 1 is relevant during this time likewise the propagation of the celestite dissolution front into the opa is also somewhat faster in the rtm case rt red than in the sm overall however this effect is limited in the present model set up both the rtm and the sm allow a global and local mass balance of the consumed sulphate and the generated sulphide to be evaluated in the case of the rtm this is inherent to the mass conservation equation solved the mass balance includes the dissolved solid and exchanged masses in the sm the mass of sulphide produced is calculated from the mass of sulphate consumed within a given time increment the mass of consumed solid sulphate is considered instantaneously converted into sulphide this implies instant transfer of the dissolved sulphate to the edz the dissolved sulphate mass is therefore ignored in this calculation this effect is negligible at early times when the distances for diffusive transport are short but increases gradually later when the celestite dissolution front retreats deeper into the opa fig 9 shows this by comparing the sm predictions with the rtm case rtm red at one million years the difference in the global mass of sulphide produced is however relatively small 173 mol or several percent of the total sulphide produced as discussed earlier the sm performs mass balance on sulphate and sulphide because of continued srb activity in the edz sulphide precipitated as mackinawite is always present in the edz controlling dissolved sulphide concentrations therefore under the specific conditions considered here the tracking of sulphide mass is not critical as the system could be simply represented by a constant sulphide concentration in the edz however under different circumstances e g where srb activity stops or is greatly reduced following an initial period of bacterial activity such sulphide mass tracking is necessary to correctly represent continued sulphide fluxes to the canister due to mackinawite re dissolution 6 3 sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths having compared key aspects of the rtm and the sm sulphide fluxes to the canister and canister corrosion depths predicted by the models fig 10 can be discussed in the sm all sulphate initially present in the edz including as celestite is at the start of the calculation instantaneously converted to sulphide and precipitated as mackinawite subject to a fixed assumed solubility constraint it should be further noted that as sulphate transport to the edz never ceases during the simulation large reservoir of celestite in opa sulphide production and mackinawite precipitation and therefore sulphide solubility control continue at all times in combination with the steady state diffusive transport assumption this results in constant sulphide fluxes from the edz to the canister surface fig 10 shows that sulphide fluxes calculated by the rtm are initially very low and increase steeply during the initial several hundred years as discussed previously section 6 1 1 this initial sulphide flux is due to the time dependent diffusive transport and the build up of steady state concentration distributions across the buffer following the initial increase sulphide fluxes predicted by the different rtm cases undergo a transient phase that lasts up to ca 100 000 years note that as discussed in section 6 1 3 sulphide fluxes to the canister predicted by the rtm are a direct function of dissolved sulphide concentrations in the edz during this time the fluxes to the canister fig 10 top are controlled by the shifting sulphide solubility in the edz fig 11 therefore for example the relatively high sulphide concentrations in the edz calculated for the rtm sulf case are the result of fast srb activity and increased sulphide solubility under decreased porewater ph this is expected to translate into enhanced sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths after about 100 000 years the rtm predicts the establishment of a near steady state due to a combination of diffusive transport and chemical ph buffering following that corrosion becomes a linear function of time as in the sm 7 conclusions following repository closure sulphide production by srb in the near field of the planned repository is conceivable and its potential impact on the performance of the copper coated disposal canister requires a quantitative evaluation due to complexity of the processes involved and presence of uncertainties realistic quantitative predictions of srb mediated sulphide generation in the repository near field are currently not possible especially over time scales relevant to safety assessment pekala et al 2019a however pessimistic estimates based on conservative modelling of processes and conservative parameter value selection are feasible simplistic mass balance calculations yield unrealistically high corrosion depth estimates in the order of millimetres we discuss the relative advantages of two more sophisticated models and how they can be jointly used in the context of the repository safety assessment quantitative comparison of the two models is performed for a specific srb activity scenario based on a shared conceptual process model relative to the simplified semi analytical model sm the reactive transport model rtm offers a flexible and generalised framework within which a variety of disposal concepts e g geometries and conceptual srb activity models can be evaluated by employing a mechanistic representation the rtm can be used to identify system controlling processes and offers quantitative insights into the complex behaviour characteristic of srb activity in the near field on the other hand the rtm calculations are more time and resource consuming and require considerable expertise furthermore they are often characterized by a large number of parameters some of which are not well constrained in comparison the sm replaces conceptual and parametric uncertainties with extra layers of conservativism this simplifies model structure and helps increase the transparency of the results moreover the sm calculations are fast to carry out which lends itself to probabilistic and parametric studies a single sm calculation is performed in approximately 15 s on a standard desktop computer compared to some 20 30 min required by the rtm using fast 20 processors on the university of bern cluster computer https docs id unibe ch ubelix therefore if run in series only ca 4 h computing time would be needed by the sm to produce 1000 realisations compared to 12 21 days for the rtm both the transparency and calculation speed are particularly attractive from the point of view of safety performance assessment calculations in addition the sm is flexible and formulae can be derived for a variety of conceptual scenarios of srb activity see cloet et al 2017 rtm calculations can be implemented at various levels of detail for example the geochemical model presented can be significantly and conservatively simplified e g as was done in the rtm red case this has the advantage of increasing the overall model transparency and readability however just as in the case of the sm it requires crucial model parameters sulphide solubility limits to be defined based on expert judgment or using external geochemical calculations the analysis performed indicates that for the same set of assumptions and model parameterisation especially the sulphide solubility limits the two models yield comparable results in terms of sulphide fluxes and canister corrosion depths minor differences between the model implementations e g representation of diffusive transport and mass balance calculation lead to small and mostly negligible differences in the results especially considering the overall model uncertainties and tend to be pessimistic in the sm the two presented models are complementary in particular expert judgment based estimates of a key parameter in the sm the solubility of sulphide in the edz can be better constrained based on the results of the rtm moreover system understanding derived from the rtm calculations can be used to support the choice of processes included in the sm for example analysis of the rtm calculations indicates that the implicit assumption underlying the sm that srb activity is limited only by the transport of sulphate to the edz is indeed conservative in terms of sulphide production and canister corrosion also comparison against the rtm shows that the simplifying assumption of steady state diffusion made by the sm is acceptable and has negligible effects for the results at 1 million years on the other hand once the conceptual model and its parameterisation have been established the sm model can be used to perform burdensome parameter sweep or probabilistic calculations in view of the present knowledge gaps both models tend to make conservative assumptions and therefore yield pessimistic estimates of possible corrosion of the cu canister coating due to sulphide pekala et al 2019a discuss the various types of conservative assumptions underlying the rtm including the nature of the sulphide solubility limiting mineral phase the availability of dom extractability and dissolution rate of som the source of fe for sulphide precipitation and the intrinsic rate of srb activity the ability of srb to utilise sulphate and dom similar assumptions but typically defined in a more conservative manner compared with the rtm are implicit to the sm for example the sm implicitly assumes that an electron donor for the sulphate reduction reaction is always available and never rate limiting in the rtm terminology this implies presence of excess dom concentration due to fast som dissolution and unlimited diffusive transport in section 6 1 2 we show that in combination with the assumption of fast intrinsic srb reaction rates such an assumption is conservative in a similar manner the sm implicitly assumes an unlimited availability of fe required for sulphide precipitation as mackinawite while in the rtm this is limited by the solubility of siderite in the opa and diffusive transport of fe the sm further assumes that the srb reaction rates are infinitely high instantaneous whereas this rate is finite in the rtm it should be mentioned that both models are conservative in terms of the rate of srb activity which over the assessment period of 1 million years is assumed to be limited only by the availability of sulphate and dom for instance cracks in the edz which are assumed to provide the habitable space for srb are only expected to remain open during the relatively short thermal period following that period saturation of the edz with water is expected to seal the cracks thus preventing further srb activity other factors such as toxic effects of sulphide or insufficient availability of trace metals needed for bacterial metabolism might further inhibit bacterial growth in the present paper the two models are discussed in view of a specific application case however variants to this conceptual model can readily be accommodated by both models for example srb activity in the buffer and sulphide generation directly at the canister surface can easily be represented moreover if desired advective transport of sulphate and sulphide between the rock and the edz can also readily be incorporated into both models the implementation of these and other variations of the conceptual process model into the simplified semi analytical

1546,foams can be used to remediate aquifer pollution due to industrial leaks however when in contact with oily pollutants foams may collapse and thus have a very limited life time a suitable formulation of biodegradable foam that resists oil contact is therefore needed hence the ability of xanthan polymer and silica colloidal particles to stabilise foam against oil was investigated their performance in terms of stabilisation was evaluated via foam generation experiments in columns of porous medium conducted with and without oil the results show that the addition of xanthan polymer led to an increase in the viscosity of the solution which thwarted the formation of foam it did not improve the resistance of foam to oil but increased altogether the resistance factor up to more than twice the original value concerning silica particles it was demonstrated that they both noticeably increased resistance factor and moderately stabilised foam against oil by 20 at optimum concentration as such this study presents a new way to reinforce foam against oil for soil remediation issues graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foam porous media xanthan colloidal particle light non aqueous phase liquid soil remediation 1 introduction when a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl an organic contaminant such as hydrocarbon is spilled it can percolate due to gravity into the ground and reach an aquifer it is then dispersed contaminating the aquifer a potential source of drinkable water and harming aquatic living organisms the possible consequences in terms of public health and environmental issues are numerous and dire and the removal of lnapl is crucial several remediation strategies can be used to reduce the existing pollution there are two main categories of these ex situ remediation techniques which consist in excavating the pollution in order to treat it and in situ techniques which do not require soil displacement the latter approaches can thus be applied to a broader range of sites but may present more technical difficulties of the available solutions for in situ remediation gas sparging and flushing are most commonly used they consist of injecting gas or a surfactant solution respectively into the porous media to mobilise the pollutant and pump it afterwards however due to the low viscosity of the fluids viscous fingering is observed and fluids preferentially flow in high permeability layers due to its interesting mobility control properties foam has been considered for use in aquifer remediation hirasaki et al 1997 portois et al 2018 liquid foam is a dispersion of gas in liquid and is stabilised by amphiphilic molecules called surfactants because of their amphiphilic nature surfactants adsorb at the gas water interface decrease interfacial tension and stabilise lamellae and gas bubbles as gas becomes trapped in water its mobility is reduced mitigating channelling and gravity segregation apaydin and kovscek 2001 gas dispersion also increases fluid viscosity and in the case of heterogeneous porous media improves sweep efficiency by diverting the flow to low permeability regions tang and kovscek 2006 as a result the foam injection process has been proven to be more efficient than gas sparging or soil flushing by surfactant solutions alone osei bonsu et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 moreover foam is mainly composed of gas meaning that it also uses lower quantities of surfactant than soil flushing processes thus lowering environmental damage and being economically advantageous the use of foam can be considered for various remediation strategies one technique consists of injecting foam to push oil through the soil and to recover it afterward kilbane et al 1997 by selectively blocking high permeability areas of heterogeneous porous media the placement of foam allows for oil displacement in low permeability zones leading to higher sweep efficiency kovscek and bertin 2003 the capability of foam to invade even low permeability areas can also be exploited to deliver remedial amendments by transporting products such as phosphate or nanoscale zero valent iron shen et al 2011 foam facilitates a broad and homogeneous distribution of these chemicals into the porous media by reaching low permeability zones via foam displacement remedial amendments can react with polluting chemicals this reaction produces non toxic species hence providing the necessary treatment for soil remediation zhong et al 2011 another approach is to use foam to confine pollutants to a defined area before treating it portois et al 2018 finally foam can be used to block water beneath oil thus improving the selectivity of hydrocarbon pumping the present research focuses on this strategy when foam comes in contact with organic compounds its stability is largely affected regardless of the surfactants used this has been observed in both bulk and porous media almajid and kovscek 2016 and mainly depends on the interfacial tensions between oil gas and water this de foaming process takes place via complex mechanisms and recent theoretical efforts have been carried out to model it denkov 2004 manlowe and radke 1990 pointed out that the stability of foam in porous media is dependent on the stability of the pseudo emulsion film separating oil and gas bubbles this pseudo emulsion film ruptures whenever its drainage time is shorter than the contact time with oil since oil destabilises foam foam reinforcement is necessary in applications of this technique several additives have been used for this purpose including polymers and colloids binks et al 2017 hernando et al 2018 the aim of polymer addition is to increase the bulk solution viscosity of the aqueous phase inducing long term stability of the foam while the aim of adding colloidal particles is to create a mechanical barrier with the subsequent adsorption of particles onto the surface of the bubble sun et al 2014 however given the aim of soil remediation any negative impact of the surfactants or additives on the environment needs to be minimised and a choice of biodegradable chemical species with low toxicity is fundamental most surfactants that have already been proven to stabilise foams in the presence of oil are not environmentally friendly farajzadeh et al 2012 osei bonsu et al 2015 however due to their low cost such surfactants are usually favoured in enhanced oil recovery eor as it requires large quantities of surfactant thus an investigation of other types of surfactants is required and those from other industry fields can offer interesting alternatives among the potential biodegradable surfactants we focus here on a plant based surfactant called saponin as it has promising properties pradhan and bhattacharyya 2017 it has been used in solution for the removal of heavy metal and mixed contaminants via solubilisation and desorption of contaminants chen et al 2008 song et al 2008 it is one of the few biodegradable surfactants that has also been used in foam reinforced with colloidal solid particles for the stabilisation of food grade products binks et al 2017 of the environmentally friendly polymers that can be used as additives xanthan is a microbial biodegradable polysaccharide with no environmental or health hazards and is commonly used in the food industry and medical and environmental applications bilanovic et al 2016 zhong et al 2008 this product is well known for improving emulsion and the stability of colloidal dispersions as it increases the continuous phase viscosity and is thixotropic it presents a very high viscosity at low shear rates or even a yield stress limit and highly shear thinning behaviour at higher shear rates martínez padilla et al 2015 zhong et al 2013 although xanthan may slightly decrease foamability martínez padilla et al 2015 it has been used by many authors to improve the bulk stability of foams pu et al 2017 both with and without oil sun et al 2015 it has also been shown that xanthan helps foam to improve oil recovery in core experiments sun et al 2015 wei et al 2018 hence xanthan was chosen as the reference polymer in the present study another way to reinforce the resistance of foam to oil is through the use of solid colloidal particles many particles of various types shapes and physico chemical properties are currently used including alumina particles yang et al 2017 fly ash nanoparticles eftekhari et al 2015 and silica particles nguyen et al 2014 singh and mohanty 2015 all of which have been tested in the presence of oil however their environmental impact varies with their chemical nature silica particles are natural products that have been used in food grade applications dickinson 2010 in order to include them in solution they can be made partially hydrophobic through an appropriate surface treatment and they are used with surfactants to increase foam stability although they may decrease foamability in comparison with the surfactant alone sun et al 2014 tang et al 1989 zhang et al 2008 this justifies the choice of sio2 particles to test foam reinforcement in this work although some experiments have previously been performed in bulk to study the resistance of foam to oil aveyard et al 1994 only a few have successfully been applied in porous media bai et al 2018 singh and mohanty 2015 sun et al 2014 moreover these were used only for eor applications rather than for environmental purposes the main goal of this study is therefore to investigate the influence of polymer or solid particles on foam stability and flow resistance in porous media containing residual oil since field applications involve the blocking effects of foam on water this study focuses on both the sweeping efficiency and the foam water content only environmentally friendly products were used and the different foams were tested both in the absence and the presence of oil in columns filled with a porous medium the injection parameters were first optimised to obtain the strongest foam and these foams were then reinforced with xanthan polymer or silica solid particles and tested in oil free and oil containing porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in this study all selected surfactants were biodegradable and presented no environmental hazard as specified by their safety data sheet

terms of additives commercial fncs xanthan was supplied by jungbunzlauer austria ag the colloidal silica particles ludox tm 50 sigma aldrich france had a nominal size of 30 nm as measured by orts gil et al 2011 the pollutant oil was macron 1821 f 4 from houghton us with a density of 0 818 at t 20 c compressed nitrogen n2 purity 99 999 was supplied by air liquide france and was used to avoid potential oxidation of the chemicals by o2 and to control the level of purity of the gas 2 2 experimental facilities in order to measure the viscosity of the aqueous solutions with xanthan five solutions with xanthan concentrations of 100 to 500 ppm were prepared and their shear viscosity was first measured at various shear rates by means of a kinexus controlled stress rheometer malvern instruments uk with a peltier cylinder cartridge all the samples were prepared with tap water the shear viscosity was measured at 20 c 0 1 c with a measurement range of between 1 and 1000 s 1 values at a shear rate of 12 5 s 1 corresponding to the newtonian plateau were used to plot the shear rate versus the concentration of xanthan as the native solid particle suspensions were in an aggregated state they were systematically submitted to ultrasonic solicitation using ultrasonic bath equipment for 10 min fisherbrand elmasonic fisher scientific france the experimental setup used for the coreflood experiments is presented in fig 1 a phd ultra piston pump harvard apparatus us was used to inject the aqueous solutions the gas flow rate was controlled by a mass flow meter el flow bronkhorst france under nominal conditions gas and aqueous solutions were co injected into the column the column was a transparent pvc tube of length 40 cm and inner diameter 4 4 cm which was sealed with nylon caps at the inlet and outlet a length of 40 cm was long enough to minimise the entrance and capillary end effects as suggested in the literature eftekhari and farajzadeh 2017 the column was filled with sand from cantillana france containing 98 4 sio2 grains with a d50 of 279 μm and a particle size distribution as shown in fig 2 cantillana sas 2019 the pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of the column was measured with a differential transducer rosemount 2051 coplanar emerson france and values were recorded every 10 s 2 3 experimental procedure various experimental tests were performed in this study and these are presented in table 1 with the experimental approaches used 2 3 1 surfactant solutions all experiments were performed at room temperature all foaming solutions were prepared using tap water with an ionic strength of below 10 2 m before use all aqueous solutions were stirred at 400 rpm for at least 10 min except for the xanthan solutions which required 12 h to ensure the complete dissolution of the polymer in water all dispersions of solid particles were prepared by mechanical dispersion in a given amount of water before sonication for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath in parallel the surfactant solutions were prepared by dissolution or dilution in the same amount of water the two were then blended in convenient volume proportions 2 3 2 coreflood tests for the coreflood experiments the column was placed vertically and water and sand were gradually introduced by adding 2 cm of water and 2 cm of sand alternately gentle manual shaking was applied throughout the procedure to uniformly pack the sand grains the sand packing porosity was calculated based on the exact amount of water and sand used the column was then placed horizontally and the absolute permeability was determined using darcy s law by imposing various flow rates and measuring the pressure drop along the column to saturate the medium and to cause surfactant adsorption on the sand grains 3 3 pore volumes pv of solution were injected prior to co injection similar procedures have previously been followed by other authors del campo estrada et al 2015 eftekhari and farajzadeh 2017 jones et al 2016 to ensure that any surfactant injected during co injection only serves for foaming process for each surfactant the gas and foaming solution were co injected into the column at a variable total flow rate q tot the liquid and gas n2 flow rates were varied to reach a target foam quality fq q gas q tot while recording the induced pressure drop every 10 s during co injection two main parameters were observed to determine the foam properties the resistance factor rf eq 1 and the water saturation s w eq 2 these are defined as follows 1 rf δ p f δ p w qtot where δp f and δp w are the pressure drops measured along the core when the foam and water are flowing respectively and 2 s w v w pv where v w is the volume occupied by the aqueous phase in the porous medium in the presence of the polymer a modified resistance factor rf is calculated eq 3 to subtract the pure polymer viscosifying effect of the aqueous phase this represents the ratio of the pressure drop of the foam δp f to that of the continuous phase cp δp cp at the same total flow rate rather than water 3 rf δ p f δ p cp qtot rf is related to the foam strength the higher the rf the higher the lamella density and thus the stronger the foam meanwhile s w represents the amount of water remaining in the porous medium a low value of s w reflects a high efficiency of the foam in terms of displacing water and shall reflect a decrease in water mobility through the foam the standard error for rf values was measured for three typical experiments and it was found to be 0 68 with 3 2 cmc surfactant alone with four replicates and 1 2 for 3 2 cmc 1 wt sio2 in triplicate meanwhile the standard error for rf with 3 2 cmc 200 ppm xanthan was measured to be 0 21 the standard errors for the two other experiments were measured to be 0 4 data not shown this set of standard errors demonstrates the reliability of the measurements 2 3 2 1 experiments in the presence of oil in these experiments the column was initially completely saturated with oil rather than water and the procedure described above was followed water was injected until no oil was produced allowing us to calculate the remaining oil saturation this procedure led to a system at residual oil saturation a situation encountered in the field at the interface between the aquifer and the lnapl to satisfy the conditions for surfactant adsorption 3 3 pv of surfactant solution were injected before foam injection 2 3 2 2 experiments with the addition of polymer several solutions were prepared at fixed saponin concentration 3 2 cmc to perform column experiments on the addition of polymer based on results in the literature pu et al 2017 zhong et al 2013 a broad range of polymer concentrations of between 0 and 500 ppm was chosen to test the influence of polymer concentration on foam behaviour experiments were then performed with oil two foaming solutions with different polymer concentrations were prepared and were co injected with gas into columns in a state of residual oil saturation the polymer concentrations were chosen so that the same range of concentrations could be scanned as for the experiments without oil 2 3 2 3 experiments with the addition of particles for these experiments the range of particle concentrations was suggested by data in the literature usually reaching a maximum of 1 wt binks et al 2017 binks et al 2007 lv et al 2017 under comparable physico chemical conditions but with different systems experiments were performed following the same experimental procedure first without and then with oil 3 results 3 1 choice of surfactant this first set of column experiments was performed in order to compare the saponin surfactant to two other surfactants previously used in the literature for similar purposes osei bonsu et al 2015 simjoo et al 2013 table 2 summarises the values of rf and s w obtained in the steady state for the three selected surfactants it is observed that both rf and s w depend on the surfactant used based on its low s w sdhp is expected to be a promising surfactant but its rf is below 10 which may lead to a weak foam ch has a moderate rf but a high s w making it uninteresting for the purposes of application meanwhile saponin shows both a relatively high rf and a low s w and was therefore selected at this stage for further experiment 3 2 optimisation of injection parameters this surfactant hierarchy is based on injection experiments performed at a single q tot and a given foam quality the rf values may change at other flow rates in order to identify the best flow conditions analogous experiments were performed for a fixed saponin concentration of 3 2 cmc by varying both the foam quality and q tot over a wide interval the results are presented in terms of rf versus foam quality in fig 3 for all flow rates the curves show a region of increase that corresponds to the low quality regime where the pressure gradient is independent of the gas flow rate and a decreasing region that corresponds to the high quality regime where the pressure gradient is independent of the liquid flow rate this is in accordance with the findings of other authors studying chemically different surfactants osterloh and jante 1992 the rf peak is located between 80 and 92 depending on the value of q tot and it appears that the optimum foam quality increases as flow rate increases moreover when the injection rate is high rf decreases with the injection rate this is in accordance with studies showing that foams of high quality are yield stress fluids with pronounced shear thinning behaviour denkov et al 2009 princen and kiss 1987 for low injection rates rf increases with the injection rate fig 4 shows the variation in s w as a function of foam quality by gathering all s w values available that correspond to any q tot values in the low quality regime s w decreases with the foam quality this indicates that as the foam quality increases the sweep efficiency becomes more effective and the amount of water remaining is consequently low for the strongest foams for which the quality is above 87 s w becomes almost constant as the amount of gas in the system increases the number of bubbles increases and the lamella thickness decreases at a critical level of gas the lamellae become too thin to be stable and collapse an equilibrium is then reached between the formation and destruction of lamella and the water saturation remains stable when plotted against the total flow rate q tot see fig 5 s w decreases with q tot in the low flow rate regime before reaching a limiting saturation at higher values of q tot this graph shows that unlike rf the values of s w directly depend on q tot and to a lesser extent on the foam quality for the remainder of the study and to maximise sweep efficiency the experimental conditions were chosen as a foam quality of 87 5 and q tot of 6 3 ml min 1 in summary the optimum foam quality and flow rate are defined to give a strong saponin foam in a porous medium with high rf and low s w this foam can then be reinforced with polymer in order to observe the resistance of the foam to oil and how it behaves when polymer is added 3 3 effects of the addition of polymer 3 3 1 oil free conditions an example of the rf and s w curves obtained as a function of the injected pv is presented in fig 6 similar curves were obtained for other xanthan concentrations in the beginning rf increases steadily while s w decreases linearly indicating a piston like foam displacement until gas breakthrough after this s w stabilises quickly as rearrangement of the foam takes place throughout the column as can be observed from the slight increase in rf after gas breakthrough and the subsequent steady state regime the final rf and s w values for various xanthan concentrations are shown in table 3 the first analysis concerns the onset of gas breakthrough bt i e the time of outgassing from the sand column it can be observed that bt sw is almost constant regardless of cx meaning that the time to breakthrough is mainly a consequence of the water content reached in presence of foam early breakthrough is a consequence of low gas saturation these results show that rf rises progressively with xanthan concentration cx however in contrast to the results in section 3 2 sw also increases indicating the effects of the addition of xanthan an opposite trend is seen for rf and rf table 3 as cx increases rf increases and rf decreases an in depth description of mechanism underlying the observed relationship between rf rf and s w is given in section 4 1 3 3 2 experiments in the presence of oil similar experiments were performed with oil to observe the resistance of the foam against oil induced destruction in these experiments s i o corresponds to the oil saturation immediately before foam injection which varies from one experiment to another measurements taken after foam injection showed that the oil saturation remained almost constant during the experiment the results for the presence of oil are shown in table 4 together with the results for xanthan free solutions when rf is considered a significant loss is observed compared to experiments in the absence of oil indeed rf decreases rapidly with xanthan concentration and it is likely that the foam bubbles are collapsing in contact with oil compared to the use of polymers it is well known that solid colloidal particles can efficiently stabilise both foams and emulsions against coalescence singh and mohanty 2015 these pickering like foams are of increasing interest to researchers and most studies concern the determination of the optimum physico chemical conditions of a given system in the following a preliminary evaluation of the ability of colloidal sio2 particles to efficiently stabilise foams is presented for porous media in the absence or presence of oil 3 4 addition of solid colloidal particles 3 4 1 optimisation of foam particle mixture 3 4 1 1 effects of surfactant concentration in oil free conditions since the addition of xanthan did not lead to foam reinforcement against oil i e rf did not increase colloidal particles were considered for use in formulating an oil resistant foam native sio2 colloidal particles were chosen to perform coreflood experiments before reinforcement with colloidal particles the influence of the surfactant concentration cs on sweep efficiency was investigated for a saponin surfactant cs was varied between 3 2 cmc and 15 cmc for a foam quality of 87 5 and q tot 6 3 ml min 1 the obtained values of rf and s w are shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 rf and s w are well correlated as cs is increased to 10 cmc rf increases and s w decreases this behaviour is characteristic of foams that become stronger with more efficient sweeping conversely when the concentration is high enough e g 15 cmc rf drops and s w rises indicating less efficient sweeping further explanations of the mechanisms involved are given in section 4 2 3 4 1 2 effects of colloidal particle concentration in oil free systems for a given 3 2 cmc saponin foam the effect of silica particle concentration on the properties of the foam was studied in these experiments two concentrations of sio2 were used table 5 shows the obtained values of rf and s w as can be seen from table 5 the addition of particles at 1 wt does not change the values of s w or rf an increase in rf is observed when silica is added at 0 5 wt without modifying the sw value 3 4 1 3 optimal addition of particles in an oil free system given the previous results on the importance of surfactant concentration the saponin concentration was then changed to 10 cmc while maintaining a sio2 concentration of 0 5 wt when solid particles are added at 10 cmc rf increases from 15 9 to 20 4 but s w remains unchanged at 0 32 in comparison with saponin alone table 6 this indicates that the particles do not change the macroscopic foam structure and that the sweep efficiency remains the same as the ultimate goal was to develop foam formulations that resist oil induced destruction within porous media core experiments were performed in the presence of oil 3 4 2 experiments in the presence of oil in the same way as the oil free system the effect of surfactant concentration was investigated in experiments with oil when the surfactant concentration is increased from 3 2 cmc to 10 cmc rf increases from 3 6 to 6 3 with oil see table 6 in the oil free system the addition of 0 5 wt sio2 substantially increases rf especially for 10 cmc saponin solutions thus 10 cmc 0 5 wt sio2 was used in experiments in the presence of oil the results show an increase in rf from 6 3 without particles to 7 7 when silica is added at 0 5 wt see table 6 in these experiments both s i o and s w remain the same and are similar to those for the oil free experiments in which s w remains unchanged to obtain a comprehensive overview of these experiments the main results for the addition of sio2 particles are presented in fig 8 the effects of surfactant concentration with and without oil can be observed the increase in rf with increasing surfactant concentration is linked to a decrease in s w in the absence of oil the importance of particle addition is also shown in the figure it causes an increase in rf in the presence of oil while s w remains unchanged 4 discussion 4 1 polymer effect the first analysis concerns the shear viscosity values obtained at 12 5 s 1 when the values obtained at different xanthan concentrations are compared with those reported by other authors zhong et al 2013 they appear to be low however the use of tap water implies the presence of ions and particularly cations according to zhong et al 2013 this concentration of cations leads to a decrease in the viscosity of xanthan solutions this phenomenon is explained by the ionic neutralisation of the local anionic charges of xanthan leading to a molecular contraction and hence lower viscosity regarding the variation in rf it can be shown that the overall resistance factor rf for polymer foams has two contributions the first is a structural contribution rf that mainly depends on the number density of the bubbles their size and the interface rheology which itself relies on the possible interaction between polymer and surfactant molecules the second is a continuous phase contribution due to the bulk viscosity by increasing cx the relative continuous phase viscosity δp polymer δp w increases thus increasing rf inside the column as confirmed by the increase in shear viscosity phenomenologically when a hydrosoluble polymer and a surfactant are simultaneously present the foaming process is believed to occur as follows hernando et al 2018 after the mechanical creation of the gas liquid interface a process of coalescence immediately occurs within this period however the surfactant molecule reaches the gas liquid interface preventing coalescence in the presence of the polymer the process of collapse in the early foaming stages is delayed due to polymer induced steric repulsion in the liquid films as a consequence the surfactant molecules have a longer time to reach the interface hence promoting the foaming process however depending on the type of interaction between the polymer and the surfactant surfactant molecules may not be free to reach the interface in fact in the case of a strong surfactant polymer interaction a surfactant polymer complex is formed that slows down adsorption at the surface decreases the amount of free monomers in solution and thus decreases foamability this strong interaction can be found for surfactants and polymers of opposite charge petkova et al 2012 conversely in the case of a weakly interacting system surfactant monomers can quickly adsorb at the surface during foaming and the polymer stabilises the new lamella via steric repulsion thus improving foamability a system of this type can be found with a non ionic polymer and a charged surfactant petkova et al 2012 meanwhile for non interacting systems the foamability is thwarted by mitigation of the interface creation rate and a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in this case no polymer co adsorption on the surfactant or change of gas water interfacial tension is expected hernando et al 2016 petkova et al 2012 a loss of foamability even of limited magnitude is accompanied by a gain in stability the obtained films are thicker than when the surfactant is used alone and have a low drainage velocity and lamellae that contain polymers are stabilised by long range steric interactions gochev 2015 in this situation it is likely that a weaker foam is created with thicker lamellae leading to higher s w early breakthrough and lower rf the rf s w and breakthrough variations observed in the present study also reveal difficulties in foam formation a phenomenon that could be due to the formation of a surfactant polymer complex via strong interactions however in the present study xanthan and saponin are both non ionic chemicals whose interactions can take place via hydrogen bonding a weaker interaction than electrostatic bonding formation of a surfactant polymer complex may not explain the observed behaviour and it appears that the decrease in foam strength depends mainly on the continuous phase viscosity increase similar experiments were performed with oil to determine the potential oil resistance and to identify whether the foam creation mechanism observed previously was reproduced it appears that the expected stabilisation of foam against destruction by oil is not induced by xanthan addition the same degradation of the foam was observed by hernando et al 2016 in foams reinforced with non ionic polyacrylamide where it was shown that oil acted as a defoaming agent in an equivalent way to the oil free experiments the observed increase in rf is due only to the increase in the continuous phase viscosity and is hindered by structural loss of the foam as a corollary bt decreases and s w becomes significant in the presence of polymer overall it appears that the addition of xanthan to a saponin foaming solution results in an increase in the continuous phase viscosity that mitigates liquid drainage and thickens lamellae it also increases rf thanks to the viscous contribution but at the same time hinders the generation of foam leading to weaker foam in oil free sandpacks moreover no positive stabilisation effect was observed in the presence of oil as reported by shen et al 2006 it is therefore not a suitable way to increase foam strength in the presence of oil but can still be useful if the aim is only to increase the overall rf 4 2 surfactant concentration to interpret data from the variations in surfactant concentration the dynamic displacement of foam in porous media is considered in fact during foam flow lamellae are continuously stretched at the pore body and compressed at the pore throat where the distance between the walls is smaller as illustrated in fig 9 as surfactant unimers on gas liquid interface are in dynamic equilibrium with surfactant micelles compensation for the lack of surfactant molecules during the stretching period is more nearly instantaneous as cs increases this leads to lamellae that are more stable against breakage and stronger foam is transported along the core however above a certain value of cs the aqueous film may be depleted in the surfactant micelles compared to the nodes due to the important amount of surfactant present more space is available in the nodes for micelles to be packed in a situation that is not encountered at standard surfactant concentrations thus an additional attractive force of osmotic origin contributes to the disjoining pressure leading to the thinning of lamellae and coalescence of less resistant foams indeed according to jones et al 2016 relatively low surfactant concentrations are needed for stabilisation in bulk foam where large bubbles are formed with low gas water interface area conversely higher surfactant concentrations are necessary to obtain a similar surface coverage in porous media as the bubbles are of smaller size and of the same order of magnitude as pore bodies 4 3 particle addition the results for 3 2 cmc in the absence of oil show similar values of rf and s w without particles and with 1 wt sio2 table 5 suggesting that particles do not have any impact on how the foam rearranges itself inside the porous media it therefore appears as if the surfactant alone is responsible for foamability and foam stability however an increase in rf is noted when silica is introduced at only 0 5 wt with no significant increase in the aqueous phase viscosity the apparent aqueous phase viscosity was determined by measuring rf which was equal to rf implying that the pressure gradients during the flow of water or surfactant solution are the same thus both solutions have the same apparent viscosity the increase in rf suggests an improvement in gas water interface rheology when sio2 is added at this concentration for other systems it is usually reported that a loss of foam strength or equivalently rf is observed when the particle concentration exceeds a certain threshold value due to particle aggregation alyousef et al 2018 veyskarami and ghazanfari 2018 or surfactant adsorption on the surface of the particles thereby limiting the amount of available surfactant yang et al 2017 thus the limiting solid concentration should be below 1 wt the increase in rf that is observed when sio2 is added to a 3 2 or 10 cmc solution indicates a microscopic foam change this probably arises from particles gathering at the gas water interface as this would be promoted by a large number of surfactant molecules this in turn would strengthen the interface rigidity and induce a higher rf to interpret this finding it should be borne in mind that the best adsorption of solid colloids has been reported for partially hydrophobic particles with a ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic sites ratio that depends on the system of interest binks and horozov 2005 tang et al 1989 it is therefore possible that when free surfactant molecules are available to change the hydrophobicity of colloids this makes the adsorption of particles at gas water interface more energetically favourable thus increasing the interface rigidity as yang et al 2017 reported for a different system with the appropriate surface charges and right surfactant particle ratio surfactants could adsorb at the particle surface and improve the stability of the foam both the particle network created in the film and the adsorption of the modified particles at the interface contribute to the increase in the bulk stability of the foam and its blocking ability in porous media in the oil free system the correlation between surfactant concentration and rf increase is explained by the need for additional surfactant due to dynamic foam displacements in the presence of oil surfactant concentration and the increase in rf also seem to be correlated indeed since the surfactant is involved in the oil water emulsion a higher surfactant concentration is needed for the formation of foam the increase in rf when 0 5 wt sio2 is added to the solution in the presence of oil is similar to the results of oil recovery experiments by sun et al 2014 in which they added 0 5 wt sio2 to an sds foam although they reported a slightly higher increase the surfactant was different which could lead to different particle surfactant interactions and potentially stronger adsorption at the interface the subsequent increase in rf observed with the addition of particles suggests that colloidal particles do reach the gas water interface and create a barrier against the oil induced coalescence of bubbles this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 10 where the presence of oil leads to the foam collapsing in the absence of particles as particles are added to the formulation they adsorb at the interface rigidify it and stabilise the foam against the oil the thermodynamics of systems with solid particles constituting a rigid barrier at the gas water interface depends on the contact angle which itself relies on the degree of hydrophobicity of the particles when the gas water interface is covered by solid colloids they effectively mitigate the entry of oil droplets at the interface but this is in competition with the opposing capillary effect that takes place between adjacent adsorbed particles denkov 2004 4 4 applicability in the field if a foam is used as a blocking agent for water flow the value of s w should be as low as possible for the injection of foam into surficial aquifers the rf should be significantly higher than 1 for the foam to act as a sweeping agent but should not be too high due to injectivity constraints a value slightly lower than or close to 10 is acceptable for practical purposes maire et al 2018 portois et al 2018 it is shown in table 6 that for the optimised experiments these conditions are met with rf being close to 8 while the s w is quite low at around 0 36 in the presence of xanthan the obtained rf was lower than with particles 6 4 compared to 7 8 and it has been shown that this effect is mainly due to an increase in the viscosity of the fluid in lamellae while the foam itself seemed to be weakened this effect which is not clearly visible in 1d experiments should be visible in 2d experiments indeed in 2d or 3d situations a weak foam tends to lead to preferential pathways and thus to a low sweep efficiency therefore in order to reach an homogeneous foam distribution the addition of particles is preferable over xanthan polymer finally when considering foam technology for soil remediation several practical aspects should be taken into account such as the cost and possible technical issues since foam is mainly composed of gas the main cost of the procedure lies in the biodegradable surfactant and particles used silica particles are easily available and affordable whereas a biodegradable surfactant can be more expensive however apart from the cost of the surfactant the procedure is still shown to be less expensive easier and more feasible than other techniques in fact the bare ground needed for excavation is not necessary little equipment is needed and the sweeping efficiency is high thus foam is an ideal candidate for a heterogeneous porous medium particularly when compared to gas sparging or soil flushing several challenges still remain such as the development of oil resistant foams on a larger scale or the implementation of a push and pump technique in which foam would be injected into the same well where oil is pumped the use of foam is also still contraindicated in scenarios with fast flowing underground water as this technique is still under development finally even with a biodegradable surfactant used in food grade applications the addition of this chemical may impact the environment to some extent although the health and environmental issues caused by a pollutant are substantially more important than those of a biodegradable surfactant a risk assessment is always required 5 conclusions the objective of the present study was to obtain a biodegradable formulation consisting of surfactant and additives that can ensure the stability of foam in porous media in the presence of organic pollutants the findings of the present study can be summarised as follows saponin appears to be the most effective biodegradable surfactant of the three alternatives considered here coreflood experiments confirm the detrimental effects of oil on the stability of foam both in bulk and in porous media for all formulations studied the addition of xanthan is less efficient than colloidal solid particles for foam reinforcement as it increases only the continuous phase viscosity inducing an increase in flow resistance and a decrease in water saturation in this respect environmentally friendly interacting polymer surfactant systems may be of interest particle addition is shown to inhibit the destruction of foam in the presence of oil by creating a physical barrier at the gas water interface in the

1546,foams can be used to remediate aquifer pollution due to industrial leaks however when in contact with oily pollutants foams may collapse and thus have a very limited life time a suitable formulation of biodegradable foam that resists oil contact is therefore needed hence the ability of xanthan polymer and silica colloidal particles to stabilise foam against oil was investigated their performance in terms of stabilisation was evaluated via foam generation experiments in columns of porous medium conducted with and without oil the results show that the addition of xanthan polymer led to an increase in the viscosity of the solution which thwarted the formation of foam it did not improve the resistance of foam to oil but increased altogether the resistance factor up to more than twice the original value concerning silica particles it was demonstrated that they both noticeably increased resistance factor and moderately stabilised foam against oil by 20 at optimum concentration as such this study presents a new way to reinforce foam against oil for soil remediation issues graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords foam porous media xanthan colloidal particle light non aqueous phase liquid soil remediation 1 introduction when a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl an organic contaminant such as hydrocarbon is spilled it can percolate due to gravity into the ground and reach an aquifer it is then dispersed contaminating the aquifer a potential source of drinkable water and harming aquatic living organisms the possible consequences in terms of public health and environmental issues are numerous and dire and the removal of lnapl is crucial several remediation strategies can be used to reduce the existing pollution there are two main categories of these ex situ remediation techniques which consist in excavating the pollution in order to treat it and in situ techniques which do not require soil displacement the latter approaches can thus be applied to a broader range of sites but may present more technical difficulties of the available solutions for in situ remediation gas sparging and flushing are most commonly used they consist of injecting gas or a surfactant solution respectively into the porous media to mobilise the pollutant and pump it afterwards however due to the low viscosity of the fluids viscous fingering is observed and fluids preferentially flow in high permeability layers due to its interesting mobility control properties foam has been considered for use in aquifer remediation hirasaki et al 1997 portois et al 2018 liquid foam is a dispersion of gas in liquid and is stabilised by amphiphilic molecules called surfactants because of their amphiphilic nature surfactants adsorb at the gas water interface decrease interfacial tension and stabilise lamellae and gas bubbles as gas becomes trapped in water its mobility is reduced mitigating channelling and gravity segregation apaydin and kovscek 2001 gas dispersion also increases fluid viscosity and in the case of heterogeneous porous media improves sweep efficiency by diverting the flow to low permeability regions tang and kovscek 2006 as a result the foam injection process has been proven to be more efficient than gas sparging or soil flushing by surfactant solutions alone osei bonsu et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 moreover foam is mainly composed of gas meaning that it also uses lower quantities of surfactant than soil flushing processes thus lowering environmental damage and being economically advantageous the use of foam can be considered for various remediation strategies one technique consists of injecting foam to push oil through the soil and to recover it afterward kilbane et al 1997 by selectively blocking high permeability areas of heterogeneous porous media the placement of foam allows for oil displacement in low permeability zones leading to higher sweep efficiency kovscek and bertin 2003 the capability of foam to invade even low permeability areas can also be exploited to deliver remedial amendments by transporting products such as phosphate or nanoscale zero valent iron shen et al 2011 foam facilitates a broad and homogeneous distribution of these chemicals into the porous media by reaching low permeability zones via foam displacement remedial amendments can react with polluting chemicals this reaction produces non toxic species hence providing the necessary treatment for soil remediation zhong et al 2011 another approach is to use foam to confine pollutants to a defined area before treating it portois et al 2018 finally foam can be used to block water beneath oil thus improving the selectivity of hydrocarbon pumping the present research focuses on this strategy when foam comes in contact with organic compounds its stability is largely affected regardless of the surfactants used this has been observed in both bulk and porous media almajid and kovscek 2016 and mainly depends on the interfacial tensions between oil gas and water this de foaming process takes place via complex mechanisms and recent theoretical efforts have been carried out to model it denkov 2004 manlowe and radke 1990 pointed out that the stability of foam in porous media is dependent on the stability of the pseudo emulsion film separating oil and gas bubbles this pseudo emulsion film ruptures whenever its drainage time is shorter than the contact time with oil since oil destabilises foam foam reinforcement is necessary in applications of this technique several additives have been used for this purpose including polymers and colloids binks et al 2017 hernando et al 2018 the aim of polymer addition is to increase the bulk solution viscosity of the aqueous phase inducing long term stability of the foam while the aim of adding colloidal particles is to create a mechanical barrier with the subsequent adsorption of particles onto the surface of the bubble sun et al 2014 however given the aim of soil remediation any negative impact of the surfactants or additives on the environment needs to be minimised and a choice of biodegradable chemical species with low toxicity is fundamental most surfactants that have already been proven to stabilise foams in the presence of oil are not environmentally friendly farajzadeh et al 2012 osei bonsu et al 2015 however due to their low cost such surfactants are usually favoured in enhanced oil recovery eor as it requires large quantities of surfactant thus an investigation of other types of surfactants is required and those from other industry fields can offer interesting alternatives among the potential biodegradable surfactants we focus here on a plant based surfactant called saponin as it has promising properties pradhan and bhattacharyya 2017 it has been used in solution for the removal of heavy metal and mixed contaminants via solubilisation and desorption of contaminants chen et al 2008 song et al 2008 it is one of the few biodegradable surfactants that has also been used in foam reinforced with colloidal solid particles for the stabilisation of food grade products binks et al 2017 of the environmentally friendly polymers that can be used as additives xanthan is a microbial biodegradable polysaccharide with no environmental or health hazards and is commonly used in the food industry and medical and environmental applications bilanovic et al 2016 zhong et al 2008 this product is well known for improving emulsion and the stability of colloidal dispersions as it increases the continuous phase viscosity and is thixotropic it presents a very high viscosity at low shear rates or even a yield stress limit and highly shear thinning behaviour at higher shear rates martínez padilla et al 2015 zhong et al 2013 although xanthan may slightly decrease foamability martínez padilla et al 2015 it has been used by many authors to improve the bulk stability of foams pu et al 2017 both with and without oil sun et al 2015 it has also been shown that xanthan helps foam to improve oil recovery in core experiments sun et al 2015 wei et al 2018 hence xanthan was chosen as the reference polymer in the present study another way to reinforce the resistance of foam to oil is through the use of solid colloidal particles many particles of various types shapes and physico chemical properties are currently used including alumina particles yang et al 2017 fly ash nanoparticles eftekhari et al 2015 and silica particles nguyen et al 2014 singh and mohanty 2015 all of which have been tested in the presence of oil however their environmental impact varies with their chemical nature silica particles are natural products that have been used in food grade applications dickinson 2010 in order to include them in solution they can be made partially hydrophobic through an appropriate surface treatment and they are used with surfactants to increase foam stability although they may decrease foamability in comparison with the surfactant alone sun et al 2014 tang et al 1989 zhang et al 2008 this justifies the choice of sio2 particles to test foam reinforcement in this work although some experiments have previously been performed in bulk to study the resistance of foam to oil aveyard et al 1994 only a few have successfully been applied in porous media bai et al 2018 singh and mohanty 2015 sun et al 2014 moreover these were used only for eor applications rather than for environmental purposes the main goal of this study is therefore to investigate the influence of polymer or solid particles on foam stability and flow resistance in porous media containing residual oil since field applications involve the blocking effects of foam on water this study focuses on both the sweeping efficiency and the foam water content only environmentally friendly products were used and the different foams were tested both in the absence and the presence of oil in columns filled with a porous medium the injection parameters were first optimised to obtain the strongest foam and these foams were then reinforced with xanthan polymer or silica solid particles and tested in oil free and oil containing porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in this study all selected surfactants were biodegradable and presented no environmental hazard as specified by their safety data sheet

terms of additives commercial fncs xanthan was supplied by jungbunzlauer austria ag the colloidal silica particles ludox tm 50 sigma aldrich france had a nominal size of 30 nm as measured by orts gil et al 2011 the pollutant oil was macron 1821 f 4 from houghton us with a density of 0 818 at t 20 c compressed nitrogen n2 purity 99 999 was supplied by air liquide france and was used to avoid potential oxidation of the chemicals by o2 and to control the level of purity of the gas 2 2 experimental facilities in order to measure the viscosity of the aqueous solutions with xanthan five solutions with xanthan concentrations of 100 to 500 ppm were prepared and their shear viscosity was first measured at various shear rates by means of a kinexus controlled stress rheometer malvern instruments uk with a peltier cylinder cartridge all the samples were prepared with tap water the shear viscosity was measured at 20 c 0 1 c with a measurement range of between 1 and 1000 s 1 values at a shear rate of 12 5 s 1 corresponding to the newtonian plateau were used to plot the shear rate versus the concentration of xanthan as the native solid particle suspensions were in an aggregated state they were systematically submitted to ultrasonic solicitation using ultrasonic bath equipment for 10 min fisherbrand elmasonic fisher scientific france the experimental setup used for the coreflood experiments is presented in fig 1 a phd ultra piston pump harvard apparatus us was used to inject the aqueous solutions the gas flow rate was controlled by a mass flow meter el flow bronkhorst france under nominal conditions gas and aqueous solutions were co injected into the column the column was a transparent pvc tube of length 40 cm and inner diameter 4 4 cm which was sealed with nylon caps at the inlet and outlet a length of 40 cm was long enough to minimise the entrance and capillary end effects as suggested in the literature eftekhari and farajzadeh 2017 the column was filled with sand from cantillana france containing 98 4 sio2 grains with a d50 of 279 μm and a particle size distribution as shown in fig 2 cantillana sas 2019 the pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of the column was measured with a differential transducer rosemount 2051 coplanar emerson france and values were recorded every 10 s 2 3 experimental procedure various experimental tests were performed in this study and these are presented in table 1 with the experimental approaches used 2 3 1 surfactant solutions all experiments were performed at room temperature all foaming solutions were prepared using tap water with an ionic strength of below 10 2 m before use all aqueous solutions were stirred at 400 rpm for at least 10 min except for the xanthan solutions which required 12 h to ensure the complete dissolution of the polymer in water all dispersions of solid particles were prepared by mechanical dispersion in a given amount of water before sonication for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath in parallel the surfactant solutions were prepared by dissolution or dilution in the same amount of water the two were then blended in convenient volume proportions 2 3 2 coreflood tests for the coreflood experiments the column was placed vertically and water and sand were gradually introduced by adding 2 cm of water and 2 cm of sand alternately gentle manual shaking was applied throughout the procedure to uniformly pack the sand grains the sand packing porosity was calculated based on the exact amount of water and sand used the column was then placed horizontally and the absolute permeability was determined using darcy s law by imposing various flow rates and measuring the pressure drop along the column to saturate the medium and to cause surfactant adsorption on the sand grains 3 3 pore volumes pv of solution were injected prior to co injection similar procedures have previously been followed by other authors del campo estrada et al 2015 eftekhari and farajzadeh 2017 jones et al 2016 to ensure that any surfactant injected during co injection only serves for foaming process for each surfactant the gas and foaming solution were co injected into the column at a variable total flow rate q tot the liquid and gas n2 flow rates were varied to reach a target foam quality fq q gas q tot while recording the induced pressure drop every 10 s during co injection two main parameters were observed to determine the foam properties the resistance factor rf eq 1 and the water saturation s w eq 2 these are defined as follows 1 rf δ p f δ p w qtot where δp f and δp w are the pressure drops measured along the core when the foam and water are flowing respectively and 2 s w v w pv where v w is the volume occupied by the aqueous phase in the porous medium in the presence of the polymer a modified resistance factor rf is calculated eq 3 to subtract the pure polymer viscosifying effect of the aqueous phase this represents the ratio of the pressure drop of the foam δp f to that of the continuous phase cp δp cp at the same total flow rate rather than water 3 rf δ p f δ p cp qtot rf is related to the foam strength the higher the rf the higher the lamella density and thus the stronger the foam meanwhile s w represents the amount of water remaining in the porous medium a low value of s w reflects a high efficiency of the foam in terms of displacing water and shall reflect a decrease in water mobility through the foam the standard error for rf values was measured for three typical experiments and it was found to be 0 68 with 3 2 cmc surfactant alone with four replicates and 1 2 for 3 2 cmc 1 wt sio2 in triplicate meanwhile the standard error for rf with 3 2 cmc 200 ppm xanthan was measured to be 0 21 the standard errors for the two other experiments were measured to be 0 4 data not shown this set of standard errors demonstrates the reliability of the measurements 2 3 2 1 experiments in the presence of oil in these experiments the column was initially completely saturated with oil rather than water and the procedure described above was followed water was injected until no oil was produced allowing us to calculate the remaining oil saturation this procedure led to a system at residual oil saturation a situation encountered in the field at the interface between the aquifer and the lnapl to satisfy the conditions for surfactant adsorption 3 3 pv of surfactant solution were injected before foam injection 2 3 2 2 experiments with the addition of polymer several solutions were prepared at fixed saponin concentration 3 2 cmc to perform column experiments on the addition of polymer based on results in the literature pu et al 2017 zhong et al 2013 a broad range of polymer concentrations of between 0 and 500 ppm was chosen to test the influence of polymer concentration on foam behaviour experiments were then performed with oil two foaming solutions with different polymer concentrations were prepared and were co injected with gas into columns in a state of residual oil saturation the polymer concentrations were chosen so that the same range of concentrations could be scanned as for the experiments without oil 2 3 2 3 experiments with the addition of particles for these experiments the range of particle concentrations was suggested by data in the literature usually reaching a maximum of 1 wt binks et al 2017 binks et al 2007 lv et al 2017 under comparable physico chemical conditions but with different systems experiments were performed following the same experimental procedure first without and then with oil 3 results 3 1 choice of surfactant this first set of column experiments was performed in order to compare the saponin surfactant to two other surfactants previously used in the literature for similar purposes osei bonsu et al 2015 simjoo et al 2013 table 2 summarises the values of rf and s w obtained in the steady state for the three selected surfactants it is observed that both rf and s w depend on the surfactant used based on its low s w sdhp is expected to be a promising surfactant but its rf is below 10 which may lead to a weak foam ch has a moderate rf but a high s w making it uninteresting for the purposes of application meanwhile saponin shows both a relatively high rf and a low s w and was therefore selected at this stage for further experiment 3 2 optimisation of injection parameters this surfactant hierarchy is based on injection experiments performed at a single q tot and a given foam quality the rf values may change at other flow rates in order to identify the best flow conditions analogous experiments were performed for a fixed saponin concentration of 3 2 cmc by varying both the foam quality and q tot over a wide interval the results are presented in terms of rf versus foam quality in fig 3 for all flow rates the curves show a region of increase that corresponds to the low quality regime where the pressure gradient is independent of the gas flow rate and a decreasing region that corresponds to the high quality regime where the pressure gradient is independent of the liquid flow rate this is in accordance with the findings of other authors studying chemically different surfactants osterloh and jante 1992 the rf peak is located between 80 and 92 depending on the value of q tot and it appears that the optimum foam quality increases as flow rate increases moreover when the injection rate is high rf decreases with the injection rate this is in accordance with studies showing that foams of high quality are yield stress fluids with pronounced shear thinning behaviour denkov et al 2009 princen and kiss 1987 for low injection rates rf increases with the injection rate fig 4 shows the variation in s w as a function of foam quality by gathering all s w values available that correspond to any q tot values in the low quality regime s w decreases with the foam quality this indicates that as the foam quality increases the sweep efficiency becomes more effective and the amount of water remaining is consequently low for the strongest foams for which the quality is above 87 s w becomes almost constant as the amount of gas in the system increases the number of bubbles increases and the lamella thickness decreases at a critical level of gas the lamellae become too thin to be stable and collapse an equilibrium is then reached between the formation and destruction of lamella and the water saturation remains stable when plotted against the total flow rate q tot see fig 5 s w decreases with q tot in the low flow rate regime before reaching a limiting saturation at higher values of q tot this graph shows that unlike rf the values of s w directly depend on q tot and to a lesser extent on the foam quality for the remainder of the study and to maximise sweep efficiency the experimental conditions were chosen as a foam quality of 87 5 and q tot of 6 3 ml min 1 in summary the optimum foam quality and flow rate are defined to give a strong saponin foam in a porous medium with high rf and low s w this foam can then be reinforced with polymer in order to observe the resistance of the foam to oil and how it behaves when polymer is added 3 3 effects of the addition of polymer 3 3 1 oil free conditions an example of the rf and s w curves obtained as a function of the injected pv is presented in fig 6 similar curves were obtained for other xanthan concentrations in the beginning rf increases steadily while s w decreases linearly indicating a piston like foam displacement until gas breakthrough after this s w stabilises quickly as rearrangement of the foam takes place throughout the column as can be observed from the slight increase in rf after gas breakthrough and the subsequent steady state regime the final rf and s w values for various xanthan concentrations are shown in table 3 the first analysis concerns the onset of gas breakthrough bt i e the time of outgassing from the sand column it can be observed that bt sw is almost constant regardless of cx meaning that the time to breakthrough is mainly a consequence of the water content reached in presence of foam early breakthrough is a consequence of low gas saturation these results show that rf rises progressively with xanthan concentration cx however in contrast to the results in section 3 2 sw also increases indicating the effects of the addition of xanthan an opposite trend is seen for rf and rf table 3 as cx increases rf increases and rf decreases an in depth description of mechanism underlying the observed relationship between rf rf and s w is given in section 4 1 3 3 2 experiments in the presence of oil similar experiments were performed with oil to observe the resistance of the foam against oil induced destruction in these experiments s i o corresponds to the oil saturation immediately before foam injection which varies from one experiment to another measurements taken after foam injection showed that the oil saturation remained almost constant during the experiment the results for the presence of oil are shown in table 4 together with the results for xanthan free solutions when rf is considered a significant loss is observed compared to experiments in the absence of oil indeed rf decreases rapidly with xanthan concentration and it is likely that the foam bubbles are collapsing in contact with oil compared to the use of polymers it is well known that solid colloidal particles can efficiently stabilise both foams and emulsions against coalescence singh and mohanty 2015 these pickering like foams are of increasing interest to researchers and most studies concern the determination of the optimum physico chemical conditions of a given system in the following a preliminary evaluation of the ability of colloidal sio2 particles to efficiently stabilise foams is presented for porous media in the absence or presence of oil 3 4 addition of solid colloidal particles 3 4 1 optimisation of foam particle mixture 3 4 1 1 effects of surfactant concentration in oil free conditions since the addition of xanthan did not lead to foam reinforcement against oil i e rf did not increase colloidal particles were considered for use in formulating an oil resistant foam native sio2 colloidal particles were chosen to perform coreflood experiments before reinforcement with colloidal particles the influence of the surfactant concentration cs on sweep efficiency was investigated for a saponin surfactant cs was varied between 3 2 cmc and 15 cmc for a foam quality of 87 5 and q tot 6 3 ml min 1 the obtained values of rf and s w are shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 rf and s w are well correlated as cs is increased to 10 cmc rf increases and s w decreases this behaviour is characteristic of foams that become stronger with more efficient sweeping conversely when the concentration is high enough e g 15 cmc rf drops and s w rises indicating less efficient sweeping further explanations of the mechanisms involved are given in section 4 2 3 4 1 2 effects of colloidal particle concentration in oil free systems for a given 3 2 cmc saponin foam the effect of silica particle concentration on the properties of the foam was studied in these experiments two concentrations of sio2 were used table 5 shows the obtained values of rf and s w as can be seen from table 5 the addition of particles at 1 wt does not change the values of s w or rf an increase in rf is observed when silica is added at 0 5 wt without modifying the sw value 3 4 1 3 optimal addition of particles in an oil free system given the previous results on the importance of surfactant concentration the saponin concentration was then changed to 10 cmc while maintaining a sio2 concentration of 0 5 wt when solid particles are added at 10 cmc rf increases from 15 9 to 20 4 but s w remains unchanged at 0 32 in comparison with saponin alone table 6 this indicates that the particles do not change the macroscopic foam structure and that the sweep efficiency remains the same as the ultimate goal was to develop foam formulations that resist oil induced destruction within porous media core experiments were performed in the presence of oil 3 4 2 experiments in the presence of oil in the same way as the oil free system the effect of surfactant concentration was investigated in experiments with oil when the surfactant concentration is increased from 3 2 cmc to 10 cmc rf increases from 3 6 to 6 3 with oil see table 6 in the oil free system the addition of 0 5 wt sio2 substantially increases rf especially for 10 cmc saponin solutions thus 10 cmc 0 5 wt sio2 was used in experiments in the presence of oil the results show an increase in rf from 6 3 without particles to 7 7 when silica is added at 0 5 wt see table 6 in these experiments both s i o and s w remain the same and are similar to those for the oil free experiments in which s w remains unchanged to obtain a comprehensive overview of these experiments the main results for the addition of sio2 particles are presented in fig 8 the effects of surfactant concentration with and without oil can be observed the increase in rf with increasing surfactant concentration is linked to a decrease in s w in the absence of oil the importance of particle addition is also shown in the figure it causes an increase in rf in the presence of oil while s w remains unchanged 4 discussion 4 1 polymer effect the first analysis concerns the shear viscosity values obtained at 12 5 s 1 when the values obtained at different xanthan concentrations are compared with those reported by other authors zhong et al 2013 they appear to be low however the use of tap water implies the presence of ions and particularly cations according to zhong et al 2013 this concentration of cations leads to a decrease in the viscosity of xanthan solutions this phenomenon is explained by the ionic neutralisation of the local anionic charges of xanthan leading to a molecular contraction and hence lower viscosity regarding the variation in rf it can be shown that the overall resistance factor rf for polymer foams has two contributions the first is a structural contribution rf that mainly depends on the number density of the bubbles their size and the interface rheology which itself relies on the possible interaction between polymer and surfactant molecules the second is a continuous phase contribution due to the bulk viscosity by increasing cx the relative continuous phase viscosity δp polymer δp w increases thus increasing rf inside the column as confirmed by the increase in shear viscosity phenomenologically when a hydrosoluble polymer and a surfactant are simultaneously present the foaming process is believed to occur as follows hernando et al 2018 after the mechanical creation of the gas liquid interface a process of coalescence immediately occurs within this period however the surfactant molecule reaches the gas liquid interface preventing coalescence in the presence of the polymer the process of collapse in the early foaming stages is delayed due to polymer induced steric repulsion in the liquid films as a consequence the surfactant molecules have a longer time to reach the interface hence promoting the foaming process however depending on the type of interaction between the polymer and the surfactant surfactant molecules may not be free to reach the interface in fact in the case of a strong surfactant polymer interaction a surfactant polymer complex is formed that slows down adsorption at the surface decreases the amount of free monomers in solution and thus decreases foamability this strong interaction can be found for surfactants and polymers of opposite charge petkova et al 2012 conversely in the case of a weakly interacting system surfactant monomers can quickly adsorb at the surface during foaming and the polymer stabilises the new lamella via steric repulsion thus improving foamability a system of this type can be found with a non ionic polymer and a charged surfactant petkova et al 2012 meanwhile for non interacting systems the foamability is thwarted by mitigation of the interface creation rate and a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in this case no polymer co adsorption on the surfactant or change of gas water interfacial tension is expected hernando et al 2016 petkova et al 2012 a loss of foamability even of limited magnitude is accompanied by a gain in stability the obtained films are thicker than when the surfactant is used alone and have a low drainage velocity and lamellae that contain polymers are stabilised by long range steric interactions gochev 2015 in this situation it is likely that a weaker foam is created with thicker lamellae leading to higher s w early breakthrough and lower rf the rf s w and breakthrough variations observed in the present study also reveal difficulties in foam formation a phenomenon that could be due to the formation of a surfactant polymer complex via strong interactions however in the present study xanthan and saponin are both non ionic chemicals whose interactions can take place via hydrogen bonding a weaker interaction than electrostatic bonding formation of a surfactant polymer complex may not explain the observed behaviour and it appears that the decrease in foam strength depends mainly on the continuous phase viscosity increase similar experiments were performed with oil to determine the potential oil resistance and to identify whether the foam creation mechanism observed previously was reproduced it appears that the expected stabilisation of foam against destruction by oil is not induced by xanthan addition the same degradation of the foam was observed by hernando et al 2016 in foams reinforced with non ionic polyacrylamide where it was shown that oil acted as a defoaming agent in an equivalent way to the oil free experiments the observed increase in rf is due only to the increase in the continuous phase viscosity and is hindered by structural loss of the foam as a corollary bt decreases and s w becomes significant in the presence of polymer overall it appears that the addition of xanthan to a saponin foaming solution results in an increase in the continuous phase viscosity that mitigates liquid drainage and thickens lamellae it also increases rf thanks to the viscous contribution but at the same time hinders the generation of foam leading to weaker foam in oil free sandpacks moreover no positive stabilisation effect was observed in the presence of oil as reported by shen et al 2006 it is therefore not a suitable way to increase foam strength in the presence of oil but can still be useful if the aim is only to increase the overall rf 4 2 surfactant concentration to interpret data from the variations in surfactant concentration the dynamic displacement of foam in porous media is considered in fact during foam flow lamellae are continuously stretched at the pore body and compressed at the pore throat where the distance between the walls is smaller as illustrated in fig 9 as surfactant unimers on gas liquid interface are in dynamic equilibrium with surfactant micelles compensation for the lack of surfactant molecules during the stretching period is more nearly instantaneous as cs increases this leads to lamellae that are more stable against breakage and stronger foam is transported along the core however above a certain value of cs the aqueous film may be depleted in the surfactant micelles compared to the nodes due to the important amount of surfactant present more space is available in the nodes for micelles to be packed in a situation that is not encountered at standard surfactant concentrations thus an additional attractive force of osmotic origin contributes to the disjoining pressure leading to the thinning of lamellae and coalescence of less resistant foams indeed according to jones et al 2016 relatively low surfactant concentrations are needed for stabilisation in bulk foam where large bubbles are formed with low gas water interface area conversely higher surfactant concentrations are necessary to obtain a similar surface coverage in porous media as the bubbles are of smaller size and of the same order of magnitude as pore bodies 4 3 particle addition the results for 3 2 cmc in the absence of oil show similar values of rf and s w without particles and with 1 wt sio2 table 5 suggesting that particles do not have any impact on how the foam rearranges itself inside the porous media it therefore appears as if the surfactant alone is responsible for foamability and foam stability however an increase in rf is noted when silica is introduced at only 0 5 wt with no significant increase in the aqueous phase viscosity the apparent aqueous phase viscosity was determined by measuring rf which was equal to rf implying that the pressure gradients during the flow of water or surfactant solution are the same thus both solutions have the same apparent viscosity the increase in rf suggests an improvement in gas water interface rheology when sio2 is added at this concentration for other systems it is usually reported that a loss of foam strength or equivalently rf is observed when the particle concentration exceeds a certain threshold value due to particle aggregation alyousef et al 2018 veyskarami and ghazanfari 2018 or surfactant adsorption on the surface of the particles thereby limiting the amount of available surfactant yang et al 2017 thus the limiting solid concentration should be below 1 wt the increase in rf that is observed when sio2 is added to a 3 2 or 10 cmc solution indicates a microscopic foam change this probably arises from particles gathering at the gas water interface as this would be promoted by a large number of surfactant molecules this in turn would strengthen the interface rigidity and induce a higher rf to interpret this finding it should be borne in mind that the best adsorption of solid colloids has been reported for partially hydrophobic particles with a ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic sites ratio that depends on the system of interest binks and horozov 2005 tang et al 1989 it is therefore possible that when free surfactant molecules are available to change the hydrophobicity of colloids this makes the adsorption of particles at gas water interface more energetically favourable thus increasing the interface rigidity as yang et al 2017 reported for a different system with the appropriate surface charges and right surfactant particle ratio surfactants could adsorb at the particle surface and improve the stability of the foam both the particle network created in the film and the adsorption of the modified particles at the interface contribute to the increase in the bulk stability of the foam and its blocking ability in porous media in the oil free system the correlation between surfactant concentration and rf increase is explained by the need for additional surfactant due to dynamic foam displacements in the presence of oil surfactant concentration and the increase in rf also seem to be correlated indeed since the surfactant is involved in the oil water emulsion a higher surfactant concentration is needed for the formation of foam the increase in rf when 0 5 wt sio2 is added to the solution in the presence of oil is similar to the results of oil recovery experiments by sun et al 2014 in which they added 0 5 wt sio2 to an sds foam although they reported a slightly higher increase the surfactant was different which could lead to different particle surfactant interactions and potentially stronger adsorption at the interface the subsequent increase in rf observed with the addition of particles suggests that colloidal particles do reach the gas water interface and create a barrier against the oil induced coalescence of bubbles this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 10 where the presence of oil leads to the foam collapsing in the absence of particles as particles are added to the formulation they adsorb at the interface rigidify it and stabilise the foam against the oil the thermodynamics of systems with solid particles constituting a rigid barrier at the gas water interface depends on the contact angle which itself relies on the degree of hydrophobicity of the particles when the gas water interface is covered by solid colloids they effectively mitigate the entry of oil droplets at the interface but this is in competition with the opposing capillary effect that takes place between adjacent adsorbed particles denkov 2004 4 4 applicability in the field if a foam is used as a blocking agent for water flow the value of s w should be as low as possible for the injection of foam into surficial aquifers the rf should be significantly higher than 1 for the foam to act as a sweeping agent but should not be too high due to injectivity constraints a value slightly lower than or close to 10 is acceptable for practical purposes maire et al 2018 portois et al 2018 it is shown in table 6 that for the optimised experiments these conditions are met with rf being close to 8 while the s w is quite low at around 0 36 in the presence of xanthan the obtained rf was lower than with particles 6 4 compared to 7 8 and it has been shown that this effect is mainly due to an increase in the viscosity of the fluid in lamellae while the foam itself seemed to be weakened this effect which is not clearly visible in 1d experiments should be visible in 2d experiments indeed in 2d or 3d situations a weak foam tends to lead to preferential pathways and thus to a low sweep efficiency therefore in order to reach an homogeneous foam distribution the addition of particles is preferable over xanthan polymer finally when considering foam technology for soil remediation several practical aspects should be taken into account such as the cost and possible technical issues since foam is mainly composed of gas the main cost of the procedure lies in the biodegradable surfactant and particles used silica particles are easily available and affordable whereas a biodegradable surfactant can be more expensive however apart from the cost of the surfactant the procedure is still shown to be less expensive easier and more feasible than other techniques in fact the bare ground needed for excavation is not necessary little equipment is needed and the sweeping efficiency is high thus foam is an ideal candidate for a heterogeneous porous medium particularly when compared to gas sparging or soil flushing several challenges still remain such as the development of oil resistant foams on a larger scale or the implementation of a push and pump technique in which foam would be injected into the same well where oil is pumped the use of foam is also still contraindicated in scenarios with fast flowing underground water as this technique is still under development finally even with a biodegradable surfactant used in food grade applications the addition of this chemical may impact the environment to some extent although the health and environmental issues caused by a pollutant are substantially more important than those of a biodegradable surfactant a risk assessment is always required 5 conclusions the objective of the present study was to obtain a biodegradable formulation consisting of surfactant and additives that can ensure the stability of foam in porous media in the presence of organic pollutants the findings of the present study can be summarised as follows saponin appears to be the most effective biodegradable surfactant of the three alternatives considered here coreflood experiments confirm the detrimental effects of oil on the stability of foam both in bulk and in porous media for all formulations studied the addition of xanthan is less efficient than colloidal solid particles for foam reinforcement as it increases only the continuous phase viscosity inducing an increase in flow resistance and a decrease in water saturation in this respect environmentally friendly interacting polymer surfactant systems may be of interest particle addition is shown to inhibit the destruction of foam in the presence of oil by creating a physical barrier at the gas water interface in the present study the optimum concentration of saponin and sio2 were found to be 10 cmc and 0 5 wt respectively declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was funded by innovasol

1547,practical designs of non aqueous phase liquids napls remediation strategies require reliable modeling of interphase mass transfer to predict the retraction of napl during processes such as dissolution in this work the dissolution process of napl during two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media is studied using pore network modeling and micromodel experiments a new physical experimental approach is proposed to enhance the prediction of the dissolution process during modeling of interphase mass transfer in this regard the normalized average resident solute concentration is evaluated for describing the dissolution process at pore level to incorporate the effect of medium heterogeneities a new experimental factor is considered for enhancing corner diffusion modeling in addition capillary desaturation curves cdcs are predicted during hydraulic flow modeling to estimate initial residual napl saturation the developed network model can predict residual napl saturations and mass transfer rate coefficient for a napl water system at different injection rates and fluid saturations the evaluated mass transfer rate coefficients using the proposed physical experimental

standard deviation of pore radius distribution ϕ porosity of system 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napls include a wide range of industrial compounds which tend to contaminate soil and ground waters bahar et al 2018 dejam et al 2014 dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 mccray et al 2001 they are a hazardous source of contamination and can be a long term threat to groundwater quality karaoglu et al 2019 this is mainly because of high toxicity and slight solubility of napls in water farthing et al 2012 mayer 2005 thus it is crucial to managing such materials properly by adopting effective contamination remediation methods such methods include the removal of napl source and accelerating napl aqueous interphase mass transfer nrc 2005 hence the effective designs of remediation strategies require reliable modeling of interphase mass transfer to predict the retraction of napl during processes such as dissolution volatilization and sorption in saturated media in which existing phases are napl and water the dominant mechanism of interphase mass transfer is the dissolution process the dissolution rate coefficient can characterize the dissolution process of residual napl in a porous medium dejam 2019a generally there are three approaches for evaluating the napl dissolution rate coefficient empirical correlations mechanistic modeling and physical experimental modeling while an empirical correlation uses statistical or experimental data mechanistic modeling is based on the physical mechanisms of the dissolution process physical experimental modeling is a combination of empirical correlation and mechanistic modeling to benefit from the strengths of both approaches in an empirical correlation experimental data are obtained by either measuring the effluent napl concentration imhoff et al 1994 jia et al 1999 or image analyzing of fluid distribution corapcioglu et al 2009 russo et al 2009 although empirical models are easy to be implemented in modeling their ranges of applicability are limited to experimental conditions for example almost all conventional correlations have stipulated a typical value for initial residual napl saturation throughout the last two decades researchers have acknowledged that these correlations are inconsistent when they are applied to the same porous medium and fluid condition kokkinaki et al 2013 luciano et al 2018 maji and sudicky 2008 sarikurt et al 2017 because of these limitations empirical correlations are not suitable for upscaling purposes in addition the empirical correlations cannot capture dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process including decreasing napl blob size and the mass fraction of soluble napl species zhou et al 2000 in mechanistic modeling zhou et al 2000 proposed mechanisms of dissolution process at pore level in different wettability conditions the proposed mechanisms include corner diffusion pore diffusion and mixing streams while the corner diffusion describes diffusion from the interface into the slowly flowing water surrounding a napl blob pore body diffusion is diffusion through napl water interfaces the mixing streams of water refers to a combination of water streams with different concentrations dillard and blunt 2000 used the corner diffusion mechanism for a water wet system using pore network modeling pnm sahloul et al 2002 upgraded corner diffusion model into the corner transport model in which velocity profiles for aqueous phase were considered in modeling based on the latter upgraded model zhao and ioannidis 2003 simulated a napl wet system by pnm huang et al 2015 provided a new theoretical expression for calculating the mass transfer rate coefficient during dissolution from pendular rings in idealized porous media although mechanistic modeling of dissolution can be used for upscaling purposes the modeling results cannot be well matched with the experimental data due to simplifying assumptions in addition initial residual napl saturation cannot be adequately reproduced by traditional pnm dillard and blunt 2000 the previously performed studies have focused on either empirical correlations or mechanistic modeling of dissolution rate coefficients the physical experimental modeling of the dissolution process has received little attention in the literature so far in this work we present a physical experimental approach to analyze the dissolution process by modeling of napl dissolution rate coefficients the results of the proposed approach are verified by micromodel experimental data and compared to the previous dissolution modeling approaches to do this an improved 2d pnm is developed for replicating flow transport and dissolution experiments in an etched glass micromodel in our modeling capillary desaturation curves cdcs are predicted to estimate initial residual napl saturation more accurately which has been rarely attended in the previous pnms the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 the general equations of dissolution are presented then the four components of pnm are developed to describe flow transport and dissolution of napl in a generated 2d porous media these parts include new approaches for modeling of dissolution and residual napl saturation after developing the pnm required calculations for evaluating mass transfer rate coefficients based on either the simulation results or empirical correlations are presented material apparatus and procedure of micromodel experiments conducted in this work are introduced at the end of this section in section 3 after presenting simulation model parameters and experimental data the results of napl displacement by water as well as transport and dissolution processes are shown and discussed finally we end with conclusions in section 4 2 model description and design of experiments 2 1 general equations of dissolution the dissolution process of residual napl in a porous medium can be characterized by mass transfer in the interface of the napl and aqueous phase although mass transfer coefficient k diss describes the dissolution process modeling studies of napl dissolution are generally focused on predicting a value for mass transfer rate coefficient k diss a i which is also called lumped mass transfer coefficient the reason is that the specific interfacial area a i which is defined as the ratio of area between two phases to pore space volume is not usually measured during the dissolution process in porous media zhou et al 2000 to obtain a predictive expression for mass transfer rate coefficient empirical relationships between k diss a i and fluid flow conditions are developed such correlations usually obey the general forms sahloul et al 2002 welty et al 2009 1 s h a b re m sc n 2 sh a b pe m where re ρ w u w l c μ w is the reynolds number in which ρ w is water density u w is aqueous phase velocity l c is characteristic length and μ w is viscosity sc μ w d m ρ w is the schmidt number in which d m is molecular diffusion pe u w l c d m is the péclet number sh k diss l c d m is the sherwood number sh k diss a i l c 2 d m is the modified sherwood number defined by miller et al 1990 that is a function of lumped mass transfer coefficient and a b m n are constant coefficients to evaluate the mass transfer rate coefficient using the proposed physical experimental approach an experimentally based pore network modeling is developed in the following section 2 2 2 2 pore network development pore network models are appropriate tools for simulating micromodel experiments in etched glass micromodels jia et al 1999 these models represent a porous medium by a collection of interconnected pores and throats to simulate processes in glass micromodels channels of the networks and junctions of pore spaces are replaced by throats and pores in pnm respectively pore network modeling of napl flow dissolution and transport in porous media has four major components which describe the structure of the media processes during phase displacement solute transport and napl dissolution these four components are presented in the following subsections 2 2 1 structure of network here an irregular network is generated for simulation of flow and dissolution process each pore in the irregular network is represented by a cubic chamber and four tubes with a square cross sectional area shared among other neighboring pores the coordination number is 4 for all pores in the network a schematic of the chambers pore bodies and the connecting tube pore throat is presented in fig 1 which also shows the water napl distributions at the pore level pore body radii are randomly assigned to the pores in the network based on a normal distribution with average pore radius of r p and standard deviation of σ rp r p and σ rp are obtained by analysis of the pore distribution in the micromodel for replicating experiments in an etched glass micromodel conductivity k size l and pore volume pv of the model are considered as matching parameters the conductivity k of the pattern is evaluated by 3 k k p ρg μ where k p is the permeability of the micromodel pattern aspect ratio r asp defined as pore throat to pore body radii is evaluated based on matching parameters then pore throats radii r t and lengths l t are calculated based on the sizes of neighboring pores i and j as follows 4 r t r asp min r pi r pj 5 l t 1 2 r pi r pj in which r pi and r pj are pore body radii of ith and jth chambers 2 2 2 flow model a dynamic flow model is used in which viscous force as well as capillary pressure are incorporated during simulation the pore pressures are computed at each time step and the decision for the position of next filling throat is taken based on pore pressure differences the pressure field of the dynamic model is solved using the single pressure algorithm in which pressure in each pore body is determined by a single value regardless of the occupancy of pore bodies at each time step micro flow mechanisms of piston like or snap off are selected based on local aqueous phase velocity in piston like displacement there is no trapping as phase displacement advances while large trapping of non wetting fluid occurs due to snap off the network model is initially filled with napl as shown in fig 2 water is injected at a constant flow rate of q t to the left side of the model the other side is in the atmospheric condition no flow boundary conditions are also presented in the next figure applying mass conservation at water invaded nodes and solving system of algebraic equations gives the pressure distribution in the model for a typical water invaded node i shown in fig 3 the following equation is applied 6 q i 1 i q i nx i q i i 1 q i i nx i in which q i j represents the local flow rate between pore body i and j if pore body j was not invaded by water q i j is set to zero otherwise the local flow rate is evaluated based on poiseuille s law as 7 q ij λ ij δp l t where δp l t is viscous pressure gradient between two ends of a throat and λ ij is flow conductivity of a throat connecting pore body i and j flow conductivity λ ij is needed to be separately evaluated for different micro flow mechanisms i e piston like mechanism and snap off in piston like mechanism the flow conductivity of a throat with arbitrary cross sectional area can be determined as 8 λ ij π r eff 4 8 μ w bryant and blunt 1992 defined the effective radius r eff of a throat as follow 9 r eff 1 2 r e r inc in which r inc and r e are the radii of a circle inscribed in the throat cross section and a circle with similar cross sectional area respectively r e can be estimated as follow 10 r e a t π where a t is the area of the throat cross section that can be calculated by 11 a t 4 r t 2 when snap off occurs the flow conductivity λ ij is determined as wang and dong 2011 12 λ ij a w r d 2 β d μ w in which a w is area of the wetting phase cross section in the corners of a throat it can be estimated as lago and araujo 2001 13 a w α 1 n cot ε α 2 ε α 2 π 2 r d 2 where ε α is a regular polygon corner angle with n t vertices for a throat with a square cross section the corner angle is ε α π 2 in eqs 12 and 13 r d is the radius of the curvature interface between two phases in corners which can be estimated as ramezanzadeh et al 2019 14 r d a t 1 1 4 g ntan π n t π n t tan π n t π 1 1 4 g n t tan π n t π here g is a dimensionless factor referred to the shape factor proposed by mason and morrow 1991 g can be evaluated using area a t and perimeter p t of the throat cross section shape as g a t p t 2 mason and morrow 1991 finally β d in eq 12 is a dimensionless factor for corner flow in edges that is estimated as zhou et al 1997 15 β d 12 sin 2 ε α 2 1 π 2 ε α 2 tan 2 ε α 2 π 2 ε α 2 2 tan 2 ε α 2 1 sin ε α 2 2 the following criterion is applied when choosing displacement mechanism in each step held and celia 2001 16 r asp 1 2 if the latter condition is met snap off occurs and flow conductivity λ ij of the next invaded throat is calculated by eq 12 otherwise the displacement mechanism is piston like in which eq 8 is used for evaluating λ ij during the simulation the next invaded node is determined based on the maximum driving force at the displacement front the driving forces are calculated by summation of viscous and capillary entry pressure in an invaded node and its connecting throats a node and a throat with maximum value of driving force are the next invaded node and throat the capillary entry pressure of a throat is evaluated by the following expression lago and araujo 2001 mason and morrow 1991 17 p c σ p t a t 1 1 4 g ntan π n π 2 water is continuing to enter new nodes until napl saturation reaches its residual value s nr however a traditional pnm cannot properly reproduce s nr a reason for the discrepancy between experimental and simulated s nr could be due to an overestimation of napl blob sizes in the network model as a result of the assumption that a napl blob occupies all of the pore space except for the corners dillard and blunt 2000 the other reason is the differences in porosity coordination number and contact angle for the experiment and the pore network model to resolve this discrepancy a new cdc model is introduced in the following there are many works regarding the estimation of cdcs in different porous media in the micromodel experiments rodríguez de castro et al 2015 developed cdcs for different mobility ratios using image analysis of experimental results yeganeh et al 2016 proposed a model for cdcs based on pore size distribution of micromodel patterns using experimental data al shalabi and ghosh 2018 estimated cdcs for different capillary numbers experimentally based on these works capillary number conductivity and pore size distribution are the physical properties that should be included in a cdc model using these factors an expression is proposed to generate cdcs for various micromodel experiments at different displacement velocities the proposed model in this work needs experimental data of napl residual saturation s nr lab at a specific capillary number c a lab as well as physical properties of the micromodel such as conductivity k and pore size distribution then the residual napl saturation s nr is estimated as follow 18 s nr a cdc 1 1 k c a σ rp r p where a cdc is a constant for a micromodel pattern obtained by 19 a cdc s nr lab 1 1 k c a lab σ rp r p here σ rp and r p are standard deviation and mean value of pore size distribution in a pattern c a lab can be measured as c a μu w darcy σ in which u w darcy is darcy velocity of water injected to the pattern and σ is the interfacial tension between napl and water the proposed model is verified by experimental data in this work as well as those are available in literature in section 3 2 2 2 3 solute transport model based on the pressure distribution determined in the previous section the concentration distribution is calculated for water invaded pores by imposing the solute mass conservation for the typical water invaded node i in fig 3 the following equation is applied 20 f i 1 j f i nx i f i i 1 f i i nx in which f i j represents napl flux from pore i to pore j for the typical pore i depending on the neighboring pore j f i j is calculated based on the following possible in out solute fluxes in the simulations in the first case the adjacent node has a greater pressure value than node i and two terms for describing aqueous phase flow and diffusion are considered with reference to fig 3 napl flux for this case f i 1 i can be evaluated as zhao and ioannidis 2003 21 f i 1 i q i 1 i c i 1 e d c s c i 1 d m a w c i 1 c i l t where e d is referred to the normalized average solute concentration that is calculated at the exit of a throat c and c s are concentration and equilibrium solubility of napl in the aqueous phase as e d is the main parameter in dissolution modeling it is discussed in section 2 2 4 in eq 21 the first term represents napl flux by aqueous phase flow and the second one indicates diffusive flux the second case occurs when the adjacent pore is filled with napl and solute flux is due to the diffusion only f i nx i is corresponding to this case in fig 3 and can be estimated as 22 f i n x i d m a t c s c i r pi in the third case when there is no flow between the node i and the adjacent node like i nx th pore in fig 3 the solute flux due by aqueous phase flow is zero it happens when pressures of the neighboring nodes are equal hence f i i nx is calculated by 23 f i i nx d m a w c i nx c i l t the fourth considered possibility for solute flux is like the first case but the pressure of the neighboring pore is greater than pore i it happens between ith pore and i 1 th pore in fig 3 f i i 1 can be calculated by dejam 2019b 24 f i i 1 q i i 1 c i d m a w c i c i 1 l t at each time step depending on pressure and concentration fields one of these possible napl flux cases are considered for a water invaded pore and its adjoining throats 2 2 4 dissolution model the dissolution mechanisms of corner diffusion and pore diffusion that proposed by zhou et al 2000 is illustrated for a water wet throat in fig 4 while the corner diffusion considers diffusion from the interface into the slowly flowing water surrounding the napl blob pore body diffusion describes diffusion across two napl water interface dillard and blunt 2000 used the corner diffusion mechanism for modeling of napl dissolution in a water wet media they simplified the corner diffusion in a throat as a one dimensional diffusion from a flat napl surface fig 5 shows a schematic of such simplification in which l t and d t are the length and width of a throat and δ is the height of water flowing in the corner of the throat if diffusion is too small in comparison with convection in the flow direction napl transport is in a steady state condition and there are no reaction and mechanical dispersion the following equation describes pore scale transport in the simplified geometry zhao and ioannidis 2003 25 v z c z d m 2 c x 2 d m 2 c y 2 where v z f x y is the velocity profile of the corner flowing water the normalized average solute concentration at the exit of a throat e d defined as zhao and ioannidis 2003 26 e d 1 c s c i 0 δ 0 a c x y l c i d x dy considering uniform velocity profile for the corner flowing water 2d coordinate geometry of yz the initial condition in eq 27 and boundary conditions in eqs 28 and 29 eq 30 can be obtained from eq 26

dimensionless time t ed that is defined as t ed 2x ed 3 to describe the duration of contact between a napl blob and the water flowing in the corner eq 30 considers a uniform velocity distribution for the aqueous phase flowing in the corner and uses boundary conditions presented in eq 29 which is appropriate only for small values of x ed sahloul et al 2002 incorporated non uniform velocity profiles and used the neumann boundary condition in eq 32 to modified corner diffusion model 32 c y y δ 0 eq 30 is used as the physical base of the proposed physical experimental approach since the complementary error function in eq 30 approaches zero and one in small and large values of the function argument it can be reduced at small values of x ed as 33 e d x ed to capture the effect of pore structure heterogeneity and cross sectional shape of corner flow in a micromodel pattern which are ignored by simplified geometry illustrated in fig 5 a new correction factor of α s is incorporated in e d evaluation as 34 e d α s x ed by conducting only one micromodel experiment the correction factor α s is determined based on changes in mass transfer rate coefficient and total water injection rate as following 35 α s k diss a i s n q t q lab here q lab is the total water injection rate in an experiment that gives mass transfer rate coefficient data the mass transfer rate coefficients that obtained by implementing α s in the developed pnm are compared to experimental data as well as the results of empirical correlations and mechanistic modeling approaches in section 3 in the following subsection the required calculation for obtaining mass transfer rate coefficient using simulation results are presented 2 3 mass transfer rate coefficient evaluation an expression for the mass transfer rate coefficient k diss a i can be obtained using mass balance on napl in the system as aminnaji et al 2019 36 k diss a i t ρ n s n c s c where c is the average concentration of napl in the model assuming a constant napl density ρ n gives 37 t ρ n s n ρ n t v n v t in which v n and v t are the volume of napl and total pore spaces in the model respectively in the simulation v n can be evaluated as 38 v n π i 1 i n t l t i a t i a w i π where n t is the total number of throats in the network substitution of eqs 37 and 38 in eq 36 gives the mass transfer rate coefficient using simulation results at each time step as 39 k diss a i 1 v t ρ n c s c d v n dt for comparison of the obtained results two empirical correlations that model mass transfer rate coefficient are presented in the next section 2 4 empirical correlations of the mass transfer rate coefficient the modified sherwood number sh in eq 1 gives mass transfer rate coefficient by miller et al 1990 40 k diss a i s h

n ϕ are 0 0012 to 0 02 and 0 to 0 4 respectively corapcioglu et al 2009 used micromodel tests and calculated changes of napl saturation by image analysis corapcioglu et al 2009 the correlation developed by the latter work is as follow 42 s h 547 s n ϕ 0 83 re 1 1 here the validity range of reynold s number re is 0 012 to 0 078 the two correlations of imhoff et al 1994 and corapcioglu et al 2009 in eqs 41 and 42 are transferred to the mass transfer rate coefficients by eq 40 2 5 experimental design for the developed pore scale simulator the experimental data of residual saturation and mass transfer rate coefficients are needed at an arbitrary injection rate in addition such experiments are used to verify the improvement of the dissolution modeling by the proposed approach in the following material and methods of micromodel experiments are presented 2 5 1 material and apparatus tetrachloroethylene pce and de aerated water are used as a dense non aqueous phase liquid and aqueous phase pce properties are presented in table 1 as pce is a colorless liquid it was stained with sudan red dye at 5 mg l the schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the visualization of

micromodel follows a normal distribution the average pore radius standard deviation and other characterizations the average pore radius standard deviation and other characterizations of the heterogeneous micromodel are presented in table 2 it should be noted that a relatively large pore size micromodel used in this study may not be an exact representation of porous media of real systems however it is quite useful to understand the processes under consideration and napl blob dissolution a quizix pump hb 170 series with 0 00001 cc min accuracy two transfer cylinders with a volume of 50

dissolution processes in the micromodel 2 5 2 experimental procedure at the beginning of the experiments the micromodel is saturated with napl and images of the micromodel pattern and the containing fluids are recorded with a digital microscope at a constant time interval of dt im the saturated micromodel pattern with pce is shown in fig 6b after napl saturation using the quizix pump water is injected into the micromodel at constant injection rates of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 cm3 min until only residual pce was left in the pore spaces at this point the experimental data of the initial napl residual saturation s nr lab at different capillary numbers c a lab are obtained fig 7 shows the images of the initial trapped residual saturation at different injection flow rates of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 cc min the dissolution process is investigated after the trapping of napl the napl area and the perimeter of the napl water interface are calculated by the analysis of the recorded images captured during dissolution assuming that the micromodel has a constant thickness and the total target area of a total the total napl saturation can be obtained as s n a n total ϕa total in which a n total is

radius of 0 5 mm and a standard deviation of 0 05 mm are considered based micromodel properties that are presented in table 2 the experimental data of the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient ka diss at different injection rates are shown in fig 9 these data obtained based on the procedure mentioned in section 2 5 2 time step t up to the time when residual napl saturation occurred is selected as follows 44 t a t m l t m q m l where m is node number of a pore which will be filled in the next time step of the simulation q m l is local flow rate through the throat connecting the pore with maximum flow potential m and the pore m which can be estimated by eq 7 after the phase displacement when the dissolution process is the dominant mechanism of changing in napl saturation t should be modified the new selected time step t diss is determined based on total water injection rate in the simulation q t and that applied in the experiment q lab as follow 45 t diss 10000 q t q lab 3 2 cdc model the conventional pnms mainly cannot properly evaluate residual napl saturation during simulations a new cdc model was proposed to improve the prediction of the residual napl saturation at the end of the phase displacement in section 2 2 2 in fig 10 the proposed model is verified by the experimental data obtained in this work and available micromodel experiments including rodríguez de castro et al 2015 yeganeh et al 2016 and al shalabi and ghosh 2018 fig 10 shows that the proposed cdc model can properly predict napl residual saturation for different micromodel experiments this estimation of the residual saturation can significantly improve the simulation results of mass transfer rate coefficients as the dissolution process is controlled by initial residual saturation 3 3 flow and transport model fig 11 shows the normalized concentration c c s field in the network at water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min at different injected pore volumes up to the end of the phase displacement when napl saturation is at the initial residual after the phase displacement the distribution is presented in fig 12 in these figures water flows from the left to the right side of the network and napl filled pores are shown as white the boundary and initial conditions were mentioned before in section 2 2 2 see fig 2 in fig 11 the changes in concentrations are higher than those in fig 12 the reason is that the saturation changes in the latter figure are controlled by the interphase mass transfer rather than the phase displacement therefore the distribution slowly changes with time as mass transfer occurs gradually fig 13 shows residual napl saturations after the phase displacement at water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min these data which are correspondence to those in fig 12 are used for evaluation of lumped mass transfer rate coefficients according to section 2 3 3 4 dissolution model evaluation of the normalized average solute concentration e d using the proposed physical experimental approach eq 34 the simple approximation eq 33 the general error function solution eq 30 and the improved solution by assuming non uniform and neumann boundary condition section 2 2 4 are shown in fig 14 it shows that e d in the proposed physical experimental approach is affected by the value of α s while other approaches give a fixed relationship between e d and x ed for different porous media and containing fluids in the proposed physical experimental approach to capture the effect of medium heterogeneities on napl dissolution process the value of the proposed factor α s is determined by the experimental data shown in fig 9 since α s represents the role of medium heterogeneity on the diffusion model it is a fixed value for a porous media fluid system so only one set of mass transfer rate coefficient data is adequate to evaluate α s here the data set for the rate of 0 1 cm3 min see fig 9 is used for this purpose 3 5 mass transfer rate coefficients fig 15 shows the results of mass transfer rate coefficients as a function of napl saturation at water injection rates of 0 05 cm3 min fig 15a and 0 01 cm3 min fig 15b the evaluated α s for the proposed physical experimental approach at water injection rates of 0 05 cm3 min and 0 01 cm3 min are 0 3276 and 0 0655 respectively fig 15 also presents the coefficients obtained by the mechanistic approach and those evaluated using the empirical correlations of imhoff et al 1994 eq 41 and corapcioglu et al 2009 eq 42 in the mechanistic approach shown in this figure the general error function solution eq 33 is implemented in pnm results of adopting different approaches in dissolution modeling are presented in table 4 for water injection rates of 0 05 cm3 min and 0 01 cm3 min in this analysis relative error ε r at a specific napl saturation is defined as 46 ε r s nr k diss a i model k diss a i lab k diss a i lab s nr 100 where k diss a i model refers to the mass transfer rate coefficients obtained by implementing different approaches of dissolution modeling and k diss a i lab represents the experimental data shown in fig 9 relative errors in table 4 for water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min shows that the physical experimental approach has significantly improved the evaluating of the mass transfer rate coefficient as the errors are less than 5 5 for all compared saturations at napl saturation lower than 38 9 the physical experimental results have been more accurate which show the proposed approach captures the behavior of the dissolution process even at late times of the simulation the relative errors analysis for water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min also shows that results of mechanistic approach with an average error of 58 are more accurate than those obtained by correlations of imhoff et al 1994 and corapcioglu et al 2009 with an average errors of 79 and 1154 respectively while the simulation results of physical experimental and mechanistic approaches underestimate the experimental data of mass transfer rate coefficients the empirical correlations predict higher values for the coefficients in addition the simulation results of the coefficients are more accurate than those are obtained by the empirical correlations these could be due to the drawback of empirical correlations in capturing dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process such as shrinkage in blob size napl saturation and the mass fraction of soluble napl species the other reason is a proper prediction of initial residual napl saturation in the simulation results which is ignored in the empirical correlations even though the correlation proposed by imhoff et al 1994 has been developed for tce in a sand pack media that is not the case in this work it is a better predictor than that presented in corapcioglu et al 2009 which proposed for pce on micromodel experiments fig 15b shows results of the simulation for water injection rates of 0 01 cm3 min analysis of relative error for this flow rare which is also presented in table 4 shows that the prediction of the dissolution process is improved for the proposed physical experimental approach as water injection rate decreases from 0 05 cm3 min in fig 15a to 0 01 cm3 min in fig 15b the mass transfer rate coefficient decreases which means that the rate of dissolution process reduces at lower injection rates this confirms that the mass transfer rate coefficient is rate dependent which also can be observed in experimental data presented in fig 13 4 summary and conclusions in this study the processes of flow transport and dissolution in a napl water system were analyzed by applying pnm and micromodel experiments the structure of the network and flow model were determined based on physical properties and image analysis of a heterogeneous flow pattern a new cdc expression was proposed and used in the simulation model to incorporate the effect of medium heterogeneities on the dissolution process at pore level a new factor of α s was considered for enhancing corner diffusion modeling this overcame limitations of previous empirical correlations by considering dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process and be matched with the experimental data that was missing in mechanistic models the developed pnm enabled us to evaluate mass transfer rate coefficients with good accuracy at different injection rates and fluid saturations based on the results obtained in this work the following conclusions can be drawn the prediction of dissolution process behavior was enhanced by the proposed physical experimental approach as the relative errors in the prediction of mass transfer rate coefficients are less than 5 5 for all compared saturations the evaluated mass transfer rate coefficients using the proposed physical experimental approach showed a significant improvement compared to either mechanistic or empirical approaches for the range of saturation discussed here the dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process and initial residual napl saturation could be responsible for these results the proposed capillary desaturation expression matched well with micromodel experiments either obtained in this study or reported in the literature reliable predictions of the napl dissolution process obtained from simulation make the new factor α s attractive for possible applications in commercial simulation of contaminant transport in porous media through enhancing diffusion modeling reflected by medium heterogeneities although the proposed approach in this study is a combination of empirical correlation and mechanistic modeling to benefit from the strengths of both approaches it still needs some limited experimental data when it is used for pore scale dissolution modeling obtaining the required data could be the limitation of this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1547,practical designs of non aqueous phase liquids napls remediation strategies require reliable modeling of interphase mass transfer to predict the retraction of napl during processes such as

standard deviation of pore radius distribution ϕ porosity of system 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napls include a wide range of industrial compounds which tend to contaminate soil and ground waters bahar et al 2018 dejam et al 2014 dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 mccray et al 2001 they are a hazardous source of contamination and can be a long term threat to groundwater quality karaoglu et al 2019 this is mainly because of high toxicity and slight solubility of napls in water farthing et al 2012 mayer 2005 thus it is crucial to managing such materials properly by adopting effective contamination remediation methods such methods include the removal of napl source and accelerating napl aqueous interphase mass transfer nrc 2005 hence the effective designs of remediation strategies require reliable modeling of interphase mass transfer to predict the retraction of napl during processes such as dissolution volatilization and sorption in saturated media in which existing phases are napl and water the dominant mechanism of interphase mass transfer is the dissolution process the dissolution rate coefficient can characterize the dissolution process of residual napl in a porous medium dejam 2019a generally there are three approaches for evaluating the napl dissolution rate coefficient empirical correlations mechanistic modeling and physical experimental modeling while an empirical correlation uses statistical or experimental data mechanistic modeling is based on the physical mechanisms of the dissolution process physical experimental modeling is a combination of empirical correlation and mechanistic modeling to benefit from the strengths of both approaches in an empirical correlation experimental data are obtained by either measuring the effluent napl concentration imhoff et al 1994 jia et al 1999 or image analyzing of fluid distribution corapcioglu et al 2009 russo et al 2009 although empirical models are easy to be implemented in modeling their ranges of applicability are limited to experimental conditions for example almost all conventional correlations have stipulated a typical value for initial residual napl saturation throughout the last two decades researchers have acknowledged that these correlations are inconsistent when they are applied to the same porous medium and fluid condition kokkinaki et al 2013 luciano et al 2018 maji and sudicky 2008 sarikurt et al 2017 because of these limitations empirical correlations are not suitable for upscaling purposes in addition the empirical correlations cannot capture dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process including decreasing napl blob size and the mass fraction of soluble napl species zhou et al 2000 in mechanistic modeling zhou et al 2000 proposed mechanisms of dissolution process at pore level in different wettability conditions the proposed mechanisms include corner diffusion pore diffusion and mixing streams while the corner diffusion describes diffusion from the interface into the slowly flowing water surrounding a napl blob pore body diffusion is diffusion through napl water interfaces the mixing streams of water refers to a combination of water streams with different concentrations dillard and blunt 2000 used the corner diffusion mechanism for a water wet system using pore network modeling pnm sahloul et al 2002 upgraded corner diffusion model into the corner transport model in which velocity profiles for aqueous phase were considered in modeling based on the latter upgraded model zhao and ioannidis 2003 simulated a napl wet system by pnm huang et al 2015 provided a new theoretical expression for calculating the mass transfer rate coefficient during dissolution from pendular rings in idealized porous media although mechanistic modeling of dissolution can be used for upscaling purposes the modeling results cannot be well matched with the experimental data due to simplifying assumptions in addition initial residual napl saturation cannot be adequately reproduced by traditional pnm dillard and blunt 2000 the previously performed studies have focused on either empirical correlations or mechanistic modeling of dissolution rate coefficients the physical experimental modeling of the dissolution process has received little attention in the literature so far in this work we present a physical experimental approach to analyze the dissolution process by modeling of napl dissolution rate coefficients the results of the proposed approach are verified by micromodel experimental data and compared to the previous dissolution modeling approaches to do this an improved 2d pnm is developed for replicating flow transport and dissolution experiments in an etched glass micromodel in our modeling capillary desaturation curves cdcs are predicted to estimate initial residual napl saturation more accurately which has been rarely attended in the previous pnms the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 the general equations of dissolution are presented then the four components of pnm are developed to describe flow transport and dissolution of napl in a generated 2d porous media these parts include new approaches for modeling of dissolution and residual napl saturation after developing the pnm required calculations for evaluating mass transfer rate coefficients based on either the simulation results or empirical correlations are presented material apparatus and procedure of micromodel experiments conducted in this work are introduced at the end of this section in section 3 after presenting simulation model parameters and experimental data the results of napl displacement by water as well as transport and dissolution processes are shown and discussed finally we end with conclusions in section 4 2 model description and design of experiments 2 1 general equations of dissolution the dissolution process of residual napl in a porous medium can be characterized by mass transfer in the interface of the napl and aqueous phase although mass transfer coefficient k diss describes the dissolution process modeling studies of napl dissolution are generally focused on predicting a value for mass transfer rate coefficient k diss a i which is also called lumped mass transfer coefficient the reason is that the specific interfacial area a i which is defined as the ratio of area between two phases to pore space volume is not usually measured during the dissolution process in porous media zhou et al 2000 to obtain a predictive expression for mass transfer rate coefficient empirical relationships between k diss a i and fluid flow conditions are developed such correlations usually obey the general forms sahloul et al 2002 welty et al 2009 1 s h a b re m sc n 2 sh a b pe m where re ρ w u w l c μ w is the reynolds number in which ρ w is water density u w is aqueous phase velocity l c is characteristic length and μ w is viscosity sc μ w d m ρ w is the schmidt number in which d m is molecular diffusion pe u w l c d m is the péclet number sh k diss l c d m is the sherwood number sh k diss a i l c 2 d m is the modified sherwood number defined by miller et al 1990 that is a function of lumped mass transfer coefficient and a b m n are constant coefficients to evaluate the mass transfer rate coefficient using the proposed physical experimental approach an experimentally based pore network modeling is developed in the following section 2 2 2 2 pore network development pore network models are appropriate tools for simulating micromodel experiments in etched glass micromodels jia et al 1999 these models represent a porous medium by a collection of interconnected pores and throats to simulate processes in glass micromodels channels of the networks and junctions of pore spaces are replaced by throats and pores in pnm respectively pore network modeling of napl flow dissolution and transport in porous media has four major components which describe the structure of the media processes during phase displacement solute transport and napl dissolution these four components are presented in the following subsections 2 2 1 structure of network here an irregular network is generated for simulation of flow and dissolution process each pore in the irregular network is represented by a cubic chamber and four tubes with a square cross sectional area shared among other neighboring pores the coordination number is 4 for all pores in the network a schematic of the chambers pore bodies and the connecting tube pore throat is presented in fig 1 which also shows the water napl distributions at the pore level pore body radii are randomly assigned to the pores in the network based on a normal distribution with average pore radius of r p and standard deviation of σ rp r p and σ rp are obtained by analysis of the pore distribution in the micromodel for replicating experiments in an etched glass micromodel conductivity k size l and pore volume pv of the model are considered as matching parameters the conductivity k of the pattern is evaluated by 3 k k p ρg μ where k p is the permeability of the micromodel pattern aspect ratio r asp defined as pore throat to pore body radii is evaluated based on matching parameters then pore throats radii r t and lengths l t are calculated based on the sizes of neighboring pores i and j as follows 4 r t r asp min r pi r pj 5 l t 1 2 r pi r pj in which r pi and r pj are pore body radii of ith and jth chambers 2 2 2 flow model a dynamic flow model is used in which viscous force as well as capillary pressure are incorporated during simulation the pore pressures are computed at each time step and the decision for the position of next filling throat is taken based on pore pressure differences the pressure field of the dynamic model is solved using the single pressure algorithm in which pressure in each pore body is determined by a single value regardless of the occupancy of pore bodies at each time step micro flow mechanisms of piston like or snap off are selected based on local aqueous phase velocity in piston like displacement there is no trapping as phase displacement advances while large trapping of non wetting fluid occurs due to snap off the network model is initially filled with napl as shown in fig 2 water is injected at a constant flow rate of q t to the left side of the model the other side is in the atmospheric condition no flow boundary conditions are also presented in the next figure applying mass conservation at water invaded nodes and solving system of algebraic equations gives the pressure distribution in the model for a typical water invaded node i shown in fig 3 the following equation is applied 6 q i 1 i q i nx i q i i 1 q i i nx i in which q i j represents the local flow rate between pore body i and j if pore body j was not invaded by water q i j is set to zero otherwise the local flow rate is evaluated based on poiseuille s law as 7 q ij λ ij δp l t where δp l t is viscous pressure gradient between two ends of a throat and λ ij is flow conductivity of a throat connecting pore body i and j flow conductivity λ ij is needed to be separately evaluated for different micro flow mechanisms i e piston like mechanism and snap off in piston like mechanism the flow conductivity of a throat with arbitrary cross sectional area can be determined as 8 λ ij π r eff 4 8 μ w bryant and blunt 1992 defined the effective radius r eff of a throat as follow 9 r eff 1 2 r e r inc in which r inc and r e are the radii of a circle inscribed in the throat cross section and a circle with similar cross sectional area respectively r e can be estimated as follow 10 r e a t π where a t is the area of the throat cross section that can be calculated by 11 a t 4 r t 2 when snap off occurs the flow conductivity λ ij is determined as wang and dong 2011 12 λ ij a w r d 2 β d μ w in which a w is area of the wetting phase cross section in the corners of a throat it can be estimated as lago and araujo 2001 13 a w α 1 n cot ε α 2 ε α 2 π 2 r d 2 where ε α is a regular polygon corner angle with n t vertices for a throat with a square cross section the corner angle is ε α π 2 in eqs 12 and 13 r d is the radius of the curvature interface between two phases in corners which can be estimated as ramezanzadeh et al 2019 14 r d a t 1 1 4 g ntan π n t π n t tan π n t π 1 1 4 g n t tan π n t π here g is a dimensionless factor referred to the shape factor proposed by mason and morrow 1991 g can be evaluated using area a t and perimeter p t of the throat cross section shape as g a t p t 2 mason and morrow 1991 finally β d in eq 12 is a dimensionless factor for corner flow in edges that is estimated as zhou et al 1997 15 β d 12 sin 2 ε α 2 1 π 2 ε α 2 tan 2 ε α 2 π 2 ε α 2 2 tan 2 ε α 2 1 sin ε α 2 2 the following criterion is applied when choosing displacement mechanism in each step held and celia 2001 16 r asp 1 2 if the latter condition is met snap off occurs and flow conductivity λ ij of the next invaded throat is calculated by eq 12 otherwise the displacement mechanism is piston like in which eq 8 is used for evaluating λ ij during the simulation the next invaded node is determined based on the maximum driving force at the displacement front the driving forces are calculated by summation of viscous and capillary entry pressure in an invaded node and its connecting throats a node and a throat with maximum value of driving force are the next invaded node and throat the capillary entry pressure of a throat is evaluated by the following expression lago and araujo 2001 mason and morrow 1991 17 p c σ p t a t 1 1 4 g ntan π n π 2 water is continuing to enter new nodes until napl saturation reaches its residual value s nr however a traditional pnm cannot properly reproduce s nr a reason for the discrepancy between experimental and simulated s nr could be due to an overestimation of napl blob sizes in the network model as a result of the assumption that a napl blob occupies all of the pore space except for the corners dillard and blunt 2000 the other reason is the differences in porosity coordination number and contact angle for the experiment and the pore network model to resolve this discrepancy a new cdc model is introduced in the following there are many works regarding the estimation of cdcs in different porous media in the micromodel experiments rodríguez de castro et al 2015 developed cdcs for different mobility ratios using image analysis of experimental results yeganeh et al 2016 proposed a model for cdcs based on pore size distribution of micromodel patterns using experimental data al shalabi and ghosh 2018 estimated cdcs for different capillary numbers experimentally based on these works capillary number conductivity and pore size distribution are the physical properties that should be included in a cdc model using these factors an expression is proposed to generate cdcs for various micromodel experiments at different displacement velocities the proposed model in this work needs experimental data of napl residual saturation s nr lab at a specific capillary number c a lab as well as physical properties of the micromodel such as conductivity k and pore size distribution then the residual napl saturation s nr is estimated as follow 18 s nr a cdc 1 1 k c a σ rp r p where a cdc is a constant for a micromodel pattern obtained by 19 a cdc s nr lab 1 1 k c a lab σ rp r p here σ rp and r p are standard deviation and mean value of pore size distribution in a pattern c a lab can be measured as c a μu w darcy σ in which u w darcy is darcy velocity of water injected to the pattern and σ is the interfacial tension between napl and water the proposed model is verified by experimental data in this work as well as those are available in literature in section 3 2 2 2 3 solute transport model based on the pressure distribution determined in the previous section the concentration distribution is calculated for water invaded pores by imposing the solute mass conservation for the typical water invaded node i in fig 3 the following equation is applied 20 f i 1 j f i nx i f i i 1 f i i nx in which f i j represents napl flux from pore i to pore j for the typical pore i depending on the neighboring pore j f i j is calculated based on the following possible in out solute fluxes in the simulations in the first case the adjacent node has a greater pressure value than node i and two terms for describing aqueous phase flow and diffusion are considered with reference to fig 3 napl flux for this case f i 1 i can be evaluated as zhao and ioannidis 2003 21 f i 1 i q i 1 i c i 1 e d c s c i 1 d m a w c i 1 c i l t where e d is referred to the normalized average solute concentration that is calculated at the exit of a throat c and c s are concentration and equilibrium solubility of napl in the aqueous phase as e d is the main parameter in dissolution modeling it is discussed in section 2 2 4 in eq 21 the first term represents napl flux by aqueous phase flow and the second one indicates diffusive flux the second case occurs when the adjacent pore is filled with napl and solute flux is due to the diffusion only f i nx i is corresponding to this case in fig 3 and can be estimated as 22 f i n x i d m a t c s c i r pi in the third case when there is no flow between the node i and the adjacent node like i nx th pore in fig 3 the solute flux due by aqueous phase flow is zero it happens when pressures of the neighboring nodes are equal hence f i i nx is calculated by 23 f i i nx d m a w c i nx c i l t the fourth considered possibility for solute flux is like the first case but the pressure of the neighboring pore is greater than pore i it happens between ith pore and i 1 th pore in fig 3 f i i 1 can be calculated by dejam 2019b 24 f i i 1 q i i 1 c i d m a w c i c i 1 l t at each time step depending on pressure and concentration fields one of these possible napl flux cases are considered for a water invaded pore and its adjoining throats 2 2 4 dissolution model the dissolution mechanisms of corner diffusion and pore diffusion that proposed by zhou et al 2000 is illustrated for a water wet throat in fig 4 while the corner diffusion considers diffusion from the interface into the slowly flowing water surrounding the napl blob pore body diffusion describes diffusion across two napl water interface dillard and blunt 2000 used the corner diffusion mechanism for modeling of napl dissolution in a water wet media they simplified the corner diffusion in a throat as a one dimensional diffusion from a flat napl surface fig 5 shows a schematic of such simplification in which l t and d t are the length and width of a throat and δ is the height of water flowing in the corner of the throat if diffusion is too small in comparison with convection in the flow direction napl transport is in a steady state condition and there are no reaction and mechanical dispersion the following equation describes pore scale transport in the simplified geometry zhao and ioannidis 2003 25 v z c z d m 2 c x 2 d m 2 c y 2 where v z f x y is the velocity profile of the corner flowing water the normalized average solute concentration at the exit of a throat e d defined as zhao and ioannidis 2003 26 e d 1 c s c i 0 δ 0 a c x y l c i d x dy considering uniform velocity profile for the corner flowing water 2d coordinate geometry of yz the initial condition in eq 27 and boundary conditions in eqs 28 and 29 eq 30 can be obtained from eq 26

parameter defined as 31 x ed 3 l t 2 δ pe l where pe l 3q l 4d m d t is local péclet number in which q l is the local flow rate calculated by eq 7 the dimensionless parameter x ed represents the dimensionless time t ed that is defined as t ed 2x ed 3 to describe the duration of contact between a napl blob and the water flowing in the corner eq 30 considers a uniform velocity distribution for the aqueous phase flowing in the corner and uses boundary conditions presented in eq 29 which is appropriate only for small values of x ed sahloul et al 2002 incorporated non uniform velocity profiles and used the neumann boundary condition in eq 32 to modified corner diffusion model 32 c y y δ 0 eq 30 is used as the physical base of the proposed physical experimental approach since the complementary error function in eq 30 approaches zero and one in small and large values of the function argument it can be reduced at small values of x ed as 33 e d x ed to capture the effect of pore structure heterogeneity and cross sectional shape of corner flow in a micromodel pattern which are ignored by simplified geometry illustrated in fig 5 a new correction factor of α s is incorporated in e d evaluation as 34 e d α s x ed by conducting only one micromodel experiment the correction factor α s is determined based on changes in mass transfer rate coefficient and total water injection rate as following 35 α s k diss a i s n q t q lab here q lab is the total water injection rate in an experiment that gives mass transfer rate coefficient data the mass transfer rate coefficients that obtained by implementing α s in the developed pnm are compared to experimental data as well as the results of empirical correlations and mechanistic modeling approaches in section 3 in the following subsection the required calculation for obtaining mass transfer rate coefficient using simulation results are presented 2 3 mass transfer rate coefficient evaluation an expression for the mass transfer rate coefficient k diss a i can be obtained using mass balance on napl in the system as aminnaji et al 2019 36 k diss a i t ρ n s n c s c where c is the average concentration of napl in the model assuming a constant napl density ρ n gives 37 t ρ n s n ρ n t v n v t in which v n and v t are the volume of napl and total pore spaces in the model respectively in the simulation v n can be evaluated as 38 v n π i 1 i n t l t i a t i a w i π where n t is the total number of throats in the network substitution of eqs 37 and 38 in eq 36 gives the mass transfer rate coefficient using

developed by the latter work is as follow 42 s h 547 s n ϕ 0 83 re 1 1 here the validity range of reynold s number re is 0 012 to 0 078 the two correlations of imhoff et al 1994 and corapcioglu et al 2009 in eqs 41 and 42 are transferred to the mass transfer rate coefficients by eq 40 2 5 experimental design for the developed pore scale simulator the experimental data of residual saturation and mass transfer rate coefficients are needed at an arbitrary injection rate in addition such experiments are used to verify the improvement of the dissolution modeling by the proposed approach in the following material and methods of micromodel experiments are presented 2 5 1 material and apparatus tetrachloroethylene pce and de aerated water are used as a dense non aqueous phase liquid and aqueous phase pce properties are presented in table 1 as pce is a colorless liquid it was stained with sudan red dye at 5 mg l the schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the visualization of napl flow and transport is presented in fig 6 which includes a heterogeneous micromodel pattern that is magnified in fig 6b an injection system and imaging equipment the size of the pores in the micromodel follows a normal distribution the average pore radius standard deviation and other characterizations the average pore radius standard deviation and other characterizations of the heterogeneous micromodel are presented in table 2 it should be noted that a relatively large pore size micromodel used in this study may not be an exact representation of porous media of real systems however it is quite useful to understand the processes under consideration and napl blob dissolution a quizix pump hb 170 series with 0 00001 cc min accuracy two transfer cylinders with a volume of 50 ml and the connecting tubing of an inner diameter of 1 59 mm are used in the injection system the dino capture software and the dino lite microscope dino lite am41 1 t are used to capture pce flow and dissolution processes in the micromodel 2 5 2 experimental procedure at the beginning of the experiments the micromodel is saturated with napl and images of the micromodel pattern and the containing fluids are recorded with a digital microscope at a constant time interval of dt im the saturated micromodel pattern with pce is shown in fig 6b after napl saturation using the quizix pump water is injected into the micromodel at constant injection rates of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 cm3 min until only residual pce was left in the pore spaces at this point the experimental data of the initial napl residual saturation s nr lab at different capillary numbers c a lab are obtained fig 7 shows the images of the initial trapped residual saturation at different injection flow rates of 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 cc min the dissolution process is investigated after the trapping of napl the napl area and the perimeter of the napl water interface are calculated by the analysis of the recorded images captured during dissolution assuming that the micromodel has a constant thickness and the total target area of a total the total napl saturation can be obtained as s n a n total ϕa total in which a n total is total area occupied by napl then lumped mass transfer rate coefficients are evaluated for napls exposed to clean water c s c using eq 36 as 43 k a diss 1 a total d a n total d t im ρ n c s 3 results and discussion 3 1 pnm parameters and experimental data the model characteristics are obtained by hydraulic matching and pore size distribution analysis of the micromodel pattern as explained in section 2 2 1 the errors and convergence values for hydraulic matching parameters including size conductivity and pore volume are presented in table 3 the evaluated aspect ratio r asp and grid numbers are 0 31 and 576 respectively the iteration number for total relative errors of 10 for all three parameters is 927 the pore radius distribution of the network is also shown in fig 8 an average pore radius of 0 5 mm and a standard deviation of 0 05 mm are considered based micromodel properties that are presented in table 2 the experimental data of the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient ka diss at different injection rates are shown in fig 9 these data obtained based on the procedure mentioned in section 2 5 2 time step t up to the time when residual napl saturation occurred is selected as follows 44 t a t m l t m q m l where m is node number of a pore which will be filled in the next time step of the simulation q m l is local flow rate through the throat connecting the pore with maximum flow potential m and the pore m which can be estimated by eq 7 after the phase displacement when the dissolution process is the dominant mechanism of changing in napl saturation t should be modified the new selected time step t diss is determined based on total water injection rate in the simulation q t and that applied in the experiment q lab as follow 45 t diss 10000 q t q lab 3 2 cdc model the conventional pnms mainly cannot properly evaluate residual napl saturation during simulations a new cdc model was proposed to improve the prediction of the residual napl saturation at the end of the phase displacement in section 2 2 2 in fig 10 the proposed model is verified by the experimental data obtained in this work and available micromodel experiments including rodríguez de castro et al 2015 yeganeh et al 2016 and al shalabi and ghosh 2018 fig 10 shows that the proposed cdc model can properly predict napl residual saturation for different micromodel experiments this estimation of the residual saturation can significantly improve the simulation results of mass transfer rate coefficients as the dissolution process is controlled by initial residual saturation 3 3 flow and transport model fig 11 shows the normalized concentration c c s field in the network at water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min at different injected pore volumes up to the end of the phase displacement when napl saturation is at the initial residual after the phase displacement the distribution is presented in fig 12 in these figures water flows from the left to the right side of the network and napl filled pores are shown as white the boundary and initial conditions were mentioned before in section 2 2 2 see fig 2 in fig 11 the changes in concentrations are higher than those in fig 12 the reason is that the saturation changes in the latter figure are controlled by the interphase mass transfer rather than the phase displacement therefore the distribution slowly changes with time as mass transfer occurs gradually fig 13 shows residual napl saturations after the phase displacement at water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min these data which are correspondence to those in fig 12 are used for evaluation of lumped mass transfer rate coefficients according to section 2 3 3 4 dissolution model evaluation of the normalized average solute concentration e d using the proposed physical experimental approach eq 34 the simple approximation eq 33 the general error function solution eq 30 and the improved solution by assuming non uniform and neumann boundary condition section 2 2 4 are shown in fig 14 it shows that e d in the proposed physical experimental approach is affected by the value of α s while other approaches give a fixed relationship between e d and x ed for different porous media and containing fluids in the proposed physical experimental approach to capture the effect of medium heterogeneities on napl dissolution process the value of the proposed factor α s is determined by the experimental data shown in fig 9 since α s represents the role of medium heterogeneity on the diffusion model it is a fixed value for a porous media fluid system so only one set of mass transfer rate coefficient data is adequate to evaluate α s here the data set for the rate of 0 1 cm3 min see fig 9 is used for this purpose 3 5 mass transfer rate coefficients fig 15 shows the results of mass transfer rate coefficients as a function of napl saturation at water injection rates of 0 05 cm3 min fig 15a and 0 01 cm3 min fig 15b the evaluated α s for the proposed physical experimental approach at water injection rates of 0 05 cm3 min and 0 01 cm3 min are 0 3276 and 0 0655 respectively fig 15 also presents the coefficients obtained by the mechanistic approach and those evaluated using the empirical correlations of imhoff et al 1994 eq 41 and corapcioglu et al 2009 eq 42 in the mechanistic approach shown in this figure the general error function solution eq 33 is implemented in pnm results of adopting different approaches in dissolution modeling are presented in table 4 for water injection rates of 0 05 cm3 min and 0 01 cm3 min in this analysis relative error ε r at a specific napl saturation is defined as 46 ε r s nr k diss a i model k diss a i lab k diss a i lab s nr 100 where k diss a i model refers to the mass transfer rate coefficients obtained by implementing different approaches of dissolution modeling and k diss a i lab represents the experimental data shown in fig 9 relative errors in table 4 for water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min shows that the physical experimental approach has significantly improved the evaluating of the mass transfer rate coefficient as the errors are less than 5 5 for all compared saturations at napl saturation lower than 38 9 the physical experimental results have been more accurate which show the proposed approach captures the behavior of the dissolution process even at late times of the simulation the relative errors analysis for water injection rate of 0 05 cm3 min also shows that results of mechanistic approach with an average error of 58 are more accurate than those obtained by correlations of imhoff et al 1994 and corapcioglu et al 2009 with an average errors of 79 and 1154 respectively while the simulation results of physical experimental and mechanistic approaches underestimate the experimental data of mass transfer rate coefficients the empirical correlations predict higher values for the coefficients in addition the simulation results of the coefficients are more accurate than those are obtained by the empirical correlations these could be due to the drawback of empirical correlations in capturing dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process such as shrinkage in blob size napl saturation and the mass fraction of soluble napl species the other reason is a proper prediction of initial residual napl saturation in the simulation results which is ignored in the empirical correlations even though the correlation proposed by imhoff et al 1994 has been developed for tce in a sand pack media that is not the case in this work it is a better predictor than that presented in corapcioglu et al 2009 which proposed for pce on micromodel experiments fig 15b shows results of the simulation for water injection rates of 0 01 cm3 min analysis of relative error for this flow rare which is also presented in table 4 shows that the prediction of the dissolution process is improved for the proposed physical experimental approach as water injection rate decreases from 0 05 cm3 min in fig 15a to 0 01 cm3 min in fig 15b the mass transfer rate coefficient decreases which means that the rate of dissolution process reduces at lower injection rates this confirms that the mass transfer rate coefficient is rate dependent which also can be observed in experimental data presented in fig 13 4 summary and conclusions in this study the processes of flow transport and dissolution in a napl water system were analyzed by applying pnm and micromodel experiments the structure of the network and flow model were determined based on physical properties and image analysis of a heterogeneous flow pattern a new cdc expression was proposed and used in the simulation model to incorporate the effect of medium heterogeneities on the dissolution process at pore level a new factor of α s was considered for enhancing corner diffusion modeling this overcame limitations of previous empirical correlations by considering dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process and be matched with the experimental data that was missing in mechanistic models the developed pnm enabled us to evaluate mass transfer rate coefficients with good accuracy at different injection rates and fluid saturations based on the results obtained in this work the following conclusions can be drawn the prediction of dissolution process behavior was enhanced by the proposed physical experimental approach as the relative errors in the prediction of mass transfer rate coefficients are less than 5 5 for all compared saturations the evaluated mass transfer rate coefficients using the proposed physical experimental approach showed a significant improvement compared to either mechanistic or empirical approaches for the range of saturation discussed here the dynamic behaviors of the dissolution process and initial residual napl saturation could be responsible for these results the proposed capillary desaturation expression matched well with micromodel experiments either obtained in this study or reported in the literature reliable predictions of the napl dissolution process obtained from simulation make the new factor α s attractive for possible applications in commercial simulation of contaminant transport in porous media through enhancing diffusion modeling reflected by medium heterogeneities although the proposed approach in this study is a combination of empirical correlation and mechanistic modeling to benefit from the strengths of both approaches it still needs some limited experimental data when it is used for pore scale dissolution modeling obtaining the required data could be the limitation of this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1548,the removal of bisphenol a 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bpa in fixed bed columns was investigated by breakthrough adsorption tests at different operation conditions and further prediction by a

subscripts f feed condition v dead volume measurement condition 1 introduction surface and ground waters are found frequently highly contaminated due to the presence of a group of non regulated micro contaminants known as emerging pollutants generally these compounds e g pharmaceuticals surfactants pesticides brominated flame retardants and personal care products among others are not totally removed in the conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of their persistent and non biodegradable character in recent years the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in the water cycle has been considered as a major environmental issue although they are usually detected in wastewater at very low concentrations μg ng l the exposure to edcs is extremely harmful to humans and aquatic organisms because they can interfere with endocrine functions either by directly activating or inactivating endocrine target receptors or by disrupting or inhibiting the synthesis of hormones and metabolism of enzymes schmidt et al 2017 berardi et al 2019 bisphenol a 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bpa is one of the highest produced and consumed chemical compounds in the world with an annual production higher than 10 millions of ton fenichel et al 2013 this xenoestrogenic substance has been broadly used for the production of polycarbonate and epoxy resins being used in the manufacture of dental sealants cans polycarbonate beverage dispensers medical devices shower curtains pillow protectors care products such as sunscreen lotions nail polish or face lotions thermal paper and toys bpa has lately gained an increasing attention because of its adverse effects on human reproduction functions and the disruption of the thyroid function related with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases han and hong 2016 zhou et al 2019 due to its significant biological toxicity and estrogenic effects bpa involves a serious threat to the ecological environment and human health michałowicz 2014 charoen et al 2018 consequently recent research has been focused on the development of efficient treatment technologies for the removal of bpa from aqueous solution in this context several advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely studied for this purpose including fenton and fenton related processes anotai et al 2017 photolysis moussavi et al 2017 photocatalysis aziz et al 2018 ozonation ghuge and saroha 2018 and different combinations of them therefore in many applications these processes are associated to high costs and the generation of secondary products with a similar or higher toxicity than the target compound for this reason the physical processes based technologies such as micro and nanofiltration ren et al 2017 reverse osmosis yüksel et al 2013 membrane bioreactors satake and tang 2018 and adsorption spaltro et al 2018 mccarter et al 2019 have become of increasing interest for the scientific community adsorption is considered as an effective consolidated and easy operation technology for the removal of many organic pollutants and some inorganics with low operating costs simple design and absence of harmful byproducts this treatment offers a high effectiveness and the possibility of be used in a wide range of pollutant concentrations ptaszkowska koniarz et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition the adsorption laboratory data e g the experimental breakthrough curves can be scaled up to the industrial level with the use of the appropriate design equations bpa removal from aqueous solution by batch adsorption has been widely explored by many researchers using different carbon based materials thus liu et al 2009 studied the modification of two commercial carbons by different treatments obtaining high bisphenol a equilibrium adsorption capacities on the other hand multi walled carbon nanotubes were used as adsorbent of bpa in aqueous solution finding a moderate adsorption capacity liu et al 2014 similar studies have been reported using amberlite xad 7 batra et al 2019 organo montmorillonites yang et al 2016 graphene bele et al 2016 and zeolites tsai et al 2006 hence in order to overcome the mass transfer limitations offered by the conventional activated carbons novel carbon materials have been synthesized and tested as efficient adsorbents of bisphenol a xerogels are porous carbon materials prepared by polycondensation reaction of a hydroxylated benzene phenol catechol resorcinol hydroquinone phloroglucinol and an aldehyde formaldehyde furfural in a solvent followed by drying and pyrolysis stages these materials usually show a large surface area and a well developed porous structure that is a great advantage in the field of adsorption thus xerogels have been previously tested as adsorbents in the removal of several micropollutants with promising results carabineiro et al 2012 álvarez et al 2015 the so called green adsorbents are those obtained from waste materials being helpful to develop a sustainable waste management devoted to decrease the amount of generated wastes and to preserve the environment as well so there is an urgent need to become a circular economy where valuable wastes can be reused therefore the use of renewable cheap and extensively available agro industrial wastes as precursors of low cost adsorbents has become an attractive and eco friendly strategy to remove micro pollutants from water álvarez torrellas et al 2016 silva et al 2018 in this context lignin is a waste from the paper industry and the second most abundant natural substance in the world after cellulose it is isolated from hemicellulosic material through the pulping process of wood thus lignin based adsorbents activated carbons obtained via chemical or physical activation have been efficiently tested to remove pollutants from aqueous medium ma et al 2018 feng et al 2017 for industrial application of adsorption the fixed bed operation is the most usual and feasible technology sotelo et al 2012b sotelo et al 2012c albadarin et al 2012 sotelo et al 2014 for the correct design and scaling up of the adsorption columns it is necessary to develop a model considering the mass transfer process occurring in the adsorption system including the effect of the main operation variables pollutant concentration column dimensions and contact time in this context the use of a detailed mathematical model based on conservation equations allowed to estimate the mass transfer coefficients governing the adsorption process to the best of our knowledge this is the first study focused on the fixed bed adsorption of bpa onto a xerogel and a lignocellulosic material based activated carbon thus the aim of the present work is to study the efficient removal of bpa from aqueous solution by fixed bed adsorption onto the synthesized carbon adsorbents the xerogel rfx and the lignin based activated carbon klp involving the reuse of the exhausted adsorbent along subsequent adsorption desorption cycles previously the adsorption equilibrium of bpa onto both synthesized materials and a commercial activated carbon f400 used for comparison was investigated by the accomplishment of batch adsorption experiments in order to elucidate the equilibrium conditions finally a mathematical model based on mass conservation equations was used to fit in a realistic way the experimental breakthrough curves allowing the accurate estimation of the mass transfer coefficients external liquid film and adsorbed phase constants at the tested conditions the main novelties of this work compared with some studies reported in the literature on bpa adsorption bautista toledo et al 2005 choi et al 2005 liu et al 2009 koduru et al 2016 are the following the high bpa adsorption capacities e g 406 mg g obtained for the commercial f400 activated carbon vs the highest reported by bautista toledo et al 2005 of 263 mg g the dynamic adsorption removal of bpa in fixed bed column exploring the influence of the operating conditions initial bpa concentration volumetric flow rate and adsorbent weight on the adsorption parameters breakthrough and saturation times adsorption capacities at breakthrough and saturation times fractional bed utilization and mass transfer zone values thus the profile of the bpa breakthrough curves was obtained until the adsorption equilibrium was reached the accomplishment of the regeneration of the saturated adsorbent under 3 consecutive cycles obtaining satisfactory results the successful estimation of the external and adsorbed phase mass transfer parameters using a mathematical model based on mass conservation equations in addition as it has been reported in the work of park et al park et al 2015 the presence of natural organic matter nom in the tested wastewater has a pronounceable effect on bpa adsorption capacity as it has been found in some works of our group studying the interference of natural organic matter presence in a local drinking water or a hospital effluent on the adsorption process álvarez torrellas et al 2017a álvarez torrellas et al 2017b the effect of nom on bpa adsorption removal has been studied in our group and described in a non yet published paper observing a general decreasing in bpa uptake which depends on the type of the treated wastewater e g the concentration of natural organic matter inorganic content ph etc finally the tested adsorbents in this manuscript have been thoroughly characterized in terms of textural morphological and chemical surface properties specifically the main features that are a novelty in this work are the following i the determination of experimental breakthrough curves in very short times due to the optimization of the design of the adsorption column because of this and using the macro mesoporous synthesized materials several consecutive adsorption desorption cycles could be accomplished achieving a regeneration efficiency of the adsorbents very close to 100 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting outstanding regeneration efficiencies in breakthrough adsorption experiments for the emerging contaminant bisphenol a ii an important aspect to be considered in an adsorption process design are the mass transfer parameters for this reason a mathematical model based on conservation equations describing the adsorption column kinetics of bpa onto the tested carbon materials was developed thus the mass transfer parameters of bpa on the adsorbents were accurately estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bisphenol a

material in this work was supplied by ence energía y celulosa s a company obtained by acid precipitation of kraft black liquors the size fraction of the adsorbents was selected from 250 to 500 μm by sieving before being used all the solids were washed several times until the washing water was clear and then they were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h 2 2 synthesis of the adsorbents in this work the xerogels were synthesized by polycondensation reaction of resorcinol with formaldehyde solubilized in water using a molar ratio 1 2 in order to increase the ph of the precursor solution until the optimum value of 5 8 sodium hydroxide solutions of different concentrations 0 5 2 0 and 5 0 mol l were added drop wise under continuous stirring and ph monitoring subsequently the gelation of the mixture was performed at 85 c for 3 days after the obtained dark orange gel was dried in an oven during 5 days at 60 c and then for 3 days at 150 c finally the solid was thermally treated at 800 c under nitrogen flow 100 ml min in a quartz reactor the process of carbonization was accomplished in three stages 1 150 c 15 min 1 7 c min 2 400 c 60 min 5 c min and 3 800 c 120 min 5 c min the resulting material was stored in an oven at 100 c and labelled as rfx on the other hand the klp activated carbon was prepared by chemical activation of kraft lignin according to the method reported by fierro et al 2006 applying some modifications briefly kraft lignin previously washed with sulfuric acid solution and then deionized water was mixed with a h3po4 solution 85 wt for 6 h at 85 c using a h3po4 solution lignin mass ratio of 1 4 then the solid was dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 days and was heated at 500 c for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere 100 ml min in a quartz reactor in order to remove the excess of acid impurities after the carbonization the material was thoroughly washed with ultrapure water until neutral ph was reached finally the carbon was dried at 100 c in an oven for 24 h and labelled as klp all the adsorbents were tested in the granular form since they were sieved within the size of 250 500 μm before use 2 3 characterization of the adsorbents textural characterization of the carbon materials was performed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k using a micromeritics asap 2020 apparatus the samples were outgassed for 3 h at 250 c before the measurements which were accomplished within a relative pressure range of p p0 0 05 0 35 the specific surface area sbet m2 g was determined by b e t equation but due to the controversial use of this parameter for microporous materials apparent surface area will be used to refer us to the specific surface area of the tested carbons micropore volume vmicro cm3 g and external surface area sext m2 g values have been calculated using t plot method and the pore size distributions were obtained by using the horvath kawazoe method the morphology of the materials was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem with a jeol jsm 6335 microscope at 15 kev fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectra over the range of 4000 400 1 cm were recorded in a thermo nicolet ft ir spectrometer with a resolution of 4 1 cm the ft ir spectra were obtained using kbr method with a carbon kbr proportion of 0 01 tpd studies of the tested adsorbents in nitrogen atmosphere were carried out in a thermo finnigan tpd r o 1100 equipment within a temperature range from 30 to 800 c 50 mg of sample were loaded in a quartz u tube reactor previously the lines were cleaned with nitrogen flow and the equipment was constantly cooled during the operation the measurements were accomplished using a nitrogen flow of 20 cm3 min atmospheric pressure room temperature 23 c and using a heating rate of 5 c min the gas composition leaving the reactor was monitored by an on line mass spectrophotometer omnistar pfeiffer vacuum raman spectroscopy measurements was carried out in a ntegra spectra nt mdt micro raman equipment equipped with a ccd andor idus detector the laser power and the wavelength were established at 20 mw and 532 nm respectively raman scattered light was focused onto an olympus bxfm microscope the elemental microanalysis composition of the carbon materials was carried out using a leco chns 932 analyzer 0 6 1 6 mg of sample was held in a furnace at 1000 c occurring the combustion of the sample and evolving cox h2o n2 and sox furthermore the particle density of the solids was measured in a mercury hg porosimeter model thermo finnigan pascal 140 440 the external porosity of the bed ε has been calculated by using the following equation 1 ε 1 w v c 1000 ρ p where w is the weight of adsorbent g ρp is the particle density kg m3 and vc is the column volume m3 2 4 batch adsorption studies batch adsorption experiments were accomplished in a thermostatic shaker at room temperature 25 c each solution of bpa c0 0 1 kg m3 v 25 ml was put in contact to different amounts of adsorbent and maintained under constant stirring 250 rpm kinetic tests were assessed using a constant load of adsorbent 0 36 kg m3 taking samples at regular time intervals until the adsorption equilibrium was reached therefore the adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried out by using a dose of adsorbent interval ranging from 0 04 to 3 2 kg m3 in both cases samples were collected filtered using a ptfe filter 0 45 μm and immediately analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc all the analysis were conducted using a chromatograph varian prostar with a perkin elmer c18 column 220 mm 4 6 mm as stationary phase an isocratic mobile phase 45 55 v v of acetonitrile and acidified water 0 1 w h3po4 was used with a volumetric flow rate of 0 4 ml min the analysis were performed at 275 nm with a 20 μl loop volume the equilibrium adsorption capacity kg kg was estimated by the following equation 2 q e c 0 c e w v where c0 kg m3 is the initial concentration of bpa ce kg m3 is the equilibrium bpa concentration v m3 is the volume of the solution and w kg is the weight of adsorbent 2 5 fixed bed adsorption experiments fixed bed adsorption experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the behavior of the studied adsorbents in a dynamic process the tests were performed in a stainless steel column 1 6 cm 0 5 cm i d packed with glass wool in order to avoid void volumes and preference channels in the bed and then filled with the adsorbent the influent solution c0 0 005 0 04 kg m3 was pumped to the column using a hplc pump varian prostar 220 operating in up flow mode bpa concentration in the effluent was constantly measured by a uv vis detector varian 9050 model at a wavelength of 275 nm all the experiments were performed at room temperature 25 c using deionized water at non modified ph the dead volume of the installation has been determined using a bpa solution of constant concentration c0 0 04 kg m3 at a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min the column was filled only with glass beads without adsorbent so the dead volume value can be calculated using the following equation 3 v v q v 0 t 1 c c 0 dt where vv ml is the dead volume and qv ml min is the volumetric flow rate used in the dead volume measurement a scheme of the dynamic adsorption experimental set up used in this work has been depicted in fig s1 supplementary material it is noteworthy to explain that the performance of dynamic adsorption is highly influenced by different operation parameters such as i the column breakthrough time tb time at bpa concentration in the effluent is close to 10 of the inlet concentration ii the saturation time ts time when bpa concentration in the effluent reaches the bpa inlet concentration iii the total quantity of bpa adsorbed on the column or saturation

determined saturation qs and breakthrough qb adsorption capacities kg kg fractional bed utilization fbu and length of the mass transfer zone mtz cm the description of these parameters is detailed in the supplementary material 2 6 mathematical model formulation the mathematical model proposed to describe the bpa fixed bed adsorption in liquid phase is based on the following general assumptions 1 the system is isothermal 2 the mobile phase can be described by an axial dispersed plug flow model 3 the liquid density can be considered constant 4 the adsorbent particles shape is spherical 5 the adsorbent particles are homogeneous the mass transfer between the liquid phase and the adsorbent is described by the homogeneous solid diffusion model hsdm piazzoli and antonelli 2018 using the linear driving force approximation ldf two mass transfer resistances in series are considered described by an external mass transfer coefficient in the liquid film kf and a mass transfer coefficient in the adsorbed phase ks the mass balance of bpa in an infinitesimal length of the packed bed can be described as the next expression 4 d l 2 c 2 z u 0 c z 1 ε ε q t c t where dl m2 s is the axial dispersion coefficient t s is the operation time ε m3 void m3 bed is the bed void fraction or bed porosity u0 m s is the interstitial velocity z is the axial coordinate and c kg m3 is the bpa concentration in the liquid phase the axial dispersion coefficient dl 1 s can be calculated with the next expression 5 d l u 0 2 r p 0 2 ε 0 011 ε re 0 48 where rp m is the particle radius and re is the reynolds number that can be obtained by the following correlation 6 re u 2 r p ρ μ where u m s is the superficial velocity ρ kg m3 is the liquid density and μ pa s is the liquid viscosity the expression q t is related to the mass transfer rate between the interstitial liquid and the adsorbent particle this term of the eq 4 can be described as follows 7 q t 3 k f r p c c where kf m s is the external mass transfer coefficient and c kg m3 is the bpa liquid phase concentration in equilibrium with the adsorbed phase concentration onto the particle surface q on the other hand the mass balance in the adsorbed phase can be expressed by the eq 8 8 q t k s q q where ks 1 s is the mass transfer coefficient in the adsorbed phase the continuity of mass flux across the external surface of the adsorbent particle can be imposed by using the next equation 9 3 k f r p c c k s ρ p q q the following boundary conditions were used 10 z 0 q ε s bed c d l c z q ε s bed c 0 11 z l c z 0 where c0 kg m3 is the initial bpa concentration q ml min is the volumetric flow rate and sbed m2 is the column section the complete model can be solved using the orthogonal collocation on finite elements method with cubic hermite polynomials the resulting ordinary differential equation ode system was integrated by using the odepack package odepack program 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents the tested adsorbents were characterized by n2 physisorption in order to obtain their textural properties that are collected in table 1 thus n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the carbon materials can be seen in fig 1a and b respectively f400 activated carbon showed a n2 isotherm type ia according to iupac classification thommes et al 2015 suggesting that the material is strictly microporous with a very high apparent surface area sbet 1059 m2 g and a relatively low external surface area in addition f400 activated carbon showed a maximum pore width of 0 5 nm fig 1b the n2 isotherm of rfx material can be classified according type i with a very important contribution of macroporosity on its porous structure the xerogel offered the lowest value of apparent surface area sbet 625 m2 g among the tested adsorbents even though the total pore volume took a very high value reaching up 1 70 cm3 g due to its high content in macropores in consequence rfx material showed the broadest range of pore width among the tested carbons 0 4 86 nm finally klp activated carbon showed a type i ii n2 adsorption desorption isotherm with a type h4 hysteresis loop the more pronounced uptake at low p p0 values can be associated with the filling of the micropores since h4 hysteresis loop is usually formed in mesoporous materials this material showed an excellent apparent surface area sbet 1053 m2 g combined with a high value of external surface area sext 477 m2 g and a pore width centered in the mesoporous range 2 0 3 6 nm from the ft ir spectra of the adsorbents see fig s2 in the supplementary material it can be concluded that all the tested materials showed similar chemical surface groups on their structure characteristic of the carbon materials more details can be found in the literature sotelo et al 2013a subbaramaiah et al 2014 interesting information about the surface functionalities on carbon adsorbents can be obtained from the tpd profiles under inert atmosphere co2 and co profiles obtained under heating with nitrogen flow from 30 to 800 c are shown in fig s3a and s3b supplementary material the co2 profile fig s3a showed two mainly peaks at low temperature region found more remarkably on the tpd profile of klp activated carbon the first found peak at 310 c can be assigned to the decomposition of the carboxyl groups another peak at approximately 400 c is associated with the thermal decomposition of carboxylic anhydrides groups these results are in agreement to the literature where it has been discussed that the maximum evolved co2 concentration is due to the decomposition of carboxylic groups figueiredo et al 1999 toebes et al 2004 other peak was found in the tpd profile of rfx material at about 550 c assigned to the decomposition of carboxylic functionalities finally it can also be observed a shoulder at 625 c originated from the decomposition of lactones since lactones are more stable than carboxylic groups tpd profile of f400 activated carbon showed only carboxyl groups less stable than those observed at higher temperature then analysing the co decomposition profile of the tested adsorbents fig s3b supplementary material again the highest evolved co concentration was found for klp material with a peak at 200 c attributed to the water loss due to hydroquinones and phenols thus the highest co concentration at higher temperature was observed for klp sample a small shoulder at about 310 c for klp and rfx adsorbents was determined attributed to the aldehyde groups the decomposition of carboxylic anhydrides led to the evolving of co at about 440 c fig s3b therefore the highly pronounced peak at 550 c found in tpd profile of rfx can be associated to the thermal degradation of phenols finally the co peak at higher temperatures at about 670 c present in all the three tested adsorbents can be attributed to the decomposition of phenol quinone and ether groups kundu et al 2008 these remarks are aligned with the measured co2 and co concentration values shown in table s2 supplementary material raman spectroscopic spectra of the tested carbon materials are depicted in the supplementary material fig s4 two bands at 1577 and 1348 1 cm are clearly visible in all the three spectra which can be assigned to the g and d band respectively g band at 1577 1 cm can be attributed to the stretching sp2 atomic pairs in plane vibration mode indicating the presence of defects in the graphitic structure otherwise the d band at 1348 1 cm can be assigned to the a1g in plane breathing vibration mode which is indicative of the disordered arrangement and low symmetry of graphite lattice structure a 2d peak at 2800 1 cm can be observed more clearly for klp activated carbon associated to the disposition of the graphitic structure related to the substituted groups such as alkane alkene and or alkyne groups jiang et al 2016 the intensity ratio of g and d bands id ig is a parameter widely used to characterize the relative disorder of the material thus in this case the id ig values were found of 1 15 0 89 and 0 77 for f400 rfx and klp adsorbents respectively according to the literature an id ig intensity ratio of 1 0 is indicative of a high degree of crystallinity of the adsorbent structure in addition it has been reported that the increase in id ig ratio is strongly correlated with the disorder in the carbon structure mainly due to the incorporation of nitrogen in the aromatic rings kundu et al 2010 these findings are in agreement to the elemental composition analyzed for the tested carbonaceous materials where f400 activated carbon with the highest id ig value showed a higher content in nitrogen table s3 of supplementary material sem micrographs of the tested adsorbents can be observed in fig s5 supplementary material from the micrographs it can be seen that a wide variety of morphologic properties are present in the carbon materials generally smooth and more roughness surfaces were observed related to the type of precursors and synthesis procedures tested the particle density of f400 rfx and klp materials was measured by hg porosimetry resulting in 454 452 and 417 kg m3 respectively finally the bed porosity ε was estimated for each adsorption column ranging from 0 49 to 0 54 3 2 batch adsorption tests in order to obtain bpa adsorption isotherms kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments were carried out the kinetic results showed that the adsorption equilibrium was found after 24 h for rfx and klp materials whereas f400 activated carbon required 48 h to reach the equilibrium fig 2a it was considered that the equilibrium of the system was reached when no significant changes in the adsorption capacity were observed for further adsorption times so it could be concluded that a longer equilibrium time was required for f400 activated carbon due to the essentially microporous nature of the material in this case adsorption usually proceeds through diffusion of the pollutant from the bulk liquid phase through the mesopores and then into the micropores transport within the inner pores can be severely limited by steric effects so the adsorbate takes a longer time to diffuse into the micropores causing slow adsorption kinetics sotelo et al 2012a sotelo et al 2013a the adsorption isotherms of bpa onto the three tested adsorbents are shown in fig 2b all the isotherms showed a high affinity towards the bpa molecule langmuir isotherm type sotelo et al 2013b with a steep initial slope which indicates that there is not competition between the target pollutant and water molecules for the active sites so the adsorption process depends only on the solution concentration this is as more solute is taken up there are less suitable active sites on which bpa molecules can be adsorbed it can be noticed that the equilibrium bpa adsorption capacity values onto the activated carbons qe 0 40 and 0 22 kg kg for f400 and klp respectively were found much higher in comparison to that obtained for the xerogel material qe 0 08 kg kg this behavior can be attributed to the higher micropore volume values of the activated carbons vmicro 0 38 and 0 30 cm3 g for f400 and klp respectively versus the value found for rfx vmicro 0 19 cm3 g so it seems that the textural characteristics of the materials are mainly conditioning the efficiency of the adsorption process as it has been reported in the literature micropores have a major role in the adsorption of small molecular organic compounds onto activated carbon materials finding usually a direct relationship between both parameters li et al 2002 furthermore some researchers have studied the influence of the pore size of the adsorbent on the adsorption of organic pollutants in aqueous phase previous works pelekani and snoeyink 2000 liu et al 2010 bak et al 2019 have established that the pore size should be above 1 2 1 7 or 1 2 times it depends on the reported work of the second widest dimension of the adsorbate molecule to allow an effective adsorption thus liu et al 2010 concluded that the steric hindrance effects on the adsorption kinetics were strongly related to the widest molecular dimension while the steric effects on the maximum adsorption capacity could be attributed to the second widest molecular dimension of the pollutant this is the similarity between the average pore size of the adsorbent and the second widest dimension of the adsorbate enhances the adsorption capacity of the pollutant these statements are in accordance to the results of this work since klp and f400 activated carbons showed almost the same microporous volume values but the maximum bpa uptake was obtained for f400 carbon due to the high similarity between the average pore width of the material 0 5 nm and the second highest dimension of bpa molecule 0 383 nm 3 3 fixed bed adsorption experiments the experimental breakthrough curves of bpa adsorption onto the tested adsorbents are shown in fig 3 the experiments have accomplished using a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min an initial bpa concentration of 0 04 kg m3 and 0 05 g of adsorbent in this case as it usually occurs with small organic compounds molecules the breakthrough curves described an s shape sigmoidal profile since they may be steeper or flatter depending on the characteristics of the kinetic adsorption process bak et al 2019 the results obtained in the fixed bed adsorption tests are in agreement to those observed in batch adsorption experiments thus the adsorption saturation was reached faster when the synthesized carbons were used obtaining a saturation time of 19 8 and 4 4 h for klp and rfx materials respectively table 2 due to the more opened porous structure of the synthesized materials the breakthrough curves of bpa onto klp and rfx adsorbents were steeper than that obtained for f400 activated carbon with a saturation time which extended until 58 h the narrow porous structure of the commercial f400 carbon led to the adsorbate molecules had difficulties in moving within the pores leading to mass transfer limited processes pelekani et al 2000 adsorption parameters such as breakthrough and saturation times tb ts breakthrough and saturation adsorption capacities qb qs fractional bed utilization fbu and the length of the mass transfer zone mtz have been determined and collected in table 2 from the experimental results the highest adsorption capacity at saturation time was obtained for f400 activated carbon qs 0 383 kg kg due to its high specific surface area and high contribution of micropores in the porous structure moreover the mass transfer properties on the commercial activated carbon were seen dramatically reduced this could be assessed by fbu and mtz values which were found of only 8 1 of used bed and a high length of mass transfer zone 1 47 cm considering these results it can be concluded that klp and rfx materials showed the best mass transfer properties among the tested adsorbents for this reason they have been used in the further tests studying the qualitative influence of the different operation conditions e g bpa initial concentration volumetric flow rate and adsorbent weight on bpa adsorption breakthrough curves 3 3 1 influence of operating conditions on breakthrough curves the influence of the initial concentration of bpa adsorbent weight and volumetric flow rate on the pollutant adsorption onto the synthesized materials has been investigated the effect of these variables on the shape of the bpa breakthrough curves and breakthrough and saturation times is illustrated in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively furthermore dynamic adsorption parameters of the experiments at the different conditions were calculated and collected in tables 3 and 4 for klp and rfx materials respectively breakthrough curves were obtained at different bpa initial concentrations 0 04 0 02 and 0 005 kg m3 onto klp and rfx adsorbents maintaining constant the mass of adsorbent 0 05 g and the volumetric flow rate 1 0 ml min fig 4a b thus as it could be observed in fig 4 an increasing in the bpa inlet concentration led to steeper breakthrough curves when the initial concentration of the pollutant was increased the kinetic adsorption process was favored leading to lower breakthrough and saturation times tables 3 and 4 these results are related to the diffusion process inside the bed since it has been reported that the mass transfer driving force increases due to the existence of a higher concentration gradient when the concentration of the pollutant increases too hayati et al 2018 moreover the increasing in the drug initial concentration allowed a faster saturation of the available adsorption binding sites which is in agreement to previous research sotelo et al 2013b in addition the saturation and breakthrough adsorption capacity values increased with the initial concentration and more efficient fbu and mtz values were found tables 3 and 4 furthermore the effect of the variation in the adsorbent weight 0 05 and 0 01 g on bpa dynamic adsorption has been investigated using a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min and an inlet bpa concentration of 0 02 kg m3 the obtained breakthrough curves are depicted in fig 5ab generally the retention of the adsorbate molecule in the packed bed columns is highly dependent on the quantity of adsorbent inside of the column an increasing in the adsorbent weight 0 05 g led to a flatter slope of the bpa breakthrough curve for both adsorbents indicating that the front of concentration is not fully developed in the bed nahm et al 2012 and higher breakthrough and saturation times were obtained resulting in a larger adsorption zone which is associated with a wider mass transfer zone tables 3 and 4 according to other works found in the literature uddin et al 2009 lezehari et al 2012 these results are strongly related with the presence of more binding sites available for the bpa adsorption nevertheless as it can be expected the saturation adsorption capacity values were not seen affected by the different quantities of adsorbent tables 3 and 4 finally the influence of different volumetric flow rate values 1 0 0 5 and 0 2 ml min on the bpa fixed bed adsorption onto both adsorbents has been studied at the following constant conditions 0 05 g of adsorbent weight and 0 04 kg m3 of initial concentration of the pollutant the experimental breakthrough curves are depicted in fig 6ab the breakthrough curve with a highest slope was obtained for the highest tested volumetric flow rate 1 0 ml min when the volumetric flow rate value increased the external film mass resistance at the adsorbent surface diminished thus reducing the boundary layer and the mass transfer resistance regarding the adsorption process this is related to the residence time that decreased when the flow rate increased leading to shorter breakthrough and saturation times chen et al 2012 the variation in the initial pollutant concentration and weight of adsorption showed similar effects on breakthrough curves of both tested materials therefore the change in the volumetric flow rate induced a different behavior in the two studied adsorbents in the case of lignin based activated carbon klp it could be observed that the variation in the volumetric flow rate did not strongly affect the calculated saturation adsorption capacity values table 3 the obtained results in this work are in agreement to previous adsorption studies in fixed bed mode sotelo et al 2013b in contrast the experimental adsorption capacities at saturation of bpa onto the xerogel were influenced by the change in the volumetric flow rate as it can be seen in table 4 in order to explain this behavior additional adsorption experiments at different initial concentrations were assessed at a constant volumetric flow rate of 0 2 ml min as it has been established in the literature zeledón toruño et al 2007 spaltro et al 2018 generally the adsorption processes appear to be governed by two different mass transport steps a first stage occurs when the adsorbate molecules are quickly adsorbed on the wider and more available pores macro and mesopores and a further second stage associated to a slower migration of the molecule to the less accessible binding sites micropores within the xerogel structure takes place this allows to conclude that macropores available on the xerogel surface were used instantaneously by the pollutant molecules in 1 0 ml min experiment thus in this case only broader pores were used for bpa adsorption and the equilibrium was not reached because the pollutant molecules did not have enough time to diffuse into the inner pores of the adsorbent moreover as it could be expected the changes in the volumetric flow rate did not affect the bpa adsorption capacity onto klp adsorbent due to its more homogeneous porous structure and practically absence of macroporous structure concluding that in this case the equilibrium could be reached in all the accomplished fixed bed experiments these findings are illustrated by the bpa adsorption isotherms obtained in batch and fixed bed mode operation at 1 0 ml min onto both adsorbents fig s6 in the supplementary material 3 4 adsorption desorption experiments one of the major issues related to the adsorption of emerging pollutants onto carbon materials is the cost associated with the regeneration and disposal of the saturated and exhausted chars although there are several methods to reuse the adsorbents mainly based on thermal or chemical regeneration processes one of the most extended method is the use of eluents previous works have studied the feasibility of the desorption process using several reagents such as water hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid acetic acid sodium hydroxide chloride methanol ethanol acetone among others chang et al 2014 dávila jiménez et al 2018 so in order to evaluate the regeneration efficiency of rfx and klp adsorbents three adsorption desorption cycles using pure methanol as desorbent agent have been accomplished the adsorption tests were carried out at the following operating conditions a bpa initial concentration of 0 04 kg m3 0 05 g of adsorbent weight and a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min after each adsorption step when the saturation was reached a methanol solution was pumped through the column at a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min for 100 min this elution time was previously estimated to be enough to desorb bpa molecules totally then the regenerated adsorbent was used in the next adsorption cycle the three consecutive adsorption runs on both adsorbents are shown in fig 7ab indeed the saturation adsorption capacities obtained in each cycle have been depicted in fig 8ab from the figures it is noteworthy that the adsorption capacity was almost unaltered after regeneration via methanol along the three cycles indicating that an excellent regeneration efficiency 100 was achieved for the two tested carbon materials in addition it is worth highlighting that the bpa desorption was accomplished within a short time after 100 min as maximum time a slightly better desorption behavior was observed for rfx material in comparison to klp activated carbon attributed to the more opened porous structure of the xerogel that facilitates the desorption of the pollutant the efficient bpa desorption suggests the existence of a high affinity between the eluent and the bpa adsorbed molecules so it can be elucidated that the synthesized adsorbents can be used for the efficient removal of bpa from water and subsequently economically and easily regenerated in addition these results are in accordance to those found by reza et al 2014 which studied the efficiency of ibuprofen and clofibric acid desorption using different eluents concluding that the regeneration with methanol proved to be the most efficient process furthermore zhang et al 2014 have used different organic solvents methanol ethanol toluene and cyclohexane for the bpa desorption obtaining an elution efficiency of 98 using methanol 3 5 modeling of the experimental breakthrough curves for the modeling of the experimental adsorption data as it was described previously it is necessary to calculate the adsorbed concentration on the particle surface in equilibrium with the solute concentration in the liquid phase q value defined in eqs 8 and 9 so in this work the bpa experimental equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to the dual site langmuir model which is described by the following equation 12 q e q sat 1 k 1 c e 1 k 1 c e q sat 2 k 2 c e 1 k 2 c e where qsat1 and qsat2 kg kg are the maximum bpa adsorption capacities on each site k1 and k2 m3 kg are the adsorption equilibrium constants related to the affinity of the adsorbate molecule towards the surface of the adsorbent spaltro et al 2018 the experimental and predicted equilibrium adsorption data of bpa onto rfx and klp adsorbents can be seen in fig 9ab as it can be seen in the figures an excellent agreement with the experimental data could be achieved by using the dual site langmuir equation thus the calculated adsorption parameters are summarized in table 5 showing good correlation coefficients r2 for the modeling of the breakthrough curves of bpa onto rfx and klp materials it was necessary to obtain the mass transfer parameters that then were used for the validation of the model the operation conditions of the adsorption experiments used for the modeling are summarized in table s4 supplementary material it is noteworthy to say that the selected fixed bed operation conditions were those for the adsorption equilibrium was reached in order to demonstrate that the tested adsorption system is being effectively used an adsorption bpa breakthrough curve onto rfx material at a lower initial bpa concentration than those previously tested c0 0 0025 kg m3 was obtained fig s7 in the supplementary material it was found that the mathematical model fitted satisfactorily the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 95 for this case due to the used mathematical model is based on mass conservative equations when the contact time between adsorbate adsorbent is very high breakthrough time of 43 3 h the predicted breakthrough time is higher than the experimental thus the experimental adsorption parameters are collected in table s5 supplementary material the mass transfer parameters were calculated by fitting the model to the experimental breakthrough curves minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the experimental and predicted values the experimental and predicted breakthrough curves for bpa adsorption from ultrapure water onto klp and rfx adsorbents are depicted in fig 10ab it is clearly noticed that the model reproduced the experimental breakthrough curves within all the interval time with a very high accuracy obtaining high correlation coefficient values r2 0 99 0 98 for klp and rfx respectively hence the mathematical correlation offered by the model can be efficiently used to estimate bpa breakthrough curves onto carbonaceous materials and then up scale the adsorption process both mass transfer coefficients external and adsorbed phase for the fixed bed adsorption of bpa onto the tested adsorbents were calculated by using the proposed model different procedures of calculation were followed for each adsorbent in order to enhance the fitting of the model to the experimental data considering different cases table s4 supplementary material for fixed bed adsorption modeling of rfx the external mass transfer coefficient kf was assumed to be constant achieving a value of 1 29 10 5 m s moreover the surface mass transfer coefficient ks was considered dependent on the initial bpa concentration obtaining ks values of 2 53 10 6 1 27 10 5 and 2 84 10 5 1 s for bpa concentrations of 0 005 0 02 and 0 04 kg m3 respectively as it could be expected the adsorbed phase mass transfer parameter increased with an increasing in the pollutant concentration furthermore for the column adsorption simulation with klp adsorbent ks was considered constant resulting in a value of 9 63 10 5 1 s in this case the external mass transfer coefficient was seen dependent on the surface velocity in this case an increasing of kf value with the volumetric flow rate could be observed obtaining kf values of 2 45 10 5 and 7 38 10 5 m s for 0 5 and 1 0 ml min respectively the calculated mass transfer parameters odepack program 2019 for both adsorbents are summarized in table 6 it was found that both mass transfer coefficients estimated for the xerogel material were slightly lower than those calculated for klp activated carbon according to the literature dogan et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 the kinetics of any adsorption process is usually governed by two mechanisms i the transport on the mesopores of the adsorbent that are considered channels of transport of the adsorbate until saturation of this external surface is reached ii the penetration of the adsorbate into the pores that are less accessible the micropores where the diffusion resistance increases decreasing the diffusion rate it was found that klp activated carbon showed a higher content in mesopores than the xerogel xrf as it can be seen in the pore size distribution of the adsorbents fig 1b enhancing the transport of the pollutant in the adsorbent surface this fact can explain the high calculated values of both external and adsorbed phase mass transfer parameters for klp material the obtained kf values in this work are in accordance to those found in the literature for instance ye et al 2019 studied the fixed bed adsorption of several micropollutants pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds onto granular activated carbon finding external mass transfer coefficients ranging from 6 10 6 and 2 10 5 m s in the same way kf values from 2 8 10 5 to 1 0 10 4 m s were obtained for the adsorption of chloroform and pce onto commercial activated carbons piazzoli and antonelli 2018 4 conclusions in this work the synthesized klp and rfx materials have proved to be excellent adsorbents for the removal of bisphenol a from water batch and fixed bed experiments onto klp activated carbon and rfx carbon xerogel were accomplished in order to study bpa adsorption capacity of these synthesized carbonaceous materials versus a commercial activated carbon thus the adsorption breakthrough curves were simulated using a mathematical model based on mass conservative equations and the mass transfer parameters were effectively estimated the following conclusions can be drawn from this study i the textural characterization of the materials allowed to elucidate the mainly microporous character of the xerogel with a higher content in macropores or transport pores since klp activated carbon showed a type i ii n2 adsorption desorption isotherm associated to mesoporous materials the higher mesoporosity found in the synthesized materials compared to the properties of the conventional f400 activated carbon conditioned mainly both the adsorption capacity and kinetic of the process favoring the adsorption diffusion of the pollutant through the inner porosity of the solid ii the operation conditions e g initial bpa concentration mass of adsorbent and volumetric flow rate played a significant role on the adsorption column performance influencing on the shape of the breakthrough curves and the adsorption parameters such as breakthrough time and saturation adsorption capacity attending to the adsorption capacity the optimum operation conditions could be established as 0 2 ml min 0 05 g of adsorbent weight and 0 04 kg m3 of initial concentration of the pollutant hence at these conditions the saturation adsorption capacity values of bpa reached the equilibrium values qs 0 253 and 0 078 kg kg for klp and rfx respectively indicating that an outstanding efficiency of the bed was achieved with very fast adsorption kinetics due to the highly opened porous structure of the adsorbents and consequence of the avoiding of axial dispersion preference channelling formation or bed compaction iii a total regeneration of the exhausted solids after three consecutive runs was effectively accomplished maintaining their adsorptive properties iv the experimental breakthrough curves were satisfactorily fitted to a mathematical model based on conservation equations aligned with the use of the dual site langmuir model to describe the equilibrium adsorption data by this method external and adsorbed phase mass transfer coefficients could be estimated with a high accuracy kf 1 29 7 38 10 5 m s ks 0 25 9 63 10 5 1 s declaration of competing interest the authors of the manuscript entitled new insights from modelling

cardiovascular diseases han and hong 2016 zhou et al 2019 due to its significant biological toxicity and estrogenic effects bpa involves a serious threat to the ecological environment and human health michałowicz 2014 charoen et al 2018 consequently recent research has been focused on the development of efficient treatment technologies for the removal of bpa from aqueous solution in this context several advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely studied for this purpose including fenton and fenton related processes anotai et al 2017 photolysis moussavi et al 2017 photocatalysis aziz et al 2018 ozonation ghuge and saroha 2018 and different combinations of them therefore in many applications these processes are associated to high costs and the generation of secondary products with a similar or higher toxicity than the target compound for this reason the physical processes based technologies such as micro and nanofiltration ren et al 2017 reverse osmosis yüksel et al 2013 membrane bioreactors satake and tang 2018 and adsorption spaltro et al 2018 mccarter et al 2019 have become of increasing interest for the scientific community adsorption is considered as an effective consolidated and easy operation technology for the removal of many organic pollutants and some inorganics with low operating costs simple design and absence of harmful byproducts this treatment offers a high effectiveness and the possibility of be used in a wide range of pollutant concentrations ptaszkowska koniarz et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition the adsorption laboratory data e g the experimental breakthrough curves can be scaled up to the industrial level with the use of the appropriate design equations bpa removal from aqueous solution by batch adsorption has been widely explored by many researchers using different carbon based materials thus liu et al 2009 studied the modification of two commercial carbons by different treatments obtaining high bisphenol a equilibrium adsorption capacities on the other hand multi walled carbon nanotubes were used as adsorbent of bpa in aqueous solution finding a moderate adsorption capacity liu et al 2014 similar studies have been reported using amberlite xad 7 batra et al 2019 organo montmorillonites yang et al 2016 graphene bele et al 2016 and zeolites tsai et al 2006 hence in order to overcome the mass transfer limitations offered by the conventional activated carbons novel carbon materials have been synthesized and tested as efficient adsorbents of bisphenol a xerogels are porous carbon materials prepared by polycondensation reaction of a hydroxylated benzene phenol catechol resorcinol hydroquinone phloroglucinol and an aldehyde formaldehyde furfural in a solvent followed by drying and pyrolysis stages these materials usually show a large surface area and a well developed porous structure that is a great advantage in the field of adsorption thus xerogels have been previously tested as adsorbents in the removal of several micropollutants with promising results carabineiro et al 2012 álvarez et al 2015 the so called green adsorbents are those obtained from waste materials being helpful to develop a sustainable waste management devoted to decrease the amount of generated wastes and to preserve the environment as well so there is an urgent need to become a circular economy where valuable wastes can be reused therefore the use of renewable cheap and extensively available agro industrial wastes as precursors of low cost adsorbents has become an attractive and eco friendly strategy to remove micro pollutants from water álvarez torrellas et al 2016 silva et al 2018 in this context lignin is a waste from the paper industry and the second most abundant natural substance in the world after cellulose it is isolated from hemicellulosic material through the pulping process of wood thus lignin based adsorbents activated carbons obtained via chemical or physical activation have been efficiently tested to remove pollutants from aqueous medium ma et al 2018 feng et al 2017 for industrial application of adsorption the fixed bed operation is the most usual and feasible technology sotelo et al 2012b sotelo et al 2012c albadarin et al 2012 sotelo et al 2014 for the correct design and scaling up of the adsorption columns it is necessary to develop a model considering the mass transfer process occurring in the adsorption system including the effect of the main operation variables pollutant concentration column dimensions and contact time in this context the use of a detailed mathematical model based on conservation equations allowed to estimate the mass transfer coefficients governing the adsorption process to the best of our knowledge this is the first study focused on the fixed bed adsorption of bpa onto a xerogel and a lignocellulosic material based activated carbon thus the aim of the present work is to study the efficient removal of bpa from aqueous solution by fixed bed adsorption onto the synthesized carbon adsorbents the xerogel rfx and the lignin based activated carbon klp involving the reuse of the exhausted adsorbent along subsequent adsorption desorption cycles previously the adsorption equilibrium of bpa onto both synthesized materials and a commercial activated carbon f400 used for comparison was investigated by the accomplishment of batch adsorption experiments in order to elucidate the equilibrium conditions finally a mathematical model based on mass conservation equations was used to fit in a realistic way the experimental breakthrough curves allowing the accurate estimation of the mass transfer coefficients external liquid film and adsorbed phase constants at the tested conditions the main novelties of this work compared with some studies reported in the literature on bpa adsorption bautista toledo et al 2005 choi et al 2005 liu et al 2009 koduru et al 2016 are the following the high bpa adsorption capacities e g 406 mg g obtained for the commercial f400 activated carbon vs the highest reported by bautista toledo et al 2005 of 263 mg g the dynamic adsorption removal of bpa in fixed bed column exploring the influence of the operating conditions initial bpa concentration volumetric flow rate and adsorbent weight on the adsorption parameters breakthrough and saturation times adsorption capacities at breakthrough and saturation times fractional bed utilization and mass transfer zone values thus the profile of the bpa breakthrough curves was obtained until the adsorption equilibrium was reached the accomplishment of the regeneration of the saturated adsorbent under 3 consecutive cycles obtaining satisfactory results the successful estimation of the external and adsorbed phase mass transfer parameters using a mathematical model based on mass conservation equations in addition as it has been reported in the work of park et al park et al 2015 the presence of natural organic matter nom in the tested wastewater has a pronounceable effect on bpa adsorption capacity as it has been found in some works of our group studying the interference of natural organic matter presence in a local drinking water or a hospital effluent on the adsorption process álvarez torrellas et al 2017a álvarez torrellas et al 2017b the effect of nom on bpa adsorption removal has been studied in our group and described in a non yet published paper observing a general decreasing in bpa uptake which depends on the type of the treated wastewater e g the concentration of natural organic matter inorganic content ph etc finally the tested adsorbents in this manuscript have been thoroughly characterized in terms of textural morphological and chemical surface properties specifically the main features that are a novelty in this work are the following i the determination of experimental breakthrough curves in very short times due to the optimization of the design of the adsorption column because of this and using the macro mesoporous synthesized materials several consecutive adsorption desorption cycles could be accomplished achieving a regeneration efficiency of the adsorbents very close to 100 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting outstanding regeneration efficiencies in breakthrough adsorption experiments for the emerging contaminant bisphenol a ii an important aspect to be considered in an adsorption process design are the mass transfer parameters for this reason a mathematical model based on conservation equations describing the adsorption column kinetics of bpa onto the tested carbon materials was developed thus the mass transfer parameters of bpa on the adsorbents were accurately estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bisphenol a

material in this work was supplied by ence energía y celulosa s a company obtained by acid precipitation of kraft black liquors the size fraction of the adsorbents was selected from 250 to 500 μm by sieving before being used all the solids were washed several times until the washing water was clear and then they were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h 2 2 synthesis of the adsorbents in this work the xerogels were synthesized by polycondensation reaction of resorcinol with formaldehyde solubilized in water using a molar ratio 1 2 in order to increase the ph of the precursor solution until the optimum value of 5 8 sodium hydroxide solutions of different concentrations 0 5 2 0 and 5 0 mol l were added drop wise under continuous stirring and ph monitoring subsequently the gelation of the mixture was performed at 85 c for 3 days after the obtained dark orange gel was dried in an oven during 5 days at 60 c and then for 3 days at 150 c finally the solid was thermally treated at 800 c under nitrogen flow 100 ml min in a quartz reactor the process of carbonization was accomplished in three stages 1 150 c 15 min 1 7 c min 2 400 c 60 min 5 c min and 3 800 c 120 min 5 c min the resulting material was stored in an oven at 100 c and labelled as rfx on the other hand the klp activated carbon was prepared by chemical activation of kraft lignin according to the method reported by fierro et al 2006 applying some modifications briefly kraft lignin previously washed with sulfuric acid solution and then deionized water was mixed with a h3po4 solution 85 wt for 6 h at 85 c using a h3po4 solution lignin mass ratio of 1 4 then the solid was dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 days and was heated at 500 c for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere 100 ml min in a quartz reactor in order to remove the excess of acid impurities after the carbonization the material was thoroughly washed with ultrapure water until neutral ph was reached finally the carbon was dried at 100 c in an oven for 24 h and labelled as klp all the adsorbents were tested in the granular form since they were sieved within the size of 250 500 μm before use 2 3 characterization of the adsorbents textural characterization of the carbon materials was performed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k using a micromeritics asap 2020 apparatus the samples were outgassed for 3 h at 250 c before the measurements which were accomplished within a relative pressure range of p p0 0 05 0 35 the specific surface area sbet m2 g was determined by b e t equation but due to the controversial use of this parameter for microporous materials apparent surface area will be used to refer us to the specific surface area of the tested carbons micropore volume vmicro cm3 g and external surface area sext m2 g values have been calculated using t plot method and the pore size distributions were obtained by using the horvath kawazoe method the morphology of the materials was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem with a jeol jsm 6335 microscope at 15 kev fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectra over the range of 4000 400 1 cm were recorded in a thermo nicolet ft ir spectrometer with a resolution of 4 1 cm the ft ir spectra were obtained using kbr method with a carbon kbr proportion of 0 01 tpd studies of the tested adsorbents in nitrogen atmosphere were carried out in a thermo finnigan tpd r o 1100 equipment within a temperature range from 30 to 800 c 50 mg of sample were loaded in a quartz u tube reactor previously the lines were cleaned with nitrogen flow and the equipment was constantly cooled during the operation the measurements were accomplished using a nitrogen flow of 20 cm3 min atmospheric pressure room temperature 23 c and using a heating rate of 5 c min the gas composition leaving the reactor was monitored by an on line mass spectrophotometer omnistar pfeiffer vacuum raman spectroscopy measurements was carried out in a ntegra spectra nt mdt micro raman equipment equipped with a ccd andor idus detector the laser power and the wavelength were established at 20 mw and 532 nm respectively raman scattered light was focused onto an olympus bxfm microscope the elemental microanalysis composition of the carbon materials was carried out using a leco chns 932 analyzer 0 6 1 6 mg of sample was held in a furnace at 1000 c occurring the combustion of the sample and evolving cox h2o n2 and sox furthermore the particle density of the solids was measured in a mercury hg porosimeter model thermo finnigan pascal 140 440 the external porosity of the bed ε has been calculated by using the following equation 1 ε 1 w v c 1000 ρ p where w is the weight of adsorbent g ρp is the particle density kg m3 and vc is the column volume m3 2 4 batch adsorption studies batch adsorption experiments were accomplished in a thermostatic shaker at room temperature 25 c each solution of bpa c0 0 1 kg m3 v 25 ml was put in contact to different amounts of adsorbent and maintained under constant stirring 250 rpm kinetic tests were assessed using a constant load of adsorbent 0 36 kg m3 taking samples at regular time intervals until the adsorption equilibrium was reached therefore the adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried out by using a dose of adsorbent interval ranging from 0 04 to 3 2 kg m3 in both cases samples were collected filtered using a ptfe filter 0 45 μm and immediately analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc all the analysis were conducted using a chromatograph varian prostar with a perkin elmer c18 column 220 mm 4 6 mm as stationary phase an isocratic mobile phase 45 55 v v of acetonitrile and acidified water 0 1 w h3po4 was used with a volumetric flow rate of 0 4 ml min the analysis were performed at 275 nm with a 20 μl loop volume the equilibrium adsorption capacity kg kg was estimated by the following equation 2 q e c 0 c e w v where c0 kg m3 is the initial concentration of bpa ce kg m3 is the equilibrium bpa concentration v m3 is the volume of the solution and w kg is the weight of adsorbent 2 5 fixed bed adsorption experiments fixed bed adsorption experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the behavior of the studied adsorbents in a dynamic process the tests were performed in a stainless steel column 1 6 cm 0 5 cm i d packed with glass wool in order to avoid void volumes and preference channels in the bed and then filled with the adsorbent the influent solution c0 0 005 0 04 kg m3 was pumped to the column using a hplc pump varian prostar 220 operating in up flow mode bpa concentration in the effluent was constantly measured by a uv vis detector varian 9050 model at a wavelength of 275 nm all the experiments were performed at room temperature 25 c using deionized water at non modified ph the dead volume of the installation has been determined using a bpa solution of constant concentration c0 0 04 kg m3 at a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min the column was filled only with glass beads without adsorbent so the dead volume value can be calculated using the following equation 3 v v q v 0 t 1 c c 0 dt where vv ml is the dead volume and qv ml min is the volumetric flow rate used in the dead volume measurement a scheme of the dynamic adsorption experimental set up used in this work has been depicted in fig s1 supplementary material it is noteworthy to explain that the performance of dynamic adsorption is highly influenced by different operation parameters such as i the column breakthrough time tb time at bpa concentration in the effluent is close to 10 of the inlet concentration ii the saturation time ts time when bpa concentration in the effluent reaches the bpa inlet concentration iii the total quantity of bpa adsorbed on the column or saturation adsorption capacity qs defined as kg of bpa adsorbed per kg of adsorbent so in order to describe the bpa fixed bed adsorption process onto the tested adsorbent materials several parameters have been determined saturation qs and breakthrough qb adsorption capacities kg kg fractional bed utilization fbu and length of the mass transfer zone mtz cm the description of these parameters is detailed in the supplementary material 2 6 mathematical model formulation the mathematical model proposed to describe the bpa fixed bed adsorption in liquid phase is based on the following general assumptions 1 the system is isothermal 2 the mobile phase can be described by an axial dispersed plug flow model 3 the liquid density can be considered constant 4 the adsorbent particles shape is spherical 5 the adsorbent particles are homogeneous the mass transfer between the liquid phase and the adsorbent is described by the homogeneous solid diffusion model hsdm piazzoli and antonelli 2018 using the linear driving force approximation ldf two mass transfer resistances in series are considered described by an external mass transfer coefficient in the liquid film kf and a mass transfer coefficient in the adsorbed phase ks the mass balance of bpa in an infinitesimal length of the packed bed can be described as the next expression 4 d l 2 c 2 z u 0 c z 1 ε ε q t c t where dl m2 s is the axial dispersion coefficient t s is the operation time ε m3 void m3 bed is the bed void fraction or bed porosity u0 m s is the interstitial velocity z is the axial coordinate and c kg m3 is the bpa concentration in the liquid phase the axial dispersion coefficient dl 1 s can be calculated with the next expression 5 d l u 0 2 r p 0 2 ε 0 011 ε re 0 48 where rp m is the particle radius and re is the reynolds number that can be obtained by the following correlation 6 re u 2 r p ρ μ where u m s is the superficial velocity ρ kg m3 is the liquid density and μ pa s is the liquid viscosity the expression q t is related to the mass transfer rate between the interstitial liquid and the adsorbent particle this term of the eq 4 can be described as follows 7 q t 3 k f r p c c where kf m s is the external mass transfer coefficient and c kg m3 is the bpa liquid phase concentration in equilibrium with the adsorbed phase concentration onto the particle surface q on the other hand the mass balance in the adsorbed phase can be expressed by the eq 8 8 q t k s q q where ks 1 s is the mass transfer coefficient in the adsorbed phase the continuity of mass flux across the external surface of the adsorbent particle can be imposed by using the next equation 9 3 k f r p c c k s ρ p q q the following boundary conditions were used 10 z 0 q ε s bed c d l c z q ε s bed c 0 11 z l c z 0 where c0 kg m3 is the initial bpa concentration q ml min is the volumetric flow rate and sbed m2 is the column section the complete model can be solved using the orthogonal collocation on finite elements method with cubic hermite polynomials the resulting ordinary differential equation ode system was integrated by using the odepack package odepack program 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents the tested adsorbents were characterized by n2 physisorption in order to obtain their textural properties that are collected in table 1 thus n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the carbon materials can be seen in fig 1a and b respectively f400 activated carbon showed a n2 isotherm type ia according to iupac classification thommes et al 2015 suggesting that the material is strictly microporous with a very high apparent surface area sbet 1059 m2 g and a relatively low external surface area in addition f400 activated carbon showed a maximum pore width of 0 5 nm fig 1b the n2 isotherm of rfx material can be classified according type i with a very important contribution of macroporosity on its porous structure the xerogel offered the lowest value of apparent surface area sbet 625 m2 g among the tested adsorbents even though the total pore volume took a very high value reaching up 1 70 cm3 g due to its high content in macropores in consequence rfx material showed the broadest range of pore width among the tested carbons 0 4 86 nm finally klp activated carbon showed a type i ii n2 adsorption desorption isotherm with a type h4 hysteresis loop the more pronounced uptake at low p p0 values can be associated with the filling of the micropores since h4 hysteresis loop is usually formed in mesoporous materials this material showed an excellent apparent surface area sbet 1053 m2 g combined with a high value of external surface area sext 477 m2 g and a pore width centered in the mesoporous range 2 0 3 6 nm from the ft ir spectra of the adsorbents see fig s2 in the supplementary material it can be concluded that all the tested materials showed similar chemical surface groups on their structure characteristic of the carbon materials more details can be found in the literature sotelo et al 2013a subbaramaiah et al 2014 interesting information about the surface functionalities on carbon adsorbents can be obtained from the tpd profiles under inert atmosphere co2 and co profiles obtained under heating with nitrogen flow from 30 to 800 c are shown in fig s3a and s3b supplementary material the co2 profile fig s3a showed two mainly peaks at low temperature region found more remarkably on the tpd profile of klp activated carbon the first found peak at 310 c can be assigned to the decomposition of the carboxyl groups another peak at approximately 400 c is associated with the thermal decomposition of carboxylic anhydrides groups these results are in agreement to the literature where it has been discussed that the maximum evolved co2 concentration is due to the decomposition of carboxylic groups figueiredo et al 1999 toebes et al 2004 other peak was found in the tpd profile of rfx material at about 550 c assigned to the decomposition of carboxylic functionalities finally it can also be observed a shoulder at 625 c originated from the decomposition of lactones since lactones are more stable than carboxylic groups tpd profile of f400 activated carbon showed only carboxyl groups less stable than those observed at higher temperature then analysing the co decomposition profile of the tested adsorbents fig s3b supplementary material again the highest evolved co concentration was found for klp material with a peak at 200 c attributed to the water loss due to hydroquinones and phenols thus the highest co concentration at higher temperature was observed for klp sample a small shoulder at about 310 c for klp and rfx adsorbents was determined attributed to the aldehyde groups the decomposition of carboxylic anhydrides led to the evolving of co at about 440 c fig s3b therefore the highly pronounced peak at 550 c found in tpd profile of rfx can be associated to the thermal degradation of phenols finally the co peak at higher temperatures at about 670 c present in all the three tested adsorbents can be attributed to the decomposition of phenol quinone and ether groups kundu et al 2008 these remarks are aligned with the measured co2 and co concentration values shown in table s2 supplementary material raman spectroscopic spectra of the tested carbon materials are depicted in the supplementary material fig s4 two bands at 1577 and 1348 1 cm are clearly visible in all the three spectra which can be assigned to the g and d band respectively g band at 1577 1 cm can be attributed to the stretching sp2 atomic pairs in plane vibration mode indicating the presence of defects in the graphitic structure otherwise the d band at 1348 1 cm can be assigned to the a1g in plane breathing vibration mode which is indicative of the disordered arrangement and low symmetry of graphite lattice structure a 2d peak at 2800 1 cm can be observed more clearly for klp activated carbon associated to the disposition of the graphitic structure related to the substituted groups such as alkane alkene and or alkyne groups jiang et al 2016 the intensity ratio of g and d bands id ig is a parameter widely used to characterize the relative disorder of the material thus in this case the id ig values were found of 1 15 0 89 and 0 77 for f400 rfx and klp adsorbents respectively according to the literature an id ig intensity ratio of 1 0 is indicative of a high degree of crystallinity of the adsorbent structure in addition it has been reported that the increase in id ig ratio is strongly correlated with the disorder in the carbon structure mainly due to the incorporation of nitrogen in the aromatic rings kundu et al 2010 these findings are in agreement to the elemental composition analyzed for the tested carbonaceous materials where f400 activated carbon with the highest id ig value showed a higher content in nitrogen table s3 of supplementary material sem micrographs of the tested adsorbents can be observed in fig s5 supplementary material from the micrographs it can be seen that a wide variety of morphologic properties are present in the carbon materials generally smooth and more roughness surfaces were observed related to the type of precursors and synthesis procedures tested the particle density of f400 rfx and klp materials was measured by hg porosimetry resulting in 454 452 and 417 kg m3 respectively finally the bed porosity ε was estimated for each adsorption column ranging from 0 49 to 0 54 3 2 batch adsorption tests in order to obtain bpa adsorption isotherms kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments were carried out the kinetic results showed that the adsorption equilibrium was found after 24 h for rfx and klp materials whereas f400 activated carbon required 48 h to reach the equilibrium fig 2a it was considered that the equilibrium of the system was reached when no significant changes in the adsorption capacity were observed for further adsorption times so it could be concluded that a longer equilibrium time was required for f400 activated carbon due to the essentially microporous nature of the material in this case adsorption usually proceeds through diffusion of the pollutant from the bulk liquid phase through the mesopores and then into the micropores transport within the inner pores can be severely limited by steric effects so the adsorbate takes a longer time to diffuse into the micropores causing slow adsorption kinetics sotelo et al 2012a sotelo et al 2013a the adsorption isotherms of bpa onto the three tested adsorbents are shown in fig 2b all the isotherms showed a high affinity towards the bpa molecule langmuir isotherm type sotelo et al 2013b with a steep initial slope which indicates that there is not competition between the target pollutant and water molecules for the active sites so the adsorption process depends only on the solution concentration this is as more solute is taken up there are less suitable active sites on which bpa molecules can be adsorbed it can be noticed that the equilibrium bpa adsorption capacity values onto the activated carbons qe 0 40 and 0 22 kg kg for f400 and klp respectively were found much higher in comparison to that obtained for the xerogel material qe 0 08 kg kg this behavior can be attributed to the higher micropore volume values of the activated carbons vmicro 0 38 and 0 30 cm3 g for f400 and klp respectively versus the value found for rfx vmicro 0 19 cm3 g so it seems that the textural characteristics of the materials are mainly conditioning the efficiency of the adsorption process as it has been reported in the literature micropores have a major role in the adsorption of small molecular organic compounds onto activated carbon materials finding usually a direct relationship between both parameters li et al 2002 furthermore some researchers have studied the influence of the pore size of the adsorbent on the adsorption of organic pollutants in aqueous phase previous works pelekani and snoeyink 2000 liu et al 2010 bak et al 2019 have established that the pore size should be above 1 2 1 7 or 1 2 times it depends on the reported work of the second widest dimension of the adsorbate molecule to allow an effective adsorption thus liu et al 2010 concluded that the steric hindrance effects on the adsorption kinetics were strongly related to the widest molecular dimension while the steric effects on the maximum adsorption capacity could be attributed to the second widest molecular dimension of the pollutant this is the similarity between the average pore size of the adsorbent and the second widest dimension of the adsorbate enhances the adsorption capacity of the pollutant these statements are in accordance to the results of this work since klp and f400 activated carbons showed almost the same microporous volume values but the maximum bpa uptake was obtained for f400 carbon due to the high similarity between the average pore width of the material 0 5 nm and the second highest dimension of bpa molecule 0 383 nm 3 3 fixed bed adsorption experiments the experimental breakthrough curves of bpa adsorption onto the tested adsorbents are shown in fig 3 the experiments have accomplished using a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min an initial bpa concentration of 0 04 kg m3 and 0 05 g of adsorbent in this case as it usually occurs with small organic compounds molecules the breakthrough curves described an s shape sigmoidal profile since they may be steeper or flatter depending on the characteristics of the kinetic adsorption process bak et al 2019 the results obtained in the fixed bed adsorption tests are in agreement to those observed in batch adsorption experiments thus the adsorption saturation was reached faster when the synthesized carbons were used obtaining a saturation time of 19 8 and 4 4 h for klp and rfx materials respectively table 2 due to the more opened porous structure of the synthesized materials the breakthrough curves of bpa onto klp and rfx adsorbents were steeper than that obtained for f400 activated carbon with a saturation time which extended until 58 h the narrow porous structure of the commercial f400 carbon led to the adsorbate molecules had difficulties in moving within the pores leading to mass transfer limited processes pelekani et al 2000 adsorption parameters such as breakthrough and saturation times tb ts breakthrough and saturation adsorption capacities qb qs fractional bed utilization fbu and the length of the mass transfer zone mtz have been determined and collected in table 2 from the experimental results the highest adsorption capacity at saturation time was obtained for f400 activated carbon qs 0 383 kg kg due to its high specific surface area and high contribution of micropores in the porous structure moreover the mass transfer properties on the commercial activated carbon were seen dramatically reduced this could be assessed by fbu and mtz values which were found of only 8 1 of used bed and a high length of mass transfer zone 1 47 cm considering these results it can be concluded that klp and rfx materials showed the best mass transfer properties among the tested adsorbents for this reason they have been used in the further tests studying the qualitative influence of the different operation conditions e g bpa initial concentration volumetric flow rate and adsorbent weight on bpa adsorption breakthrough curves 3 3 1 influence of operating conditions on breakthrough curves the influence of the initial concentration of bpa adsorbent weight and volumetric flow rate on the pollutant adsorption onto the synthesized materials has been investigated the effect of these variables on the shape of the bpa breakthrough curves and breakthrough and saturation times is illustrated in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively furthermore dynamic adsorption parameters of the experiments at the different conditions were calculated and collected in tables 3 and 4 for klp and rfx materials respectively breakthrough curves were obtained at different bpa initial concentrations 0 04 0 02 and 0 005 kg m3 onto klp and rfx adsorbents maintaining constant the mass of adsorbent 0 05 g and the volumetric flow rate 1 0 ml min fig 4a b thus as it could be observed in fig 4 an increasing in the bpa inlet concentration led to steeper breakthrough curves when the initial concentration of the pollutant was increased the kinetic adsorption process was favored leading to lower breakthrough and saturation times tables 3 and 4 these results are related to the diffusion process inside the bed since it has been reported that the mass transfer driving force increases due to the existence of a higher concentration gradient when the concentration of the pollutant increases too hayati et al 2018 moreover the increasing in the drug initial concentration allowed a faster saturation of the available adsorption binding sites which is in agreement to previous research sotelo et al 2013b in addition the saturation and breakthrough adsorption capacity values increased with the initial concentration and more efficient fbu and mtz values were found tables 3 and 4 furthermore the effect of the variation in the adsorbent weight 0 05 and 0 01 g on bpa dynamic adsorption has been investigated using a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min and an inlet bpa concentration of 0 02 kg m3 the obtained breakthrough curves are depicted in fig 5ab generally the retention of the adsorbate molecule in the packed bed columns is highly dependent on the quantity of adsorbent inside of the column an increasing in the adsorbent weight 0 05 g led to a flatter slope of the bpa breakthrough curve for both adsorbents indicating that the front of concentration is not fully developed in the bed nahm et al 2012 and higher breakthrough and saturation times were obtained resulting in a larger adsorption zone which is associated with a wider mass transfer zone tables 3 and 4 according to other works found in the literature uddin et al 2009 lezehari et al 2012 these results are strongly related with the presence of more binding sites available for the bpa adsorption nevertheless as it can be expected the saturation adsorption capacity values were not seen affected by the different quantities of adsorbent tables 3 and 4 finally the influence of different volumetric flow rate values 1 0 0 5 and 0 2 ml min on the bpa fixed bed adsorption onto both adsorbents has been studied at the following constant conditions 0 05 g of adsorbent weight and 0 04 kg m3 of initial concentration of the pollutant the experimental breakthrough curves are depicted in fig 6ab the breakthrough curve with a highest slope was obtained for the highest tested volumetric flow rate 1 0 ml min when the volumetric flow rate value increased the external film mass resistance at the adsorbent surface diminished thus reducing the boundary layer and the mass transfer resistance regarding the adsorption process this is related to the residence time that decreased when the flow rate increased leading to shorter breakthrough and saturation times chen et al 2012 the variation in the initial pollutant concentration and weight of adsorption showed similar effects on breakthrough curves of both tested materials therefore the change in the volumetric flow rate induced a different behavior in the two studied adsorbents in the case of lignin based activated carbon klp it could be observed that the variation in the volumetric flow rate did not strongly affect the calculated saturation adsorption capacity values table 3 the obtained results in this work are in agreement to previous adsorption studies in fixed bed mode sotelo et al 2013b in contrast the experimental adsorption capacities at saturation of bpa onto the xerogel were influenced by the change in the volumetric flow rate as it can be seen in table 4 in order to explain this behavior additional adsorption experiments at different initial concentrations were assessed at a constant volumetric flow rate of 0 2 ml min as it has been established in the literature zeledón toruño et al 2007 spaltro et al 2018 generally the adsorption processes appear to be governed by two different mass transport steps a first stage occurs when the adsorbate molecules are quickly adsorbed on the wider and more available pores macro and mesopores and a further second stage associated to a slower migration of the molecule to the less accessible binding sites micropores within the xerogel structure takes place this allows to conclude that macropores available on the xerogel surface were used instantaneously by the pollutant molecules in 1 0 ml min experiment thus in this case only broader pores were used for bpa adsorption and the equilibrium was not reached because the pollutant molecules did not have enough time to diffuse into the inner pores of the adsorbent moreover as it could be expected the changes in the volumetric flow rate did not affect the bpa adsorption capacity onto klp adsorbent due to its more homogeneous porous structure and practically absence of macroporous structure concluding that in this case the equilibrium could be reached in all the accomplished fixed bed experiments these findings are illustrated by the bpa adsorption isotherms obtained in batch and fixed bed mode operation at 1 0 ml min onto both adsorbents fig s6 in the supplementary material 3 4 adsorption desorption experiments one of the major issues related to the adsorption of emerging pollutants onto carbon materials is the cost associated with the regeneration and disposal of the saturated and exhausted chars although there are several methods to reuse the adsorbents mainly based on thermal or chemical regeneration processes one of the most extended method is the use of eluents previous works have studied the feasibility of the desorption process using several reagents such as water hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid acetic acid sodium hydroxide chloride methanol ethanol acetone among others chang et al 2014 dávila jiménez et al 2018 so in order to evaluate the regeneration efficiency of rfx and klp adsorbents three adsorption desorption cycles using pure methanol as desorbent agent have been accomplished the adsorption tests were carried out at the following operating conditions a bpa initial concentration of 0 04 kg m3 0 05 g of adsorbent weight and a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min after each adsorption step when the saturation was reached a methanol solution was pumped through the column at a volumetric flow rate of 1 0 ml min for 100 min this elution time was previously estimated to be enough to desorb bpa molecules totally then the regenerated adsorbent was used in the next adsorption cycle the three consecutive adsorption runs on both adsorbents are shown in fig 7ab indeed the saturation adsorption capacities obtained in each cycle have been depicted in fig 8ab from the figures it is noteworthy that the adsorption capacity was almost unaltered after regeneration via methanol along the three cycles indicating that an excellent regeneration efficiency 100 was achieved for the two tested carbon materials in addition it is worth highlighting that the bpa desorption was accomplished within a short time after 100 min as maximum time a slightly better desorption behavior was observed for rfx material in comparison to klp activated carbon attributed to the more opened porous structure of the xerogel that facilitates the desorption of the pollutant the efficient bpa desorption suggests the existence of a high affinity between the eluent and the bpa adsorbed molecules so it can be elucidated that the synthesized adsorbents can be used for the efficient removal of bpa from water and subsequently economically and easily regenerated in addition these results are in accordance to those found by reza et al 2014 which studied the efficiency of ibuprofen and clofibric acid desorption using different eluents concluding that the regeneration with methanol proved to be the most efficient process furthermore zhang et al 2014 have used different organic solvents methanol ethanol toluene and cyclohexane for the bpa desorption obtaining an elution efficiency of 98 using methanol 3 5 modeling of the experimental breakthrough curves for the modeling of the experimental adsorption data as it was described previously it is necessary to calculate the adsorbed concentration on the particle surface in equilibrium with the solute concentration in the liquid phase q value defined in eqs 8 and 9 so in this work the bpa experimental equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to the dual site langmuir model which is described by the following equation 12 q e q sat 1 k 1 c e 1 k 1 c e q sat 2 k 2 c e 1 k 2 c e where qsat1 and qsat2 kg kg are the maximum bpa adsorption capacities on each site k1 and k2 m3 kg are the adsorption equilibrium constants related to the affinity of the adsorbate molecule towards the surface of the adsorbent spaltro et al 2018 the experimental and predicted equilibrium adsorption data of bpa onto rfx and klp adsorbents can be seen in fig 9ab as it can be seen in the figures an excellent agreement with the experimental data could be achieved by using the dual site langmuir equation thus the calculated adsorption parameters are summarized in table 5 showing good correlation coefficients r2 for the modeling of the breakthrough curves of bpa onto rfx and klp materials it was necessary to obtain the mass transfer parameters that then were used for the validation of the model the operation conditions of the adsorption experiments used for the modeling are summarized in table s4 supplementary material it is noteworthy to say that the selected fixed bed operation conditions were those for the adsorption equilibrium was reached in order to demonstrate that the tested adsorption system is being effectively used an adsorption bpa breakthrough curve onto rfx material at a lower initial bpa concentration than those previously tested c0 0 0025 kg m3 was obtained fig s7 in the supplementary material it was found that the mathematical model fitted satisfactorily the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 95 for this case due to the used mathematical model is based on mass conservative equations when the contact time between adsorbate adsorbent is very high breakthrough time of 43 3 h the predicted breakthrough time is higher than the experimental thus the experimental adsorption parameters are collected in table s5 supplementary material the mass transfer parameters were calculated by fitting the model to the experimental breakthrough curves minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the experimental and predicted values the experimental and predicted breakthrough curves for bpa adsorption from ultrapure water onto klp and rfx adsorbents are depicted in fig 10ab it is clearly noticed that the model reproduced the experimental breakthrough curves within all the interval time with a very high accuracy obtaining high correlation coefficient values r2 0 99 0 98 for klp and rfx respectively hence the mathematical correlation offered by the model can be efficiently used to estimate bpa breakthrough curves onto carbonaceous materials and then up scale the adsorption process both mass transfer coefficients external and adsorbed phase for the fixed bed adsorption of bpa onto the tested adsorbents were calculated by using the proposed model different procedures of calculation were followed for each adsorbent in order to enhance the fitting of the model to the experimental data considering different cases table s4 supplementary material for fixed bed adsorption modeling of rfx the external mass transfer coefficient kf was assumed to be constant achieving a value of 1 29 10 5 m s moreover the surface mass transfer coefficient ks was considered dependent on the initial bpa concentration obtaining ks values of 2 53 10 6 1 27 10 5 and 2 84 10 5 1 s for bpa concentrations of 0 005 0 02 and 0 04 kg m3 respectively as it could be expected the adsorbed phase mass transfer parameter increased with an increasing in the pollutant concentration furthermore for the column adsorption simulation with klp adsorbent ks was considered constant resulting in a value of 9 63 10 5 1 s in this case the external mass transfer coefficient was seen dependent on the surface velocity in this case an increasing of kf value with the volumetric flow rate could be observed obtaining kf values of 2 45 10 5 and 7 38 10 5 m s for 0 5 and 1 0 ml min respectively the calculated mass transfer parameters odepack program 2019 for both adsorbents are summarized in table 6 it was found that both mass transfer coefficients estimated for the xerogel material were slightly lower than those calculated for klp activated carbon according to the literature dogan et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 the kinetics of any adsorption process is usually governed by two mechanisms i the transport on the mesopores of the adsorbent that are considered channels of transport of the adsorbate until saturation of this external surface is reached ii the penetration of the adsorbate into the pores that are less accessible the micropores where the diffusion resistance increases decreasing the diffusion rate it was found that klp activated carbon showed a higher content in mesopores than the xerogel xrf as it can be seen in the pore size distribution of the adsorbents fig 1b enhancing the transport of the pollutant in the adsorbent surface this fact can explain the high calculated values of both external and adsorbed phase mass transfer parameters for klp material the obtained kf values in this work are in accordance to those found in the literature for instance ye et al 2019 studied the fixed bed adsorption of several micropollutants pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds onto granular activated carbon finding external mass transfer coefficients ranging from 6 10 6 and 2 10 5 m s in the same way kf values from 2 8 10 5 to 1 0 10 4 m s were obtained for the adsorption of chloroform and pce onto commercial activated carbons piazzoli and antonelli 2018 4 conclusions in this work the synthesized klp and rfx materials have proved to be excellent adsorbents for the removal of bisphenol a from water batch and fixed bed experiments onto klp activated carbon and rfx carbon xerogel were accomplished in order to study bpa adsorption capacity of these synthesized carbonaceous materials versus a commercial activated carbon thus the adsorption breakthrough curves were simulated using a mathematical model based on mass conservative equations and the mass transfer parameters were effectively estimated the following conclusions can be drawn from this study i the textural characterization of the materials allowed to elucidate the mainly microporous character of the xerogel with a higher content in macropores or transport pores since klp activated carbon showed a type i ii n2 adsorption desorption isotherm associated to mesoporous materials the higher mesoporosity found in the synthesized materials compared to the properties of the conventional f400 activated carbon conditioned mainly both the adsorption capacity and kinetic of the process favoring the adsorption diffusion of the pollutant through the inner porosity of the solid ii the operation conditions e g initial bpa concentration mass of adsorbent and volumetric flow rate played a significant role on the adsorption column performance influencing on the shape of the breakthrough curves and the adsorption parameters such as breakthrough time and saturation adsorption capacity attending to the adsorption capacity the optimum operation conditions could be established as 0 2 ml min 0 05 g of adsorbent weight and 0 04 kg m3 of initial concentration of the pollutant hence at these conditions the saturation adsorption capacity values of bpa reached the equilibrium values qs 0 253 and 0 078 kg kg for klp and rfx respectively indicating that an outstanding efficiency of the bed was achieved with very fast adsorption kinetics due to the highly opened porous structure of the adsorbents and consequence of the avoiding of axial dispersion preference channelling formation or bed compaction iii a total regeneration of the exhausted solids after three consecutive runs was effectively accomplished maintaining their adsorptive properties iv the experimental breakthrough curves were satisfactorily fitted to a mathematical model based on conservation equations aligned with the use of the dual site langmuir model to describe the equilibrium adsorption data by this method external and adsorbed phase mass transfer coefficients could be estimated with a high accuracy kf 1 29 7 38 10 5 m s ks 0 25 9 63 10 5 1 s declaration of competing interest the authors of the manuscript entitled new insights from modelling

1549,to investigate the migration behavior of sr strontium in granite a rough walled single fracture of granite was prepared with the self built rock splitting apparatus surface roughness angle and hydraulic aperture of the fracture were measured by 3d laser scanning and fluid flow experiment respectively the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiments of sr in the single fracture were conducted at different flow rates and initial concentrates of sr and the important transport parameters were derived by fitting the btcs and dpcs the results suggested that the sorption of sr onto the

1 introduction granite is the first choice as the host rock media of a radioactive waste repository for many countries epri 2010 attributed to its low permeability an intact granite can effectively restrict the flow of underground water and retard the migration of radionuclides however over a very long geological period the structure of granite mass can be disturbed as the result of the exogenic and endogenic geological processes which generates many fractures with different geometrical morphologies the fractures can become the main passages for seepage of underground water and transport of radionuclides therefore for reliably assessing the safety of a repository it is indispensable to take into account the migration behavior of radionuclides in granite fractures konzuk and kueper 2004 huang et al 2015 a single fracture is the basic unit of fracture networks the experimental studies on the hydraulic behavior and radionuclide migration mechanism in a rough single fracture are the foundation stone for constructing a realistic model of radionuclides transportation in a jointed rock matrix konzuk and kueper 2004 since water flow is the main driving force for nuclide migration the study of flow in a single fracture is an important prerequisite for understanding nuclide migration behavior in the past considerable attentions have been paid to the fluid flow through a single fracture between two perfectly smooth parallel joint walls in which the flow is generally assumed to be laminar and can be characterized by the cubic low bear 1972 witherspoon et al 1980 nevertheless lots of studies have found that the flow through a real fracture may not be laminar on account of its rough surface and variable aperture ji et al 2008 luo et al 2016 hence it is essential to investigate the possible seepage behavior of flow in a rough single fracture with particular aperture before focusing on the migration of radionuclide another important topic is the migration of radionuclides in a single fracture 90sr is one of important fission products of radioactive wastes and spent fuels for the reason of long half life 29a and high poisonous of 90sr once the soil or water is contaminated by 90sr the safety of environment will be exposed to danger for decades serne et al 1996 in practice non radioactive 88sr is usually selected as the experimental substitute of 90sr for sake of safety moreover the chemical sorption properties of stable 88sr are the same with that of 90sr li et al 2011 yu et al 2015 for the moment most studies have focused on the migration of 90sr and stable 88sr in the soil and crushed granite torstenfelt et al 1982 park and hahn 1999 li et al 2011 palágyi et al 2015 wissocq et al 2018 few studies hadermann and heer 1996 vandergraaf et al 1996 vandergraaf et al 1997 hoehn et al 1998 vilks and baik 2001 albarran et al 2011 have concentrated on the dynamic sorption of the 85sr in a single fracture filled with or without colloids at a certain flow rate however it is still lack enough knowledge about the sorption mechanism of sr in a single fracture the goal of this work is to analyze the seepage behavior of flow in a rough single fracture with particular aperture and more importantly investigate the sorption and desorption behavior of sr in a rough single fracture the probable sorption mechanism of sr in the single fracture will be discussed in this paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 fracture generation grainte core was collected at the northwest area of china the dimensions of which are 100 mm in length and 50 mm in diameter x ray diffractometer xrd philips mpd was employed to identify the main minerals constituting the granite and it was found that the granite sample was mainly composed of quartz 31 7 albite 30 4 microcline 26 4 biotite 7 2 and chlorite 4 3 the cation exchange capacity cec was determined to be 9 3 0 2 meq 100 g chen et al 2013 to create a single fracture in the rock core sample an apparatus fig 1 made up of high carbon 1 20 c by weight steel was developed to produce a single fracture based on a brazilian technique the preparation process of a single fracture is in accordance with the procedure mentioned by singh et al 2015 the rock core was then separated into two cylindrical halves by means of splitting subsequently both cylindrical halves were joined together by means of epoxy resin generating single fracture 3 roughness measurement of the fracture surfaces roughness measurement can be performed by employing a 3d laser profile scanner the laser beam is adopted to capture the texture of the fracture surface or the topography of the surfaces in the present work roughness measurements were performed on both the fracture surfaces at 0 04 mm point spacing before being affixed together which was done by employing the creaform 3d laser profile absolute arm scanner the data obtained from the scanner were handled to generate the 3d topography of the fracture surfaces as the way described by singh et al 2015 fig 2 presents the 3d surface profile of the fracture surfaces of the sample a typical surface profile section a b was taken at the center of the sample whole along the length of generated 3d surface roughness profile as displayed in dotted line in fig 2 in order to parameterize the fracture surface roughness a number of parameters have been proposed e g joint roughness coefficient jrc asperity slope z 2 and fractal dimension luo et al 2016 recently he and his co workers he et al 2016 have put forward the roughness angle to parameterize fracture surface roughness meanwhile their studies proved that the well known cubic law modified by the roughness angle α m could describe the steady flow through a single rough fracture better than the law modified by jrc hence the roughness angle was chosen as the key parameter for the characterization of fracture surface the roughness angle can be calculated by he et al 2016 1 tan α m 1 l z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where l is the profile length x i and z i represent the coordinates of the mth fracture surface profile for example the a b line in fig 3 however due to the fractal characterization of surface topography guerrero et al 2002 there will be different surface profiles along the x or y coordinate according to the sampling scale and each profile may have particular roughness parameter as a result it is unreliable to characterize the surface roughness with one certain profile on the other hand only the surface profile along the flow path will have more remarkable influence on the seepage in the single fracture therefore 49 surface profiles p1 p49 along the flow path were extracted at 0 1 mm sampling spacing in the fracture wide direction and the roughness angle α m of each profile was calculated by using eq 1 as shown in table 1 the average roughness angle effective inclination angle α e of the fracture surface is 15 2 which could be obtained by applying the follow equation 2 α e 1 49 α m 4 the fluid flow test in the single fracture the fluid flow characteristic of the single fracture was determined with the help of a self built experiment apparatus the schematic diagram of which was depicted in fig 3 and its operating principle was similar to that of flexible wall permeameter zhou et al 2013 a confining pressure of 1 mpa was applied to the cell filled with compressed air to push the membrane in contact with the specimen side tightly and deionized water was used to saturate the specimen wherein the specimen was exposed to water under an applied positive pressure of 150 kpa fluid flow tests were then conducted on the specimen at different positive pressure the flow rate under particular hydraulic gradient was measured by weighing the volume of effluent water collected at every 10 min i e gravimetrically each measurement under particular hydraulic gradient will be carried out three times in parallel to ensure the reliability of measurements 5 the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiment of sr the column experiments were carried out to survey the sorption and desorption of sr in the single fracture influent solutions with two different initial concentrations of sr c 0 3 0 10 5and 7 0 10 5g ml respectively were prepared by dissolution srcl2 salt sigma aldrich into deionized water which were injected into the influent pipe through three way valve to provide the steady nuclide source for the migration study in each column experiment the fluid rate was changed by varying the hydraulic gradient so as to examine its effect on the migration behavior of sr in the dynamic sorption experiment the influent solution was injected to the single fracture granite at certain constant flux until the maximum concentration of sr in effluents was reached in the desorption experiment the deionized water was introduced to displace sr adsorbed onto the fracture surface at the constant flux until the concentration of sr in effluents was approached to zero the flow rate under particular hydraulic gradient was measured by weighing the volume of effluents which is continually collected by using a fraction collector at constant sampling time the concentrations of sr in effluents were determined by icp aes leeman psfo 2 0 and the concentration was expressed as a relative concentration c c 0 where c is the concentration in the effluent six btcs sorption breakthrough curves and four dpcs displacement curves were obtained as a c c 0 vs n pv the number of pore volumes of liquid phase plots on the other hand in order to evaluate the influence of initial concentration of sr on its sorption behavior the btcs and dpcs were also determined under two different initial concentrations of 3 0 10 5 and 7 0 10 5 g ml 6 theory model for transport experiments the governing equation describing the one dimension transport of nuclide in the fracture is based on albarran et al 2011 shahkarami et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 3 c t υ r c x d l r 2 c x 2 2 θd er c y 0 where c and c are the solute concentrations in the fracture and rock matrix respectively d l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient υ

diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix θ is the rock porosity e the hydraulic fracture aperture r is the retardation factor r 1 k f e 2 k f is the surface distribution coefficient due to the crystalline rocks low permeability the diffusion of nuclide through the matrix is so weak that the sorption of nuclide into the matrix at short time scales can be neglected hence the transport of nuclide in the fractures is assumed to be the crucial process for evaluating the migration tendency of nuclide in the site the initial c 0 at x 0 and t 0 0 and c t c 0 at x l and boundary c 0 t x 0 l conditions yield the following equations describing the sorption btcs and the desorption dpcs obtained for c rels and c reld respectively 4 c rels c x t c 0 1 2 erfc r n pv 2 r n pv pe since the

hydraulic gradient as demonstrated in fig 4 the reynolds number provides an indication of flow regime laminar or non laminar based on the geometry of the flowing system and the properties of the fluid ranjith 2010 it can be expressed as 6 re ρql μa where ρ is the fluid density l is the characteristic dimension of the flow system q is the volumetric flow rate a is the flow area μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid for flow between two parallel plates with w e w is width of the fracture joint e is hydraulic fracture aperture l e and thus 7 re ρq μw the obtained reynolds values show low re 7 as presented in table 1 which implies that the fluid flow in these cases is laminar as suggested by singh et al 2015 and can be described by the cubic law ji et al 2008 besides seeing that the variable groundwater velocities in rock fractures are 0 0012 0 0382 cm s estimated by novakowski et al 2006 and the open fracture apertures in granite are 0 3 3 mm widestrand et al 2007 the reynolds values will be re 1 according to eq 7 thereby it is reliable to apply the cubic law in seepage analysis of field site taking account to the effect of surface roughness on fluid low he et al 2016 proposed that the cubic law can be modified as follows 8 q cos 4 α e ge 3 12 ν j where α e is the average roughness angle of the fracture surface g is the acceleration due to gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid j is the hydraulic gradient the value of e could be calculated by using eq 8 as displayed in table 2 and the average hydraulic aperture ē is 0 025 cm 7 2 migration of sr in the single fracture fig 5 shows the btcs of sr at flow rates of 0 0013 0 0444 and 0 2113 cm s and the dpcs of sr at flow rates of 0 0039 0 0675 and 0 1145 cm s when its initial concentration is 7 0 10 5 g ml the btcs and dpcs were then fitted by using eqs 4 and 5 respectively and their fittings the blue lines shown in fig 5 present a nice match with the experimental data the transport parameters for btcs and dpcs at different flow rates derived by the fitting were summarized in table 3 it can be concluded that the sorption of sr onto the fracture surface is weak according to its low sorption distribution coefficient k fs meanwhile the adsorbed sr can be completely desorbed from the surface as depicted in fig 5 which revealed that the sorption of sr in these cases is reversible k fd k fs considering the sorption of sr onto the granite is reversible and the sorption capacity quite small the existence of fractures will significantly increase the risk of sr leakage into biosphere on the other hand although the flow rates have been widely changed from 0 0013 to 0 2113 cm s the sorption distribution coefficients of sr are inclined to be constant approximately equal to 0 045 cm as displayed in table 3 which means the flow rates almost have no effect on the sorption of sr table 4 displays the important transport parameters for btcs and dpcs at initial concentrations of 3 0 10 5 g ml in this case the value of sorption distribution coefficient k f is quite close to that of btcs at initial concentration of 7 0 10 5 g ml which means that the sorption of sr may not be influenced by the initial concentration variation of sr this result is consistent with the viewpoint stated by torstenfelt et al 1982 pot and genty 2005 it can be safely inferred that the sorption of sr onto granite fracture surface is linear consequently its sorption distribution coefficient will be a constant and unaffected by the initial concentration change of sr there are two main types of adsorption sites on the granite jin et al 2016 one is the negative surface charge sites derived from isomorphous substitution i e cation ion exchange sites this kind of adsorption sites can adsorb cations due to electrostatic interactions and its sorption capacity will be affected by ion type and ionic strength the other is surface hydroxyl groups e g si oh and al oh formed by the surface hydration reaction between granite surface and water these sites can adsorb both anions and cations and the sorption capacity was controlled by the protonation and deprotonation process of hydroxyl functional groups using batch techniques torstenfelt et al 1982 found that the sorption of sr on rock and minerals could qualitatively be correlated to the cation exchange capacity of the solid sorbent moreover the static sorption and desorption sequential chemical extraction experiments of sr onto a bulguksa granite were carried out by park and hahn 1999 and it was observed that sr showed almost linear and reversible ion exchange sorption behavior recently employing the generalised composite approach davis et al 2004 tertre et al 2008 chen et al 2013 performed numerical analysis of the sorption data obtained by park and hahn 1999 and they proposed that ion exchange process was the main sorption mechanism of sr onto the granite based on the analyses above it can be safely concluded that the sorption of sr onto the granite surface is dominated by rapid ion exchange process and under dynamic condition this sorption behavior is linear and reversible furthermore specific surface area the ratio of the fracture surface area to the volume of mobile water in the fracture has found to be the main factor that affects the sorption of sr onto the fracture in neutral environment torstenfelt et al 1982 wels et al 1996 consequently the sorption of sr is governed by surface site capacities of the facture wissocq et al 2018 and will not be affected by the variation of flow rate 8 conclusions surface roughness angle and hydraulic aperture are two key characteristic parameters of a rough single fracture which were measured by the 3d laser scanning and fluid flow experiment in this paper respectively the seepage experiment indicated that the flow in this single fracture is laminar and can be described by the modified cubic law the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiments of sr in the single fracture were also conducted at the different flow rates and initial concentrates and the important transport parameters were derived by fitting the btcs and dpcs it is can be inferred from the results that the sorption of sr onto the fracture surface is linear and reversible which is dominated by the rapid ion exchange process and unaffected by the

diameter x ray diffractometer xrd philips mpd was employed to identify the main minerals constituting the granite and it was found that the granite sample was mainly composed of quartz 31 7 albite 30 4 microcline 26 4 biotite 7 2 and chlorite 4 3 the cation exchange capacity cec was determined to be 9 3 0 2 meq 100 g chen et al 2013 to create a single fracture in the rock core sample an apparatus fig 1 made up of high carbon 1 20 c by weight steel was developed to produce a single fracture based on a brazilian technique the preparation process of a single fracture is in accordance with the procedure mentioned by singh et al 2015 the rock core was then separated into two cylindrical halves by means of splitting subsequently both cylindrical halves were joined together by means of epoxy resin generating single fracture 3 roughness measurement of the fracture surfaces roughness measurement can be performed by employing a 3d laser profile scanner the laser beam is adopted to capture the texture of the fracture surface or the topography of the surfaces in the present work roughness measurements were performed on both the fracture surfaces at 0 04 mm point spacing before being affixed together which was done by employing the creaform 3d laser profile absolute arm scanner the data obtained from the scanner were handled to generate the 3d topography of the fracture surfaces as the way described by singh et al 2015 fig 2 presents the 3d surface profile of the fracture surfaces of the sample a typical surface profile section a b was taken at the center of the sample whole along the length of generated 3d surface roughness profile as displayed in dotted line in fig 2 in order to parameterize the fracture surface roughness a number of parameters have been proposed e g joint roughness coefficient jrc asperity slope z 2 and fractal dimension luo et al 2016 recently he and his co workers he et al 2016 have put forward the roughness angle to parameterize fracture surface roughness meanwhile their studies proved that the well known cubic law modified by the roughness angle α m could describe the steady flow through a single rough fracture better than the law modified by jrc hence the roughness angle was chosen as the key parameter for the characterization of fracture surface the roughness angle can be calculated by he et al 2016 1 tan α m 1 l z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where l is the profile length x i and z i represent the coordinates of the mth fracture surface profile for example the a b line in fig 3 however due to the fractal characterization of surface topography guerrero et al 2002 there will be different surface profiles along the x or y coordinate according to the sampling scale and each profile may have particular roughness parameter as a result it is unreliable to characterize the surface roughness with one certain profile on the other hand only the surface profile along the flow path will have more remarkable influence on the seepage in the single fracture therefore 49 surface profiles p1 p49 along the flow path were extracted at 0 1 mm sampling spacing in the fracture wide direction and the roughness angle α m of each profile was calculated by using eq 1 as shown in table 1 the average roughness angle effective inclination angle α e of the fracture surface is 15 2 which could be obtained by applying the follow equation 2 α e 1 49 α m 4 the fluid flow test in the single fracture the fluid flow characteristic of the single fracture was determined with the help of a self built experiment apparatus the schematic diagram of which was depicted in fig 3 and its operating principle was similar to that of flexible wall permeameter zhou et al 2013 a confining pressure of 1 mpa was applied to the cell filled with compressed air to push the membrane in contact with the specimen side tightly and deionized water was used to saturate the specimen wherein the specimen was exposed to water under an applied positive pressure of 150 kpa fluid flow tests were then conducted on the specimen at different positive pressure the flow rate under particular hydraulic gradient was measured by weighing the volume of effluent water collected at every 10 min i e gravimetrically each measurement under particular hydraulic gradient will be carried out three times in parallel to ensure the reliability of measurements 5 the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiment of sr the column experiments were carried out to survey the sorption and desorption of sr in the single fracture influent solutions with two different initial concentrations of sr c 0 3 0 10 5and 7 0 10 5g ml respectively were prepared by dissolution srcl2 salt sigma aldrich into deionized water which were injected into the influent pipe through three way valve to provide the steady nuclide source for the migration study in each column experiment the fluid rate was changed by varying the hydraulic gradient so as to examine its effect on the migration behavior of sr in the dynamic sorption experiment the influent solution was injected to the single fracture granite at certain constant flux until the maximum concentration of sr in effluents was reached in the desorption experiment the deionized water was introduced to displace sr adsorbed onto the fracture surface at the constant flux until the concentration of sr in effluents was approached to zero the flow rate under particular hydraulic gradient was measured by weighing the volume of effluents which is continually collected by using a fraction collector at constant sampling time the concentrations of sr in effluents were determined by icp aes leeman psfo 2 0 and the concentration was expressed as a relative concentration c c 0 where c is the concentration in the effluent six btcs sorption breakthrough curves and four dpcs displacement curves were obtained as a c c 0 vs n pv the number of pore volumes of liquid phase plots on the other hand in order to evaluate the influence of initial concentration of sr on its sorption behavior the btcs and dpcs were also determined under two different initial concentrations of 3 0 10 5 and 7 0 10 5 g ml 6 theory model for transport experiments the governing equation describing the one dimension transport of nuclide in the fracture is based on albarran et al 2011 shahkarami et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 3 c t υ r c x d l r 2 c x 2 2 θd er c y 0 where c and c are the solute concentrations in the fracture and rock matrix respectively d l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient υ is the fluid velocity under laminar flow condition x is the distance in the direction of the flow field y is the distance in the direction perpendicular to the fracture t is time d is the effective diffusion coefficient in the rock matrix θ is the rock porosity e the hydraulic fracture aperture r is the retardation factor r 1 k f e 2 k f is the surface distribution coefficient due to the crystalline rocks low permeability the diffusion of nuclide through the matrix is so weak that the sorption of nuclide into the matrix at short time scales can be neglected hence the transport of nuclide in the fractures is assumed to be the crucial process for evaluating the migration tendency of nuclide in the site the initial c 0 at x 0 and t 0 0 and c t c 0 at x l and boundary c 0 t x 0 l conditions yield the following equations describing the sorption btcs and the desorption dpcs obtained for c rels and c reld respectively 4 c rels c x t c 0 1 2 erfc r n pv 2 r n pv pe since the sorption and desorption breakthrough curves are theoretically mirror symmetrical for a reversible adsorption process palágyi et al 2015 the desorption dpcs function can be expressed as 5 c reld c x t

hydraulic gradient as demonstrated in fig 4 the reynolds number provides an indication of flow regime laminar or non laminar based on the geometry of the flowing system and the properties of the fluid ranjith 2010 it can be expressed as 6 re ρql μa where ρ is the fluid density l is the characteristic dimension of the flow system q is the volumetric flow rate a is the flow area μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid for flow between two parallel plates with w e w is width of the fracture joint e is hydraulic fracture aperture l e and thus 7 re ρq μw the obtained reynolds values show low re 7 as presented in table 1 which implies that the fluid flow in these cases is laminar as suggested by singh et al 2015 and can be described by the cubic law ji et al 2008 besides seeing that the variable groundwater velocities in rock fractures are 0 0012 0 0382 cm s estimated by novakowski et al 2006 and the open fracture apertures in granite are 0 3 3 mm widestrand et al 2007 the reynolds values will be re 1 according to eq 7 thereby it is reliable to apply the cubic law in seepage analysis of field site taking account to the effect of surface roughness on fluid low he et al 2016 proposed that the cubic law can be modified as follows 8 q cos 4 α e ge 3 12 ν j where α e is the average roughness angle of the fracture surface g is the acceleration due to gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid j is the hydraulic gradient the value of e could be calculated by using eq 8 as displayed in table 2 and the average hydraulic aperture ē is 0 025 cm 7 2 migration of sr in the single fracture fig 5 shows the btcs of sr at flow rates of 0 0013 0 0444 and 0 2113 cm s and the dpcs of sr at flow rates of 0 0039 0 0675 and 0 1145 cm s when its initial concentration is 7 0 10 5 g ml the btcs and dpcs were then fitted by using eqs 4 and 5 respectively and their fittings the blue lines shown in fig 5 present a nice match with the experimental data the transport parameters for btcs and dpcs at different flow rates derived by the fitting were summarized in table 3 it can be concluded that the sorption of sr onto the fracture surface is weak according to its low sorption distribution coefficient k fs meanwhile the adsorbed sr can be completely desorbed from the surface as depicted in fig 5 which revealed that the sorption of sr in these cases is reversible k fd k fs considering the sorption of sr onto the granite is reversible and the sorption capacity quite small the existence of fractures will significantly increase the risk of sr leakage into biosphere on the other hand although the flow rates have been widely changed from 0 0013 to 0 2113 cm s the sorption distribution coefficients of sr are inclined to be constant approximately equal to 0 045 cm as displayed in table 3 which means the flow rates almost have no effect on the sorption of sr table 4 displays the important transport parameters for btcs and dpcs at initial concentrations of 3 0 10 5 g ml in this case the value of sorption distribution coefficient k f is quite close to that of btcs at initial concentration of 7 0 10 5 g ml which means that the sorption of sr may not be influenced by the initial concentration variation of sr this result is consistent with the viewpoint stated by torstenfelt et al 1982 pot and genty 2005 it can be safely inferred that the sorption of sr onto granite fracture surface is linear consequently its sorption distribution coefficient will be a constant and unaffected by the initial concentration change of sr there are two main types of adsorption sites on the granite jin et al 2016 one is the negative surface charge sites derived from isomorphous substitution i e cation ion exchange sites this kind of adsorption sites can adsorb cations due to electrostatic interactions and its sorption capacity will be affected by ion type and ionic strength the other is surface hydroxyl groups e g si oh and al oh formed by the surface hydration reaction between granite surface and water these sites can adsorb both anions and cations and the sorption capacity was controlled by the protonation and deprotonation process of hydroxyl functional groups using batch techniques torstenfelt et al 1982 found that the sorption of sr on rock and minerals could qualitatively be correlated to the cation exchange capacity of the solid sorbent moreover the static sorption and desorption sequential chemical extraction experiments of sr onto a bulguksa granite were carried out by park and hahn 1999 and it was observed that sr showed almost linear and reversible ion exchange sorption behavior recently employing the generalised composite approach davis et al 2004 tertre et al 2008 chen et al 2013 performed numerical analysis of the sorption data obtained by park and hahn 1999 and they proposed that ion exchange process was the main sorption mechanism of sr onto the granite based on the analyses above it can be safely concluded that the sorption of sr onto the granite surface is dominated by rapid ion exchange process and under dynamic condition this sorption behavior is linear and reversible furthermore specific surface area the ratio of the fracture surface area to the volume of mobile water in the fracture has found to be the main factor that affects the sorption of sr onto the fracture in neutral environment torstenfelt et al 1982 wels et al 1996 consequently the sorption of sr is governed by surface site capacities of the facture wissocq et al 2018 and will not be affected by the variation of flow rate 8 conclusions surface roughness angle and hydraulic aperture are two key characteristic parameters of a rough single fracture which were measured by the 3d laser scanning and fluid flow experiment in this paper respectively the seepage experiment indicated that the flow in this single fracture is laminar and can be described by the modified cubic law the sorption and desorption breakthrough experiments of sr in the single fracture were also conducted at the different flow rates and initial concentrates and the important transport parameters were derived by fitting the btcs and dpcs it is can be inferred from the results that the sorption of sr onto the fracture surface is linear and reversible which is dominated by the rapid ion exchange process and unaffected by the variation of flow rate and initial concentrate of sr
