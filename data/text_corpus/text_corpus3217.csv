16085,the bacteria in the water column and surface sediments are inherently intertwined and inseparable in aquatic ecosystems yet little is known about the integrated spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of both planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in reservoirs by investigating the planktonic and sedimentary bacteria during four seasons from 88 samples of 11 representative sites across the danjiangkou reservoir we depicted an integrated biogeographic pattern of bacterial communities in the water source of the world s largest water diversion project our study revealed both planktonic mantel r 0 502 p 0 001 and sedimentary mantel r 0 131 p 0 009 bacterial communities were significantly correlated with environmental heterogeneity but a weak disparity along spatial heterogeneity and the significant seasonal dynamics of planktonic mantel r 0 499 p 0 001 rather than sedimentary bacteria particularly rare biosphere played a main role in determining the community succession in the reservoir it not only exhibited a more striking environmental separation than abundant taxa but also was an essential part in mediating spatiotemporal shifts of planktonic bacteria and maintaining the stability of bacterial community these rare bacteria were respectively mediated by stochastic 62 68 and selective 79 60 processes in water and sediments despite abundant taxa being largely determined by stochastic processes 86 88 93 96 overall our study not only fills a gap in understanding the bacterial community dynamics and underlying drivers in source water reservoirs but also highlights the particular importance of rare bacteria in mediating biogeochemical cycles in world s large reservoir ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source water reservoir bacterial community rare biosphere spatiotemporal dynamic 1 introduction bacteria are the critical constituents of biogeochemical cycling and food webs in various aquatic ecosystems madsen 2011 tran et al 2021 and commonly exist in water columns and sediment maintaining the stability of ecological functions and services liu et al 2018 unraveling their spatiotemporal variations and potential driving forces is widely regarded as the fundamental ecological goal which is of great significance for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes and regulating the ecosystem function langenheder and székely 2011 niño garcía et al 2016 bacterial communities have been intensively studied in oceans louca et al 2016 rivers liu et al 2018 drinking water jia et al 2020 and lakes peter and sommaruga 2016 usually the bacterial community is highly diverse and extremely heterogeneous in composition with relatively few abundant taxa and numerous rare taxa campbell et al 2011 interestingly recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of rare subcommunity who can serve as keystone species with disproportionately large effects on ecosystem services lynch and neufeld 2015 xue et al 2020 reservoirs are typical surface water ecosystems created by dam construction for various purposes such as hydroelectricity production agriculture irrigation flood control and recreation activities feng et al 2009 reitter et al 2021 they usually play an essential role in supplying essential water resources for drinking water production and recreational activities especially in regions with water scarcity great attention has been paid to the distribution and dynamic of abiotic factors such as temperature nutrients and micropollutants during the seasonal change or along the spatial gradient of reservoir ecosystems dang et al 2018 li et al 2019 wiejaczka et al 2018 recently biotic components such as phytoplankton xu et al 2018a 2018b 2017 eukaryotes yan et al 2020 and planktonic or sedimentary bacteria liu et al 2015 reitter et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 llirós et al 2014 were found to quickly respond to the external environmental interference for example bacterial communities in three freshwater reservoirs exhibited distinct compositions and were strongly influenced by ph alkalinity and organic carbon content llirós et al 2014 some heterotrophic bacterial taxa were found to exhibit higher abundance with increased synechococcus cyanobacterial species at internal and exit sites of a large estuarine reservoir during summer compared with spring xu et al 2018 as the emphasis on rare subcommunity increases the distinct ecological roles of the rare and abundant subcommunity in response to environmental change were gradually being understood nyirabuhoro et al 2021 xue et al 2018 some researchers reported the spatiotemporal dynamics environmental responses biogeographic patterns and ecological role of abundant and rare bacterioplankton in reservoirs nyirabuhoro et al 2021 shi et al 2022 wang et al 2020 but most previous studies have only focused on bacterioplankton in the water column however the abiotic and biotic properties of the water column and surface sediments are inherently intertwined and inseparable dalu et al 2017 physicochemical and biological components in the water column can settle into the surface sediments and can be resuspended from the surface sediments back into the water column lenaker et al 2019 pauer and auer 2000 thus the comprehensive bacterial community characteristics in the whole reservoir ecosystem cannot be fully revealed only by planktonic or sedimentary bacteria nevertheless the integrated spatiotemporal variation and driving mechanisms of both planktonic and sedimentary community especially rare subcommunity in typical reservoirs are still lacking the danjiangkou reservoir located on the longest tributary han river of the yangtze river serves as an important water source of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china which is the world s largest water transfer project dang et al 2020 protecting the water quality and the ecological function of the danjiangkou reservoir is of fundamental significance to guaranteeing public drinking water safety xin et al 2015 bacteria in source water systems is closely related to water self purification and ultimately to water safety zhang et al 2021 but little is known about the integrated planktonic and sedimentary bacterial community dynamics in the danjiangkou reservoir let alone the ecological processes of the abundant and rare subcommunities therefore it is essential to explore the biogeographic pattern and environmental response of the integrated bacterial community that contributes to the mediation of nutrient cycling and indicates water quality in the danjiangkou reservoir chen et al 2018 here the bacterial community structure both in water and sediments were investigated to comprehensively understand the spatial environmental and seasonal changes of bacterial structure and their underlying governing mechanism specifically we attempted to address the following issues 1 how planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in danjiangkou reservoir respond to spatiotemporal changes 2 whether abundant or rare subcommunities were the main contributors to the community dynamics 3 which environmental factors act as the main driving force for structuring bacterial communities and 4 which ecological processes mediate the bacterial assembly in the reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the danjiangkou reservoir 32 22 33 10 n and 110 40 111 45 e is the largest artificial reservoir in china with a storage capacity of about 19 billion m3 huang and huang 2017 and an average annual inflow of approximately 38 80 billion m3 zhao et al 2020 the reservoir is the water source of the middle route of south to north water diversion project snwdp in china it is located at the junction of the hanjiang river and danjiang river so the danjiangkou reservoir includes the han reservoir and dan reservoir this reservoir region situates in the transitional zone between the northern subtropics and the warm temperate zone and supported a population of approximately 3 14 million xin et al 2015 to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of bacterial communities in water and sediment of the danjiangkou reservoir we carried out sampling campaigns in spring april 2016 autumn october 2016 summer july 2017 and winter december 2017 notably no rain event occurred before and during the sample collection and no sediment cleaning activities in the reservoir in the two years of our sampling campaigns a total of 11 representative sampling sites in the danjiangkou reservoir were set up fig s1 specifically four monitoring sites 01dsq 02bdt 03lsh 04dkkx were located in the dan reservoir five sites 05lk 06xc 07hk 08lh 09lhkx situated in han reservoir and sites 10bs and 11bx respectively distributed on the up stream and down stream of danjiangkou dam a total of 20 l mixed water samples were collected at each sampling site and the sampling depths contain three layers surface 0 5 10 m middle 20 30 m and bottom 40 50 m the actual sampling depth was according to the average water depth of the sampling site table s1 when the water depth was shallow 10 m 20 l mixed water samples were collected from only one or two depths then part of the mixed water samples was filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes millipore usa to capture microbial cells within 24 h for dna extraction at the same time sediment samples approximately 1000 g were collected from depositional areas near the water sampling sites using a grab sampler like ponar sampler similar to the previous study lenaker et al 2019 the sediment sampling depth mainly depended on the water depth table s1 and the maximum sediment collection depths were approximately 20 m below the water surface due to the limited length of the sampler each sediment sample was homogenized and transferred into 50 ml sterilized polypropylene tubes then placed in dry ice and immediately transported to the laboratory each site sample was split into two parts one stored at 80 c until dna extraction the other part of collected water and sediment samples were stored at 4 c and used for subsequent physicochemical analysis as described in our previous studies dang et al 2020 2018 the physicochemical parameters including ph water temperature wt total nitrogen tn dissolved oxygen do for water nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc were determined for each sample the physiochemical parameters of samples and detailed information on the sampling sites were described in our previous studies dang et al 2021 2 2 dna extraction and illumina sequencing for each water and sediment sample 2 filtered membranes or 0 5 g of well mixed sediments were respectively extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s standard then the quality and concentrations of dna extracts were evaluated using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa the high quality dna was used for pcr amplification based on the universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 with an approximate length of 468 bp which were designed against the bacterial v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene pcr products were purified using an axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen usa quantified using a quantifluor st blue fluorescence quantitative system promega company and pooled together for library preparation using a truseqtm dna sample prep kit illumina san diego ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions during the above dna extraction and pcr amplification process three negative controls were performed to monitor any contamination finally purified amplicons of bacterial 16s rrna gene were sequenced using an illumina miseq platform following the manufacturer s instructions majorbio company shanghai china the sequence data were deposited into the national omics data encyclopedia node with the accession number oep003001 2 3 bioinformatics analysis sequencing raw 16s rrna reads were analyzed by first removing primers and merging the demultiplexed reads with flash software magoč and salzberg 2011 then the sequences were quality filtered and optimized with fastp software and any low quality sequences quality value 30 or length 400 bp were removed chen et al 2018 high quality sequences were processed to amplicon sequence variants asvs using the deblur plugin with the default parameters in the qiime2 platform register and services 2019 the taxonomical information for each asv was assigned by the feature classifier method according to the silva database v 138 quast et al 2013 to compare the bacterial structure of different samples the dataset was randomly rarefied to the lowest number of reads obtained from an individual sample using usearch edgar 2010 according to previous studies asvs with relative abundances above 0 1 were defined as abundant and asvs with relative abundances below 0 01 were defined as rare and asvs with relative abundances between 0 01 and 0 1 were defined as intermediate jiao and lu 2020 mo et al 2018 2 4 statistical analysis alpha diversity indices including chao1 richness and shannon diversity were calculated using the vegan r package beta diversity of bacterial community for each sample was estimated based on the bray curtis dissimilarity using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis analysis of similarity statistics anosim and one way analysis of variance one way anova was performed to test the significance of bacterial or environmental differences among groups using the vegan package in r oksanen et al 2016 indicator species analysis was conducted to characterize the asvs with significantly different abundances i e the indicator taxa in each season p value 0 05 using the indicspecies package in r biologiques 2009 the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities were performed using positive r 0 95 and significant benjamini hochberg adjusted p 0 01 spearman correlations and were visualized with gephi v 0 9 0 bastian et al 2009 the node in the co occurrence networks indicated one bacterial asv and the node size was proportional to the number of connections i e degree in order to evaluate the distance decay patterns of bacterial communities along geographical based on spatial variables environmental and seasonal gradients the mantel test was implemented to examine the spearman s correlations between the three gradients and bacterial community similarity using bray curtis distance matrices using vegan package in r spatial variables were generated based on the longitude and latitude coordinates using the approach of principal coordinates of neighbor matrices pcnm analysis borcard and legendre 2002 the environmental distance of sampling sites was generated by calculating the euclidian distance of physicochemical parameters using vegan package in r effective spatial and environmental variables were selected by running a forward selection test with the packfor package centre ville 2008 then canonical correspondence analysis cca was carried out to expose the influence of the selected environmental parameters on bacterial communities levins niche breadth index was calculated to identify the habitat specialization using the spaa package levins 1968 and the average niche breadth for all taxa occurring in one community was regarded as the habitat niche breadth jiao and yang 2020 wu et al 2017 to further identify the influence of environmental variables on bacterial niche breadth the random forests model was performed and the significance of the models and cross validated r2 values were assessed with the a3 package and then the significance of each factor on niche breadth was assessed using the rfpermute package in r wang et al 2022 to explore the contributions of five ecological processes including homogenizing selection variable selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift on the bacterial community structure in the dangjiangkou reservoirs the quantitative ecological framework based on null models was applied as previously reported stegen et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhou and ning 2017 the calculation of βnti β nearest taxon index together with the rcbray bray curtis based raup crick was the primary step to quantify the contribution of ecological processes to the assembly of microbial communities βnti between communities was determined using the picante kembel et al 2010 and ape paradis et al 2004 packages and rcbray was calculated using the vegan package when the βnti 2 the assembly of the microbial community was governed by deterministic processes i e homogenizing selection βnti 2 or variable selection βnti 2 when the βnti 2 the community was mainly controlled by stochastic processes such as homogenizing dispersal rcbray 0 95 dispersal limitation rcbray 0 95 or undominated processes rcbray 0 95 3 results 3 1 alpha and beta diversity of bacterial communities overall the illumina sequencing yielded a total of 14 612 distinct asvs from all 88 samples 44 water samples and 44 co sampled sediment samples in the danjiangkou reservoir the taxonomic assignment of these representative asvs revealed bacterial taxa from 50 phyla 157 classes 279 orders 610 families and 1261 genera to explore the bacterial structure across different samples nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was conducted based on the bray curtis distance matrix fig 1 bacterial communities showed a distinct separation between water and sediment samples fig s2 anosim r 0 95 p 0 001 further the whole bacterial communities all group showed significant differences within the four separate seasonal groups in water samples fig 1 a anosim r 0 65 p 0 001 while weaker seasonal clusters were found in sedimentary communities fig 1 b anosim r 0 13 p 0 004 notably rare subcommunities of planktonic bacteria exhibited a more striking separation anosim r 0 84 p 0 001 than abundant subcommunities anosim r 0 58 p 0 001 among four seasons fig 1 a similarly the sedimentary rare subcommunities anosim r 0 17 p 0 003 appeared to be more varied than abundant subcommunities anosim r 0 07 p 0 035 among four seasons based on anosim although no clear separations were observed among four seasons in fig 1 b as for the asvs shared among four seasons fig s3 6 47 and 8 78 of the total asvs identified from planktonic and sedimentary communities were shared among four seasonal groups respectively moreover a considerable large portion of the abundant asvs respectively from planktonic 51 46 and sedimentary communities 15 56 were shared among four seasonal groups while a minor part of the rare asvs 1 01 in water and 5 84 in sediment were simultaneously detected in different seasons the alpha diversity including shannon diversity chao1 richness and phylogenetic diversity of planktonic bacterial communities also exhibited significant distinction among four seasons anova p 0 003 and the highest bacterial diversity chao 621 72 6 49 shannon 108 86 0 60 were found in autumn figs 1 c and s4a these seasonal differences in planktonic biodiversity could be mainly caused by the rare anova p 0 001 rather than abundant subcommunities anova p 0 05 in contrast no obvious seasonal patterns of shannon diversity were found in sedimentary communities except for the rare bacteria which implied the relative stability of sedimentary bacterial communities during seasonal dynamics figs 1 d and s4b in addition the biodiversity obtained from sedimentary communities chao1 richness 972 18 293 26 shannon diversity 8 84 0 61 was higher than that from planktonic communities chao1 richness 333 17 106 14 shannon diversity 5 97 0 60 figs 1 and s4 possibly reflecting the potential role of sedimentary habitats as the species bank to maintain the ecological function of the reservoirs 3 2 taxonomic composition of bacterial community the taxonomic composition of bacterial community was further explored in water and sediment of the danjiangkou reservoir at phylum level nearly 90 of the asvs in planktonic bacterial communities were assigned to actinobacteria average relative abundance 39 92 proteobacteria 20 65 bacteroidetes 16 11 and cyanobacteria 13 59 fig s5 while sedimentary phyla such as proteobacteria 23 85 actinobacteria 16 77 chloroflexi 14 94 and acidobacteriota 13 77 were identified to be abundant in all samples fig s6 moreover nineteen planktonic phyla accounting for about 25 60 of the total abundance in bacterial communities exhibited the apparent seasonal patterns for example bacteroidota planctomycetota chloroflexi and acidobacteriota were respectively dominant in spring summer autumn and winter fig s7 while nine sedimentary phyla holding for 4 63 of the total community showed high proportions in different seasons e g gemmatimonadota in summer and fibrobacterota in autumn fig s8 at genus level fig s9 hgci clade cl500 29 and flavobacterium had a predominance in the planktonic bacterial community of the reservoir holding for 21 89 of the total abundance fig s9a while uncultured roseiflexaceae 2 92 rokubacteriales 2 30 uncultured gemmatimonadaceae 2 28 uncultured gaiellales 2 05 and rb41 2 03 were the most abundant components of sedimentary communities fig s9b as for the seasonal dynamic planktonic genera such as flavobacterium cyanobium pcc 6307 cl500 29 marine group and candidatus methylopumilus showed a significant preference to spring summer autumn and winter respectively in addition sedimentary taxa exhibited little variation among the four seasons the asvs responsible for the response of bacterial communities to seasonal changes were further identified based on indicator species analysis as shown by manhattan plots fig 2 a about 34 18 of the total planktonic asvs presented significant differences among the four seasons namely indicator taxa for seasonal differences these indicator taxa specifically abundant asvs in each season were mainly affiliated to proteobacteria 11 73 of all indicator taxa and actinobacteria 11 50 cyanobacteria 10 22 and bacteroidota 9 83 and the number consisted of 2 43 and 21 32 of the abundant and rare subcommunities respectively for sedimentary bacteria fig 2 b a small percentage of indicator asvs 5 10 in all sedimentary asvs dominated by a large percentage of rare 79 18 rather than abundant taxa 2 28 were identified as bacteria for the seasonal pattern and mainly assigned to proteobacteria 3 34 of all indicator taxa actinobacteriota 2 11 and acidobacteriota 1 03 above all the relatively stronger difference related to seasonal variations existed in planktonic bacteria compared with sedimentary communities and these seasonal dynamics were mainly caused by rare subcommunities in the dangjiangkou reservoir 3 3 bacterial co occurrence pattern the network analysis was performed to explore the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities using all asvs obtained from water and sediment fig 3 as a result the planktonic network consisted of 1198 nodes and 16 892 significant edges based on strong spearman r 0 95 and significant p value 0 001 correlations and these connections were positive associations fig 3 a comparatively the sedimentary network was more complex and composed of 8881 nodes and 272 138 significant positive connections fig 3 b from the perspective of taxonomy these cooccurred taxa mainly belonged to proteobacteria 45 16 bacteroidetes 18 78 and cyanobacteria 10 43 in water while that in sedimentary network were mainly assigned to proteobacteria 24 20 chloroflexi 17 13 acidobacteria 14 80 and actinobacteria 12 12 notably rare subcommunity played an irreplaceable role in the bacterial networks in both water and sediment of the reservoir specifically nearly 90 and 95 of the coexisted taxa were identified as rare bacteria in the planktonic and sedimentary network respectively beside planktonic rare bacteria had a total of 30 472 connection degrees averaged degree 28 61 which were extremely higher than abundant groups total degree 143 averaged degree 20 43 fig 3 c while sedimentary rare bacteria had a total of 507 418 connection degrees averaged degree 60 11 and abundant taxa had a total degree of 5023 averaged degree 86 60 fig 3 d in addition the rare part also had a higher total closeness centrality 7 62e 04 than that for abundant taxa 4 99e 06 in the planktonic bacterial community overall rare taxa could be an essential part in maintaining the stability of bacterial community in both water and sediment of the reservoir especially for planktonic community 3 4 influencing factors and driving forces of bacterial community variations physicochemical parameters in the water of the reservoir were found to disparate among four seasons fig s10 nine physicochemical parameters including water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ph total organic carbon toc biological oxygen demand bod and total phosphorus tp showed significant seasonal variations fig s10 noticeably do 7 32 0 71 mg l wt 27 53 3 20 c toc 3 45 0 38 mg l were found to be the highest in spring summer and winter respectively in terms of sediment environments tp showed a prominent high concentration in winter whereas the other physicochemical variables seemed to be constant during seasonal changes in reservoir sediments fig s11 distance decay relationship is a typical geographical distribution pattern of bacterial communities wang et al 2019 the potential relationships between bacterial community similarity and geographic or environmental distance were further estimated for both planktonic and sedimentary communities in this reservoir meanwhile the time lag patterns of the bacterial similarity were also considered as shown in fig 4 community similarity of planktonic bacteria showed significant decrease patterns with increasing environmental distance mantel r 0 502 p 0 001 or seasonal gradient mantel r 0 499 p 0 001 rather than geographical distance mantel r 0 056 p 0 05 importantly these distance decay relationships could be better reflected by rare subcommunities environmental distance mantel r 0 544 p 0 001 seasonal distance mantel r 0 601 p 0 001 rather than abundant taxa environmental distance mantel r 0 484 p 0 001 seasonal distance mantel r 0 053 p 0 001 sedimentary bacterial similarities seemed to significantly correlate with environmental distance mantel r 0 131 p 0 009 instead of geographic distance or seasonal heterogeneity fig s12 despite this correlation being weaker than planktonic communities mantel r 0 502 p 0 001 fig 4 b the variations of sedimentary bacterial community with environmental distance could also be better explained by rare subcommunities mantel r 0 129 p 0 009 than abundant taxa mantel r 0 117 p 0 05 fig s12b briefly bacterial variations with environmental or seasonal changes were mainly attributed to rare subcommunity demonstrating the sensitivity of rare taxa to external environmental interference in reservoir ecosystems canonical correspondence analysis cca was further performed to examine the effects of different environmental factors on bacterial communities in the dangjiangkou reservoir as a result wt r 2 0 7282 p 0 01 nh4 n r 2 0 58193 p 0 01 no3 n r 2 0 5433 p 0 01 and tn r 2 0 4926 p 0 01 were identified as key drivers affecting the distribution of planktonic community fig 5 a while no2 n r 2 0 5445 p 0 01 ph r 2 0 4663 p 0 01 and toc r 2 0 3493 p 0 01 were the primary factors shaping the structure of sedimentary communities fig 5 b more importantly the niche breadth of rare subcommunities could be largely explained by environmental parameters in both water r 2 0 4731 and sediment r 2 0 2399 of the reservoir fig 5 c d however the niche breadth of abundant subcommunities seemed to be hardly limited by environmental heterogeneity fig s13 beside a quantitative ecological framework based on the null model was used to disentangle the potential contributions of ecological processes to the structure of bacterial communities in water and sediment of the danjiangkou reservoir stegen et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 we found that a dominant influence of selection processes including homogeneous selection and variable selection explained for 74 00 relative to stochastic processes i e undominated process homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation in structuring bacterial assembly in sedimentary bacteria while stochastic processes 51 33 seemed to be more important for planktonic bacterial assembly fig 5 e f specifically for planktonic bacteria the whole community were mainly governed by homogeneous selection process 48 05 undominated process 26 95 and dispersal limitation process 24 11 while abundant and rare subcommunity were respectively largely driven by undominated process 33 07 and homogeneous selection 30 67 in addition to the dominance of dispersal limitation process 53 28 for abundant and 50 09 for rare fig 5e as for sedimentary bacteria the variable selection was characterized as the dominant driver in controlling the whole community 55 39 and rare subcommunity 63 21 while the undominated process 77 86 predominantly shaped the assembly of abundant sedimentary bacteria by comparison rare subcommunities in water and sediment were respectively controlled by stochastic processes and selection processes whereas abundant taxa were mainly determined by stochastic processes 4 discussion the spatial temporal variations of physical chemical and biological components in reservoirs have become an increasingly prominent issue zhou et al 2019 the hydrological regime of reservoirs is influenced by both natural factors such as rainfall solar radiation and flow rate and artificial regulation on water level and retention time which contributes to the formation of unique bacterial composition different from other aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2013 understanding the structure and distribution of both planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities will provide important insights to help resolve public health concerns associated with biological pollution and nutrition transformation in these engineered freshwater systems unfortunately the composition distributions and ecological drivers of the planktonic and sedimentary bacteria across space and time in source water reservoirs are still unclear especially for the danjiangkou reservoir the water source of the world s largest water diversion project in the present study we explored the spatial temporal dynamics of bacterial communities in both flowing water and sediments identified the primary influencing factors and revealed the underlying ecological processes driving community assembly in the dangjiangkou reservoir which will provide significant guidance for ecological management in source water systems the biodiversity and structure of planktonic rather than sedimentary bacterial communities were found to be dramatically influenced by seasonal variations in the danjiangkou reservoirs the inconspicuous seasonal variations of sedimentary bacterial community could be ascribed to the following aspects first the sedimentary bacteria could reach a state of relative equilibrium through long term sediment erosion and deposition processes resulting in the weak response of microbes to seasonal changes in sediments liu et al 2018 second a relatively higher diversity of microbes was harbored in sediment environments compared to reservoir water supporting that sediments could be the crucial species bank in various aquatic systems liu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 this could be ascribed to the abundant organic matter and nutrients deposited in sediments that contributed to the propagation of sedimentary microbes tanentzap et al 2019 the enriched sedimentary species exhibited higher positive correlations and more network complexity fig 3 thus these active biotic interactions facilitated community stability against seasonal disturbance yuan et al 2021 intriguingly apparent seasonal dynamics were observed for planktonic communities and for the rare taxa in particular among the planktonic bacteria flavobacterium cyanobium pcc 6307 cl500 29 and candidatus methylopumilus exhibited the highest abundance in spring summer autumn and winter respectively this could be attributed to the sensitivity of different species to physiochemical conditions in four seasons for example flavobacterium includes some potential psychrophilic bacteria that can thrive in the spring with a low water temperature about 15 5 c wang et al 2022 cyanobium pcc 6307 as the dominant cyanobacterial species in summer is sensitive to increased temperature and enough light exposure this genus is also known to be capable of forming algae bloom and producing cyanotoxins which should be of particular concern regarding the management of the water quality in this source water reservoir li et al 2019 cl500 29 marine group has been reported to have an excellent ability to degrade various forms of carbon based compounds such as the dead phytoplankton which increased during the autumn thus mediating the carbon cycling and nutrient transformation in aquatic ecosystems lindh et al 2015 candidatus methylopumilus as a potential methanotrophic bacteria could maintain active carbon iron and nitrogen cycling in the winter with low water temperature reduced light availability and limited input nutrients cruaud et al 2020 in summary the seasonal dynamic of planktonic bacteria is of great significance for promoting energy flow and maintaining ecological functions of reservoir systems importantly our results indicated that rare and dominant taxa exhibited inconsistent biogeographic patterns in the reservoir particularly rare populations rather than those widely occurred abundant taxa were the main contributors to the spatiotemporal shifts of planktonic communities in this source water reservoir beside the richness of rare subcommunities was nearly 20 and 113 times higher than the abundant subcommunities in water and sediments respectively fig s4 implying the significant contribution of rare microbes to the whole bacterial diversity the diverse rare taxa will become prominent with changing environmental conditions and thereby alleviate the impact of external environmental perturbation due to their high biodiversity high ecological redundancy and high adaptive capacity caron and countway 2009 on the one hand rare taxa could also transform into the key seeds for promoting bloom events in aquatic systems xue et al 2018 in this reservoir cyanobacteria such as microcystis pcc 7914 oscillatoria pcc 6304 and cyanobium pcc 6307 was detected as the rare present taxa and these cyanobacterial taxa could wildly grow and pollute water once the temperature and nutrients reached the suitable condition on the other hand although rare biosphere exhibited extremely low abundances these rare taxa could possess an immense reserve of genes involving the nitrogen carbon sulfur and phosphorus transformations and play fundamental roles in regulating the ecological function and biogeochemical processes of various aquatic systems pedrs ali 2012 for example despite the extremely low abundances in various ecosystems the newly discovered comammox nitrospira was reported to have an excellent ability in nitrogen transformation in drinking water systems lakes and rivers shi et al 2020 wang et al 2017 implying that these rare taxa were worthy to be further explored in this source water reservoir therefore our findings indicated that a large number of supplementary works are still needed to elucidate the regulatory role of rare taxa in the metabolism and function of various ecosystems notably as a refreshed reservoir the continuous influx of water also brought bacteria into the reservoir possibly resulting in observed bacterial variation between samples with different water ages from different seasons however the greater differences in bacterial communities longer bray curtis distance between spring and autumn samples were observed as well as between summer and winter regardless of all abundant or rare community fig 1 a although the spring and autumn samples were collected in 2016 and the summer and winter samples were collected in 2017 the pattern of differences in bacterial communities is more consistent with the cycle of the seasonal shift of spring summer autumn and winter fig 1 a suggesting the seasonal changes play a greater role in assembling the bacterial community in the reservoir instead of water age more importantly environmental rather than spatial heterogeneity played a dominant role in shaping bacterial communities of the water reservoir in four seasons fig 4 among the various environmental parameters water temperature and nutrients including ammonia nitrate and tn were found to be the highest explanation for variations of planktonic bacterial community among four seasons usually seasonal changes of various microbes were reported to be mainly caused by the fluctuation of temperature organic matters as well as dissolved oxygen in various freshwater ecosystems li et al 2017 2013 shang et al 2022 beside nitrogen and its major existing form i e nh4 n and no3 n are the limiting nutrients in freshwater environments and can thereby be the crucial factors that determine the diversity structure and even the key functions of bacterial communities strikingly rare biosphere especially those captured from water environments exhibited a stronger distribution limitation by environmental heterogeneity that were represented by so4 2 do toc and nh4 n despite that the habitat niche of abundant subcommunities could be hardly restricted by any measured environmental factors these differences might result from the preference of different species to the environmental conditions in the reservoir for example the observed rare species such as complete ammonia oxidizer and sulfate reducing bacteria might be influenced by the changes in the concentration of toc nitrogen and do among different sampling sites fig s10 to sum up environmental changes promoted the succession of microbial structures in the reservoir water especially acting on the rare biosphere disentangling the ecological processes modulating community assembly across diverse ecosystems is a major ecological concern martiny et al 2006 however the knowledge of ecological driving processes structuring the rare subcommunities remained largely unsatisfactory particularly considering the significant role of rare taxa within the community to address the above question we extended the investigation on ecological rules governing both rare and abundant subcommunities in the source reservoir our results showed that the dispersal limitation process 50 09 and homogeneous selection process 30 67 played dominant roles in controlling the assembly of planktonic rare bacteria while variable selection 63 21 mainly structured the sedimentary rare taxa meanwhile planktonic abundant subcommunities were dominantly shaped by dispersal limitation while that in sediment were mainly determined by the undominated process such as drift and diversification there are several possible explanations firstly the abundant biosphere represents these taxa with large abundance and a high adaption capacity to local environments and their community dynamics could be primarily controlled by stochastic processes in both water and sediment environments secondly for rare taxa the water conditions were less environmentally heterogeneous among different sites so that environmental filters were not strong enough to act as selective forces exerting species sorting thereby the stochastic processes seem to be more dominant huber et al 2020 beside the dominant role of dispersal limitation for planktonic rare taxa also implied that these taxa were largely limited by local position challenging a previous hypothesis that everything is everywhere but the environment selects thirdly a relatively stable water condition among different locations of the reservoir may provide a steady selective environment despite seasonal changes in several parameters such as wt do tn and ph thus continuously imposing homogeneous selection for planktonic rare taxa this finding could be also confirmed by the insignificant distance decay pattern of rare community similarity along the geographic distance however in sediment the key contribution of variable selection to rare taxa reflected that heterogeneous sedimentary environments promoted the high variation in community structure among different sampling sites zhou and ning 2017 in brief rare and abundant taxa played complementary roles regarding the species diversity and ecological functions within the bacterial communities thus maintaining the stability of reservoir ecosystems 5 conclusions the current study provides an overview of the bacterial community dynamics and their assembly mechanisms in terms of spatial and seasonal variations in a source water system broader biodiversity and more complex co occurrence patterns of sedimentary than the planktonic community were discovered which could contribute to the relatively stable structure of the sedimentary community against the external environmental disturbance or spatiotemporal changes within the whole bacterial communities abundant and rare subcommunities demonstrated contrasting patterns regarding their seasonal patterns particularly intriguing are the rare communities that could be largely influenced by the fluctuation of physicochemical conditions such as nitrogen and sulfur in the water while abundant taxa could be less affected by environmental changes further planktonic rare subcommunities could be mainly mediated by dispersal limitation and homogeneous selection whereas sedimentary rare taxa were dominantly controlled by variable selection these findings lay the groundwork for revealing the essential role of rare taxa in maintaining the ecological functions and services in aquatic ecosystems further

16085,the bacteria in the water column and surface sediments are inherently intertwined and inseparable in aquatic ecosystems yet little is known about the integrated spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of both planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in reservoirs by investigating the planktonic and sedimentary bacteria during four seasons from 88 samples of 11 representative sites across the danjiangkou reservoir we depicted an integrated biogeographic pattern of bacterial communities in the water source of the world s largest water diversion project our study revealed both planktonic mantel r 0 502 p 0 001 and sedimentary mantel r 0 131 p 0 009 bacterial communities were significantly correlated with environmental heterogeneity but a weak disparity along spatial heterogeneity and the significant seasonal dynamics of planktonic mantel r 0 499 p 0 001 rather than sedimentary bacteria particularly rare biosphere played a main role in determining the community succession in the reservoir it not only exhibited a more striking environmental separation than abundant taxa but also was an essential part in mediating spatiotemporal shifts of planktonic bacteria and maintaining the stability of bacterial community these rare bacteria were respectively mediated by stochastic 62 68 and selective 79 60 processes in water and sediments despite abundant taxa being largely determined by stochastic processes 86 88 93 96 overall our study not only fills a gap in understanding the bacterial community dynamics and underlying drivers in source water reservoirs but also highlights the particular importance of rare bacteria in mediating biogeochemical cycles in world s large reservoir ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract

spatiotemporal variations and potential driving forces is widely regarded as the fundamental ecological goal which is of great significance for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes and regulating the ecosystem function langenheder and székely 2011 niño garcía et al 2016 bacterial communities have been intensively studied in oceans louca et al 2016 rivers liu et al 2018 drinking water jia et al 2020 and lakes peter and sommaruga 2016 usually the bacterial community is highly diverse and extremely heterogeneous in composition with relatively few abundant taxa and numerous rare taxa campbell et al 2011 interestingly recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of rare subcommunity who can serve as keystone species with disproportionately large effects on ecosystem services lynch and neufeld 2015 xue et al 2020 reservoirs are typical surface water ecosystems created by dam construction for various purposes such as hydroelectricity production agriculture irrigation flood control and recreation activities feng et al 2009 reitter et al 2021 they usually play an essential role in supplying essential water resources for drinking water production and recreational activities especially in regions with water scarcity great attention has been paid to the distribution and dynamic of abiotic factors such as temperature nutrients and micropollutants during the seasonal change or along the spatial gradient of reservoir ecosystems dang et al 2018 li et al 2019 wiejaczka et al 2018 recently biotic components such as phytoplankton xu et al 2018a 2018b 2017 eukaryotes yan et al 2020 and planktonic or sedimentary bacteria liu et al 2015 reitter et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 llirós et al 2014 were found to quickly respond to the external environmental interference for example bacterial communities in three freshwater reservoirs exhibited distinct compositions and were strongly influenced by ph alkalinity and organic carbon content llirós et al 2014 some heterotrophic bacterial taxa were found to exhibit higher abundance with increased synechococcus cyanobacterial species at internal and exit sites of a large estuarine reservoir during summer compared with spring xu et al 2018 as the emphasis on rare subcommunity increases the distinct ecological roles of the rare and abundant subcommunity in response to environmental change were gradually being understood nyirabuhoro et al 2021 xue et al 2018 some researchers reported the spatiotemporal dynamics environmental responses biogeographic patterns and ecological role of abundant and rare bacterioplankton in reservoirs nyirabuhoro et al 2021 shi et al 2022 wang et al 2020 but most previous studies have only focused on bacterioplankton in the water column however the abiotic and biotic properties of the water column and surface sediments are inherently intertwined and inseparable dalu et al 2017 physicochemical and biological components in the water column can settle into the surface sediments and can be resuspended from the surface sediments back into the water column lenaker et al 2019 pauer and auer 2000 thus the comprehensive bacterial community characteristics in the whole reservoir ecosystem cannot be fully revealed only by planktonic or sedimentary bacteria nevertheless the integrated spatiotemporal variation and driving mechanisms of both planktonic and sedimentary community especially rare subcommunity in typical reservoirs are still lacking the danjiangkou reservoir located on the longest tributary han river of the yangtze river serves as an important water source of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china which is the world s largest water transfer project dang et al 2020 protecting the water quality and the ecological function of the danjiangkou reservoir is of fundamental significance to guaranteeing public drinking water safety xin et al 2015 bacteria in source water systems is closely related to water self purification and ultimately to water safety zhang et al 2021 but little is known about the integrated planktonic and sedimentary bacterial community dynamics in the danjiangkou reservoir let alone the ecological processes of the abundant and rare subcommunities therefore it is essential to explore the biogeographic pattern and environmental response of the integrated bacterial community that contributes to the mediation of nutrient cycling and indicates water quality in the danjiangkou reservoir chen et al 2018 here the bacterial community structure both in water and sediments were investigated to comprehensively understand the spatial environmental and seasonal changes of bacterial structure and their underlying governing mechanism specifically we attempted to address the following issues 1 how planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in danjiangkou reservoir respond to spatiotemporal changes 2 whether abundant or rare subcommunities were the main contributors to the community dynamics 3 which environmental factors act as the main driving force for structuring bacterial communities and 4 which ecological processes mediate the bacterial assembly in the reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the danjiangkou reservoir 32 22 33 10 n and 110 40 111 45 e is the largest artificial reservoir in china with a storage capacity of about 19 billion m3 huang and huang 2017 and an average annual inflow of approximately 38 80 billion m3 zhao et al 2020 the reservoir is the water source of the middle route of south to north water diversion project snwdp in china it is located at the junction of the hanjiang river and danjiang river so the danjiangkou reservoir includes the han reservoir and dan reservoir this reservoir region situates in the transitional zone between the northern subtropics and the warm temperate zone and supported a population of approximately 3 14 million xin et al 2015 to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of bacterial communities in water and sediment of the danjiangkou reservoir we carried out sampling campaigns in spring april 2016 autumn october 2016 summer july 2017 and winter december 2017 notably no rain event occurred before and during the sample collection and no sediment cleaning activities in the reservoir in the two years of our sampling campaigns a total of 11 representative sampling sites in the danjiangkou reservoir were set up fig s1 specifically four monitoring sites 01dsq 02bdt 03lsh 04dkkx were located in the dan reservoir five sites 05lk 06xc 07hk 08lh 09lhkx situated in han reservoir and sites 10bs and 11bx respectively distributed on the up stream and down stream of danjiangkou dam a total of 20 l mixed water samples were collected at each sampling site and the sampling depths contain three layers surface 0 5 10 m middle 20 30 m and bottom 40 50 m the actual sampling depth was according to the average water depth of the sampling site table s1 when the water depth was shallow 10 m 20 l mixed water samples were collected from only one or two depths then part of the mixed water samples was filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes millipore usa to capture microbial cells within 24 h for dna extraction at the same time sediment samples approximately 1000 g were collected from depositional areas near the water sampling sites using a grab sampler like ponar sampler similar to the previous study lenaker et al 2019 the sediment sampling depth mainly depended on the water depth table s1 and the maximum sediment collection depths were approximately 20 m below the water surface due to the limited length of the sampler each sediment sample was homogenized and transferred into 50 ml sterilized polypropylene tubes then placed in dry ice and immediately transported to the laboratory each site sample was split into two parts one stored at 80 c until dna extraction the other part of collected water and sediment samples were stored at 4 c and used for subsequent physicochemical analysis as described in our previous studies dang et al 2020 2018 the physicochemical parameters including ph water temperature wt total nitrogen tn dissolved oxygen do for water nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc were determined for each sample the physiochemical parameters of samples and detailed information on the sampling sites were described in our previous studies dang et al 2021 2 2 dna extraction and illumina sequencing for each water and sediment sample 2 filtered membranes or 0 5 g of well mixed sediments were respectively extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s standard then the quality and concentrations of dna extracts were evaluated using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa the high quality dna was used for pcr amplification based on the universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 with an approximate length of 468 bp which were designed against the bacterial v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene pcr products were purified using an axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen usa quantified using a quantifluor st blue fluorescence quantitative system promega company and pooled together for library preparation using a truseqtm dna sample prep kit illumina san diego ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions during the above dna extraction and pcr amplification process three negative controls were performed to monitor any contamination finally purified amplicons of bacterial 16s rrna gene were sequenced using an illumina miseq platform following the manufacturer s instructions majorbio company shanghai china the sequence data were deposited into the national omics data encyclopedia node with the accession number oep003001 2 3 bioinformatics analysis sequencing raw 16s rrna reads were analyzed by first removing primers and merging the demultiplexed reads with flash software magoč and salzberg 2011 then the sequences were quality filtered and optimized with fastp software and any low quality sequences quality value 30 or length 400 bp were removed chen et al 2018 high quality sequences were processed to amplicon sequence variants asvs using the deblur plugin with the default parameters in the qiime2 platform register and services 2019 the taxonomical information for each asv was assigned by the feature classifier method according to the silva database v 138 quast et al 2013 to compare the bacterial structure of different samples the dataset was randomly rarefied to the lowest number of reads obtained from an individual sample using usearch edgar 2010 according to previous studies asvs with relative abundances above 0 1 were defined as abundant and asvs with relative abundances below 0 01 were defined as rare and asvs with relative abundances between 0 01 and 0 1 were defined as intermediate jiao and lu 2020 mo et al 2018 2 4 statistical analysis alpha diversity indices including chao1 richness and shannon diversity were calculated using the vegan r package beta diversity of bacterial community for each sample was estimated based on the bray curtis dissimilarity using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis analysis of similarity statistics anosim and one way analysis of variance one way anova was performed to test the significance of bacterial or environmental differences among groups using the vegan package in r oksanen et al 2016 indicator species analysis was conducted to characterize the asvs with significantly different abundances i e the indicator taxa in each season p value 0 05 using the indicspecies package in r biologiques 2009 the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities were performed using positive r 0 95 and significant benjamini hochberg adjusted p 0 01 spearman correlations and were visualized with gephi v 0 9 0 bastian et al 2009 the node in the co occurrence networks indicated one bacterial asv and the node size was proportional to the number of connections i e degree in order to evaluate the distance decay patterns of bacterial communities along geographical based on spatial variables environmental and seasonal gradients the mantel test was implemented to examine the spearman s correlations between the three gradients and bacterial community similarity using bray curtis distance matrices using vegan package in r spatial variables were generated based on the longitude and latitude coordinates using the approach of principal coordinates of neighbor matrices pcnm analysis borcard and legendre 2002 the environmental distance of sampling sites was generated by calculating the euclidian distance of physicochemical parameters using vegan package in r effective spatial and environmental variables were selected by running a forward selection test with the packfor package centre ville 2008 then canonical correspondence analysis cca was carried out to expose the influence of the selected environmental parameters on bacterial communities levins niche breadth index was calculated to identify the habitat specialization using the spaa package levins 1968 and the average niche breadth for all taxa occurring in one community was regarded as the habitat niche breadth jiao and yang 2020 wu et al 2017 to further identify the influence of environmental variables on bacterial niche breadth the random forests model was performed and the significance of the models and cross validated r2 values were assessed with the a3 package and then the significance of each factor on niche breadth was assessed using the rfpermute package in r wang et al 2022 to explore the contributions of five ecological processes including homogenizing selection variable selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift on the bacterial community structure in the dangjiangkou reservoirs the quantitative ecological framework based on null models was applied as previously reported stegen et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhou and ning 2017 the calculation of βnti β nearest taxon index together with the rcbray bray curtis based raup crick was the primary step to quantify the contribution of ecological processes to the assembly of microbial communities βnti between communities was determined using the picante kembel et al 2010 and ape paradis et al 2004 packages and rcbray was calculated using the vegan package when the βnti 2 the assembly of the microbial community was governed by deterministic processes i e homogenizing selection βnti 2 or variable selection βnti 2 when the βnti 2 the community was mainly controlled by stochastic processes such as homogenizing dispersal rcbray 0 95 dispersal limitation rcbray 0 95 or undominated processes rcbray 0 95 3 results 3 1 alpha and beta diversity of bacterial communities overall the illumina sequencing yielded a total of 14 612 distinct asvs from all 88 samples 44 water samples and 44 co sampled sediment samples in the danjiangkou reservoir the taxonomic assignment of these representative asvs revealed bacterial taxa from 50 phyla 157 classes 279 orders 610 families and 1261 genera to explore the bacterial structure across different samples nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was conducted based on the bray curtis distance matrix fig 1 bacterial communities showed a distinct separation between water and sediment samples fig s2 anosim r 0 95 p 0 001 further the whole bacterial communities all group showed significant differences within the four separate seasonal groups in water samples fig 1 a anosim r 0 65 p 0 001 while weaker seasonal clusters were found in sedimentary communities fig 1 b anosim r 0 13 p 0 004 notably rare subcommunities of planktonic bacteria exhibited a more striking separation anosim r 0 84 p 0 001 than abundant subcommunities anosim r 0 58 p 0 001 among four seasons fig 1 a similarly the sedimentary rare subcommunities anosim r 0 17 p 0 003 appeared to be more varied than abundant subcommunities anosim r 0 07 p 0 035 among four seasons based on anosim although no clear separations were observed among four seasons in fig 1 b as for the asvs shared among four seasons fig s3 6 47 and 8 78 of the total asvs identified from planktonic and sedimentary communities were shared among four seasonal groups respectively moreover a considerable large portion of the abundant asvs respectively from planktonic 51 46 and sedimentary communities 15 56 were shared among four seasonal groups while a minor part of the rare asvs 1 01 in water and 5 84 in sediment were simultaneously detected in different seasons the alpha diversity including shannon diversity chao1 richness and phylogenetic diversity of planktonic bacterial communities also exhibited significant distinction among four seasons anova p 0 003 and the highest bacterial diversity chao 621 72 6 49 shannon 108 86 0 60 were found in autumn figs 1 c and s4a these seasonal differences in planktonic biodiversity could be mainly caused by the rare anova p 0 001 rather than abundant subcommunities anova p 0 05 in contrast no obvious seasonal patterns of shannon diversity were found in sedimentary communities except for the rare bacteria which implied the relative stability of sedimentary bacterial communities during seasonal dynamics figs 1 d and s4b in addition the biodiversity obtained from sedimentary communities chao1 richness 972 18 293 26 shannon diversity 8 84 0 61 was higher than that from planktonic communities chao1 richness 333 17 106 14 shannon diversity 5 97 0 60 figs 1 and s4 possibly reflecting the potential role of sedimentary habitats as the species bank to maintain the ecological function of the reservoirs 3 2 taxonomic composition of bacterial community the taxonomic composition of bacterial community was further explored in water and sediment of the danjiangkou reservoir at phylum level nearly 90 of the asvs in planktonic bacterial communities were assigned to actinobacteria average relative abundance 39 92 proteobacteria 20 65 bacteroidetes 16 11 and cyanobacteria 13 59 fig s5 while sedimentary phyla such as proteobacteria 23 85 actinobacteria 16 77 chloroflexi 14 94 and acidobacteriota 13 77 were identified to be abundant in all samples fig s6 moreover nineteen planktonic phyla accounting for about 25 60 of the total abundance in bacterial communities exhibited the apparent seasonal patterns for example bacteroidota planctomycetota chloroflexi and acidobacteriota were respectively dominant in spring summer autumn and winter fig s7 while nine sedimentary phyla holding for 4 63 of the total community showed high proportions in different seasons e g gemmatimonadota in summer and fibrobacterota in autumn fig s8 at genus level fig s9 hgci clade cl500 29 and flavobacterium had a predominance in the planktonic bacterial community of the reservoir holding for 21 89 of the total abundance fig s9a while uncultured roseiflexaceae 2 92 rokubacteriales 2 30 uncultured gemmatimonadaceae 2 28 uncultured gaiellales 2 05 and rb41 2 03 were the most abundant components of sedimentary communities fig s9b as for the seasonal dynamic planktonic genera such as flavobacterium cyanobium pcc 6307 cl500 29 marine group and candidatus methylopumilus showed a significant preference to spring summer autumn and winter respectively in addition sedimentary taxa exhibited little variation among the four seasons the asvs responsible for the response of bacterial communities to seasonal changes were further identified based on indicator species analysis as shown by manhattan plots fig 2 a about 34 18 of the total planktonic asvs presented significant differences among the four seasons namely indicator taxa for seasonal differences these indicator taxa specifically abundant asvs in each season were mainly affiliated to proteobacteria 11 73 of all indicator taxa and actinobacteria 11 50 cyanobacteria 10 22 and bacteroidota 9 83 and the number consisted of 2 43 and 21 32 of the abundant and rare subcommunities respectively for sedimentary bacteria fig 2 b a small percentage of indicator asvs 5 10 in all sedimentary asvs dominated by a large percentage of rare 79 18 rather than abundant taxa 2 28 were identified as bacteria for the seasonal pattern and mainly assigned to proteobacteria 3 34 of all indicator taxa actinobacteriota 2 11 and acidobacteriota 1 03 above all the relatively stronger difference related to seasonal variations existed in planktonic bacteria compared with sedimentary communities and these seasonal dynamics were mainly caused by rare subcommunities in the dangjiangkou reservoir 3 3 bacterial co occurrence pattern the network analysis was performed to explore the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities using all asvs obtained from water and sediment fig 3 as a result the planktonic network consisted of 1198 nodes and 16 892 significant edges based on strong spearman r 0 95 and significant p value 0 001 correlations and these connections were positive associations fig 3 a comparatively the sedimentary network was more complex and composed of 8881 nodes and 272 138 significant positive connections fig 3 b from the perspective of taxonomy these cooccurred taxa mainly belonged to proteobacteria 45 16 bacteroidetes 18 78 and cyanobacteria 10 43 in water while that in sedimentary network were mainly assigned to proteobacteria 24 20 chloroflexi 17 13 acidobacteria 14 80 and actinobacteria 12 12 notably rare subcommunity played an irreplaceable role in the bacterial networks in both water and sediment of the reservoir specifically nearly 90 and 95 of the coexisted taxa were identified as rare bacteria in the planktonic and sedimentary network respectively beside planktonic rare bacteria had a total of 30 472 connection degrees averaged degree 28 61 which were extremely higher than abundant groups total degree 143 averaged degree 20 43 fig 3 c while sedimentary rare bacteria had a total of 507 418 connection degrees averaged degree 60 11 and abundant taxa had a total degree of 5023 averaged degree 86 60 fig 3 d in addition the rare part also had a higher total closeness centrality 7 62e 04 than that for abundant taxa 4 99e 06 in the planktonic bacterial community overall rare taxa could be an essential part in maintaining the stability of bacterial community in both water and sediment of the reservoir especially for planktonic community 3 4 influencing factors and driving forces of bacterial community variations physicochemical parameters in the water of the reservoir were found to disparate among four seasons fig s10 nine physicochemical parameters including water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ph total organic carbon toc biological oxygen demand bod and total phosphorus tp showed significant seasonal variations fig s10 noticeably do 7 32 0 71 mg l wt 27 53 3 20 c toc 3 45 0 38 mg l were found to be the highest in spring summer and winter respectively in terms of sediment environments tp showed a prominent high concentration in winter whereas the other physicochemical variables seemed to be constant during seasonal changes in reservoir sediments fig s11 distance decay relationship is a typical geographical distribution pattern of bacterial communities wang et al 2019 the potential relationships between bacterial community similarity and geographic or environmental distance were further estimated for both planktonic and sedimentary communities in this reservoir meanwhile the time lag patterns of the bacterial similarity were also considered as shown in fig 4 community similarity of planktonic bacteria showed significant decrease patterns with increasing environmental distance mantel r 0 502 p 0 001 or seasonal gradient mantel r 0 499 p 0 001 rather than geographical distance mantel r 0 056 p 0 05 importantly these distance decay relationships could be better reflected by rare subcommunities environmental distance mantel r 0 544 p 0 001 seasonal distance mantel r 0 601 p 0 001 rather than abundant taxa environmental distance mantel r 0 484 p 0 001 seasonal distance mantel r 0 053 p 0 001 sedimentary bacterial similarities seemed to significantly correlate with environmental distance mantel r 0 131 p 0 009 instead of geographic distance or seasonal heterogeneity fig s12 despite this correlation being weaker than planktonic communities mantel r 0 502 p 0 001 fig 4 b the variations of sedimentary bacterial community with environmental distance could also be better explained by rare subcommunities mantel r 0 129 p 0 009 than abundant taxa mantel r 0 117 p 0 05 fig s12b briefly bacterial variations with environmental or seasonal changes were mainly attributed to rare subcommunity demonstrating the sensitivity of rare taxa to external environmental interference in reservoir ecosystems canonical correspondence analysis cca was further performed to examine the effects of different environmental factors on bacterial communities in the dangjiangkou reservoir as a result wt r 2 0 7282 p 0 01 nh4 n r 2 0 58193 p 0 01 no3 n r 2 0 5433 p 0 01 and tn r 2 0 4926 p 0 01 were identified as key drivers affecting the distribution of planktonic community fig 5 a while no2 n r 2 0 5445 p 0 01 ph r 2 0 4663 p 0 01 and toc r 2 0 3493 p 0 01 were the primary factors shaping the structure of sedimentary communities fig 5 b more importantly the niche breadth of rare subcommunities could be largely explained by environmental parameters in both water r 2 0 4731 and sediment r 2 0 2399 of the reservoir fig 5 c d however the niche breadth of abundant subcommunities seemed to be hardly limited by environmental heterogeneity fig s13 beside a quantitative ecological framework based on the null model was used to disentangle the potential contributions of ecological processes to the structure of bacterial communities in water and sediment of the danjiangkou reservoir stegen et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 we found that a dominant influence of selection processes including homogeneous selection and variable selection explained for 74 00 relative to stochastic processes i e undominated process homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation in structuring bacterial assembly in sedimentary bacteria while stochastic processes 51 33 seemed to be more important for planktonic bacterial assembly fig 5 e f specifically for planktonic bacteria the whole community were mainly governed by homogeneous selection process 48 05 undominated process 26 95 and dispersal limitation process 24 11 while abundant and rare subcommunity were respectively largely driven by undominated process 33 07 and homogeneous selection 30 67 in addition to the dominance of dispersal limitation process 53 28 for abundant and 50 09 for rare fig 5e as for sedimentary bacteria the variable selection was characterized as the dominant driver in controlling the whole community 55 39 and rare subcommunity 63 21 while the undominated process 77 86 predominantly shaped the assembly of abundant sedimentary bacteria by comparison rare subcommunities in water and sediment were respectively controlled by stochastic processes and selection processes whereas abundant taxa were mainly determined by stochastic processes 4 discussion the spatial temporal variations of physical chemical and biological components in reservoirs have become an increasingly prominent issue zhou et al 2019 the hydrological regime of reservoirs is influenced by both natural factors such as rainfall solar radiation and flow rate and artificial regulation on water level and retention time which contributes to the formation of unique bacterial composition different from other aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 2013 understanding the structure and distribution of both planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities will provide important insights to help resolve public health concerns associated with biological pollution and nutrition transformation in these engineered freshwater systems unfortunately the composition distributions and ecological drivers of the planktonic and sedimentary bacteria across space and time in source water reservoirs are still unclear especially for the danjiangkou reservoir the water source of the world s largest water diversion project in the present study we explored the spatial temporal dynamics of bacterial communities in both flowing water and sediments identified the primary influencing factors and revealed the underlying ecological processes driving community assembly in the dangjiangkou reservoir which will provide significant guidance for ecological management in source water systems the biodiversity and structure of planktonic rather than sedimentary bacterial communities were found to be dramatically influenced by seasonal variations in the danjiangkou reservoirs the inconspicuous seasonal variations of sedimentary bacterial community could be ascribed to the following aspects first the sedimentary bacteria could reach a state of relative equilibrium through long term sediment erosion and deposition processes resulting in the weak response of microbes to seasonal changes in sediments liu et al 2018 second a relatively higher diversity of microbes was harbored in sediment environments compared to reservoir water supporting that sediments could be the crucial species bank in various aquatic systems liu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 this could be ascribed to the abundant organic matter and nutrients deposited in sediments that contributed to the propagation of sedimentary microbes tanentzap et al 2019 the enriched sedimentary species exhibited higher positive correlations and more network complexity fig 3 thus these active biotic interactions facilitated community stability against seasonal disturbance yuan et al 2021 intriguingly apparent seasonal dynamics were observed for planktonic communities and for the rare taxa in particular among the planktonic bacteria flavobacterium cyanobium pcc 6307 cl500 29 and candidatus methylopumilus exhibited the highest abundance in spring summer autumn and winter respectively this could be attributed to the sensitivity of different species to physiochemical conditions in four seasons for example flavobacterium includes some potential psychrophilic bacteria that can thrive in the spring with a low water temperature about 15 5 c wang et al 2022 cyanobium pcc 6307 as the dominant cyanobacterial species in summer is sensitive to increased temperature and enough light exposure this genus is also known to be capable of forming algae bloom and producing cyanotoxins which should be of particular concern regarding the management of the water quality in this source water reservoir li et al 2019 cl500 29 marine group has been reported to have an excellent ability to degrade various forms of carbon based compounds such as the dead phytoplankton which increased during the autumn thus mediating the carbon cycling and nutrient transformation in aquatic ecosystems lindh et al 2015 candidatus methylopumilus as a potential methanotrophic bacteria could maintain active carbon iron and nitrogen cycling in the winter with low water temperature reduced light availability and limited input nutrients cruaud et al 2020 in summary the seasonal dynamic of planktonic bacteria is of great significance for promoting energy flow and maintaining ecological functions of reservoir systems importantly our results indicated that rare and dominant taxa exhibited inconsistent biogeographic patterns in the reservoir particularly rare populations rather than those widely occurred abundant taxa were the main contributors to the spatiotemporal shifts of planktonic communities in this source water reservoir beside the richness of rare subcommunities was nearly 20 and 113 times higher than the abundant subcommunities in water and sediments respectively fig s4 implying the significant contribution of rare microbes to the whole bacterial diversity the diverse rare taxa will become prominent with changing environmental conditions and thereby alleviate the impact of external environmental perturbation due to their high biodiversity high ecological redundancy and high adaptive capacity caron and countway 2009 on the one hand rare taxa could also transform into the key seeds for promoting bloom events in aquatic systems xue et al 2018 in this reservoir cyanobacteria such as microcystis pcc 7914 oscillatoria pcc 6304 and cyanobium pcc 6307 was detected as the rare present taxa and these cyanobacterial taxa could wildly grow and pollute water once the temperature and nutrients reached the suitable condition on the other hand although rare biosphere exhibited extremely low abundances these rare taxa could possess an immense reserve of genes involving the nitrogen carbon sulfur and phosphorus transformations and play fundamental roles in regulating the ecological function and biogeochemical processes of various aquatic systems pedrs ali 2012 for example despite the extremely low abundances in various ecosystems the newly discovered comammox nitrospira was reported to have an excellent ability in nitrogen transformation in drinking water systems lakes and rivers shi et al 2020 wang et al 2017 implying that these rare taxa were worthy to be further explored in this source water reservoir therefore our findings indicated that a large number of supplementary works are still needed to elucidate the regulatory role of rare taxa in the metabolism and function of various ecosystems notably as a refreshed reservoir the continuous influx of water also brought bacteria into the reservoir possibly resulting in observed bacterial variation between samples with different water ages from different seasons however the greater differences in bacterial communities longer bray curtis distance between spring and autumn samples were observed as well as between summer and winter regardless of all abundant or rare community fig 1 a although the spring and autumn samples were collected in 2016 and the summer and winter samples were collected in 2017 the pattern of differences in bacterial communities is more consistent with the cycle of the seasonal shift of spring summer autumn and winter fig 1 a suggesting the seasonal changes play a greater role in assembling the bacterial community in the reservoir instead of water age more importantly environmental rather than spatial heterogeneity played a dominant role in shaping bacterial communities of the water reservoir in four seasons fig 4 among the various environmental parameters water temperature and nutrients including ammonia nitrate and tn were found to be the highest explanation for variations of planktonic bacterial community among four seasons usually seasonal changes of various microbes were reported to be mainly caused by the fluctuation of temperature organic matters as well as dissolved oxygen in various freshwater ecosystems li et al 2017 2013 shang et al 2022 beside nitrogen and its major existing form i e nh4 n and no3 n are the limiting nutrients in freshwater environments and can thereby be the crucial factors that determine the diversity structure and even the key functions of bacterial communities strikingly rare biosphere especially those captured from water environments exhibited a stronger distribution limitation by environmental heterogeneity that were represented by so4 2 do toc and nh4 n despite that the habitat niche of abundant subcommunities could be hardly restricted by any measured environmental factors these differences might result from the preference of different species to the environmental conditions in the reservoir for example the observed rare species such as complete ammonia oxidizer and sulfate reducing bacteria might be influenced by the changes in the concentration of toc nitrogen and do among different sampling sites fig s10 to sum up environmental changes promoted the succession of microbial structures in the reservoir water especially acting on the rare biosphere disentangling the ecological processes modulating community assembly across diverse ecosystems is a major ecological concern martiny et al 2006 however the knowledge of ecological driving processes structuring the rare subcommunities remained largely unsatisfactory particularly considering the significant role of rare taxa within the community to address the above question we extended the investigation on ecological rules governing both rare and abundant subcommunities in the source reservoir our results showed that the dispersal limitation process 50 09 and homogeneous selection process 30 67 played dominant roles in controlling the assembly of planktonic rare bacteria while variable selection 63 21 mainly structured the sedimentary rare taxa meanwhile planktonic abundant subcommunities were dominantly shaped by dispersal limitation while that in sediment were mainly determined by the undominated process such as drift and diversification there are several possible explanations firstly the abundant biosphere represents these taxa with large abundance and a high adaption capacity to local environments and their community dynamics could be primarily controlled by stochastic processes in both water and sediment environments secondly for rare taxa the water conditions were less environmentally heterogeneous among different sites so that environmental filters were not strong enough to act as selective forces exerting species sorting thereby the stochastic processes seem to be more dominant huber et al 2020 beside the dominant role of dispersal limitation for planktonic rare taxa also implied that these taxa were largely limited by local position challenging a previous hypothesis that everything is everywhere but the environment selects thirdly a relatively stable water condition among different locations of the reservoir may provide a steady selective environment despite seasonal changes in several parameters such as wt do tn and ph thus continuously imposing homogeneous selection for planktonic rare taxa this finding could be also confirmed by the insignificant distance decay pattern of rare community similarity along the geographic distance however in sediment the key contribution of variable selection to rare taxa reflected that heterogeneous sedimentary environments promoted the high variation in community structure among different sampling sites zhou and ning 2017 in brief rare and abundant taxa played complementary roles regarding the species diversity and ecological functions within the bacterial communities thus maintaining the stability of reservoir ecosystems 5 conclusions the current study provides an overview of the bacterial community dynamics and their assembly mechanisms in terms of spatial and seasonal variations in a source water system broader biodiversity and more complex co occurrence patterns of sedimentary than the planktonic community were discovered which could contribute to the relatively stable structure of the sedimentary community against the external environmental disturbance or spatiotemporal changes within the whole bacterial communities abundant and rare subcommunities demonstrated contrasting patterns regarding their seasonal patterns particularly intriguing are the rare communities that could be largely influenced by the fluctuation of physicochemical conditions such as nitrogen and sulfur in the water while abundant taxa could be less affected by environmental changes further planktonic rare subcommunities could be mainly mediated by dispersal limitation and homogeneous selection whereas sedimentary rare taxa were dominantly controlled by variable selection these findings lay the groundwork for revealing the essential role of rare taxa in maintaining the ecological functions and services in aquatic ecosystems further

16086,dissolved organic matter dom mediates the microbial transformation of micropollutants including norgestrel ngt in natural waters however little is known of the effect of complex and variable wastewater derived dom composition on ngt degradation during wastewater treatment in this study the relationship between the compositions of initial dom and ngt removal efficiencies of 17 wastewater treatment plants wwtps in spring and summer were analyzed the different molecular composition of dom was selected in the lab to further explore its effect on ngt degradation by activated sludge results indicated that the dom composition was a substantial driver of ngt removal in wwtps the discrepancies in the initial dom composition contributed to the differences in the kinetics of ngt degradation by activated sludge the larger rapid decay phase rates of ngt are usually accompanied by a large proportion of labile substances in dom high throughput sequencing and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry were used to further analyze the evolution of bacterial communities and dom molecular composition were combined with network analysis to reveal the intrinsic relationship that how dom composition affected ngt degradation by regulating core microbes eighty nine core otus were significantly associated with ngt degradation and 73 occurred in the rapid decay phase implying that ngt degradation was mainly regulated by the initial composition of dom nine major transformation products were identified in different groups with widely varying concentrations or relative abundances of these transformation products this work provides valuable insights into the effects of wastewater derived dom composition on ngt degradation by activated sludge and innovatively explores the influence

environmentally benign levels nguyen et al 2021 zind et al 2021 activated sludge is one of the most widely used wastewater treatment processes and is used in more than 80 of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china xu et al 2019 numerous factors have been reported to affect the removal of mps by activated sludge such as redox conditions sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nguyen et al 2021 nevertheless little is known of the effect of dissolved organic matter dom composition on mp removal by activated sludge wastewater derived dom is a mixture of complex molecules that represent a mainly available source of carbon and energy for the microbes wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 normally the composition of dom could importantly influence the structure and function of the microbial community because bacterial growth and activity rely on available components as an energy substrate osterholz et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 it is speculated that the composition of dom is closely related to the removal of mps in wastewater tan et al 2015 which may be because dom can participate in the removal of mps via co metabolism ma and yates 2018 several studies have investigated the effect of the composition of natural dom on the degradation and transformation of mps in surface water confirming that natural dom can remove mps by affecting the microbial community bai et al 2019 luo et al 2019 compared to natural dom wastewater derived dom is mainly derived from human activities resulting in a complex and variable composition maizel and remucal 2017 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2018 which may have a broader impact on the microbial community in activated sludge wang et al 2021 however remarkably little is known of how the composition of wastewater derived dom affects mp removal in activated sludge the composition of dom changes in response to microbial utilization with the associations between the two being bidirectional and complex zhao et al 2019 which in turn may alter the removal of mps through variations in individual populations tan et al 2013 technological advances in high throughput sequencing and dom characterization have enabled the microbial

multivariate statistics to capture the potential association between bacterial populations and dom molecules in coastal estuaries and seawater chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 this provides a new perspective to reveal the relationships between dom composition bacterial community and mp degradation however to date no studies have investigated these coupling relationships in activated sludge

aforementioned information ngt was selected as the model compound for this study although recent studies have emphasized the importance of dom composition in microbial community succession the role played by dom composition is rarely considered in the removal of ngt from wastewater in this study the composition of the initial dom and ngt removal data of 17 wwtps was analyzed to improve the understanding of the relationship between them the effect of dom composition on the kinetics of ngt degradation by activated sludge was further investigated in the laboratory the mechanism of the effect of dom composition on ngt degradation was elucidated from the perspectives of the molecular composition of dom bacterial community and ngt transformation products together this study provides a new insight into explanation about the mechanism of ngt removal in activated sludge and suggests beneficial directions for exploring the intrinsic relationship between dom composition and mp removal 2

greengenes database otus containing 0 001 were discarded 2 7 data analysis two phase biphasic exponential decay model was used to examine ngt decay 1 c c 0 e k r a p t 1 e k s l o w t t 1 where c represents the concentration of ngt at time t c0 represents the initial concentration of ngt k rap represents the initial rapid decay phase rate until a breakpoint at time t 1 and k slow represents the slow decay phase rate after a breakpoint at time t 1 breakpoints were determined by the segmented package in r studio version 1 4 1717 the aqueous removal efficiencies of ngt were calculated by comparing the concentrations in the influent and secondary effluent of the wwtps spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the relative abundance of otus and the m z ions and ngt residual concentration was calculated using r studio a positive strong correlation r 0 7 p 0 01 q 0 01 and negative strong correlation r 0 7 p 0 01 q 0 01 were selected and visualized in a network with gephi 3 results and discussion 3 1 ngt removal and influent dom composition in 17 wwtps the aqueous removal efficiencies of ngt in 17 wwtps over two seasons ranged from 60 to 100 fig 1 a the majority of the investigated wwtps exhibited broad seasonal differences with variances of up to 149 the overall removal efficiency of ngt in summer median 89 8 was higher than that in spring median 69 6 the differences in ngt removal efficiency were commonly observed in different wwtps during the same season for example in spring ngt was almost completely removed in the sh and the removal efficiency of hlj was 33 the compositions of dom in the influent also showed seasonal and geographical variations fig 1b the dominant doms in spring were free tryptophan like amino acids try terrestrial humic acid like components th and microbial humic like fluorescence mh and those of dom in summer were free tyrosine like amino acids tyr try mh and th the dom in spring contained more abundant mh and th than those in summer the composition of dom also varied considerably among wwtps in the same season fig 1b which might be attributed to differences in wastewater sources across regions li et al 2020a the relationship between ngt removal and influent dom composition and other factors was analyzed using spearman correlation fig 1c the removal efficiencies of ngt showed a significant negative correlation with humic fulvic like substances hf which implied that the composition of influent dom may be a driver affecting ngt removal in wwtps no statistically significant relationships were observed between the other dom composition and variables with ngt removal previous studies have also observed little or no statistical relationship between variables such as srt or hrt and the biodegradation rate of mps assuming that bacteria capable of biodegrading the selected mps may be present under different conditions falås et al 2016 helbling et al 2012 nguyen et al 2021 dom composition may indirectly affect ngt removal mainly through the regulation of microbes bai et al 2019 it was observed in coastal estuaries and rivers that the molecular composition of dom was affected the dynamics of bacterial communities chen et al 2021 muscarella et al 2019 while biodegradation is an essential pathway for ngt removal in activated sludge liu et al 2013 limited by the resolution of dom composition characterization and the complexity of wwtps knowledge about how dom composition affect microbial and thereby ngt removal requires further elucidation in laboratory experiments 3 2 effect of dom composition on the degradation of ngt by activated sludge 3 2 1 characteristics of dom molecular composition the molecular composition of dom in each group was characterized by ft icr ms before incubation and the visualization results are presented in fig 2 a the points representing dom molecules in js were distributed centrally in protein like lipid like and lignin like regions while in sh and hb molecules were distributed more dispersedly in protein like condensed aromatic structures and lignin like regions the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons was relatively larger in sh and hb than in the other three groups while the sd and srom molecules were distributed centrally in the condensed aromatic structure and lignin like regions although ft icr ms is not a quantitative technique for analyzing the composition of dom comparing the relative peak intensities of molecules in different samples under the same instrumental conditions can be used for semi quantitative analysis of analogous types of compounds wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 the differences in the composition of these initial dom were more clearly illustrated when the contributions of the relative abundances of the major compound classes were compared fig 2b the lignin like lipid like and protein like structures exhibited higher overall proportions in js in total 82 than in sh in total 44 hb in total 49 sd in total 36 and srom in total 35 the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons was higher in sh 12 and hb 13 than in js 7 sd 4 and srom 7 by contrast the condensed aromatic structures exhibited higher proportions of srom 51 and sd 43 than in the other groups 28 in sh 26 in hb and 4 in js the cho chon chos and chop compounds were major subcategories in the dom samples but the proportion of each subcategory varied among the groups fig 2c these results provided a clear visualization and semi quantitative analysis of the initial dom in different groups and revealed the differences in their compositions at the molecular level 3 2 2 degradation of ngt by activated sludge under different dom composition the aqueous residual concentrations of ngt in abiotic control groups were 6 29 0 43 μg l at the end of the experiment while the residual concentrations of ngt in various experimental groups were less than 5 ng l the abiotic removal mechanisms of ngt might mainly involve sludge adsorption and form complex with dom liu et al 2013 ma and yates 2018 this implied that the loss of ngt in the experimental groups was mainly attributed to biodegradation compared to abiotic effects the degradation kinetics of the ngt were fitted using a one phase exponential decay model the residual plots demonstrated that the decay model did not fit these data of the dom added groups well conversely the ngt degradation in different groups was biphasic which started with a rapid exponential decay followed by a slower decay fig 3 biphasic decay was also observed in the literature for example the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sludge and bisphenol a with laccase margot et al 2013 vermeulen et al 2007 the segmented regression showed that the breakpoint between the two decay phases of js and cl occurred on the first day and sh hb sd and srom occurred on the second day this could be caused by the differences in bioavailability of the carbon sources to the inhabiting microorganisms the time for the initial concentration of ngt to decrease by 90 t 90 in all groups occurred during the rapid decay phase notably the t 90 values of all dom added groups were smaller than those of cl t 90 8 16 h 25 c under the same conditions table s3 this might be due to the presence of dom having complex composition which is relatively resistant to biodegradation and inhibits the activity of microorganisms li et al 2020b t 90 values were significantly different across dom added groups p 0 05 with the t 90 values notably larger at sd 18 h and smaller at js 11 h the differences in t 90 values across the dom added groups might be attributed to the effect of different initial compositions of dom available to microbes zhou et al 2021 the relatively higher protein like lipid like and lignin like content in js might explain its higher ngt degradation rate because they are more biodegradable and can be rapidly utilized by microorganisms to facilitate pollutant removal li et al 2020b by contrast the refractory molecules in the substrate were likely to weaken the ability of microorganisms to degrade mps tan et al 2015 dom molecules of sd contained more condensed aromatic structure compounds that were recalcitrant ohno et al 2014 possibly contributing to its larger t 90 value except for sd the time for the initial concentration of ngt to decrease by 99 t 99 in all groups occurred in the slow decay phase where the t 99 values were significantly different across groups p 0 01 specifically the t 99 value of sh was the smallest at 34 3 h and that of srom was the largest at 136 h these results were considerably different from those of t 90 probably due to the change in the composition of the initial dom as a result of degradation by the microorganisms and its characteristics and reactivity also changed accordingly wang et al 2021 the altered dom composition may be varied among these groups and consequently affect the degradation kinetics of ngt during the 1st and 2nd days of incubation the doc concentration with different wastewater derived doms was decreased by 66 2 4 75 and 26 1 2 91 respectively followed by a comparatively slow decrease of doc fig s1 the loss of doc occurred mainly within the first 1 day of incubation which is consistent with previous studies involving soil derived and algal dom samples hansen et al 2016 nguyen and hur 2011 during the first day incubation labile dom fractions such as proteins sugars and lipids are preferentially utilized by microorganisms promoting the growth and metabolism of the microbial community d andrilli et al 2019 sipler et al 2017 the variation in doc concentration coincided with the change in ngt degradation ngt was removed by 96 8 1 07 on the first day followed by slow removal this might be attributed to the abundant utilization of labile dom by the microbes increasing their abundance and activity and driving the degradation of ngt although the total amount of dom utilized by the microbes differed between the groups a similar pattern of temporal variations in doc concentration was observed in all groups during the experiment fig s1 3 3 mechanism of dom composition effect on ngt degradation by activated sludge 3 3 1 dynamic variations of dom molecular composition to elucidate the variations in dom composition at the molecular level van krevelen plots depicted the removal peak loss resistance peak retention and production new peaks of subclasses such as cho and chon in each group after biodegradation figs 4 and s2 the dom removed during biodegradation in the js sh hb sd and srom biodegradation were mainly distributed in the o c 0 1 0 5 0 3 0 67 0 67 0 5 and h c 1 0 2 0 0 5 1 5 0 7 2 0 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 regions respectively and the resistant and new dom gained after biodegradation were concentratively distributed in the o c 0 3 0 4 0 4 and 0 5 0 67 0 3 and 0 4 and h c 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 and 1 5 2 0 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 0 and 0 7 2 0 regions respectively these results indicate that different changes in dom with different initial compositions occurred in the activated sludge the numerous removed and produced formulas demonstrate that the microbes effectively utilized the initial dom during the degradation of ngt however the utilization preferences of the major subcategory compounds varied in different dom added activated sludge as influenced by the initial dom composition specifically dom compounds with low o c ratios were substantially biotransformed in the sh and hb these dom compounds were mainly distributed within the region of unsaturated hydrocarbons osterholz et al 2016 which accounted for a larger proportion of the initial dom composition in sh and hb than that in the other groups after degradation 1207 and 1006 newly formed molecular formulae were assigned to lignin like substances in sh and hb respectively for js microorganisms mainly utilized protein like lignin like and lipid like structures previous studies indicated that highly biodegradable protein like and lipid like compounds were metabolized by microbes in the short term d andrilli et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 a substantial number of lignin like and condensed aromatic structures were newly generated with the utilization of the initial dom in js wang et al 2020 found that the biodegradability of lignin like substances was lower than that of unsaturated biodegradable lipid like substances microbially produced lignin like and condensed aromatic structures were resistant to re utilization by general microorganisms wang et al 2021 this may be the reason for the short t 90 value but the long t 99 value of ngt in js interestingly condensed aromatic components were utilized in large quantities in sd and srom contrary to in the literature findings that condensed aromatic compounds were recalcitrant schmidt et al 2011 this could be attributed to the large proportion of condensed aromatic structures in the initial sd and srom 43 and 51 respectively leading to favourable growth of microbes capable to utilize condensed aromatic structures zhou et al 2021 previous studies reported a strong effect of dom composition on the structure of bacterial communities in the natural environment bai et al 2019 luo et al 2019 the differences in wastewater dom composition might also lead to different successions of bacterial communities in the activated sludge 3 3 2 dynamic evolution of bacterial communities fig 5 shows the evolution of bacterial communities at the phyla and otu levels induced by differences in dom composition at the phylum level proteobacteria 44 bacteroidetes 11 planctomycetes 8 and chloroflexi 8 were the major bacteria in activated sludge ss as measured by relative abundance on day 1 the abundance and structure of the bacterial community varied with the initial dom composition for example proteobacteria planctomycetes and actinobacteria were the dominant bacteria in js 49 14 and 12 respectively and proteobacteria planctomycetes and bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria in hb 40 16 and10 the difference in the bacterial community further increased during the incubation period fig 5a a similar pattern was also observed at the otu level fig 5b for example on day 1 the abundance of otu40 was highest in js which was eight times higher than that of srom and by day 14 the abundance of otu40 was highest in hb which was two times higher than that of the lowest sh these findings might be mainly attributed to the initial dom composition and variation in dom composition under microbial utilization osterholz et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 the alpha diversity of bacteria was not significantly different among the dom added groups due to the prevalence of proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes and planctomycetes in the different groups it has been reported that these types of bacteria also respond rapidly to other biogenic dom such as synechococcus derived dom zheng et al 2019 and grass dom d andrilli et al 2019 the bacterial diversity in all groups tended to decrease from day 1 to 14 which was closely related to the generation of increasing amounts of substances resistant to bioavailability during dom transformation tanentzap et al 2019 commonly bacterial community variations were limited by the bioavailability of dom zhao et al 2019 the different dom composition provided variable available components which might lead to the succession of microbial communities in different directions tanentzap et al 2019 the biodegradation of ngt was enhanced when the dom composition facilitated the growth of ngt degrading microorganisms interestingly some otus with potential ngt degradation capabilities were found in different groups for example otu73 belongs to γ proteobacteria which was reported to have a strong ngt degradation capability liu et al 2013 the abundance of these ngt degrading bacteria varied considerably among the groups which might be intrinsic to the discrepancy in ngt removal across groups 3 3 3 linkage among dom composition and bacterial species and ngt degradation the complex relationships between dom composition bacterial species and ngt degradation were visualized by network analysis fig 6 the selected datasets were composed of spearman s rank correlation coefficients among otus with a sum of relative abundance greater than 0 1 and m z ions in each subcategory and ngt residual concentration edges in the network were made by direct connections from selected otu nodes to selected m z ion nodes and ngt nodes positive and negative networks were linked to reflect the dom composition effect on ngt degradation by activated sludge sideways with a total of 3677 nodes and 29 105 edges across the network the significant relationships between otu abundance and dom molecule relative intensity or ngt degradation were mainly presentd in the negative network during the rapid phase of ngt degradation figs 6 and s3 at this stage labile substances in the initial dom composition were used to proliferate for certain microbes and the relative intensity of dom molecules was usually reduced by microbial utilization chen et al 2021 vorobev et al 2018 which resulted in a negative correlation between them in the negative network 235 core otus related to dom utilization were identified with the majority of these otu nodes connected to the degraded cho formulas and the chos and chop formulae with low o c ratios fig 6 the top tank otus were associated with the utilization and conversion of compositions that were relatively active in the initial dom figs 2 and 6 seventy three core otus were significantly correlated with ngt degradation these otus could be categorized into 13 classes spreadsheet of which α proteobacteria β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria have been reported to be closely associated with steroid degradation chakraborty et al 2021 yang et al 2016 in addition otu52 was classified as comamonas which was an ngt degrading strain isolated from activated sludge in the literature liu et al 2013 these otus were mainly modulated by lipid like and lignin like compounds in the initial dom composition spreadsheet which might be attributed to the increased microbial abundance by labile compounds in the short term ma and yates 2018 the significant relationships between the successive otu abundance and the generated dom molecule relative intensity or ngt degradation were mainly present in the positive network spreadsheet during the slow phase of ngt degradation figs 6 and s4 the 178 core otus associated with dom production were identified and these otu nodes were mainly connected to the cho chon and chop formulas that accumulated after incubation figs 6 and s4 the initial dom was utilized by microbes to produce abundant microbe derived dom and some microbes could use the metabolites of other microbes wang et al 2021 the labor division and cooperation patterns in bacterial communities facilitate the continuous transformation and metabolism of dom similar phenomena have been observed in the literature on seawater and surface water chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 only 16 otus were significantly associated with ngt degradation in the positive network these otus were supported by lignin like and condensed aromatic structures produced by the microorganisms spreadsheet ten of these otus were significantly associated with ngt degradation in both positive and negative networks commonly known as generalists indicating that they could exploit both the initial dom and microbe derived dom among the 10 generalist otu17874 otu17873 and otu16615 belong to α proteobacteria otu67 belongs to β proteobacteria and otu73 belongs to γ proteobacteria these three subspecies of proteobacteria have been shown to be closely associated with the degradation of ngt liu et al 2013 these results demonstrated that dom composition could affect ngt degradation by regulating microorganisms which is mainly regulated by the initial dom composition although numerous bacteria did not show a significant correlation with ngt degradation the coexistence and interaction of these bacteria with ngt degrading bacteria should not be ignored 3 4 biotransformation of ngt by activated sludge under different dom composition nine major transformation products tps of ngt were detected in the different groups the tentative structures and ms information of the tps are shown in table s4 figs s5 and s6 wherein p3 and p6 were tps from the bacterial degradation of ngt detected in activated sludge for the first time these tps were identified to be the same among the groups one possible reason is that the different microorganisms generated the same tps of ngt liu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 notably the relative abundance of these tps varied considerably among the groups fig s4 two tps 5α dihydrotestosterone and 4 androstene 3 17 dione were further quantified by standards and the results indicated that these two tps exhibited large discrepancies at various sampling time points in different groups fig 7 a for example at day 1 the concentration of 5α dihydrotestosterone was higher in hb which was more than twice that detected in sd at day 3 the concentration of 5α dihydrotestosterone was higher in sh which was nearly six times higher than that detected in srom these results imply that differences in dom composition also played an essential role in the occurrence of tps in the activated sludge the general pathways of ngt biotransformation in dom added groups were tentatively proposed where hydrogenation dehydrogenation hydroxylation and redox could be major mechanisms fig 7b briefly two hydrogen atoms were removed from the c6 7 position of ring b to form p1 and two hydrogen atoms were added to the c4 5 position of ring a to form p2 studies have pointed out that rings a and b of steroids are prone to be hydrogenated and dehydrogenated under the action of microorganisms liu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 the ketone group at the c3 position of ring a of p2 was reduced to hydroxyl by microorganisms to form p5 previous studies have widely detected p5 an important metabolite of ngt in monkeys sisenwine et al 1979 the hydroxylation reaction occurred at the c16 position of ring d of ngt to form p3 and the c2 position of ring a of p3 was hydroxylated to form p6 the p3 and p6 metabolites of ngt were detected in rhesus monkeys sisenwine et al 1979 but have not been reported in activated sludge the ring d of p1 underwent a side chain break and methylation reaction and the methylation and hydrogenation reactions occurred on ring b to form p4 studies have also pointed out that progesterone can be converted into androgens via bacterial processes yu et al 2018 two hydrogen atoms were added to c4 5 position of ring a of p4 to form p7 product p8 was formed by the dehydrogenation of ring a and hydroxylation of ring d of p7 which may also be formed by the oxidation of hydroxyl to ketone at the c17 position of p4 ring b of p8 broke and underwent a redox reaction at positions c9 10 and c5 6 to form p9 3 5 implication and limitations this study investigated the intrinsic link between dom composition and ngt degradation in wastewater treatment systems in unprecedented detail the combination of high throughput sequencing and ft icr ms and network analysis provided insights into the complex correlations between dom molecular composition and microbial communities and ngt degradation from both a molecular and species perspective our results emphasized that dom composition can influence ngt degradation and transformation by modulating the bacterial community in activated sludge which was affected by the initial composition of dom exploration of the effect of dom composition on the biodegradation of mps will facilitate the design and operation of wastewater treatment systems to achieve high stable removal of mps from wastewater tan et al 2015 wang et al 2020 however the current study has limitations and is only a first step towards this goal a major limitation is the complexity and the semi quantitative data on the molecular composition of dom limited by the dom extraction efficiency tanentzap et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the unknown ionization efficiency in the mass spectra chen et al 2021 and the invisibility of the highly reduced dark dom molecules in the window muscarella et al 2019 ft icr ms can only capture part of the dom molecules which may not represent the entire dom pool the dom composition variation analysis was also based on the hypothesis of equal extractability of compositions in all samples zhao et al 2019 additionally generic primers utilized for the 16s rrna gene region usually overestimate specific taxonomic groups such as gram negative bacteria parada et al 2016 despite these limitations and uncertainties this study still provides new insights into how dom composition affects the degradation of mps in activated sludge 4 conclusions in summary this work investigated the effect of wastewater derived dom composition on ngt degradation by activated sludge from the perspective of molecular characteristics of dom and bacterial community interactions the results indicate that discrepancies in dom composition contributed to differences in the kinetics of ngt degradation by activated sludge network analysis revealed the intrinsic relationship that dom molecules affected ngt degradation via regulation of microbes emphasizing that the core otus associated with ngt degradation were mainly regulated by the initial composition of dom moreover the composition of dom also had important effect on the concentrations or relative abundances of ngt tps in the activated sludge further strengthening of mp removal in wastewater treatment systems by modifying dom such as electrochemically modified dom composition could be considered in the future

16086,dissolved organic matter dom mediates the microbial transformation of micropollutants including norgestrel ngt in natural waters however little is known of the effect of complex and variable wastewater derived dom composition on ngt degradation during wastewater treatment in this study the relationship between the compositions of initial dom and ngt removal efficiencies of 17 wastewater treatment plants wwtps in spring and summer were analyzed the different molecular composition of dom was selected in the lab to further explore its effect on ngt degradation by activated sludge results indicated that the dom composition was a substantial driver of ngt removal in wwtps the discrepancies in the initial dom composition contributed to the differences in the kinetics of ngt degradation by activated sludge the larger rapid decay phase rates of ngt are usually accompanied by a large proportion of labile substances in dom high throughput sequencing and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry were used to further analyze the evolution of bacterial communities and dom molecular composition were combined with network analysis to reveal the intrinsic relationship that how dom composition affected ngt degradation by regulating core microbes eighty nine core otus were significantly associated with ngt degradation and 73 occurred in the rapid decay phase implying that ngt degradation was mainly regulated by the initial composition of dom nine major transformation products were identified in different groups with widely varying concentrations or relative abundances of these transformation products this work provides valuable insights into the effects of wastewater derived dom composition on ngt degradation by activated sludge and innovatively explores the influence

composition 1 introduction the presence of micropollutants mps introduces a critical challenge to wastewater treatment because of the required reduction in the concentrations of these mps to environmentally benign levels nguyen et al 2021 zind et al 2021 activated sludge is one of the most widely used wastewater treatment processes and is used in more than 80 of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china xu et al 2019 numerous factors have been reported to affect the removal of mps by activated sludge such as redox conditions sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nguyen et al 2021 nevertheless little is known of the effect of dissolved organic matter dom composition on mp removal by activated sludge wastewater derived dom is a mixture of complex molecules that represent a mainly available source of carbon and energy for the microbes wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 normally the composition of dom could importantly influence the structure and function of the microbial community because bacterial growth and activity rely on available components as an energy substrate osterholz et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 it is speculated that the composition of dom is closely related to the removal of mps in wastewater tan et al 2015 which may be because dom can participate in the removal of mps via co metabolism ma and yates 2018 several studies have investigated the effect of the composition of natural dom on the degradation and transformation of mps in surface water confirming that natural dom can remove mps by affecting the microbial community bai et al 2019 luo et al 2019 compared to natural dom wastewater derived dom is mainly derived from human activities resulting in a complex and variable composition maizel and remucal 2017 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2018 which may have a broader impact on the microbial community in activated sludge wang et al 2021 however remarkably little is known of how the composition of wastewater derived dom affects mp removal in activated sludge the composition of dom changes in response to microbial utilization with the associations between the two being bidirectional and complex zhao et al 2019 which in turn may alter the removal of mps through variations in individual populations tan et al 2013 technological advances in high throughput sequencing and dom characterization have enabled the microbial communities and dom molecular composition to be revealed at ultrahigh resolution and high accuracy chen et al 2021 tanentzap et al 2019 high throughput sequencing facilitates the classification of environmental dna amplicons into thousands of bacterial populations tanentzap et al 2019 and the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms can produce thousands of dom molecular formulas and provide a more detailed molecular characterization of dom composition wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 recent studies have coupled these two detection techniques and combined multivariate statistics to capture the potential association between bacterial populations and dom molecules in coastal estuaries and seawater chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 this provides a new perspective to reveal the relationships between dom composition bacterial community and mp degradation however to date no studies have investigated these coupling relationships in activated sludge norgestrel ngt is widely used in contraception certain types of cancer treatments and farm animal production regulators hou et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 environmental ngt is an important mp due to its wide detection in the environmental matrix liu et al 2012 torres padrón et al 2020 relative persistence liu et al 2013 and ecotoxicological effects hou et al 2018 the concentrations of ngt were up to 126 ng l in municipal wastewaters fernandez et al 2007 10 800 ng l in farm wastewater and 465 ng l in receiving surface waters liu et al 2012 the negative impact of ngt on the reproductive systems of indigenous aquatic organisms was observed at concentration levels down to 3 6 ng l hou et al 2018 the removal of ngt in the activated sludge was mainly via biodegradation liu et al 2013 based on the aforementioned information ngt was selected as the model compound for this study although recent studies have emphasized the importance of dom composition in microbial community succession the role played by dom composition is rarely considered in the removal of ngt from wastewater in this study the composition of the initial dom and ngt removal data of 17 wwtps was analyzed to improve the understanding of the relationship between them the effect of dom composition on the kinetics of ngt degradation by activated sludge was further investigated in the laboratory the mechanism of the effect of dom composition on ngt degradation was elucidated from the perspectives of the molecular composition of dom bacterial community and ngt transformation products together this study provides a new insight into explanation about the mechanism of ngt removal in activated sludge and suggests beneficial directions for exploring the intrinsic relationship between dom composition and mp removal 2

wastewater derived dom preparation wastewater samples used to investigate ngt aqueous removal efficiencies and dom initial composition were collected from 17 operating wwtps which are distributed in 17 cities in china and all use activated sludge processes two sampling campaigns were conducted from march 2019 to august 2019 and the sampling interval of each wwtp was controlled at approximately three months basic information on these wwtps is shown in table s1 and detailed information on wastewater collection and preparation is provided in text s1 wastewater samples used to prepare the wastewater derived dom were taken from the entrance of four municipal wwtps js hb sd and sh samples were collected in precleaned 1 l high density polyethylene bottles wrapped with aluminum foil kept on dry ice and immediately shipped in darkness to the laboratory the samples were then thawed at 4 c and filtered through gf f glass fiber filters whatman usa to obtain wastewater derived dom the filtrate was freeze dried to a powder solids and used in the experiments activated sludge used as inoculum was collected from the aerobic tank in wwtp js and was multiple washed with phosphate buffered saline slightly agitate stand to allow the sludge to settle and discard the supernatant to eliminate the presumed background of dom and then aliquots were used to seed each flask batch experiments were conducted immediately on the same day 2 3 biodegradation experiments there was no ngt concentration was detected in the experimental water and sludge before adding ngt all flasks were

sludge the same concentrations of natural dom and glucose were separately added to different flasks as the experimental controls all flasks were incubated in a shaker at 25 c and 120 rpm continuously

withdrawn from the same flask at intervals of 0 1 0 and 14 days to analyze the molecular composition of dom a 200 ml supernatant sample was collected from additional replicate batches of each group at predetermined sampling intervals 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 14 days after ngt treatment and extracts from all sampling sites were combined to identify the degradation products of ngt abiotic control experiments were performed concurrently to determine abiotic processes briefly the flask was autoclaved three times 121 c 30 min followed by the addition of a final concentration of 0 5 sodium azide to maintain sterility afterward dom and ngt were added to the control flasks for abiotic control experiments 2 4 concentration measurement and product identification of ngt the analytical procedures for ngt were slightly modified based on previous studies liu et al 2014 briefly after pretreatment with oasis hlb cartridges the filtered water samples were loaded onto the cartridges at a flow rate of 1 2 drops s and the cartridges were washed with 10 ml of 5 v v methanol water the cartridges were dried under vacuum and then eluted with 2 5 ml ethyl acetate for each cartridge the eluents were dried under nitrogen flow and then re dissolved in 0 5 ml wwtp samples or 0 2 ml lab samples methanol after centrifugation the supernatants were transferred to a 200 μl glass lined pipe the concentration of ngt was analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer waters corp ma usa the limit of quantification signal to noise ratio of 10 1 of ngt ranged from 0 47 ng l to 1 93 ng l and the mean spiked recoveries ranged from 80 to 115 degradation products of ngt were identified by an ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem orbitrap

the illumina miseq platform at sangon biotech shanghai co ltd shanghai china operational taxonomic units otus were clustered from the assembled high quality sequences and classified using blast in the greengenes database otus containing 0 001 were discarded 2 7 data analysis two phase biphasic exponential decay model was used to examine ngt decay 1 c c 0 e k r a p t 1 e k s l o w t t 1 where c represents the concentration of ngt at time t c0 represents the initial concentration of ngt k rap represents the initial rapid decay phase rate until a breakpoint at time t 1 and k slow represents the slow decay phase rate after a breakpoint at time t 1 breakpoints were determined by the segmented package in r studio version 1 4 1717 the aqueous removal efficiencies of ngt were calculated by comparing the concentrations in the influent and secondary effluent of the wwtps spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the relative abundance of otus and the m z ions and ngt residual concentration was calculated using r studio a positive strong correlation r 0 7 p 0 01 q 0 01 and negative strong correlation r 0 7 p 0 01 q 0 01 were selected and visualized in a network with gephi 3 results and discussion 3 1 ngt removal and influent dom composition in 17 wwtps the aqueous removal efficiencies of ngt in 17 wwtps over two seasons ranged from 60 to 100 fig 1 a the majority of the investigated wwtps exhibited broad seasonal differences with variances of up to 149 the overall removal efficiency of ngt in summer median 89 8 was higher than that in spring median 69 6 the differences in ngt removal efficiency were commonly observed in different wwtps during the same season for example in spring ngt was almost completely removed in the sh and the removal efficiency of hlj was 33 the compositions of dom in the influent also showed seasonal and geographical variations fig 1b the dominant doms in spring were free tryptophan like amino acids try terrestrial humic acid like components th and microbial humic like fluorescence mh and those of dom in summer were free tyrosine like amino acids tyr try mh and th the dom in spring contained more abundant mh and th than those in summer the composition of dom also varied considerably among wwtps in the same season fig 1b which might be attributed to differences in wastewater sources across regions li et al 2020a the relationship between ngt removal and influent dom composition and other factors was analyzed using spearman correlation fig 1c the removal efficiencies of ngt showed a significant negative correlation with humic fulvic like substances hf which implied that the composition of influent dom may be a driver affecting ngt removal in wwtps no statistically significant relationships were observed between the other dom composition and variables with ngt removal previous studies have also observed little or no statistical relationship between variables such as srt or hrt and the biodegradation rate of mps assuming that bacteria capable of biodegrading the selected mps may be present under different conditions falås et al 2016 helbling et al 2012 nguyen et al 2021 dom composition may indirectly affect ngt removal mainly through the regulation of microbes bai et al 2019 it was observed in coastal estuaries and rivers that the molecular composition of dom was affected the dynamics of bacterial communities chen et al 2021 muscarella et al 2019 while biodegradation is an essential pathway for ngt removal in activated sludge liu et al 2013 limited by the resolution of dom composition characterization and the complexity of wwtps knowledge about how dom composition affect microbial and thereby ngt removal requires further elucidation in laboratory experiments 3 2 effect of dom composition on the degradation of ngt by activated sludge 3 2 1 characteristics of dom molecular composition the molecular composition of dom in each group was characterized by ft icr ms before incubation and the visualization results are presented in fig 2 a the points representing dom molecules in js were distributed centrally in protein like lipid like and lignin like regions while in sh and hb molecules were distributed more dispersedly in protein like condensed aromatic structures and lignin like regions the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons was relatively larger in sh and hb than in the other three groups while the sd and srom molecules were distributed centrally in the condensed aromatic structure and lignin like regions although ft icr ms is not a quantitative technique for analyzing the composition of dom comparing the relative peak intensities of molecules in different samples under the same instrumental conditions can be used for semi quantitative analysis of analogous types of compounds wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 the differences in the composition of these initial dom were more clearly illustrated when the contributions of the relative abundances of the major compound classes were compared fig 2b the lignin like lipid like and protein like structures exhibited higher overall proportions in js in total 82 than in sh in total 44 hb in total 49 sd in total 36 and srom in total 35 the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons was higher in sh 12 and hb 13 than in js 7 sd 4 and srom 7 by contrast the condensed aromatic structures exhibited higher proportions of srom 51 and sd 43 than in the other groups 28 in sh 26 in hb and 4 in js the cho chon chos and chop compounds were major subcategories in the dom samples but the proportion of each subcategory varied among the groups fig 2c these results provided a clear visualization and semi quantitative analysis of the initial dom in different groups and revealed the differences in their compositions at the molecular level 3 2 2 degradation of ngt by activated sludge under different dom composition the aqueous residual concentrations of ngt in abiotic control groups were 6 29 0 43 μg l at the end of the experiment while the residual concentrations of ngt in various experimental groups were less than 5 ng l the abiotic removal mechanisms of ngt might mainly involve sludge adsorption and form complex with dom liu et al 2013 ma and yates 2018 this implied that the loss of ngt in the experimental groups was mainly attributed to biodegradation compared to abiotic effects the degradation kinetics of the ngt were fitted using a one phase exponential decay model the residual plots demonstrated that the decay model did not fit these data of the dom added groups well conversely the ngt degradation in different groups was biphasic which started with a rapid exponential decay followed by a slower decay fig 3 biphasic decay was also observed in the literature for example the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sludge and bisphenol a with laccase margot et al 2013 vermeulen et al 2007 the segmented regression showed that the breakpoint between the two decay phases of js and cl occurred on the first day and sh hb sd and srom occurred on the second day this could be caused by the differences in bioavailability of the carbon sources to the inhabiting microorganisms the time for the initial concentration of ngt to decrease by 90 t 90 in all groups occurred during the rapid decay phase notably the t 90 values of all dom added groups were smaller than those of cl t 90 8 16 h 25 c under the same conditions table s3 this might be due to the presence of dom having complex composition which is relatively resistant to biodegradation and inhibits the activity of microorganisms li et al 2020b t 90 values were significantly different across dom added groups p 0 05 with the t 90 values notably larger at sd 18 h and smaller at js 11 h the differences in t 90 values across the dom added groups might be attributed to the effect of different initial compositions of dom available to microbes zhou et al 2021 the relatively higher protein like lipid like and lignin like content in js might explain its higher ngt degradation rate because they are more biodegradable and can be rapidly utilized by microorganisms to facilitate pollutant removal li et al 2020b by contrast the refractory molecules in the substrate were likely to weaken the ability of microorganisms to degrade mps tan et al 2015 dom molecules of sd contained more condensed aromatic structure compounds that were recalcitrant ohno et al 2014 possibly contributing to its larger t 90 value except for sd the time for the initial concentration of ngt to decrease by 99 t 99 in all groups occurred in the slow decay phase where the t 99 values were significantly different across groups p 0 01 specifically the t 99 value of sh was the smallest at 34 3 h and that of srom was the largest at 136 h these results were considerably different from those of t 90 probably due to the change in the composition of the initial dom as a result of degradation by the microorganisms and its characteristics and reactivity also changed accordingly wang et al 2021 the altered dom composition may be varied among these groups and consequently affect the degradation kinetics of ngt during the 1st and 2nd days of incubation the doc concentration with different wastewater derived doms was decreased by 66 2 4 75 and 26 1 2 91 respectively followed by a comparatively slow decrease of doc fig s1 the loss of doc occurred mainly within the first 1 day of incubation which is consistent with previous studies involving soil derived and algal dom samples hansen et al 2016 nguyen and hur 2011 during the first day incubation labile dom fractions such as proteins sugars and lipids are preferentially utilized by microorganisms promoting the growth and metabolism of the microbial community d andrilli et al 2019 sipler et al 2017 the variation in doc concentration coincided with the change in ngt degradation ngt was removed by 96 8 1 07 on the first day followed by slow removal this might be attributed to the abundant utilization of labile dom by the microbes increasing their abundance and activity and driving the degradation of ngt although the total amount of dom utilized by the microbes differed between the groups a similar pattern of temporal variations in doc concentration was observed in all groups during the experiment fig s1 3 3 mechanism of dom composition effect on ngt degradation by activated sludge 3 3 1 dynamic variations of dom molecular composition to elucidate the variations in dom composition at the molecular level van krevelen plots depicted the removal peak loss resistance peak retention and production new peaks of subclasses such as cho and chon in each group after biodegradation figs 4 and s2 the dom removed during biodegradation in the js sh hb sd and srom biodegradation were mainly distributed in the o c 0 1 0 5 0 3 0 67 0 67 0 5 and h c 1 0 2 0 0 5 1 5 0 7 2 0 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 regions respectively and the resistant and new dom gained after biodegradation were concentratively distributed in the o c 0 3 0 4 0 4 and 0 5 0 67 0 3 and 0 4 and h c 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 and 1 5 2 0 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 0 and 0 7 2 0 regions respectively these results indicate that different changes in dom with different initial compositions occurred in the activated sludge the numerous removed and produced formulas demonstrate that the microbes effectively utilized the initial dom during the degradation of ngt however the utilization preferences of the major subcategory compounds varied in different dom added activated sludge as influenced by the initial dom composition specifically dom compounds with low o c ratios were substantially biotransformed in the sh and hb these dom compounds were mainly distributed within the region of unsaturated hydrocarbons osterholz et al 2016 which accounted for a larger proportion of the initial dom composition in sh and hb than that in the other groups after degradation 1207 and 1006 newly formed molecular formulae were assigned to lignin like substances in sh and hb respectively for js microorganisms mainly utilized protein like lignin like and lipid like structures previous studies indicated that highly biodegradable protein like and lipid like compounds were metabolized by microbes in the short term d andrilli et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 a substantial number of lignin like and condensed aromatic structures were newly generated with the utilization of the initial dom in js wang et al 2020 found that the biodegradability of lignin like substances was lower than that of unsaturated biodegradable lipid like substances microbially produced lignin like and condensed aromatic structures were resistant to re utilization by general microorganisms wang et al 2021 this may be the reason for the short t 90 value but the long t 99 value of ngt in js interestingly condensed aromatic components were utilized in large quantities in sd and srom contrary to in the literature findings that condensed aromatic compounds were recalcitrant schmidt et al 2011 this could be attributed to the large proportion of condensed aromatic structures in the initial sd and srom 43 and 51 respectively leading to favourable growth of microbes capable to utilize condensed aromatic structures zhou et al 2021 previous studies reported a strong effect of dom composition on the structure of bacterial communities in the natural environment bai et al 2019 luo et al 2019 the differences in wastewater dom composition might also lead to different successions of bacterial communities in the activated sludge 3 3 2 dynamic evolution of bacterial communities fig 5 shows the evolution of bacterial communities at the phyla and otu levels induced by differences in dom composition at the phylum level proteobacteria 44 bacteroidetes 11 planctomycetes 8 and chloroflexi 8 were the major bacteria in activated sludge ss as measured by relative abundance on day 1 the abundance and structure of the bacterial community varied with the initial dom composition for example proteobacteria planctomycetes and actinobacteria were the dominant bacteria in js 49 14 and 12 respectively and proteobacteria planctomycetes and bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria in hb 40 16 and10 the difference in the bacterial community further increased during the incubation period fig 5a a similar pattern was also observed at the otu level fig 5b for example on day 1 the abundance of otu40 was highest in js which was eight times higher than that of srom and by day 14 the abundance of otu40 was highest in hb which was two times higher than that of the lowest sh these findings might be mainly attributed to the initial dom composition and variation in dom composition under microbial utilization osterholz et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 the alpha diversity of bacteria was not significantly different among the dom added groups due to the prevalence of proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes and planctomycetes in the different groups it has been reported that these types of bacteria also respond rapidly to other biogenic dom such as synechococcus derived dom zheng et al 2019 and grass dom d andrilli et al 2019 the bacterial diversity in all groups tended to decrease from day 1 to 14 which was closely related to the generation of increasing amounts of substances resistant to bioavailability during dom transformation tanentzap et al 2019 commonly bacterial community variations were limited by the bioavailability of dom zhao et al 2019 the different dom composition provided variable available components which might lead to the succession of microbial communities in different directions tanentzap et al 2019 the biodegradation of ngt was enhanced when the dom composition facilitated the growth of ngt degrading microorganisms interestingly some otus with potential ngt degradation capabilities were found in different groups for example otu73 belongs to γ proteobacteria which was reported to have a strong ngt degradation capability liu et al 2013 the abundance of these ngt degrading bacteria varied considerably among the groups which might be intrinsic to the discrepancy in ngt removal across groups 3 3 3 linkage among dom composition and bacterial species and ngt degradation the complex relationships between dom composition bacterial species and ngt degradation were visualized by network analysis fig 6 the selected datasets were composed of spearman s rank correlation coefficients among otus with a sum of relative abundance greater than 0 1 and m z ions in each subcategory and ngt residual concentration edges in the network were made by direct connections from selected otu nodes to selected m z ion nodes and ngt nodes positive and negative networks were linked to reflect the dom composition effect on ngt degradation by activated sludge sideways with a total of 3677 nodes and 29 105 edges across the network the significant relationships between otu abundance and dom molecule relative intensity or ngt degradation were mainly presentd in the negative network during the rapid phase of ngt degradation figs 6 and s3 at this stage labile substances in the initial dom composition were used to proliferate for certain microbes and the relative intensity of dom molecules was usually reduced by microbial utilization chen et al 2021 vorobev et al 2018 which resulted in a negative correlation between them in the negative network 235 core otus related to dom utilization were identified with the majority of these otu nodes connected to the degraded cho formulas and the chos and chop formulae with low o c ratios fig 6 the top tank otus were associated with the utilization and conversion of compositions that were relatively active in the initial dom figs 2 and 6 seventy three core otus were significantly correlated with ngt degradation these otus could be categorized into 13 classes spreadsheet of which α proteobacteria β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria have been reported to be closely associated with steroid degradation chakraborty et al 2021 yang et al 2016 in addition otu52 was classified as comamonas which was an ngt degrading strain isolated from activated sludge in the literature liu et al 2013 these otus were mainly modulated by lipid like and lignin like compounds in the initial dom composition spreadsheet which might be attributed to the increased microbial abundance by labile compounds in the short term ma and yates 2018 the significant relationships between the successive otu abundance and the generated dom molecule relative intensity or ngt degradation were mainly present in the positive network spreadsheet during the slow phase of ngt degradation figs 6 and s4 the 178 core otus associated with dom production were identified and these otu nodes were mainly connected to the cho chon and chop formulas that accumulated after incubation figs 6 and s4 the initial dom was utilized by microbes to produce abundant microbe derived dom and some microbes could use the metabolites of other microbes wang et al 2021 the labor division and cooperation patterns in bacterial communities facilitate the continuous transformation and metabolism of dom similar phenomena have been observed in the literature on seawater and surface water chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 only 16 otus were significantly associated with ngt degradation in the positive network these otus were supported by lignin like and condensed aromatic structures produced by the microorganisms spreadsheet ten of these otus were significantly associated with ngt degradation in both positive and negative networks commonly known as generalists indicating that they could exploit both the initial dom and microbe derived dom among the 10 generalist otu17874 otu17873 and otu16615 belong to α proteobacteria otu67 belongs to β proteobacteria and otu73 belongs to γ proteobacteria these three subspecies of proteobacteria have been shown to be closely associated with the degradation of ngt liu et al 2013 these results demonstrated that dom composition could affect ngt degradation by regulating microorganisms which is mainly regulated by the initial dom composition although numerous bacteria did not show a significant correlation with ngt degradation the coexistence and interaction of these bacteria with ngt degrading bacteria should not be ignored 3 4 biotransformation of ngt by activated sludge under different dom composition nine major transformation products tps of ngt were detected in the different groups the tentative structures and ms information of the tps are shown in table s4 figs s5 and s6 wherein p3 and p6 were tps from the bacterial degradation of ngt detected in activated sludge for the first time these tps were identified to be the same among the groups one possible reason is that the different microorganisms generated the same tps of ngt liu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 notably the relative abundance of these tps varied considerably among the groups fig s4 two tps 5α dihydrotestosterone and 4 androstene 3 17 dione were further quantified by standards and the results indicated that these two tps exhibited large discrepancies at various sampling time points in different groups fig 7 a for example at day 1 the concentration of 5α dihydrotestosterone was higher in hb which was more than twice that detected in sd at day 3 the concentration of 5α dihydrotestosterone was higher in sh which was nearly six times higher than that detected in srom these results imply that differences in dom composition also played an essential role in the occurrence of tps in the activated sludge the general pathways of ngt biotransformation in dom added groups were tentatively proposed where hydrogenation dehydrogenation hydroxylation and redox could be major mechanisms fig 7b briefly two hydrogen atoms were removed from the c6 7 position of ring b to form p1 and two hydrogen atoms were added to the c4 5 position of ring a to form p2 studies have pointed out that rings a and b of steroids are prone to be hydrogenated and dehydrogenated under the action of microorganisms liu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 the ketone group at the c3 position of ring a of p2 was reduced to hydroxyl by microorganisms to form p5 previous studies have widely detected p5 an important metabolite of ngt in monkeys sisenwine et al 1979 the hydroxylation reaction occurred at the c16 position of ring d of ngt to form p3 and the c2 position of ring a of p3 was hydroxylated to form p6 the p3 and p6 metabolites of ngt were detected in rhesus monkeys sisenwine et al 1979 but have not been reported in activated sludge the ring d of p1 underwent a side chain break and methylation reaction and the methylation and hydrogenation reactions occurred on ring b to form p4 studies have also pointed out that progesterone can be converted into androgens via bacterial processes yu et al 2018 two hydrogen atoms were added to c4 5 position of ring a of p4 to form p7 product p8 was formed by the dehydrogenation of ring a and hydroxylation of ring d of p7 which may also be formed by the oxidation of hydroxyl to ketone at the c17 position of p4 ring b of p8 broke and underwent a redox reaction at positions c9 10 and c5 6 to form p9 3 5 implication and limitations this study investigated the intrinsic link between dom composition and ngt degradation in wastewater treatment systems in unprecedented detail the combination of high throughput sequencing and ft icr ms and network analysis provided insights into the complex correlations between dom molecular composition and microbial communities and ngt degradation from both a molecular and species perspective our results emphasized that dom composition can influence ngt degradation and transformation by modulating the bacterial community in activated sludge which was affected by the initial composition of dom exploration of the effect of dom composition on the biodegradation of mps will facilitate the design and operation of wastewater treatment systems to achieve high stable removal of mps from wastewater tan et al 2015 wang et al 2020 however the current study has limitations and is only a first step towards this goal a major limitation is the complexity and the semi quantitative data on the molecular composition of dom limited by the dom extraction efficiency tanentzap et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the unknown ionization efficiency in the mass spectra chen et al 2021 and the invisibility of the highly reduced dark dom molecules in the window muscarella et al 2019 ft icr ms can only capture part of the dom molecules which may not represent the entire dom pool the dom composition variation analysis was also based on the hypothesis of equal extractability of compositions in all samples zhao et al 2019 additionally generic primers utilized for the 16s rrna gene region usually overestimate specific taxonomic groups such as gram negative bacteria parada et al 2016 despite these limitations and uncertainties this study still provides new insights into how dom composition affects the degradation of mps in activated sludge 4 conclusions in summary this work investigated the effect of wastewater derived dom composition on ngt degradation by activated sludge from the perspective of molecular characteristics of dom and bacterial community interactions the results indicate that discrepancies in dom composition contributed to differences in the kinetics of ngt degradation by activated sludge network analysis revealed the intrinsic relationship that dom molecules affected ngt degradation via regulation of microbes emphasizing that the core otus associated with ngt degradation were mainly regulated by the initial composition of dom moreover the composition of dom also had important effect on the concentrations or relative abundances of ngt tps in the activated sludge further strengthening of mp removal in wastewater treatment systems by modifying dom such as electrochemically modified dom composition could be considered in the future

16087,to extract lithium from salt lake brine involves a process of separation and concentration after separating lithium from brine the lithium ion concentration is generally a few hundred mg l which is far below the required 20 30 g l as li before precipitation as lithium carbonate the concentration step of a lithium enriched brine is crucial but highly energy intensive spontaneous forward osmosis fo technology offers the possibility for concentrating lithium ions with low energy because the concentrating process involves both feed and draw solution with very high salinity it is highly desirable to have a high performance fo membrane with a low structural parameter as well as a high rejection to ions in this work thin polyethylene separator supported fo pe fo membranes were prepared and post treated stepwise with benzyl alcohol ba and hydraulic compaction the effect of the post treatment on the fo performance was systematically analyzed excellent fo performance was achieved the water flux and reverse salt flux selectivity were 66 3 lmh and 5 25 l g respectively when the active layer is oriented towards the 0 5 m nacl draw solution with deionized water as the feed to the best of our knowledge this fo flux is the highest ever reported in the open literature under similar test conditions applied in concentrating lithium enriched brine the membrane showed superior water flux using saturated mgcl2 as draw solution a new fo model was established to simulate the water flux during the concentration process with good agreement with the experimental results the promising results using pe fo membrane for lithium enrichment opens a new frontier for the potential application of fo membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis membrane polyethylene lithium post treatment 1 introduction lithium li is a vital element with diverse applications including nuclear fusion pharmaceutical production chemical and metallurgical industries and particularly li ion batteries dunn et al 2011 grosjean et al 2012 tarascon and armand 2001 most of the exploitable lithium reserve worldwide is present in salt lake brines particularly in china where extraction of lithium from brines has become the key lithium supply xu et al 2021 extraction of lithium from brine consists of a multi separation concentration process nanofiltration electrodialysis or lithium ion sieves for separation of lithium from complicated brine concentration of the lithium enriched brine by reverse osmosis ro or distillation before chemical precipitation to lithium carbonate xu et al 2021 one of the key issues is that the concentration stage to remove water from lithium enriched brine is highly energy intensive for chemical precipitation of lithium the threshold li concentration is required to reach 20 30 g l which is far too high for any ro system because of the high osmotic pressure the current practice is to combine ro and distillation at a sacrifice of energy cost wu et al 2017 because ro could reach 5 6 g l li about 70 75 water still has to be removed from the brine to reach at least 20 g l of li this stage generally consumes most of the energy in the whole lithium extraction process to largely reduce the energy cost spontaneous forward osmosis fo technology has recently been proposed li et al 2018 pham et al 2020 the viability of fo technology is guaranteed by the free abundant mgcl2 crystals precipitated during the evaporation process for the production of kcl in salt lake brine a saturated mgcl2 solution has an extremely high osmotic pressure 1450 bar allowing the possibility to utilize fo technology to concentrate the lithium enriched brine forwards osmosis is driven by an osmotic pressure gradient across an fo membrane cath et al 2006 if the draw solution is free and no recovery is required as in this case fo would find the best application in lithium extraction from brine shaffer et al 2015 in chinese salt lakes there is abundant crystal salt of mgcl2 or saturated brine with mgcl2 if using either of them after fo the diluted brine can be directly discharged to the system to regain the osmotic power without any negative impact on the ecological system thus the success of fo in lithium brine concentration lies in high performance fo membranes which have high rejections to lithium and magnesium ions and high water fluxes or very low structural parameters shaffer et al 2015 very few studies have reported the use of fo to concentrate salt lake brines li et al 2018 pham et al 2020 zhou 2017 however the commercial fo membranes have not been designed for such high salinity and frequently showed very low flux and relatively high reverse salt flux li et al 2018 pham et al 2020 the commercial pe porous membranes which are commonly utilized as lithium ion battery separators have recently been attempted to fabricate the pe supported fo pe fo membranes kwon et al 2017 kwon et al 2019 li et al 2021 the high porosity and pore connectivity combined with the extreme thinness of the pe support endows it with a very low structural parameter thus remarkably enhancing the fo water flux kwon et al 2017 superior mechanical strength and chemical inertness of the pe support ensures the durable operability of the pe fo membrane ryou et al 2011 furthermore the commercial availability at a low cost of the pe support increases the commercial viability of the pe fo membranes kwon et al 2017 ryou et al 2011 however the performance of the pe fo membrane in a practical application has not been evaluated it could be expected that the pe fo membrane would have good performance in concentrating lithium enriched brine in spite of the above merits of the pe support the hydrophobic character of pe prevents the formation of an integral and defect free active layer by interfacial polymerization ip various methods have been employed to hydrophilize the pe separators including hydrophilic coating with polymers kwon et al 2021 kwon et al 2019 li et al 2021 ryou et al 2011 xue et al 2020 and particles choi et al 2010 qin et al 2018 shin and kim 2013 surface grafting kim et al 2009 ko et al 2004 and oxygen plasma treatment jin et al 2017 kwon et al 2017 park et al 2018a park et al 2018b shin et al 2020 shin et al 2019 among them the oxygen plasma is a promising technique with the advantages of time and energy saving simplicity environmental friendliness and good treatment effect etc jin et al 2017 yan et al 2015 to improve the water permeability of a tfc membrane treating tfc polyamide membranes with an activating solvent e g dimethylformamide dmf dimethyl sulfoxide dmso isopropanol and ethanol has been found to be a simple and effective approach kulkarni et al 1996 mukherjee et al 1996 shin et al 2020 shin et al 2019 shin et al 2021 werber et al 2017 among the activating solvents benzyl alcohol ba was found to greatly enhance the water permeability of an ro membrane without compromising the nacl rejection shin et al 2019 however the effect of ba treatment on fo performance is not yet clarified the unique properties of fo relative to the pressure driven ro such as the thinner support layer water transport driven by osmotic pressure rather than hydraulic pressure and the presence of internal concentration polarization icp and reverse salt diffusion make it meaningful to explore the effects of ba treatment on fo membrane performance in this paper we report for the first time the development of a highly permselective pe fo membrane for concentrating lithium enriched brine the pe fo membrane was prepared by first hydrophilizing the pe support via oxygen plasma followed by interfacial polymerization furthermore a two step process comprising ba treatment and hydraulic compaction was utilized to post treat the membrane for improving the water flux and reverse salt flux selectivity the pe fo membrane was then applied in concentrating lithium enriched brine an fo model simulating water flux during the lithium concentration process was developed it is expected that this novel pe separator supported fo membrane will find extensive application in the concentration stage of the lithium extraction processes and potentially other high energy concentrating applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals m phenylene

lithium ion battery separators were received from qingdao zhongkehualian advanced materials corp ltd 2 2 membrane preparation the pristine pe support is hydrophobic and difficult to be wetted by the aqueous phase during interfacial polymerization ip therefore oxygen plasma modification was first conducted to improve its hydrophilicity by generating oxygen containing functional groups on the pe support a plasma system ion series plasma processing systemstm pva tepla germany was used for the modification with the power of 50 w modification duration of 1 min and chamber pressure of 500 mtorr the polyamide active layer was formed on top of the plasma treated pe support via interfacial polymerization the pe support was initially immersed in an aqueous solution of 2 0 wt mpd and 0 05 wt sds for 5 min after draining off the excess aqueous solution an air knife was used to remove the residual aqueous solution layer on the surface the saturated support was then immersed into an organic solution of 0 15 wt tmc in hexane for 3 min resulting in an ultra thin polyamide film over the pe support after removing excess organic solution the membrane was rinsed with hexane to wash away residual reagents the as prepared tfc membrane was then dried in the ambient for 2 min dry cured in the oven at 80 c for 5 min and stored in di water the prepared pe fo membranes were post treated stepwise by ba and hydraulic compaction in the ba treatment step the membrane was immersed in a ba solution at ambient temperature for 10 min and then gently and thoroughly rinsed with di water in the hydraulic compaction step the membrane was compacted in an ro filtration system described below with di water at an applied pressure of 10 bar and a temperature of 25 c for at least 24 h to investigate separately the effects of the above two treatment steps two other membranes were prepared one only treated by ba and the other only by hydraulic compaction the pe fo membranes without post treatment and post treated by ba hydraulic compaction and both of them were denoted as pristine ba hc and ba hc respectively as depicted in fig 1 2 3 membrane performance characterization 2 3 1 ro performance the water permeability coefficient a salt permeability coefficient b and observed salt rejection r of the membranes were evaluated using a cross flow ro filtration system sterlitech corporation with an effective membrane area of 34 cm2 the tests were performed at a cross flow velocity of 25 cm s and temperature of 25 0 5 c the a value was determined at 10 bar which was calculated by dividing the pure water flux by the applied pressure the salt rejection and salt permeability coefficient were measured by using 1 0 g l salt solution as the feed solution with the applied pressure maintained at 10 bar three salts namely nacl mgcl2 and licl were used separately in the tests r was calculated based on the salt concentration in the bulk feed c f and permeate c p r 1 c p c f 100 b was calculated according to baker 2012 mulder 1996 1 b j w 1 r r exp j w k where j w is the permeate flux k is the mass transfer coefficient for the cross flow channel of the membrane cell and was calculated from correlations for rectangular cell geometry mccutcheon et al 2006 2 3 2 fo performance the fo performance of the membrane was evaluated based on the fo water flux j v and reverse salt flux selectivity j v j s using a custom lab scale cross flow fo system depicted in fig s1 the fo membrane cell has rectangular channels with dimensions of 5 0 cm in length 2 0 cm in width and 2 mm in depth the membranes were tested in two different orientations with either the active layer facing the feed solution fs referred to as the al fs orientation or facing the draw solution ds referred to as the al ds orientation the fs and ds at 25 0 5 c were circulated co currently at a flow rate of 600 ml min corresponding to a cross flow velocity of 25 cm s nacl or mgcl2 with varied concentrations and di water were used as ds and fs respectively a computer connected to an electronic balance cp2002 ohaus instrument co ltd recorded the weight increase of the ds which was the weight of water permeated into the ds during the fo process the fo water flux j v was calculated from the weight of permeation water at the initial stage of the fo process 2 j v δ m s m δ t ρ w where δm represents the weight of permeation water collected over a selected time δt in the fo process s m is the effective membrane surface area ρ w is the density of water the reverse salt flux j s from the ds to the fs was determined from the salt content increase in the fs 3 j s δ c t v t s m δ t where c t is the salt concentration in the fs at the end of the fo test which is determined based on the conductivity measurement using a calibration curve for a single salt solution v t is the fs volume at the end of the test δ c t v t is the change of the amount of the salt before and after the test or the salt diffused from the ds to the fs the reverse salt flux selectivity j v j s was determined as the ratio of the fo water flux and the reverse salt flux 2 3 3 determination of the structural parameter the structural parameter of the membrane support s determines the extent of icp in fo it is defined as the product of the support layer thickness ts and tortuosity τ divided by the support layer porosity ε i e s tsτ ε gerstandt et al 2008 lee et al 1981 yip et al 2010 the fo test for the determination of s was conducted using 0 5 m nacl ds and di water fs in al fs mode the structural parameter is calculated by loeb et al 1997 yip et al 2010 4 s d j v ln b a π d s b j v a π f m where d is the diffusion coefficient of the draw solute nacl π d s is the osmotic pressure of the ds at the support

is the osmotic pressure of the bulk ds which is calculated via the van t hoff equation k is the mass transfer coefficient of the draw solute nacl for the cross flow channel of the membrane cell and was calculated from correlations for rectangular cell geometry mccutcheon et al 2006 2 4 concentrating lithium enriched brine by fo the same fo device for characterization of fo performance was adopted for the lithium concentration experiments to reduce the experimental time and facilitate experimental operation batch experiments were carried out to simulate the continuous concentration process of lithium enriched brine by varying the feed licl concentration as 0 1 1 0 and 3 0 m and using saturated mgcl2 as the ds other operating conditions were the same as fo performance characterization the initial water flux of each fo test was measured 2 5 instrumental analysis field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jsm 7800f prime jeol japan was used for analyzing the membrane morphology the contact angle of the membrane surface was evaluated using a contact angle goniometer dropmeter a 200 maist china the electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar austria was used to measure the zeta potential of the membrane surface atomic force microscopy afm ntegra spectra ii nt mdt russia was used to analyze the surface morphology and roughness of the membrane 3 modeling of lithium concentrating process to study the concentration process for lithium enriched brine an fo model was developed to calculate the water flux against the lithium concentration the osmotic pressure or solute concentration at the active layer differs from the bulk osmotic pressure or concentration due to the presence of the concentration polarization schematics of the osmotic pressure profiles across an fo membrane in al fs and al ds are shown in fig 2 a and 2b respectively the fo water flux j v across the active layer is given by baker 2012 5 j v a π d m π f m where a is the water permeability coefficient of the membrane π d m and π f m are the osmotic pressures of the ds and fs respectively at the active layer fig 2 the reflection coefficient is assumed to be 1 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 although the osmotic pressure can be approximated using the van t hoff equation for a dilute solution the accuracy is poor for a highly saline solution for the lithium concentrating process the van t hoff equation greatly underestimates the osmotic pressures of saturated mgcl2 ds 5 m at 25 c and highly concentrated licl fs 2 m as shown in fig s3 therefore polynomial fitting relationships were used to precisely calculate the osmotic pressures the osmotic pressures of mgcl2 licl and nacl as a function of molarity were first calculated using the oli analyzer software then the data points were fitted with four order polynomial curves as shown in fig s3 the corresponding polynomial expressions were used for calculating the osmotic pressures and are provided in section s2

the supplementary information for the complete derivation for eqs 9 11 in the lithium concentration experiments licl and mgcl2 are used as fs and ds respectively the diffusion coefficients of mgcl2 and licl as a function of concentration were calculated according to the method described in section s2 of the supplementary information and the results are shown in fig s4 and table s2 based on the variation range of diffusion coefficients an intermediate value of 1 4 10 9 m2 s was used for both mgcl2 and licl in the fo water flux simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 membrane structures and properties fig 3 presents the sem and afm images of the pe supports and pe fo membranes the pristine pe support has a highly porous structure fig 3a1 a3 with an overall porosity of 40 data from the manufacturer and a surface porosity of 33 fig s5 the membrane thickness is 9 μm fig 3a2 significantly thinner than conventional polysulfone psf support tiraferri et al 2011 yip et al 2010 the pristine pe support has a flat surface with a root mean square roughness r q of 20 5 nm fig 3a4 despite the excellent structural characteristics of the pe support the hydrophobic nature of pe prevents the formation of an intact and defect free active layer by ip the o2 plasma treatment drastically improved the hydrophilicity of the pe support as evidenced by the markedly reduced water contact angle from 115 to 67 fig 3a1 and b1 double sided plasma treatment makes the other side of the pe support similarly hydrophilic with a contact angle of 63 data not shown in fig 3 appropriate support hydrophilicity is critical for fo membrane performance a hydrophobic support is difficult to be infiltrated by the aqueous phase thus difficult to form an intact and defect free active layer while highly hydrophilic supports prevent the formation of high performance active layers due to the inhibition of mpd diffusion by polar groups ghosh and hoek 2009 park et al 2018a additionally hydrophobic or partially hydrophobic support that cannot be fully wetted when exposed to water increases the structural parameter by decreasing the effective porosity and increasing the effective tortuosity of the support layer thus aggravates icp mccutcheon and elimelech 2008 after o2 plasma treatment the pore becomes slightly larger due to the chain scission fig 3b1 and the highly open and connected pore structure of the support is maintained fig 3b1 b3 additionally plasma treatment resulted in a rougher support surface r q 40 8 nm fig 3b4 probably because plasma etching increased the roughness of the fibril and the inhomogeneity of the surface an active layer with the characteristic ridge and valley morphology is formed on the treated pe support fig 3c1 and c3 the large leaf like structures could be observed which may originate from the relatively large support pores peng et al 2022 the active layer comprises a continuous 200 300 nm base from which the ridge and valley structures extend outward fig 3c3 the formation of the base layer could be ascribed to the large surface pores and high surface porosity of the pe support lu et al 2015 due to the large variation in the size of the protruding polyamide structures the total thickness of the active layer at different locations shows great heterogeneity varying from 200 nm to 1000 nm fig 3c3 this leads to a rough surface of the active layer with a roughness of 83 8 nm fig 3c4 the active layer is moderately hydrophilic with a contact angle of 50 typical for tfc membranes formed using aromatic mpd and tmc monomers 50 60 werber et al 2016b after hydraulic compaction the morphology roughness and hydrophilicity of the active layer surface as well as the total thickness of the membrane did not change noticeably fig 3d1 d2 and d4 the slightly thinner base fig 3d3 of the active layer may be due to the hydraulic compaction the leaf like structures became flatter and less well defined after ba treatment fig 3e1 perhaps swelling by ba reduced the modulus of the polyamide layer shin et al 2019 thus prompting the softened large leaf like structures to fall down and stack together the ba treatment resulted in a more uniform thickness fig 3e3 and smoother surface r q 73 4 nm fig 3e4 of the active layer which is in accordance with fig 3e1 and the above speculation in addition the partial dissolution of the polyamide oligomers may also contribute to the roughness decline shin et al 2019 more pronounced deformation of the protruding polyamide structures could be observed on the surface of the ba hc membrane fig 3f1 which can be attributed to the ease of deformation of the polyamide layer with reduced modulus when experiencing hydraulic pressure the roughness of the ba hc membrane r q 72 2 nm is slightly reduced relative to the ba membrane fig 3f4 additionally post treatments didn t notably vary the hydrophilicity of the active layer fig 3c1 d1 e1 and f1 and the total thickness of the pe support fig 3c2 d2 e2 and f2 the surface charge characteristics of the pe supports and pe fo membranes were evaluated using zeta potential measurements as presented in fig 4 as ph increases the zeta potentials of all the membranes transform from positive to negative with the isoelectric point iep ranging from 2 5 to 4 5 the strong negative surface charge of the chemically inert pristine pe support at neutral ph may be attributable to the preferential adsorption of hydroxide ions which is widely used to explain the negative zeta potentials at hydrophobic surfaces uematsu et al 2020 the surface of the plasma treated pe support is even more negatively charged under neutral conditions which originates from the oxygen containing functional groups introduced by the oxygen plasma treatment matoušek et al 2016 syromotina et al 2016 in comparison with the plasma treated pe support the pristine membrane i e the pristine pe fo membrane without post treatment has a higher iep of 4 0 and much less negative zeta potential of 36 mv at neutral ph the positive zeta potential at ph 4 0 is due to the protonation of amino groups at ph 4 0 the membrane surface is more negatively charged at elevated ph because of the deprotonation of an increasing number of carboxyl groups in addition three different post treatments i e the hydraulic compaction ba treatment and their combination did not noticeably alter the zeta potential of the pe fo membrane over the entire ph range the negative zeta potentials of the pe fo membranes at ph 7 indicate the electrostatic repulsions to anions in neutral environments 4 2 separation properties of the pe fo membranes 4 2 1 transport properties and structural parameter table 1 lists the separation characteristics of the pristine hc ba and ba hc membranes including the water permeability coefficients a salt rejections r salt permeability coefficients b and water salt permselectivities a b the pristine and ba membranes were not compacted whereas both hc and ba hc membranes were fully compacted at 10 bar the pristine membrane exhibits a high water permeability of 4 5 lmh bar which may be primarily due to its highly porous pe support on the one hand the large surface porosity of the pe support shortens the water diffusion path through the active layer on the other hand the highly open and connected pore structure of the pe support is more conducive to water transport additionally the membrane shows moderate rejections for nacl licl and mgcl2 after hydraulic compaction the water and salt permeability coefficients were reduced with a greater reduction in the salt permeability coefficients which led to an increase in water salt permselectivities in addition the salt rejections were improved from 97 to 98 the above changes after compaction are consistent with the observations of pendergast et al pendergast et al 2010 and follow the permeability selectivity trade off namely an increase in the water permeability comes with an even greater increase in the solute permeability geise et al 2011 werber et al 2016b which may be the result of the polyamide network densification caused by hydraulic pressure inversely the ba treatment increased the water and salt permeability coefficients with a greater increase in the salt permeability coefficients thus leading to a decrease in the water salt permselectivities and salt rejections probably the ba treatment swelled and loosened the polyamide network contrary to the compaction induced densification of the polyamide network additionally the ba treatment could partially dissolve the small polyamide molecular fragments at the outermost polyamide active layer that contributes little to separation but hampers water transport jimenez solomon et al 2013 shin et al 2019 shin et al 2021 which could also enhance the water permeability hydraulic compaction altered the transport properties of the ba membrane in the same trend as the pristine membrane i e decreased the water and salt permeability coefficients and increased the water salt permselectivities and salt rejections but to a greater extent this could be explained by the reduced modulus of the polyamide layer after being swollen by ba leading to a greater deformation densification of the active layer after compaction shin et al 2019 in comparison with the pristine membrane the ba hc membrane exhibits a higher water permeability of 5 6 lmh bar that outperforms most commercial fo and ro membranes kwon et al 2017 werber et al 2016b furthermore the ba hc membrane displays higher salt rejections 98 and water salt permselectivities thus overcoming the performance trade off the breaking of the trade off can be attributed to the partial dissolution of the polyamide oligomers by ba described above the above data demonstrate the positive effect of ba treatment followed by hydraulic compaction on membrane transport properties the structural parameter is a measure of the effective diffusive distance of a solute through a porous media yip et al 2010 the prepared membranes have low structural parameters of 140 μm lower than most of the commercial membranes and membranes reported in other studies kwon et al 2019 shaffer et al 2015 wang et al 2018 this indicates a low salt transport resistance in the pe support thus low icp and high fo water flux 4 2 2 effect of post treatment on fo performance fig 5 shows the fo water flux j v and reverse salt flux selectivity j v j s of the pe fo membranes without post treatment and with different types of post treatment in al fs and al ds orientations using di water as fs and 0 5 m nacl fig 5a and c or mgcl2 fig 5b and d as ds the j v j s represents the volume of water permeated per mass of draw solute lost and it follows a simple relationship based on the van t hoff equation j v j s anrt b where n is the van t hoff dissociation factor r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature phillip et al 2010 tang et al 2010 a membrane with a higher water salt permselectivity a b will have a higher reverse salt flux selectivity j v j s in an fo characterization test a higher j v j s value means less feed and draw solute loss and purer concentrated feed solution in fo concentration ba treatment dramatically enhanced the fo water flux fig 5a and b this may be ascribed to the fact that ba treatment considerably increased the water permeability table 1 by partially dissolving the low crosslinked loose polyamide structures and swelling the polyamide network to be looser and more open jimenez solomon et al 2013 shin et al 2019 shin et al 2021 however the significant increase in j v is accompanied by a marked decrease in j v j s fig 5c and d which is due to the significant decrease in water salt permselectivity a b table 1 after further post treatment of hydraulic compaction based on ba treatment j v j s is improved considerably relative to the ba membrane fig 5c and d which is due to the significant structural densification of the polyamide network under hydraulic pressure and the resulting significant increase in water salt permselectivity a b table 1 unlike the significant increase in j v j s the hydraulic compaction has little impact on j v fig 5a and b which could be explained by two counteracting factors on one hand the decrease in water permeability results in a decrease in fo water flux on the other hand the decrease in salt permeability coefficient inhibits the reverse salt diffusion which increases the effective osmotic pressure difference across the active layer and thus increases the water flux we also evaluated the effect of the stand alone post treatment of hydraulic compaction compared with the pristine membrane hydraulic compaction slightly enhances the fo water flux fig 5a and b despite a decrease in water permeability coefficient table 1 the water flux increase could also be explained by the compaction induced decrease in the salt permeability coefficient and the resulting increase in the effective osmotic pressure difference meanwhile hydraulic compaction leads to an increase in j v j s fig 5c and d which agrees with the increase of the water salt permselectivity a b furthermore j v j s of the hc membrane is lower than the ba hc membrane which is also in line with the lower a b values of the hc membrane as shown in table 1 compared with 0 5 m nacl ds fig 5a higher water flux values can be observed for 0 5 m mgcl2 ds in the al ds orientation fig 5b which is due to the higher osmotic pressure of 0 5 m mgcl2 39 4 bar by oli analyzer software than the same molar concentration of nacl 23 4 bar by oli analyzer software while in al fs the two draw solutions generate similar water fluxes which is mainly due to the smaller diffusion coefficient of mgcl2 than nacl and therefore more severe icp using 0 5 m mgcl2 as the ds furthermore the 0 5 m mgcl2 ds corresponds to a significantly higher j v j s fig 5c and d indicating less leakage of mgcl2 than nacl to conclude the hydraulic compaction or ba treatment has a small or even detrimental effect on the fo performance nonetheless the two step post treatment method of ba treatment followed by hydraulic compaction dramatically enhances the fo water flux and the reverse salt flux selectivity take 0 5 m nacl ds as an example the water fluxes of the ba hc membrane in al fs and al ds are as high as 42 3 and 66 3 lmh respectively a significant increase of 38 and 48 over the pristine membrane to the best of our knowledge the fo flux values are the highest ever reported in the open literature under similar test conditions furthermore compared with the pristine membrane the reverse salt flux selectivities of the ba hc membrane in al fs and al ds increase by 76 and 46 reaching 4 6 and 5 3 l g respectively considerably higher than those of the commercial hti tfc and hti cta membranes kwon et al 2017 the dramatic water flux improvement can be attributed to the ba induced dissolution of the polyamide loose structure and the compaction induced decreased salt permeability coefficient the significant increase in reverse salt flux selectivity lies in the enhanced water salt permselectivity due to hydraulic compaction and dissolution of the polyamide loose structure section 4 2 1 4 2 3 fo performance of the ba hc membrane fig 6 depicts the experimental and theoretical j v and j v j s of the ba hc membranes in both orientations as a function of ds concentration as shown in fig 6a and b the greater ds concentration leads to higher j v as a result of the increased osmotic driving force the increasing rate of j v with the ds concentration slows down due to the more severe concentration polarization at elevated ds concentration the j v in the al ds orientation is higher than that in the al fs orientation owing to the less severe concentration polarization despite the significantly higher osmotic pressure of mgcl2 than nacl at the same molarity fig s3 mgcl2 ds produces similar water flux in al fs and only slightly higher water flux in al ds the former is due to the more serious icp in the case of mgcl2 ds resulting from the lower diffusion coefficient of mgcl2 than nacl as illustrated earlier the latter is owing to the more severe ecp stemming from the higher water flux ecp depends exponentially on fo water flux section 3 together with the lower diffusion coefficient of mgcl2 in the case of mgcl2 ds the fo water fluxes in both orientations were calculated using the model developed in section 3 as shown in fig 6a and b the calculated water fluxes agree well with the experimental results demonstrating the validity of the model the theoretical j v j s was also calculated based on the relationship j v j s anrt b and should be independent of the membrane orientation and ds concentration phillip et al 2010 the calculated j v j s are 14 4 and 17 6 l g for the nacl and mgcl2 ds respectively as shown in fig 6c and d the experimental results are notably lower than the calculated values this may be attributable to the enhanced shielding effect of counterions on the negative charge of the membrane surface viz decreased zeta potential in a salt solution with a higher concentration resulting in a weakened co ion exclusion and an increased salt permeability fig 7 compares the ba hc membrane prepared in the current work with other fo membranes reported in the literature the ba hc membrane exhibits the highest fo water flux in both orientations with a relatively high reverse salt flux selectivity the high water flux is attributed to the excellent water permeability and salt rejection of the membrane as well as the low effective structural parameter of the plasma treated pe support from the perspective of permeability selectivity trade off increasing the hydraulic pressure in the compaction operation may further densify the active layer thus leading to a decrease in the water permeability and an increase in the water salt permselectivity and reverse salt flux selectivity 4 3 concentrating lithium enriched brine by fo the ba hc membrane was evaluated in lithium concentration using saturated mgcl2 as ds fig 8 presents the fo water flux as a function of licl concentration in the al fs and al ds orientations the theoretical fo water fluxes in both orientations were calculated using the model developed in section 3 as presented by the solid lines in fig 8 the calculated fluxes closely match the experimental results demonstrating the validity of the model in predicting the fo water flux in lithium concentration the fo water flux decreases with increasing licl concentration due to the reduction in the osmotic driving force the water flux decline slows down as licl concentration increases the water flux in al ds is higher than that in al fs due to the less severe concentration polarization in al ds nevertheless as licl concentration increases the water flux declines more rapidly in al ds this is due to the fact that the concentration polarization on the feed side has an increasingly pronounced influence on the fo water flux with increasing licl concentration and the concentrative icp that occurs on the feed side in al ds is more severe than the concentrative ecp in al fs the ba hc membrane exhibits a high water flux during lithium concentration for feed waters with high total dissolved solids tds water fluxes in fo are generally very low mcginnis et al 2013 werber et al 2016a by contrast according to the simulation results the fo water fluxes of the ba hc membrane are still above 15 lmh in both orientations at a licl concentration up to 5 m fig 8a the high water flux is ascribed to the excellent fo property of the ba hc membrane as well as the high osmotic pressure of the mgcl2 ds to further clarify the contribution of the ba hc membrane a commercial fo membrane was compared water fluxes of the commercial hti tfc membrane during licl concentration were calculated using its separation properties i e water permeability coefficient and structural parameter measured by kwon et al kwon et al 2017 it is clear from fig 8 that the ba hc membrane exhibits significantly higher water fluxes than the commercial tfc membrane in both orientations demonstrating the remarkable superiority of the ba hc membrane in terms of the fo water flux in lithium concentration which will reduce the capital and operating costs although al fs orientation is generally more recommended in real fo applications to avoid the more intractable internal fouling that occurs within the porous support she et al 2016 the al ds orientation may be preferable in the case of the lithium concentration due to the foulant free feed solution and the higher water flux 5 conclusions in this study fo membranes were prepared using commercial porous pe separators as the supports the novel two step post treatment method of ba treatment followed by hydraulic compaction dramatically enhanced the fo water flux and the reverse salt flux selectivity the alterations of the intrinsic transport properties i e water and salt permeability coefficient and water salt permselectivity resulting from the ba induced dissolution of the loose polyamide structure and hydraulic compaction are responsible for the fo performance improvement the fo membrane exhibited a high water flux and reverse salt flux selectivity of 66 3 lmh and 5 25 l g respectively in al ds using 0 5 m nacl as the draw and di water as the feed furthermore the membrane showed a high water flux in concentrating lithium enriched brine using saturated mgcl2 as draw solution the fo water flux in lithium concentration was also accurately predicted by developing a new fo model we expect the results and methodology in this work will provide a theoretical basis for further research on the utilization of pe fo membranes in concentrating highly saline feed solutions in various industries

16087,to extract lithium from salt lake brine involves a process of separation and concentration after separating lithium from brine the lithium ion concentration is generally a few hundred mg l which is far below the required 20 30 g l as li before precipitation as lithium carbonate the concentration step of a lithium enriched brine is crucial but highly energy intensive spontaneous forward osmosis fo technology offers the possibility for concentrating lithium ions with low energy because the concentrating process involves both feed and draw solution with very high salinity it is highly desirable to have a high performance fo membrane with a low structural parameter as well as a high rejection to ions in this work thin polyethylene separator supported fo pe fo membranes were prepared and post treated stepwise with benzyl alcohol ba and hydraulic compaction the effect of the post treatment on the fo performance was systematically analyzed excellent fo performance was achieved the water flux and reverse salt flux selectivity were 66 3 lmh and 5 25 l g respectively when the active layer is oriented towards the 0 5 m nacl draw solution with deionized water as the feed to the best of our knowledge this fo flux is the highest ever reported in the open literature under similar test conditions applied in concentrating lithium enriched brine the membrane showed superior water flux using saturated mgcl2 as draw solution a new fo model was established to simulate the water flux during the concentration process with good agreement with the experimental results the promising results using pe fo membrane for lithium enrichment opens a new frontier for the potential application of fo membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis membrane polyethylene lithium post treatment 1 introduction lithium li is a vital element with diverse applications including nuclear fusion pharmaceutical production chemical and metallurgical industries and particularly li ion batteries dunn et al 2011 grosjean et al 2012 tarascon and armand 2001 most of the exploitable lithium reserve worldwide is present in salt lake brines particularly in china where extraction of lithium from brines has become the key lithium supply xu et al 2021 extraction of lithium from brine consists of a multi separation concentration process nanofiltration electrodialysis or lithium ion sieves for separation of lithium from complicated brine concentration of the lithium enriched brine by reverse osmosis ro or distillation before chemical precipitation to lithium carbonate xu et al 2021 one of the key issues is that the concentration stage to remove water from lithium enriched brine is highly energy intensive for chemical precipitation of lithium the threshold li concentration is required to reach 20 30 g l which is far too high for any ro system because of the high osmotic pressure the current practice is to combine ro and distillation at a sacrifice of energy cost wu et al 2017 because ro could reach 5 6 g l li about 70 75 water still has to be removed from the brine to reach at least 20 g l of li this stage generally consumes most of the energy in the whole lithium extraction process to largely reduce the energy cost spontaneous forward osmosis fo technology has recently been proposed li et al 2018 pham et al 2020 the viability of fo technology is guaranteed by the free abundant mgcl2 crystals precipitated during the evaporation process for the production of kcl in salt lake brine a saturated mgcl2 solution has an extremely high osmotic pressure 1450 bar allowing the possibility to utilize fo technology to concentrate the lithium enriched brine forwards osmosis is driven by an osmotic pressure gradient across an fo membrane cath et al 2006 if the draw solution is free and no recovery is required as in this case fo would find the best application in lithium extraction from brine shaffer et al 2015 in chinese salt lakes there is abundant crystal salt of mgcl2 or saturated brine with mgcl2 if using either of them after fo the diluted brine can be directly discharged to the system to regain the osmotic power without any negative impact on the ecological system thus the success of fo in lithium brine concentration lies in high performance fo membranes which have high rejections to lithium and magnesium ions and high water fluxes or very low structural parameters shaffer et al 2015 very few studies have reported the use of fo to concentrate salt lake brines li et al 2018 pham et al 2020 zhou 2017 however the commercial fo membranes have not been designed for such high salinity and frequently showed very low flux and relatively high reverse salt flux li et al 2018 pham et al 2020 the commercial pe porous membranes which are commonly utilized as lithium ion battery separators have recently been attempted to fabricate the pe supported fo pe fo membranes kwon et al 2017 kwon et al 2019 li et al 2021 the high porosity and pore connectivity combined with the extreme thinness of the pe support endows it with a very low structural parameter thus remarkably enhancing the fo water flux kwon et al 2017 superior mechanical strength and chemical inertness of the pe support ensures the durable operability of the pe fo membrane ryou et al 2011 furthermore the commercial availability at a low cost of the pe support increases the commercial viability of the pe fo membranes kwon et al 2017 ryou et al 2011 however the performance of the pe fo membrane in a practical application has not been evaluated it could be expected that the pe fo membrane would have good performance in concentrating lithium enriched brine in spite of the above merits of the pe support the hydrophobic character of pe prevents the formation of an integral and defect free active layer by interfacial polymerization ip various methods have been employed to hydrophilize the pe separators including hydrophilic coating with polymers kwon et al 2021 kwon et al 2019 li et al 2021 ryou et al 2011 xue et al 2020 and particles choi et al 2010 qin et al 2018 shin and kim 2013 surface grafting kim et al 2009 ko et al 2004 and

1996 shin et al 2020 shin et al 2019 shin et al 2021 werber et al 2017 among the activating solvents benzyl alcohol ba was found to greatly enhance the water permeability of an ro membrane without compromising the nacl rejection shin et al 2019 however the effect of ba treatment on fo performance is not yet clarified the unique properties of fo relative to the pressure driven ro such as the thinner support layer water transport driven by osmotic pressure rather than hydraulic pressure and the presence of internal concentration polarization icp and reverse salt diffusion make it meaningful to explore the effects of ba treatment on fo membrane performance in this paper we report for the first time the development of a highly permselective pe fo membrane for concentrating lithium enriched brine the pe fo membrane was prepared by first hydrophilizing the pe support via oxygen plasma followed by interfacial polymerization furthermore a two step process comprising ba treatment and hydraulic compaction was utilized to post treat the membrane for improving the water flux and reverse salt flux selectivity the pe fo membrane was then applied in concentrating lithium enriched brine an fo model simulating water flux during the lithium concentration process was developed it is expected that this novel pe separator supported fo membrane will find extensive application in the concentration stage of the lithium extraction processes and potentially other high energy concentrating applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals m phenylene

lithium ion battery separators were received from qingdao zhongkehualian advanced materials corp ltd 2 2 membrane preparation the pristine pe support is hydrophobic and difficult to be wetted by the aqueous phase during interfacial polymerization ip therefore oxygen plasma modification was first conducted to improve its hydrophilicity by generating oxygen containing functional groups on the pe support a plasma system ion series plasma processing systemstm pva tepla germany was used for the modification with the power of 50 w modification duration of 1 min and chamber pressure of 500 mtorr the polyamide active layer was formed on top of the plasma treated pe support via interfacial polymerization the pe support was initially immersed in an aqueous solution of 2 0 wt mpd and 0 05 wt sds for 5 min after draining off the excess aqueous solution an air knife was used to remove the residual aqueous solution layer on the surface the saturated support was then immersed into an organic solution of 0 15 wt tmc in hexane for 3 min resulting in an ultra thin polyamide film over the pe support after removing excess organic solution the membrane was rinsed with hexane to wash away residual reagents the as prepared tfc membrane was then dried in the ambient for 2 min dry cured in the oven at 80 c for 5 min and stored in di water the prepared pe fo membranes were post treated stepwise by ba and hydraulic compaction in the ba treatment step the membrane was immersed in a ba solution at ambient temperature for 10 min and then gently and thoroughly rinsed with di water in the hydraulic compaction step the membrane was compacted in an ro filtration system described below with di water at an applied pressure of 10 bar and a temperature of 25 c for at least 24 h to investigate separately the effects of the above two treatment steps two other membranes were prepared one only treated by ba and the other only by hydraulic compaction the pe fo membranes without post treatment and post treated by ba hydraulic compaction and both of them were denoted as pristine ba hc and ba hc respectively as depicted in fig 1 2 3 membrane performance characterization 2 3 1 ro

by dividing the pure water flux by the applied pressure the salt rejection and salt permeability coefficient were measured by using 1 0 g l salt solution as the feed solution with the applied pressure

flux selectivity j v j s using a custom lab scale cross flow fo system depicted in fig s1 the fo membrane cell has rectangular channels with dimensions of 5 0 cm in length 2 0 cm in width and 2 mm in depth the membranes were tested in two different orientations with either the active layer facing the feed solution fs referred to as the al fs orientation or facing the draw solution ds referred to as the al ds orientation the fs and ds at 25 0 5 c were circulated co currently at a flow rate of 600 ml min corresponding to a cross flow velocity of 25 cm s nacl or mgcl2 with varied concentrations and di water were used as ds and fs respectively a computer connected to an electronic balance cp2002 ohaus instrument co ltd recorded the weight increase of the ds which was the weight of water

the weight of permeation water collected over a selected time δt in the fo process s m is the effective membrane surface area ρ w is the density of water the reverse salt flux j s from the ds to the

adopted for the lithium concentration experiments to reduce the experimental time and facilitate experimental operation batch experiments were carried out to simulate the continuous concentration process of lithium enriched brine by varying the feed licl concentration as 0 1 1 0 and 3 0 m and using saturated mgcl2 as the ds other operating conditions were the same as fo performance characterization the initial water flux of each fo test was measured 2 5 instrumental analysis field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jsm 7800f prime jeol japan was used for analyzing the membrane morphology the contact angle of the membrane surface was evaluated using a contact angle goniometer dropmeter a 200 maist china the electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar austria was used

lithium concentrating process to study the concentration process for lithium enriched brine an fo model was developed to calculate the water flux against the lithium concentration the osmotic pressure or solute concentration at the active layer differs from the bulk osmotic pressure or concentration due to the presence of the concentration polarization schematics of the osmotic pressure profiles across an fo membrane in al fs and al ds are shown in fig 2 a and 2b respectively the fo water flux j v across the active layer is given by baker 2012 5 j v a π d m π f m where a is the water permeability coefficient of the membrane π d m and π f m are the osmotic pressures of the ds and fs respectively at the active layer fig 2 the reflection coefficient is assumed to be 1 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 although the osmotic pressure can be approximated using the van t hoff equation for a dilute solution the accuracy is poor for a highly saline solution for the lithium concentrating process the van t hoff equation greatly underestimates the osmotic pressures of saturated mgcl2 ds 5 m at 25 c and highly concentrated licl fs 2 m as shown in fig s3 therefore polynomial fitting relationships were used to precisely calculate the osmotic pressures the osmotic pressures of mgcl2 licl and nacl as a function of molarity were first calculated using the oli analyzer software then the data points were fitted with four order polynomial curves as shown in fig s3 the corresponding polynomial expressions were used for calculating the osmotic pressures and are provided in section s2 of the supplementary information the draw solute concentration c d m and feed concentration c f m at the active layer can be related to the corresponding bulk concentration by accounting for the

the supplementary information for the complete derivation for eqs 9 11 in the lithium concentration experiments licl and mgcl2 are used as fs and ds respectively the diffusion coefficients of mgcl2 and licl as a function of concentration were calculated according to the method described in section s2 of the supplementary information and the results are shown in fig s4 and table s2 based on the variation range of diffusion coefficients an intermediate value of 1 4 10 9 m2 s was used for both mgcl2 and licl in the fo water flux simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 membrane structures and properties fig 3 presents the sem and afm images of the pe supports and pe fo membranes the pristine pe support has a highly porous structure fig 3a1 a3 with an overall porosity of 40 data from the manufacturer and a surface porosity of 33 fig s5 the membrane thickness is 9 μm fig 3a2 significantly thinner than conventional polysulfone psf support tiraferri et al 2011 yip et al 2010 the pristine pe support has a flat surface with a root mean square roughness r q of 20 5 nm fig 3a4 despite the excellent structural characteristics of the pe support the hydrophobic nature of pe prevents the formation of an intact and defect free active layer by ip the o2 plasma treatment drastically improved the hydrophilicity of the pe support as evidenced by the markedly reduced water contact angle from 115 to 67 fig 3a1 and b1 double sided plasma treatment makes the other side of the pe support similarly hydrophilic with a contact angle of 63 data not shown in fig 3 appropriate support hydrophilicity is critical for fo membrane performance a hydrophobic support is difficult to be infiltrated by the aqueous phase thus difficult to form an intact and defect free active layer while highly hydrophilic supports prevent the formation of high performance active layers due to the inhibition of mpd diffusion by polar groups ghosh and hoek 2009 park et al 2018a additionally hydrophobic or partially hydrophobic support that cannot be fully wetted when exposed to water increases the structural parameter by decreasing the effective porosity and increasing the effective tortuosity of the support layer thus aggravates icp mccutcheon and elimelech 2008 after o2 plasma treatment the pore becomes slightly larger due to the chain scission fig 3b1 and the highly open and connected pore structure of the support is maintained fig 3b1 b3 additionally plasma treatment resulted in a rougher support surface r q 40 8 nm fig 3b4 probably because plasma etching increased the roughness of the fibril and the inhomogeneity of the surface an active layer with the characteristic ridge and valley morphology is formed on the treated pe support fig 3c1 and c3 the large leaf like structures could be observed which may originate from the relatively large support pores peng et al 2022 the active layer comprises a continuous 200 300 nm base from which the ridge and valley structures extend outward fig 3c3 the formation of the base layer could be ascribed to the large surface pores and high surface porosity of the pe support lu et al 2015 due to the large variation in the size of the protruding polyamide structures the total thickness of the active layer at different locations shows great heterogeneity varying from 200 nm to 1000 nm fig 3c3 this leads to a rough surface of the active layer with a roughness of 83 8 nm fig 3c4 the active layer is moderately hydrophilic with a contact angle of 50 typical for tfc membranes formed using aromatic mpd and tmc monomers 50 60 werber et al 2016b after hydraulic compaction the morphology roughness and hydrophilicity of the active layer surface as well as the total thickness of the membrane did not change noticeably fig 3d1 d2 and d4 the slightly thinner base fig 3d3 of the active layer may be due to the hydraulic compaction the leaf like structures became flatter and less well defined after ba treatment fig 3e1 perhaps swelling by ba reduced the modulus of the polyamide layer shin et al 2019 thus prompting the softened large leaf like structures to fall down and stack together the ba treatment resulted in a more uniform thickness fig 3e3 and smoother surface r q 73 4 nm fig 3e4 of the active layer which is in accordance with fig 3e1 and the above speculation in addition the partial dissolution of the polyamide oligomers may also contribute to the roughness decline shin et al 2019 more pronounced deformation of the protruding polyamide structures could be observed on the surface of the ba hc membrane fig 3f1 which can be attributed to the ease of deformation of the polyamide layer with reduced modulus when experiencing hydraulic pressure the roughness of the ba hc membrane r q 72 2 nm is slightly reduced relative to the ba membrane fig 3f4 additionally post treatments didn t notably vary the hydrophilicity of the active layer fig 3c1 d1 e1 and f1 and the total thickness of the pe support fig 3c2 d2 e2 and f2 the surface charge characteristics of the pe supports and pe fo membranes were evaluated using zeta potential measurements as presented in fig 4 as ph increases the zeta potentials of all the membranes transform from positive to negative with the isoelectric point iep ranging from 2 5 to 4 5 the strong negative surface charge of the chemically inert pristine pe support at neutral ph may be attributable to the preferential adsorption of hydroxide ions which is widely used to explain the negative zeta potentials at hydrophobic surfaces uematsu et al 2020 the surface of the plasma treated pe support is even more negatively charged under neutral conditions which originates from the oxygen containing functional groups introduced by the oxygen plasma treatment matoušek et al 2016 syromotina et al 2016 in comparison with the plasma treated pe support the pristine membrane i e the pristine pe fo membrane without post treatment has a higher iep of 4 0 and much less negative zeta potential of 36 mv at neutral ph the positive zeta potential at ph 4 0 is due to the protonation of amino groups at ph 4 0 the membrane surface is more negatively charged at elevated ph because of the deprotonation of an increasing number of carboxyl groups in addition three different post treatments i e the hydraulic compaction ba treatment and their combination did not noticeably alter the zeta potential of the pe fo membrane over the entire ph range the negative zeta potentials of the pe fo membranes at ph 7 indicate the electrostatic repulsions to anions in neutral environments 4 2 separation properties of the pe fo membranes 4 2 1 transport properties and structural parameter table 1 lists the separation characteristics of the pristine hc ba and ba hc membranes including the water permeability coefficients a salt rejections r salt permeability coefficients b and water salt permselectivities a b the pristine and ba membranes were not compacted whereas both hc and ba hc membranes were fully compacted at 10 bar the pristine membrane exhibits a high water permeability of 4 5 lmh bar which may be primarily due to its highly porous pe support on the one hand the large surface porosity of the pe support shortens the water diffusion path through the active layer on the other hand the highly open and connected pore structure of the pe support is more conducive to water transport additionally the membrane shows moderate rejections for nacl licl and mgcl2 after hydraulic compaction the water and salt permeability coefficients were reduced with a greater reduction in the salt permeability coefficients which led to an increase in water salt permselectivities in addition the salt rejections were improved from 97 to 98 the above changes after compaction are consistent with the observations of pendergast et al pendergast et al 2010 and follow the permeability selectivity trade off namely an increase in the water permeability comes with an even greater increase in the solute permeability geise et al 2011 werber et al 2016b which may be the result of the polyamide network densification caused by hydraulic pressure inversely the ba treatment increased the water and salt permeability coefficients with a greater increase in the salt permeability coefficients thus leading to a decrease in the water salt permselectivities and salt rejections probably the ba treatment swelled and loosened the polyamide network contrary to the compaction induced densification of the polyamide network additionally the ba treatment could partially dissolve the small polyamide molecular fragments at the outermost polyamide active layer that contributes little to separation but hampers water transport jimenez solomon et al 2013 shin et al 2019 shin et al 2021 which could also enhance the water permeability hydraulic compaction altered the transport properties of the ba membrane in the same trend as the pristine membrane i e decreased the water and salt permeability coefficients and increased the water salt permselectivities and salt rejections but to a greater extent this could be explained by the reduced modulus of the polyamide layer after being swollen by ba leading to a greater deformation densification of the active layer after compaction shin et al 2019 in comparison with the pristine membrane the ba hc membrane exhibits a higher water permeability of 5 6 lmh bar that outperforms most commercial fo and ro membranes kwon et al 2017 werber et al 2016b furthermore the ba hc membrane displays higher salt rejections 98 and water salt permselectivities thus overcoming the performance trade off the breaking of the trade off can be attributed to the partial dissolution of the polyamide oligomers by ba described above the above data demonstrate the positive effect of ba treatment followed by hydraulic compaction on membrane transport properties the structural parameter is a measure of the effective diffusive distance of a solute through a porous media yip et al 2010 the prepared membranes have low structural parameters of 140 μm lower than most of the commercial membranes and membranes reported in other studies kwon et al 2019 shaffer et al 2015 wang et al 2018 this indicates a low salt transport resistance in the pe support thus low icp and high fo water flux 4 2 2 effect of post treatment on fo performance fig 5 shows the fo water flux j v and reverse salt flux selectivity j v j s of the pe fo membranes without post treatment and with different types of post treatment in al fs and al ds orientations using di water as fs and 0 5 m nacl fig 5a and c or mgcl2 fig 5b and d as ds the j v j s represents the volume of water permeated per mass of draw solute lost and it follows a simple relationship based on the van t hoff equation j v j s anrt b where n is the van t hoff dissociation factor r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature phillip et al 2010 tang et al 2010 a membrane with a higher water salt permselectivity a b will have a higher reverse salt flux selectivity j v j s in an fo characterization test a higher j v j s value means less feed and draw solute loss and purer concentrated feed solution in fo concentration ba treatment dramatically enhanced the fo water flux fig 5a and b this may be ascribed to the fact that ba treatment considerably increased the water permeability table 1 by partially dissolving the low crosslinked loose polyamide structures and swelling the polyamide network to be looser and more open jimenez solomon et al 2013 shin et al 2019 shin et al 2021 however the significant increase in j v is accompanied by a marked decrease in j v j s fig 5c and d which is due to the significant decrease in water salt permselectivity a b table 1 after further post treatment of hydraulic compaction based on ba treatment j v j s is improved considerably relative to the ba membrane fig 5c and d which is due to the significant structural densification of the polyamide network under hydraulic pressure and the resulting significant increase in water salt permselectivity a b table 1 unlike the significant increase in j v j s the hydraulic compaction has little impact on j v fig 5a and b which could be explained by two counteracting factors on one hand the decrease in water permeability results in a decrease in fo water flux on the other hand the decrease in salt permeability coefficient inhibits the reverse salt diffusion which increases the effective osmotic pressure difference across the active layer and thus increases the water flux we also evaluated the effect of the stand alone post treatment of hydraulic compaction compared with the pristine membrane hydraulic compaction slightly enhances the fo water flux fig 5a and b despite a decrease in water permeability coefficient table 1 the water flux increase could also be explained by the compaction induced decrease in the salt permeability coefficient and the resulting increase in the effective osmotic pressure difference meanwhile hydraulic compaction leads to an increase in j v j s fig 5c and d which agrees with the increase of the water salt permselectivity a b furthermore j v j s of the hc membrane is lower than the ba hc membrane which is also in line with the lower a b values of the hc membrane as shown in table 1 compared with 0 5 m nacl ds fig 5a higher water flux values can be observed for 0 5 m mgcl2 ds in the al ds orientation fig 5b which is due to the higher osmotic pressure of 0 5 m mgcl2 39 4 bar by oli analyzer software than the same molar concentration of nacl 23 4 bar by oli analyzer software while in al fs the two draw solutions generate similar water fluxes which is mainly due to the smaller diffusion coefficient of mgcl2 than nacl and therefore more severe icp using 0 5 m mgcl2 as the ds furthermore the 0 5 m mgcl2 ds corresponds to a significantly higher j v j s fig 5c and d indicating less leakage of mgcl2 than nacl to conclude the hydraulic compaction or ba treatment has a small or even detrimental effect on the fo performance nonetheless the two step post treatment method of ba treatment followed by hydraulic compaction dramatically enhances the fo water flux and the reverse salt flux selectivity take 0 5 m nacl ds as an example the water fluxes of the ba hc membrane in al fs and al ds are as high as 42 3 and 66 3 lmh respectively a significant increase of 38 and 48 over the pristine membrane to the best of our knowledge the fo flux values are the highest ever reported in the open literature under similar test conditions furthermore compared with the pristine membrane the reverse salt flux selectivities of the ba hc membrane in al fs and al ds increase by 76 and 46 reaching 4 6 and 5 3 l g respectively considerably higher than those of the commercial hti tfc and hti cta membranes kwon et al 2017 the dramatic water flux improvement can be attributed to the ba induced dissolution of the polyamide loose structure and the compaction induced decreased salt permeability coefficient the significant increase in reverse salt flux selectivity lies in the enhanced water salt permselectivity due to hydraulic compaction and dissolution of the polyamide loose structure section 4 2 1 4 2 3 fo performance of the ba hc membrane fig 6 depicts the experimental and theoretical j v and j v j s of the ba hc membranes in both orientations as a function of ds concentration as shown in fig 6a and b the greater ds concentration leads to higher j v as a result of the increased osmotic driving force the increasing rate of j v with the ds concentration slows down due to the more severe concentration polarization at elevated ds concentration the j v in the al ds orientation is higher than that in the al fs orientation owing to the less severe concentration polarization despite the significantly higher osmotic pressure of mgcl2 than nacl at the same molarity fig s3 mgcl2 ds produces similar water flux in al fs and only slightly higher water flux in al ds the former is due to the more serious icp in the case of mgcl2 ds resulting from the lower diffusion coefficient of mgcl2 than nacl as illustrated earlier the latter is owing to the more severe ecp stemming from the higher water flux ecp depends exponentially on fo water flux section 3 together with the lower diffusion coefficient of mgcl2 in the case of mgcl2 ds the fo water fluxes in both orientations were calculated using the model developed in section 3 as shown in fig 6a and b the calculated water fluxes agree well with the experimental results demonstrating the validity of the model the theoretical j v j s was also calculated based on the relationship j v j s anrt b and should be independent of the membrane orientation and ds concentration phillip et al 2010 the calculated j v j s are 14 4 and 17 6 l g for the nacl and mgcl2 ds respectively as shown in fig 6c and d the experimental results are notably lower than the calculated values this may be attributable to the enhanced shielding effect of counterions on the negative charge of the membrane surface viz decreased zeta potential in a salt solution with a higher concentration resulting in a weakened co ion exclusion and an increased salt permeability fig 7 compares the ba hc membrane prepared in the current work with other fo membranes reported in the literature the ba hc membrane exhibits the highest fo water flux in both orientations with a relatively high reverse salt flux selectivity the high water flux is attributed to the excellent water permeability and salt rejection of the membrane as well as the low effective structural parameter of the plasma treated pe support from the perspective of permeability selectivity trade off increasing the hydraulic pressure in the compaction operation may further densify the active layer thus leading to a decrease in the water permeability and an increase in the water salt permselectivity and reverse salt flux selectivity 4 3 concentrating lithium enriched brine by fo the ba hc membrane was evaluated in lithium concentration using saturated mgcl2 as ds fig 8 presents the fo water flux as a function of licl concentration in the al fs and al ds orientations the theoretical fo water fluxes in both orientations were calculated using the model developed in section 3 as presented by the solid lines in fig 8 the calculated fluxes closely match the experimental results demonstrating the validity of the model in predicting the fo water flux in lithium concentration the fo water flux decreases with increasing licl concentration due to the reduction in the osmotic driving force the water flux decline slows down as licl concentration increases the water flux in al ds is higher than that in al fs due to the less severe concentration polarization in al ds nevertheless as licl concentration increases the water flux declines more rapidly in al ds this is due to the fact that the concentration polarization on the feed side has an increasingly pronounced influence on the fo water flux with increasing licl concentration and the concentrative icp that occurs on the feed side in al ds is more severe than the concentrative ecp in al fs the ba hc membrane exhibits a high water flux during lithium concentration for feed waters with high total dissolved solids tds water fluxes in fo are generally very low mcginnis et al 2013 werber et al 2016a by contrast according to the simulation results the fo water fluxes of the ba hc membrane are still above 15 lmh in both orientations at a licl concentration up to 5 m fig 8a the high water flux is ascribed to the excellent fo property of the ba hc membrane as well as the high osmotic pressure of the mgcl2 ds to further clarify the contribution of the ba hc membrane a commercial fo membrane was compared water fluxes of the commercial hti tfc membrane during licl concentration were calculated using its separation properties i e water permeability coefficient and structural parameter measured by kwon et al kwon et al 2017 it is clear from fig 8 that the ba hc membrane exhibits significantly higher water fluxes than the commercial tfc membrane in both orientations demonstrating the remarkable superiority of the ba hc membrane in terms of the fo water flux in lithium concentration which will reduce the capital and operating costs although al fs orientation is generally more recommended in real fo applications to avoid the more intractable internal fouling that occurs within the porous support she et al 2016 the al ds orientation may be preferable in the case of the lithium concentration due to the foulant free feed solution and the higher water flux 5 conclusions in this study fo membranes were prepared using commercial porous pe separators as the supports the novel two step post treatment method of ba treatment followed by hydraulic compaction dramatically enhanced the fo water flux and the reverse salt flux selectivity the alterations of the intrinsic transport properties i e water and salt permeability coefficient and water salt permselectivity resulting from the ba induced dissolution of the loose polyamide structure and hydraulic compaction are responsible for the fo performance improvement the fo membrane exhibited a high water flux and reverse salt flux selectivity of 66 3 lmh and 5 25 l g respectively in al ds using 0 5 m nacl as the draw and di water as the feed furthermore the membrane showed a high water flux in concentrating lithium enriched brine using saturated mgcl2 as draw solution the fo water flux in lithium concentration was also accurately predicted by developing a new fo model we expect the results and methodology in this work will provide a theoretical basis for further research on the utilization of pe fo membranes in concentrating highly saline feed solutions in various industries

16088,development of water wastewater treatment based on membrane distillation md suffers from the drawback that the hydrophobic membrane could be wetted for various reasons despite significant efforts there is uncertainty in addressing the wetting induced by scaling of calcium sulfate which is ubiquitous and recalcitrant in md processes this study made the first attempt to analyze the interplay between the growing crystals and the porous structures in the framework of stoney s equation optical coherence tomography oct was exploited to measure the membrane shift whereby the scaling induced deformation was correlated with the variation in stress created in the crystal containing layer along with the stress analysis the oct based characterization was combined with conventional approaches to ascertain the dependence of the scaling induced wetting on the rate of concentrating the crystallizing species when arriving at a high degree of supersaturation in the feed this study would refine the physical picture for better understanding crystal membrane interactions that result in not only the wetting phenomenon but also the irreversible damage of membrane structures thereby lending itself to the development of strategies for md based applications with improved efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation scaling induced wetting optical coherence tomography stress analysis operating conditions 1 introduction membrane distillation md offers additional advantages alkhudhiri et al 2012 deshmukh et al 2018 yao et al 2020 for water wastewater treatment instead of being a rejector the membrane employed by an md process serves as a hydrophobic barrier for liquid water while allowing for the passing of water vapor whose flow rate is dominated by the vapor pressure difference across the membrane chang et al 2021 lawson and lloyd 1997 lin et al 2014 qtaishat et al 2008 despite the merits of md processes a major downside is that the hydrophobic membrane could be wetted for a variety of reasons the wetting phenomenon can create a short circuit between the feed and the distillate and thereby result in the leakage of nonvolatile components a mechanistic understanding is demanded to develop efficient means to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of wetting in an md process the young laplace equation soligno et al 2014 was exploited to establish a criterion for assessing the applicability of md that is there is a critical pressure difference across the liquid vapor interface in a membrane pore below which the entry of liquid water into the membrane pore is thermodynamically impossible this critical value was therefore defined as the liquid entry pressure lep which has been extensively studied in an effort to improve the accuracy of predicting the wetting phenomenon for example a geometry factor was introduced by franken et al franken et al 1987 to account for the deviation from the assumption that the membrane be composed of cylindrical straight through pores this idea was extended by subsequent studies to cover a variety of geometrical characteristics servi et al 2016 although the prediction of wetting was limited by the simplified configuration the classical lep model lent a tool for correlating the operating conditions that could play a pivotal role in inducing the wetting in an md process the local environments at the feed membrane and feed vapor interfaces could be substantially varied over time when employing md to concentrate a feed solution in a batchwise or continuous way the process of concentration would favor the enrichment of wetting agents which can alter the wettability owing to different mechanisms a series of low surface tension lst agents were investigated in an early work by garcia payo garcı a payo et al 2000 correlating the variations in the surface tension of feed and the lep it was revealed in the work by chew at al chew et al 2017 that the adsorption of various surfactants could have profound impacts on the wetting behavior the roles of non adsorbing lst agents and adsorbing surfactants were distinguished by wang et al wang et al 2018b in contrast to the sharp wetting emanating from the alcohol containing feed solution the movement of the wetting front could be dependent on the competitive adsorption and enrichment of surfactants onto the membrane surface and in close proximity to the liquid vapor interface respectively a kinetic model was subsequently developed by wang et al wang et al 2018a to interpret the surfactant induced wetting in md numerically confirming that the convection i e the transfer driven by the liquid flow toward the membrane surface could play a critical role in replenishing the surfactants and thereby continuously lowering the surface tension at the liquid vapor interface in addition to the decrease in the surface tension of the feed the enlargement of the pore size can be another mechanism accounting for the occurrence of wetting in an md process for example scanning electron microscopy sem was explored by gryta gryta 2011 to examine the cross section of an md membrane showing that mineral compounds could be found as deep as approximately 100 μm within the membrane structures a recent study by christie et al christie et al 2020 distinguished the scaling behaviors associated with the polymerization of silica and the crystallization of calcium sulfate caso4 unraveling that the oriented growth of caso4 crystals could play a pivotal role in expanding the membrane pores and thereby resulting in the wetting although this study validated the ability of the crystal growth to damage the membrane structures by evaluating the crystallization pressure in terms of the degree of supersaturation it remained unclear what mechanisms should be involved to account for the sustained growth of the crystals confined in the membrane pores indeed the content of the inorganic salt in the liquid phase was continuously consumed owing to the nucleation and growth of crystalline particles thereby decreasing the degree of supersaturation of the sparingly soluble salts caso4 deserves particular attention since there is a higher possibility in terms of the experimental results reported over the past decades and summarized in supporting information si fig s 1 that the scaling of caso4 in md is associated with the occurrence of wetting apart from thermodynamical aspect it is of great relevance to correlate the kinetics of scaling with the interplay between the crystalline particles and the membrane structures the kinetic correlation would lend itself more readily to the optimization of operating conditions therefore this study proposed to investigate the scaling induced wetting in md by experimentally ascertaining the complex interplay between the growing crystals and the membrane structures under various operating conditions in particular direct contact membrane distillation dcmd lawson and lloyd 1996 liu et al 2021b was implemented with a varied transmembrane temperature difference whereby the caso4 containing feed was concentrated at a different rate in addition to conventional characterization the crystal membrane interaction was in situ monitored and ex situ examined by optical coherence tomography oct fercher 2010 li et al 2016b analysis of the characterization would deepen the understanding of wetting phenomena induced by the scaling in md 2 experimental procedures 2 1 md experiments dcmd was performed using a commercial hydrophobic membrane annuo zhejiang china which was composed of an active layer of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe having a nominal pore size of 0 3 μm and a thickness of 20 μm and a substrate of polyethylene terephthalate pet having a thickness of 164 μm the membrane was accommodated by a lab scale filtration cell providing an effective area of 34 cm2 the active layer was exposed to the upper compartment with a width of 48 5 mm and a height of 2 mm whose upper wall was partially replaced by an optical window 20 mm 20 mm 2 mm both the upper and lower compartments having the same geometric features were filled with a piece of spacer with the diamond configuration gao et al 2013 li et al 2016a liu et al 2017 in an attempt to provide a mechanical support and partially confine the membrane in particular the spacer in the upper compartment was modified to create a rectangular hole approximately in the central part such that the effects of the spacer on the scaling could be minimized in the regions scanned by the oct the feed solution with a relatively high temperature was driven by a gear pump longer pump model no wt3000 1fb china to flow through the upper compartment at a rate of 465 ml min yielding a bulk velocity of 0 08 m s with respect to the membrane surface the feed temperature was regulated and maintained by a thermostatically controlled water bath changliu model no hx 102 china where the feed container 2000 ml was partially immersed on the other hand the distillate flow was cycled on the lower side in a similar way while passing through a chiller laboto model no cc 0506e china that maintained the flow at a relatively low temperature when setting the feed temperature at two different values 50 and 60 the distillate temperature was accordingly varied such as the transmembrane temperature was maintained at a value of 40 or 10 the variation in the distillate flux was determined by continuously weighing the distillate container 2000 ml using a digital balance mettler toledo model no ml4002 t usa unless otherwise stated all experiments in this study were repeated at least three times to evaluate the mean and the standard deviation which will be used to establish the experimental curves and create the error bars respectively 2 2 characterization of the scaling in order to achieve a relatively high supersaturation level at the beginning of md a stock solution of caso4 was prepared by mixing calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o shanghai lingfeng china of 3 96 g with anhydrous sodium sulfate naso4 aladdin of 3 85 g in an aqueous solution of 1000 ml deionized water supplied by a milli q direct 8 water purification system france the stock solution was prefiltered using a membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm to remove any solid particles prior to the addition into the feed solution in terms of the calculation results of phreeqc version 2 8 geological survey usa the saturation index si of caso4 in the feed was 0 17 and 0 18 for the feed temperature varied at 50 and 60 respectively the scaling was rapidly induced as the caso4 containing feed solution was concentrated by the md process that was performed using the batchwise mode a fourier domain oct system ganymede iii hr thorlabs usa was integrated with the filtration cell by introducing the low coherence light beam into the upper compartment through the optical window while achieving a depth resolution of 2 µm by implementing the low coherence interference li et al 2020 podoleanu 2012 the oct system offered a resolution of 4 µm in the lateral direction which was limited

standard deviation for the liquid background owing to the presence of a crystalline particle deposited onto the membrane surface a digitalized scaling layer was constructed by combining all the scaling voxels allowing for the numerical evaluation of the surface coverage i e the number ratio of the scaling voxels directly connecting to the membrane surface to the voxels corresponding to the membrane surface the oct dataset was continuously obtained with a frequency of 2 min 1 all the numerical algorithms were coded using matlab 2 3 characterization of the wetting the occurrence of wetting was in situ monitored by continuously measuring the conductivity on both the feed and distillate sides using a conductivity meter mettler toledo model no fe38 on the other hand it was assumed that the scaling induced wetting should be associated with the variation in the distribution of stress across the membrane thereby resulting in the deformation of the partially suspended membrane this assumption was validated in prior studies liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b to demonstrate that the deformation of the membrane could be in situ characterized by precisely tracking the shift of the membrane surface via an oct based approach the feed membrane interface was resolved in terms of the variation in the gradients in the three dimensional matrix of intensities that was obtained at the beginning of the filtration this numerically determined surface was referred to as surface zero and shifted in the positive i e toward the feed side and negative i e toward the distillate side directions with an interval of 2 µm to establish a series of coordinate surfaces the voxels corresponding to each coordinate surface were exploited to evaluate the surface averaged intensity sai the location of surface zero with respect to the observer was then updated by minimizing the numerical difference between the membrane parts of the sai profiles for two consecutive samples in order to correlate the occurrence of wetting with the damage of the membrane the structural changes in the active layer were ex situ examined it was desirable that the characterization could be improved by removing the scaling layer since the thickness of the scaling layer would achieve a value that substantially attenuated the incident light at the cake membrane interface therefore the scaled membrane was carefully washed and then immersed in an ultrasonic bath kq 500de kunshan china for approximately 1 h after the cleaning treatment the membrane was characterized using both oct and sem in a complementary sense specifically the membrane samples were dried in an oven bpg 9140a shanghai yiheng china at 50 and scanned by an sem system hitachi su3800 japan to image the morphology of the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlating the flux decline and variations in electrical conductivity md processes were first implemented by maintaining the transmembrane temperature difference at a value of 40 the distillate flux is plotted as a function of time in fig 1 a showing that the threshold of decline is shifted to a longer time as the value of feed temperature is decreased when simply attributing the flux decline to the deposition of the crystalline particles this trend just manifests the retrograde solubility of caso4 warsinger et al 2015 that is decreasing the feed temperature lowered the effective degree of supersaturation the value of si was decreased from 0 18 to 0 17 as the feed temperature was changed from 60 to 50 thereby extending the induction period of crystallization the variation in the electrical conductivity measured in the bulk solution of feed provides an additional indictor for the formation of caso4 crystals as can be seen in fig 1b the electrical conductivity of feed is initially increased since the salts in the feed were gradually concentrated as indicated by the increase in the volumetric concentration factor vcf over time si fig s 2 in achieving a certain degree of supersaturation the ionic species were rapidly consumed by the nucleation and growth of crystals thereby yielding a maximum of electrical conductivity note that it is possible to observe an increase in the electrical conductivity again owing to the presence of the non crystallizing background electrolyte i e the sodium chloride in contrast to the feed side the leakage of ionic species should be the only possible mechanism accounting for a change in the electrical conductivity of the distillate therefore it is justified to conclude that wetting occurred in both the cases with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 since an almost linear increase is consistently demonstrated by the conductivity time plots in fig 1c when decreasing the transmembrane temperature difference from 40 to 10 the flux decline curves for different feed temperatures are compared in fig 2 a these plots clearly show that lowering the driving force considerably decreases the initial flux despite the experimental fluctuations it is discernible that the higher feed temperature gives rise to a more significant decrease in the vapor flux this observation is consistent with the fact that the solubility of caso4 could be substantially reduced by increasing the feed temperature the effect of retrograde solubility is also confirmed by comparing the time needed to achieve the maximum of electrical conductivity on the feed side fig 2b that is the concentration confirmed by the plot of vcf against time in si fig s 3 was suppressed by the crystallization in a shorter time when setting the feed temperature at 60 in contrast the marginal variations in the electrical conductivity on the distillate side fig 2c serve as an indicator that the membrane was not wetted to create any water channels for the diffusion of the ionic species 3 2 resolving the membrane crystal interactions via oct based approaches the analysis of oct datasets is based on keeping accurate track of the membrane surface on the feed side given that the scanned area 1 mm 0 5 mm is approximately centered in the suspended part having a much larger area 10 mm 10 mm the shift of the membrane surface can be exploited to quantify the deformation of the film which could result from the scaling induced redistribution of stress across the membrane therefore it is appealing to correlate the interfacial shift with the membrane crystal interactions in terms of stoney s equation moulin et al 1999 stoney and parsons 1909 which was originally derived to investigate the deformation arising from the mismatch of mechanical properties in considering a bilayer architecture with thicknesses of δ u and δ s for the upper layer and the substrate respectively the dependence of the stress in the upper layer σ u on the radius of curvature r c can be given by stoney s equation si method s 1 as follows 1 σ u e s δ s 2 6 r c δ u where e s is the young s modulus of the substrate if the span length of the partially supported membrane is l m the shift of the membrane d m can be approximated by si method s 2 2 d m l m 2 8 r c combining eqs 1 and 2 gives rise to a relation as follows 3 d m 3 l m 2 δ u 4 e s δ s 2 σ u this relation clearly establishes that both the magnitude and direction of shift should be primarily dependent on the stress created in the upper layer the accuracy of the surface tracking is validated by the tomographic images in si figs s 4 and s 5 while the interfacial shift is plotted as a function of time in fig 3 a and correspondingly compared with the temporal evolution of the surface coverage shown in fig 3b irrespective of the varied feed temperature it consistently indicates that the membrane was initially shifted toward the feed side when the surface was dominated by the deposits i e the surface coverage greater than 50 the positive shift was dramatically reversed to advance the membrane toward the distillate side with a magnitude much greater than that for the opposite direction moreover it is interesting to note that all the shift time curves approach a negative value with a magnitude of 100 µm after achieving a full coverage these observations can be correlated in the framework of stoney s equation to distinguish different regimes that are dependent on the membrane crystal interactions in terms of eq 3 the shift direction is mathematically related to the sign of the stress imposed on the upper layer which is taken to be positive and negative for expansion and compression vilms and kerps 1982 respectively when the deposition was initiated the deposited crystalline particles were partially embedded into the interfacial structures to form a thin crystal containing layer which played the role of the upper layer in the bilayer architecture fig 3c therefore the initial positive shift indicates that there should be a tensile stress created in the crystal containing layer the justification depends on the fact that there was a great possibility for the crystal containing pores to be separated from each other when the initial surface coverage was considerably low the second regime is characteristic of the shift toward the distillate side which indicates the contraction of the upper layer in the bilayer architecture fig 3d the polymeric network would be squeezed by the growing crystals only when most of the interfacial structures were involved in the deposition of crystalline particles the crystallization induced contraction caused the membrane to bend and keep shifting until it was balanced by the stress resulting from the deformation another possible mechanism accounting for the termination of shift could be the gradual penetration of growing crystals across the membrane fig 3e it is reasonable to infer that the asymmetry in the distribution of stress could be reduced as the thickness of the crystal containing layer was increased when it comes to the md processes performed with a relatively low transmembrane temperature difference the development of a scaling layer on the membrane is verified by the tomographic images in si figs s 6 and s 7 given the considerably reduced vapor flux this observation implies that heterogeneous nucleation could play a key role in forming the cake layer nevertheless it is evidently indicated by the plots in fig 4 a and 4b that after achieving a high surface coverage the membrane was shifted toward the distillate side though a longer sampling time for the case of a lower feed temperature was limited by the storage capacity of the oct system in addition to the similarities in the first and second regimes figs 4c and 4d respectively the higher feed temperature yields a shift time curve approaching a negative value whose magnitude is much greater than 100 µm note that the membrane shifts in all the cases are in order of magnitude greater than that resulting from the control experiments si fig s 8 without addition of any salts thereby corroborating the dominance of the scaling on the membrane deformation instead of the drag emanating from the vapor flux in contrast to the hypothesis that the asymmetric distribution of stress could be relaxed by the penetration of crystals the considerably increased shift magnitude implies that the crystal containing pores could be confined within the interfacial regions fig 4e as a result a higher degree of asymmetry in the distribution of stress was created to further bend the membrane in the context of quantitative analysis stoney s equation is only applicable to cases where the thickness of the upper layer i e the crystal containing layer is extremely thin therefore it is reasonable to see that lowering the transmembrane temperature difference yields a membrane shift with a magnitude of 150 µm which is closer to the value of 160 µm predicted by combining stoney s equation and the theory of crystallization pressure details are presented in si method s 3 3 3 ex situ characterization for examining the effects of scaling on porous structures in addition to the in situ characterization the scaling layers were carefully removed to enable a direct examination of the scaled membrane via approaches based on both sem and oct the comparison of the sem images in fig 5 for the scaled membranes clearly indicates that the surface morphology was substantially changed by the scaling in the md processes operated with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 whereas the membrane surface remained virtually intact in comparison with the sem image for the virgin membrane shown in si fig s 9 for the cases associated with the lower transmembrane temperature difference of 10 this observation indicates that the structural changes could be somehow reversible when the membrane crystal interactions could be confined within the interfacial regions since strong crystal membrane interactions have been identified by the analysis of membrane shift in all the scaling cases the depth variation in the porous structures is examined by comparing the sai profiles in fig 5 for the virgin and scaled membranes it is evident that for all the membranes scaled in the md processes operated with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 the sai values are substantially varied over the range of the coordinate surfaces corresponding to the entire hydrophobic layer 20 µm and most part of the hydrophilic support layer 100 µm the variation in the sai provides strong evidence for the structural changes that give rise to a varied reflectance specifically the decrease in the sai is attributed to the substitution of air by water within the expanded hydrophobic structures i e the occurrence of wetting which could reduce the difference of the reflective indices across the phase interfaces when more light was introduced into the substrate the penetration of the growing crystals could lead to the partial detachment at the interface between the active layer and the substrate thereby creating stronger reflection i e more effective interfacial areas to reflect the incident light in contrast the sai profiles remain unchanged for the cases with a transmembrane temperature difference of 10 this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the crystal membrane interactions could be confined within the interfacial regions when varying the transmembrane temperature difference the crystallizing species in the feed was concentrated at a different rate as indicated by the plots of vcf against time si figs s 2 and s 3 on the one hand the faster rate of concentration could play a key role in increasing the supersaturation to a level that was thermodynamically equivalent to a crystallization pressure sufficiently high to irreversibly expand the polymeric structures on the other hand the higher vapor flux could more efficiently drive the convective transfer to replenish the crystallizing species for the growth of the confined crystals in terms of the well established theory of crystal growth in porous materials scherer 1999 steiger 2005 it was impossible for the confined crystals to continuously grow without the presence of a liquid film between the loaded crystal face and the confining wall the evaporation at the liquid gas interface generated the convective flow that transferred the crystallizing species into the liquid film at a relatively faster rate compared with that driven by the diffusion si fig s 10a another concern is the highly interconnected polymeric structure whose structural discontinuity was able to limit the impact of the expansion occurring in the upper layer on the lower parts nevertheless the penetration could be achieved in a gradual way that is when the expanded parts allowed the liquid to fill the space between the crystal and an unwetted void the evaporation would concentrate the crystallizing species to favor the growth of the confined crystal toward the lower structures si fig s 10b 4 conclusions this study established that the complex interactions between the growing crystals of caso4 and the porous structures can be resolved by determining the film deformation via an oct based approach when quantifying the film deformation by the membrane shift in the area scanned by the oct stoney s equation provided a theoretical framework to interpret the variation in the stress created by the membrane crystal interactions the oct characterization results revealed that the porous structure could be expanded during the initial deposition whereas the membrane crystal interactions would be dominated by compression as the surface coverage was substantially increased moreover the scaled membranes were ex situ examined by both sem and oct indicating that the occurrence of wetting was strongly associated with a higher rate of concentration increasing the concentration rate enabled the crystallizing species in the feed to achieve a sufficiently high degree of supersaturation and thereby created a crystallization pressure high enough to irreversibly damage the membrane structures although varying the vapor flux is not the only way to regulate the rate of concentration the convective transfer of crystallizing species would favor the continuous growth of the confined crystals therefore in the context of avoiding irreversible damage of the membrane the vapor flux should be carefully controlled when crystallizing species in the feed are highly concentrated declaration of competing interest

16088,development of water wastewater treatment based on membrane distillation md suffers from the drawback that the hydrophobic membrane could be wetted for various reasons despite significant efforts there is uncertainty in addressing the wetting induced by scaling of calcium sulfate which is ubiquitous and recalcitrant in md processes this study made the first attempt to analyze the interplay between the growing crystals and the porous structures in the framework of stoney s equation optical coherence tomography oct was exploited to measure the membrane shift whereby the scaling induced deformation was correlated with the variation in stress created in the crystal containing layer along with the stress analysis the oct based characterization was combined with conventional approaches to ascertain the dependence of the scaling induced wetting on the rate of concentrating the crystallizing species when arriving at a high degree of supersaturation in the feed this study would refine the physical picture for better understanding crystal membrane interactions that result in not only the wetting phenomenon but also the irreversible damage of membrane structures thereby lending itself to the development of strategies for md based applications with improved efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation scaling induced wetting optical coherence tomography stress analysis operating conditions 1 introduction membrane distillation md offers additional advantages alkhudhiri et al 2012 deshmukh et al 2018 yao et al 2020 for water wastewater treatment instead of being a rejector the membrane employed by an md process serves as a hydrophobic barrier for liquid water while allowing for the passing of water vapor whose flow rate is dominated by the vapor pressure difference across the membrane chang et al 2021 lawson and lloyd 1997 lin et al 2014 qtaishat et al 2008 despite the merits of md processes a major downside is that the hydrophobic membrane could be wetted for a variety of reasons the wetting phenomenon can create a short circuit between the feed and the distillate and thereby result in the leakage of nonvolatile components a mechanistic understanding is demanded to develop efficient means to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of wetting in an md process the young laplace equation soligno et al 2014 was exploited to establish a criterion for assessing the applicability of md that is there is a critical pressure difference across the liquid vapor interface in a membrane pore below which the entry of liquid water into the membrane pore is thermodynamically impossible this critical value was therefore defined as the liquid entry pressure lep which has been extensively studied in an effort to improve the accuracy of predicting the wetting phenomenon for example a geometry factor was introduced by franken et al franken et al 1987 to account for the deviation from the assumption that the membrane be composed of cylindrical straight through pores this idea was extended by subsequent studies to cover a variety of geometrical characteristics servi et al 2016 although the prediction of wetting was limited by the simplified configuration the classical lep model lent a tool for correlating the operating conditions that could play a pivotal role in inducing the wetting in an md process the local environments at the feed membrane and feed vapor interfaces could be substantially varied over time when employing md to concentrate a feed solution in a batchwise or continuous way the process of concentration would favor the enrichment of wetting agents which can alter the wettability owing to different mechanisms a series of low surface tension lst agents were investigated in an early work by garcia payo garcı a payo et al 2000 correlating the variations in the surface tension of feed and the lep it was revealed in the work by chew at al chew et al 2017 that the adsorption of various surfactants could have profound impacts on the wetting behavior the roles of non adsorbing lst agents and adsorbing surfactants were distinguished by wang et al wang et al 2018b in contrast to the sharp wetting emanating from the alcohol containing feed solution the movement of the wetting front could be dependent on the competitive adsorption and enrichment of surfactants onto the membrane surface and in close proximity to the liquid vapor interface respectively a kinetic model was subsequently developed by wang et al wang et al 2018a to interpret the surfactant induced wetting in md numerically confirming that the convection i e the transfer driven by the liquid flow toward the membrane surface could play a critical role in replenishing the surfactants and thereby continuously lowering the surface tension at the liquid vapor interface in addition to the decrease in the surface tension of the feed the enlargement of the pore size can be another mechanism accounting for the occurrence of wetting in an md process for example scanning electron microscopy sem was explored by gryta gryta 2011 to examine the cross section of an md membrane showing that mineral compounds could be found as deep as approximately 100 μm within the membrane structures a recent study by christie et al christie et al 2020 distinguished the scaling behaviors associated with the polymerization of silica and the crystallization of calcium sulfate caso4 unraveling that the oriented growth of caso4 crystals could play a pivotal role in expanding the membrane pores and thereby resulting in the wetting although this study validated the ability of the crystal growth to damage the membrane structures by evaluating the crystallization pressure in terms of the degree of supersaturation it remained unclear what mechanisms should be involved to account for the sustained growth of the crystals confined in the membrane pores indeed the content of the inorganic salt in the liquid phase was continuously consumed owing to the nucleation and growth of crystalline particles thereby decreasing the degree of supersaturation of the sparingly soluble salts caso4 deserves particular attention since there is a higher possibility in terms of the experimental results reported over the past decades and summarized in supporting information si fig s 1 that the scaling of caso4 in md is associated with the occurrence of wetting apart from thermodynamical aspect it is of great relevance to correlate the kinetics of scaling with the interplay between the crystalline particles and the membrane structures the kinetic correlation would lend itself more readily to the optimization of operating conditions therefore this study proposed to investigate the scaling induced wetting in md by experimentally ascertaining the complex interplay between the growing crystals and the membrane structures under various operating conditions in particular direct contact membrane distillation dcmd lawson and lloyd 1996 liu et al 2021b was implemented with a varied transmembrane temperature difference whereby the caso4 containing feed was concentrated at a different rate in addition to conventional characterization the crystal membrane interaction was in situ monitored and ex situ examined by optical coherence tomography oct fercher 2010 li et al 2016b analysis of the characterization would deepen the understanding of wetting phenomena induced by the scaling in md 2 experimental procedures 2 1 md experiments dcmd was performed using a commercial hydrophobic membrane annuo zhejiang china which was composed of an active layer of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe having a nominal pore size of 0 3 μm and a thickness of 20 μm and a substrate of polyethylene terephthalate pet having a thickness of 164 μm the membrane was accommodated by a lab scale filtration cell providing an effective area of 34 cm2 the active layer was exposed to the upper compartment with a width of 48 5 mm and a height of 2 mm whose upper wall was partially replaced by an optical window 20 mm 20 mm 2 mm both the upper and lower compartments having the same geometric features were filled with a piece of spacer with the diamond configuration gao et al 2013 li et al 2016a liu et al 2017 in an attempt to provide a mechanical support and partially confine the membrane in particular the spacer in the upper compartment was modified to create a rectangular hole approximately in the central part such that the effects of the spacer on the scaling could be minimized in the regions scanned by the oct the feed solution with a relatively high temperature was driven by a gear pump longer pump model no wt3000 1fb china to flow through the upper compartment at a rate of 465 ml min yielding a bulk velocity of 0 08 m s with respect to the membrane surface the feed temperature was regulated and maintained by a thermostatically controlled water bath changliu model no hx 102 china where the feed container 2000 ml was partially immersed on the other hand the distillate flow was cycled on the lower side in a similar way while passing through a chiller laboto model no cc 0506e china that maintained the flow at a relatively low temperature when setting the feed temperature at two different values 50 and 60 the distillate temperature was accordingly varied such as the transmembrane temperature was maintained at a value of 40 or 10 the variation in the distillate flux was determined by continuously weighing the distillate container 2000 ml using a digital balance mettler toledo model no ml4002 t usa unless otherwise stated all experiments in this study were repeated at least three times to evaluate the mean and the standard deviation which will be used to establish the experimental curves and create the error bars respectively 2 2 characterization of the scaling in order to achieve a relatively high supersaturation level at the beginning of md a stock solution of caso4 was prepared by mixing calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o shanghai lingfeng china of 3 96 g with anhydrous sodium sulfate naso4 aladdin of 3 85 g in an aqueous solution of 1000 ml deionized water supplied by a milli q direct 8 water purification system france the stock solution was prefiltered using a membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 45 µm to remove any solid particles prior to the addition into the feed solution in terms of the calculation results of phreeqc version 2 8 geological survey usa the saturation index si of caso4 in the feed was 0 17 and 0 18 for the feed temperature varied at 50 and 60 respectively the scaling was rapidly induced as the caso4 containing feed solution was concentrated by the md process that was performed using the batchwise mode a fourier domain oct system ganymede iii hr thorlabs usa was integrated with the filtration cell by introducing the low coherence light beam into the upper compartment through the optical window while achieving a depth resolution of 2 µm by implementing the low coherence interference li et al 2020 podoleanu 2012 the oct system offered a resolution of 4 µm in the lateral direction which was limited by the focusing property of the objective lens oct lk3 bb thorlabs usa a series of a scans i e the scans fixed at a spot were performed within a rectangular area 1 mm 0 5 mm such that a three

interfacial regions fig 4e as a result a higher degree of asymmetry in the distribution of stress was created to further bend the membrane in the context of quantitative analysis stoney s equation is only applicable to cases where the thickness of the upper layer i e the crystal containing layer is extremely thin therefore it is reasonable to see that lowering the transmembrane temperature difference yields a membrane shift with a magnitude of 150 µm which is closer to the value of 160 µm predicted by combining stoney s equation and the theory of crystallization pressure details are presented in si method s 3 3 3 ex situ characterization for examining the effects of scaling on porous structures in addition to the in situ characterization the scaling layers were carefully removed to enable a direct examination of the scaled membrane via approaches based on both sem and oct the comparison of the sem images in fig 5 for the scaled membranes clearly indicates that the surface morphology was substantially changed by the scaling in the md processes operated with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 whereas the membrane surface remained virtually intact in comparison with the sem image for the virgin membrane shown in si fig s 9 for the cases associated with the lower transmembrane temperature difference of 10 this observation indicates that the structural changes could be somehow reversible when the membrane crystal interactions could be confined within the interfacial regions since strong crystal membrane interactions have been identified by the analysis of membrane shift in all the scaling cases the depth variation in the porous structures is examined by comparing the sai profiles in fig 5 for the virgin and scaled membranes it is evident that for all the membranes scaled in the md processes operated with a transmembrane temperature difference of 40 the sai values are substantially varied over the range of the coordinate surfaces corresponding to the entire hydrophobic layer 20 µm and most part of the hydrophilic support layer 100 µm the variation in the sai provides strong evidence for the structural changes that give rise to a varied reflectance specifically the decrease in the sai is attributed to the substitution of air by water within the expanded hydrophobic structures i e the occurrence of wetting which could reduce the difference of the reflective indices across the phase interfaces when more light was introduced into the substrate the penetration of the growing crystals could lead to the partial detachment at the interface between the active layer and the substrate thereby creating stronger reflection i e more effective interfacial areas to reflect the incident light in contrast the sai profiles remain unchanged for the cases with a transmembrane temperature difference of 10 this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the crystal membrane interactions could be confined within the interfacial regions when varying the transmembrane temperature difference the crystallizing species in the feed was concentrated at a different rate as indicated by the plots of vcf against time si figs s 2 and s 3 on the one hand the faster rate of concentration could play a key role in increasing the supersaturation to a level that was thermodynamically equivalent to a crystallization pressure sufficiently high to irreversibly expand the polymeric structures on the other hand the higher vapor flux could more efficiently drive the convective transfer to replenish the crystallizing species for the growth of the confined crystals in terms of the well established theory of crystal growth in porous materials scherer 1999 steiger 2005 it was impossible for the confined crystals to continuously grow without the presence of a liquid film between the loaded crystal face and the confining wall the evaporation at the liquid gas interface generated the convective flow that transferred the crystallizing species into the liquid film at a relatively faster rate compared with that driven by the diffusion si fig s 10a another concern is the highly interconnected polymeric structure whose structural discontinuity was able to limit the impact of the expansion occurring in the upper layer on the lower parts nevertheless the penetration could be achieved in a gradual way that is when the expanded parts allowed the liquid to fill the space between the crystal and an unwetted void the evaporation would concentrate the crystallizing species to favor the growth of the confined crystal toward the lower structures si fig s 10b 4 conclusions this study established that the complex interactions between the growing crystals of caso4 and the porous structures can be resolved by determining the film deformation via an oct based approach when quantifying the film deformation by the membrane shift in the area scanned by the oct stoney s equation provided a theoretical framework to interpret the variation in the stress created by the membrane crystal interactions the oct characterization results revealed that the porous structure could be expanded during the initial deposition whereas the membrane crystal interactions would be dominated by compression as the surface coverage was substantially increased moreover the scaled membranes were ex situ examined by both sem and oct indicating that the occurrence of wetting was strongly associated with a higher rate of concentration increasing the concentration rate enabled the crystallizing species in the feed to achieve a sufficiently high degree of supersaturation and thereby created a crystallization pressure high enough to irreversibly damage the membrane structures although varying the vapor flux is not the only way to regulate the rate of concentration the convective transfer of crystallizing species would favor the continuous growth of the confined crystals therefore in the context of avoiding irreversible damage of the membrane the vapor flux should be carefully controlled when crystallizing species in the feed are highly concentrated declaration of competing interest

16089,this work analyzed for the first time the bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps for the uptake of different carbon sources fifteen samples were collected from five full scale wwtps predominance of different paos i e ca accumulibacter 0 00 0 49 tetrasphaera 0 37 3 94 microlunatus phosphovorus 0 01 0 18 etc and gaos i e ca competibacter 0 08 5 39 defluviicoccus 0 05 5 34 micropruina 0 17 1 87 etc were shown by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing despite the distinct pao gao community compositions in different samples proton motive force pmf was found as the key driving force up to 90 1 for the uptake of volatile fatty acids vfas acetate and propionate and amino acids glutamate and aspartate by both gaos and paos at the community level contrasting the previous understanding that defluviicoccus have a low demand of pmf for acetate uptake for the uptake of acetate or propionate paos rarely activated f1 f0 atpase 11 7 or fumarate reductase 5 3 for pmf generation whereas intensive involvements of these two pathways up to 49 2 and 61 0 respectively were observed for gaos highlighting a major and community level difference in their vfa uptake biogenetics in full scale systems however different from vfas the uptake of glutamate and aspartate by both paos and gaos commonly involved fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase activities apart from these major and community level differences high level fine scale micro diversity in carbon uptake bioenergetics was observed within pao and gao lineages probably resulting from their versatilities in employing different pathways for reducing power generation ca accumulibacter and halomonas seemed to show higher dependency on the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase than other paos likely due to the low involvement of glyoxylate shunt pathway unlike tetrasphaera but similar to ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus took up glutamate and aspartate via the proton glutamate aspartate symporter driven by pmf this feature was testified using a pure culture of microlunatus phosphovorus stain nm 1 the major difference between paos and gaos highlights the potential to selectively suppress gaos for community regulation in ebpr systems the finer scale carbon uptake bioenergetics of paos or gaos from different lineages benefits in understanding their interactions

al 2012 hao et al 2013 simoes et al 2020 soares 2020 roy et al 2021 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a cost effective and environmentally friendly technology which has been widely implemented in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps yuan et al 2012 mcilroy et al 2014 nielsen et al 2019 this process is mediated by a group of bacteria namely polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos which could excessively take up p from wastewater and store it as intracellular polyphosphate poly p in lab and full scale applications ebpr often experiences deterioration or poor performance due to the occurrence of competing bacteria namely glycogen accumulating organisms gaos wong et al 2005 meyer et al 2006 wang et al 2021 gaos compete with paos for carbon sources but do not contribute to p removal the proliferation of which was considered as an important factor influencing the stability of ebpr lópez vázquez et al 2008 mcilroy et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the capability to obtain carbon sources is an important factor determining which group of bacteria paos or gaos would predominate the competition as a model pao the carbon uptake metabolism of cadidatus accumulibacter has been extensively studied their acetate uptake is achieved via a proton acetate symporter actp driven by proton motive force pmf the pmf is mainly generated via the efflux of proton h in symport with phosphate produced during poly p hydrolysis via the inorganic phosphate transporter pit garcia martin et al 2006 saunders et al 2007 burow et al 2008 qiu et al al 2020 when the pmf generated via the proton coupled phosphate symport was insufficient to cover that required for acetate uptake ca accumulibacter activated the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase to generate additional pmf at the expense of atp qiu et al 2020 different from ca accumulibacter gaos could not generate pmf via the efflux of phosphate due to the lack of intracellular poly p storage using an enrichment culture of defluviicoccus burow et al 2008 showed that pmf only contributed to a minor portion 28 of acetate uptake by defluviicoccus the pmf was mainly generated via anaerobic fumarate reduction coupled proton translocation catalyzed by fumarate reductase other than the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase the authors also hypothesized that a large proportion of acetate uptake was achieved via diffusion through acetate permease acs since diffusion may only be efficient at high extracellular acetate concentrations defluviicoccus were considered inefficient in competing with ca accumulibacter at low acetate concentrations by applying a slow feeding strategy tu and schuler 2013 demonstrated that lowering the in tank acetate concentrations effectively trigged the outcompetition of defluviicoccus cluster ii by ca accumulibacter in an impaired ebpr reactor similarly slow feeding strategy was shown to be effective in obtaining a highly enriched ca accumulibacter culture at high temperature 30 c qiu et al 2020 whereas certain lineage of defluviicoccus i e cluster iii members which were commonly found at high relative abundances in full scale systems mcilroy et al 2010 qiu et al 2019 onetto et al 2019 did survive under the low in tank acetate conditions in the long term qiu et al 2022 implying that they might have distinct carbon uptake bioenergetics from those analyzed by burow et al 2008 and tu and schuler 2013 on the other hand ca competibacter as gaos were shown to take up acetate fully rely on pmf 100 where the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase was the major source 81 of pmf generation saunders et al 2007 based on metagenomic analysis fumarate reductase was hypothesized to contribute to the generation of pmf required for acetate uptake by ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 however the hypothesis has yet to be testified the high dependency of ca competibacter on pmf for acetate uptake may explain their capability to survive and coexist with ca accumulibacter in full scale plants qiu et al 2019 and lab scale reactors employing slow feeding strategies qiu et al 2022 additionally current understanding of the carbon uptake bioenergetics is limited to the above mentioned paos and gaos obtained in enrichment cultures with acetate as a carbon source the bioenergetic characteristics of paos and gaos mentioned above for the uptake of other carbon sources as well as those of other paos or gaos for the uptake of any carbon sources are still not clear full scale ebpr plants harbor a wide range of paos including ca accumulibacter seviour et al 2003 halomonas nguyen et al 2012 tetrasphaera kong et al 2005 liu et al 2019 microlunatus phosphovorus nakamura et al 1995 dechloromonas kong et al 2007 petriglieri et al 2021 ca

competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 defluviicoccus mcilroy et al 2010 propionivibrio albertsen et al 2016 micropruina kong et al 2004 etc municipal wastewater also contains complex and diverse carbon sources given the key role of the carbon uptake bioenergetics in the competition between paos and gaos it is necessary to understand their bioenergetic behaviors in full scale plants for the uptake of different carbon sources fifteen activated samples were collected from five full scale wwtps the community composition was analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fresh activated sludge

pmf uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone cccp the f1 f0 atpase inhibitor n n dicyclohexylcarboiimide dccd and the fumarate reductase inhibitor oxantel further attempts were made to relate the community compositions to the observed carbon uptake bioenergetic behaviors to provide insights into the carbon uptake mechanisms of representative paos and gaos in full scale systems to the best of the authors knowledge this work represents the first comprehensive investigation of the carbon uptake bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale ebpr systems the outcomes are expected to enhance our understanding in the interactions competitions among and within pao and gao lineages benefiting the development of novel strategies for community regulation in ebpr systems 2 materials and

uncoupling of the transmembrane proton gradient it does not directly inhibit f1 f0 atpase or fumarate reductase but effectively dissipates the pmf generated via these two enzymes anaerobic conditions

and asv327 members were detected but with low relative abundances fig 1a a majority of clades i and ii members were shown to be incapable of utilizing acetate for ebpr the high occurrence of clade iii members was probably a result of their ability to use both acetate and amino acids nguyen et al 2011 overall the total relative abundances of tetrasphaera in these full scale systems were lower than

clade iii members of tetrasparea microlunatus phosphovorus halomonas and tessaracoccus are capable of taking up acetate and or propionate anaerobically nakamura et al 1995 maszenan et al al 1999 nguyen et al 2011 nguyen et al 2012 qiu et al 2019 supplementary table s2 for gaos ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 defluviicoccus oehmen et al 2005b onetto et al 2019 and micropruina are known as effectively acetate and propionate users mcilroy et al 2018 supplementary table s2 when acetate or propionate was used as a carbon source cccp showed high inhibition 75 9 90 1 for acetate and 68 6 81 6 for propionate of p release for all samples suggesting that paos from all lineages largely relied on pmf for the uptake of these two carbon sources fig 2 a and 2c the inhibitions of carbon uptake by cccp were significantly lower than those of p release fig 2b and 2d implying that gaos generally relied less on pmf for acetate or propionate uptake than paos this result was supported by the reduced p c ratios in the cccp treatments than in the control fig 3 suggesting that although both paos and gaos were inhibited gaos obtained more carbon sources than paos at the presence of cccp although paos and gaos both relied on pmf the mechanisms for pmf generation were largely different figs 2 and 3 paos showed less susceptibility to dccd an f1 f0 atpase inhibitor inhibition rates below 6 4 and 11 7 for acetate and propionate respectively except for wwtp3 1 and wwtp4 1 and oxantel a fumarate reductase inhibitor 3 7 and 5 3 in average for acetate and propionate respective fig 2a and c showing that the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase and the fumarate reduction coupled proton translocation were not intensively required for the generation of pmf for these paos in contrast high inhibitions by dccd up to 35 7 and 49 2 respectively and oxantel up to 61 0 and 49 0 respectively fig 2b and d and supplementary table s3 s7 were observed for acetate and propionate uptake by gaos suggesting their high dependencies on the fumarate reduction and the f1 f0 atpase pathways for pmf generation additionally the sum of the inhibition rates by dccd and oxantel was not always equal to these by cccp for each sample supplementary fig s20 suggesting that gaos may also involve other unknown pathways for the generation of pmf for carbon uptake significantly increased p c ratios at the presence of dccd or oxantel than control fig 3a and supplementary tables s3 s7 pointed to a fact that oxantel and dccd have selectively inhibited gaos with little impacts on carbon uptake by paos reflected by the largely uncharged p release profiles supplementary fig s5 s19 3 3 2 bioenergetic uptake behaviors were similar between acetate and propionate previous research on enrichment cultures of ca accumulibacter paos and ca competibacter gaos suggested that pmf is a key driving force for acetate uptake saunders et al 2007 mcilroy et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 whereas burow et al 2008 showed that pmf only explained 28 acetate uptake by an enrichment culture of defluviicoccus gao our results demonstrated that in all samples pmf was a major driving force for vfa uptake by diverse paos and gaos even for a defluviicoccus dominated community wwtp4 1 fig 1 pmf explained a majority 73 0 supplementary table s6 of the carbon uptake contrasting the previous understanding that defluviicoccus has a low dependency on pmf for acetate uptake burow et al 2008 in full scale systems wastewater was fed in continuously resulting in low substrate concentrations which would essentially select for microorganisms that rely more on active transport e g pmf for carbon uptake the driving force for propionate uptake by paos or gaos was previously unknown our results showed that similar to acetate pmf is a key driving force for propionate uptake by paos and gaos in full scale systems fig 3 and 4 the uptake of these two vfas was considered to be achieved via the same transporter i e the acetate proton symporter actp garcia martin et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 since actp is energized by pmf it is reasonable that both propionate and acetate uptake showed high sensitivity to cccp a cluster analysis further confirmed that in these full scale plants the carbon uptake bioenergetics for acetate and propionate were largely similar supplementary fig s21 3 3 3 fine scale differences in bioenergetics for vfa uptake apart from the major differences between paos and gaos fine scale differences were observed among samples with different pao gao compositions implying that the paos gaos from different lineages may have degenerated tendencies in energy generation for acetate and propionate uptake no ca accumulibacter was detected in wwtp5 1 applicable p release was still observed when acetate was used supplementary fig s17 suggesting that other paos indeed used acetate as a carbon source for ebpr this sample also showed high dependency on pmf for acetate uptake fig 2a showing that the dominated paos e g tetrasphaera in this sample might have higher demands on pmf than ca accumulibacter this hypothesis was supported by wwtp3 3 where the highest relative abundance was observed for ca accumulibacter 0 49 but the lowest inhibition was observed with cccp 76 0 additionally wwtp4 1 was the only sample where significant dccd inhibition of both acetate and propionate uptake occurred fig 2a and 2c halomonas showed distinctively high relative abundance in wwtp4 1 as compared to other samples suggesting that this pao might be responsible for the high dccd inhibition observed in this sample i e they might have a higher dependency on f1 f0 atpase than other paos additionally high inhibition of p release by dccd was observed with acetate but not propionate in wwtp3 1 fig 2a and c and supplementary table s5 previous study showed that tessaracoccus were able to metabolize acetate but not propionate maszenan et al 1999 the high occurrence of tessaracoccus 0 15 in this sample may have resulted in its different responses to dccd with different carbon sources compared to p release fig 2a and c the inhibitions of carbon uptake fig 2b and d showed much higher variations among samples fig 4 suggesting that gaos were more variable in carbon uptake bioenergetics extremely high relative abundance of defluviicoccus 5 12 dominated by asv22 the relative abundances of other gaos were low i e ca competibacter 0 35 micropruina glycogenica 0 45 and nakamurella multipartita 0 21 was observed in wwtp4 1 than other plants all below 1 0 fig 1b this sample also showed high susceptibility towards oxantel 61 1 and 43 6 but low inhibition by dccd 7 1 and 12 6 when acetate or propionate was used as a carbon source fig 2b and 2d and supplementary table s6 suggesting high dependency of defluviicoccus asv22 a cluster ii member on fumarate reductase for pmf generation for acetate and propionate uptake in wwtp5 the total relative abundances of ca competibacter predominated by asv42 were 5 39 5 04 and 3 16 in wwtp5 1 5 2 and 5 3 respectively with low amounts of defluviicoccus 0 51 0 82 and 1 23 and micropruina 0 38 0 31 and 0 55 the corresponding cccp inhibition ratios of acetate uptake by gaos in these samples were 79 7 75 9 and 65 2 respectively calculated by deducting the part taken up by paos supplementary fig s20 and the corresponding inhibition ratios by oxantel were 51 2 45 4 and 28 0 respectively supplementary table s7 there was a clear positive correlation between the relative abundances of ca competibacter and the inhibition of acetate uptake by cccp and oxantel nevertheless a ca competibacter asv5 100 similarity to a subgroup 1 sequence hq158666 ji and chen 2010 dominated sample wwtp2 1 showed higher inhibition by dccd suggesting the asv s higher dependency on f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation these results implied differences in carbon uptake bioenergetics within the ca competibacter lineage indeed saunders et al 2007 reported an enrichment culture of ca competibacter which highly 81 relied on f1 f0 atpase to generate pmf for acetate uptake although fumarate reductase was predicted to contribute to pmf generation for ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 the hypothesis was not testified previously results obtained in this work suggested that ca competibacter in full scale systems used fumarate reductase more than f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation for the uptake of acetate and propionate supplementary fig s20a and s20b actually there was an overall trend that gaos in these full scale plants have higher dependency on fumarate reductase than f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation fig 2b but there was also a trend that dccd inhibition was generally higher for the uptake of propionate than acetate fig 2d according to gao metabolic models less glycolysis 0 67 versus 1 12 c mol c mol is required for the uptake of propionate than acetate zeng et al 2003 oehmen et al 2006 which would result in lower amounts of surplus reducing power to be consumed via the tca cycle thus less pmf was generated via the fumarate reductase 3 4 amino acid uptake bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale systems paos which are capable of metabolizing amino acids include tetrasphaera kong et al 2004 nguyen et al 2011 microlunatus phosphovorus nakamura et al 1995 and members from the ca accumulibacter lineages qiu et al 2020 supplementary table s2 gaos which are considered to be able to assimilate amino acids comprise defluviicoccus onetto et al 2019 micropruina glycogenica mcilroy et al 2018 and nakamurella multipartita tice et al 2010 supplementary table s2 3 4 1 pmf is the key driving force for amino acid uptake when glutamate or aspartate was used as a carbon source similar to those observed for acetate and propionate cccp showed high inhibitions of both p release and carbon uptake suggesting that pmf was also a key driving force for the uptake of these two amino acids by paos and gaos however different from acetate and propionate fig 2a and c both oxantel 2 2 29 3 and dccd 5 6 55 2 inhibited p release remarkably fig 2e and g suggesting that paos in a general sense required the operation of fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase to generate pmf for the uptake of these two amino acids 3 4 2 fine scale differences in bioenergetics for amino acid uptake the detailed metabolic traits of glutamate or aspartate utilization by tetraspharea or microlunatus phosphovorus paos were unknown recent research on ca accumulibacter suggested that the uptake of aspartate and glutamate were achieved via a glutamate proton symporter gltp fully energized by pmf half of the aspartate was oxidatively deaminized to oxaloacetate and to acetyl coa the other half was converted into fumarate which was further reduced to succinate and to propionyl coa qiu et al 2020 along the fumarate reduction pathway pmf was generated contributing to aspartate uptake the inhibition of oxantel on p release of paos suggested that other paos might employed a similar pathway as shown for ca accumulibacter clade iif stain scelse1 qiu et al 2020 interestingly oxantel also showed inhibition on glutamate uptake and glutamate induced p release as suggested by qiu et al 2020 the uptake and transformation of glutamate by ca accumulibacter did not seem to have involved mechanisms related to fumarate reductase a majority of glutamate was not routed to the tca cycle owing to the lack of a gene encoding the nadh dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in the ca accumulibacter genome pha formation was observed when glutamate was used as a carbon source in all fifteen samples although with glutamate uptake to pha formation ratios 0 04 0 24 mol c mol c significantly lower than those observed for aspartate 0 28 0 45 mol c mol c supplementary table s3 s7 additionally detectable glycogen consumption 0 13 0 56 mol c mol c supplementary table s3 s7 was observed together with glutamate uptake the pha formation and glycogen consumption were significantly inhibited at the presence of oxantel supplementary fig s22 supplementary tables s3 s7 collectively these results suggested the presence of a distinct glutamate metabolic pathway in these full scale systems where a fraction of glutamate might have been routed to tca cycle via ketoglutarate with additional reducing power being consumed via the reductive branch of the tca cycle involving the activity of fumarate reductase 3 5 relating carbon uptake bioenergetics to pao gao community compositions pearson correlation fig 5 and cca analysis fig 6 were performed to further analyze the relationship between community composition and associated carbon acetate propionate glutamate or aspartate uptake mechanisms as suggested by the cca analysis for acetate and propionate the responses of p release to different inhibitors were distinctly separated from those of toc fig 6a and b the pao community e g ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus halomonas and tetrasphaera generally correlated with p release related vectors and the gao community e g ca competibacter with toc related ones fig 6a and b the same pattern was shown by the pearson correlation analysis where pao asvs generally correlated with p release related factors and gao asvs with toc related ones fig 5a again manifesting that paos and gaos in full scale systems were largely different in carbon uptake bioenergetic characteristics when acetate or propionate was used as a carbon source specifically high dependency of gaos on fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase for the generation of pmf for carbon uptake supplementary fig s23 within each specific lineage high variability was observed among different asvs showing that high level of fine scale micro diversity in carbon uptake bioenergetics was well reserved within each lineage as a result each entire lineage total population for instance tetraspheara tessaracoccus microprunia glycogenica or ca competibacter did not show clear fondness of a specific energy generation pathway fig 5 for paos the flexibility in energy generation for carbon uptake may have been a result of their versatility in employing either glycolysis or tca cycle or both to generate the reducing power in their anaerobic metabolism he and mcmahon 2011a 2011b depending on the availability of glycogen zhou et al 2009 the anaerobic tca cycle might operate in three modes i e the full comeau et al 1986 partial the glyoxylate shunt louie et al 2000 and split ones hesselmann et al 2000 oehmen et al 2007 zhou et al 2010 either the full or the split tca cycle involves the activity of fumarate reductase he and mcmahon 2011a 2011b the inhibition of oxantel on p release although it is low i e 3 7 and 5 3 in average for acetate and propionate respectively fig 2a and c suggested the potential involvement of either the full or split tca cycle by paos predominantly microlunatus phosphovorus and tetrasphaera asv 219 as suggested by the pearson correlation analysis fig 5 different from glycolysis there is no atp generation in the glyoxylate shunt pathway the involvement of this pathway would result in increased poly p hydrolysis to generate additional atp for the activation of the same amount of acetate or propionate double the amount of these required in the glycolysis model if all the reducing power was generated via the glyoxylate shunt based on the pmf balance qiu et al 2020 showed that when nadh was fully generated from glycolysis the amount of poly p hydrolysis and resultant efflux of po4 3 p was insufficient to provide all the pmf required for acetate uptake around 25 pmf was generated via the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase at the expense of atp that is to say if more than 25 of the reducing power was provided via the glyoxylate shunt pathway the amount of po4 3 p generated via poly p hydrolysis would be sufficient to generate enough pmf for acetate uptake no reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase would be required the low involvements of reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase 6 4 and 11 7 for acetate and propionate uptake respectively fig 2 in the full scale plants suggested extensive employments of the glyoxylate shunt pathway for the generation of the reducing power by paos in these plants metatranscriptomic analysis also showed the activation of the tca cycle for reducing power generation by paos in field samples law et al 2016 in contrast the high correlation between the total population of ca accumulibacter as well as the total population of halomonas tessaracoccus asvs 596 and 603 and tetrasphaera asvs 187 and 219 fig 5 and dccd suggested that these microorganisms in full scale plants mainly rely on glycolysis for reducing power generation the result was supported by the high correlation between the extent of dccd inhibition on glycogen consumption and the relative abundance of ca accumulibacter supplementary fig s22 for gaos although most of the known ones to date seem to employ the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway for glycolysis genomic study showed that some species ca competibacter denitrificans mcilroy et al 2014 also encode a entner doudoroff ed pathway compared to emp pathway ed pathway generates the same amount of reducing power 2 3 mol nadh for the conversion of 1 c mol of glycogen to pyruvate but less atp 1 3 mol and 1 2 mol per 1 c mol of glycogen for ed and emp pathway respectively to generate the same amount of atp required for acetate activation increased amount by 33 of glycolysis is required for the ed pathway which in turn generates increased amount of reducing power the increased amount of reducing power needs to be consumed by routing increased amount of carbon acetyl coa to the reductive breach of the tca cycle which would result in increased generation of pmf via fumarate reductase the involvement of the f1 f0 atpase would thus be lowered in this regard high sensitivity to oxantel might suggest a high involvement of the ed pathway for glycolysis defluviicoccus and nakamurella multipartia fig 5 in contrast high dependency on the f1 f0 atpase might indicate the predominant use of the emp pathway ca contendobacter and some ca competibacter fig 5 by comparing the results from literatures with the metabolic model predictions oehman et al 2010 suggested that under high temperature gaos tend to employ ed pathway as indicated by their higher glycogen utilization and pha production a shift in their glycolysis metabolism from emp to ed pathways would allow them to maximize their pha storage and achieve higher biomass production this might explain the generally high sensitivity of gaos in these full scale plants to oxantel than to dccd since the operating temperature in these plants was in a high range 28 c these results also highlight a higher potential to selectively inhibit gaos for community regulation in these wwtps e g via potentially applying fumarate reductase inhibitors e g oxantel to the anaerobic tanks or the influent wastewater since paos rarely used this pathway for carbon uptake additionally oxantel may also have the potential to be applied to lab scale vfa fed bioreactors to facilitate and accelerate the selection and enrichment of paos for metabolic studies for amino acids glutamate and aspartate although the pao community was separated from the gao community in the cca analysis fig 6c and d the p related vectors were mixed up with toc related ones suggesting that the bioenergetic characteristics of paos and gaos for the uptake of two amino acids were not as distinctly different as those of vfas based on the pearson correlation ca accumulibacter and microlunatus phosphovorus seemed to have higher dependency on pmf while tetrasphaera likely have a higher sensitivity to dccd fig 5 ca accumulibacter clade iif strain scelse1 was shown to take up these two amino acids via a proton glutamate aspartate symporter gltp fully driven by pmf qiu et al 2020 apart from gltp there is another set of transporter systems reserved in the genomes of ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus and tetrasphaera for the uptake of these two amino acids i e the glutamate aspartate abc transporter complex to date the detailed glutamate aspartate uptake mechanisms of tetrasphaera and microlunatus phosphovorus are still unknown as suggested by kristiansen et al 2013 all four tetrasphaera genomes encode the glutamate aspartate abc transporter complex but no gltp related genes were annotated in these genomes since abc transport is energized by atp the high correlation between the total population of tetrasphaera and the inhibition of p release by dccd possibly suggested that tetrasphaera take up these two amino acids via the abc transporter while the correlation between the total population of microlunatus phosphovorus and the inhibition of p release by cccp suggested that microlunatus phosphovorus may behave similarly as ca accumulibacter to testify the hypothesis experiments were performed on microlunatus phosphovorus strain nm 1 to understand their amino acid uptake mechanisms as expected cccp showed remarkable 78 inhibitions of the p release and carbon uptake supplementary fig s24 supporting the hypothesis that microlunatus phosphovorus shared similar amino acid uptake bioenergetics with ca accumulibacter overall fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase activities were intensively involved in the uptake and metabolism of glutamate and aspartate by both paos and gaos in the full scale plants thus limited room was left for the regulation of their interaction via selective inhibition when amino acids were used as carbon sources 4 conclusions five wwtps harbored distinct and diverse paos tetrasphaera ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus etc and gaos ca competibacter defluviicoccus micropruina etc which were capable of using acetate propionate glutamate and aspartate despite the distinct community compositions pmf was found as a key driving force not only for the uptake of acetate propionate but for the uptake of glutamate and aspartate by both paos and gaos including defluviicoccus paos showed generally higher dependency on pmf for the uptake of these carbon sources than gaos paos and gaos in full scale wwtps showed community level universal and major differences in carbon uptake bioenergetics paos rarely activated fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase for the uptake of acetate and propionate whereas high dependency on these two pathways were shown for gaos gaos in the field generally depend more on fumarate reductase than f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation the application of the inhibitors targeting these two pathways selectively inhibited the carbon uptake by gaos different from acetate and propionate both paos and gaos highly relied on fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase for the uptake of amino acids glutamate or aspartate high level of fine scale micro diversity in carbon uptake bioenergetics was observed among and within different pao gao lineages ca accumulibacter and halomonas seemed to show higher dependency on the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase to generate pmf for acetate propionate uptake than other paos different from tetrasphaera but similar to ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus take up glutamate and aspartate via the proton glutamate aspartate symporter driven by pmf declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16089,this work analyzed for the first time the bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps for the uptake of different carbon sources fifteen samples were collected from five full scale wwtps predominance of different paos i e ca accumulibacter 0 00 0 49 tetrasphaera 0 37 3 94 microlunatus phosphovorus 0 01 0 18 etc and gaos i e ca competibacter 0 08 5 39

found as the key driving force up to 90 1 for the uptake of volatile fatty acids vfas acetate and propionate and amino acids glutamate and aspartate by both gaos and paos at the community level contrasting the previous understanding that defluviicoccus have a low demand of pmf for acetate uptake for the uptake of acetate or propionate paos rarely activated f1 f0 atpase 11 7 or fumarate reductase 5 3 for pmf generation whereas intensive involvements of these two pathways up to 49 2 and 61 0 respectively were observed for gaos highlighting a major and community level difference in their vfa uptake biogenetics in full scale systems however different from vfas the uptake of glutamate and aspartate by both paos and gaos commonly involved fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase activities apart from these major and community level differences high level fine scale micro diversity in carbon uptake bioenergetics was observed within pao and gao lineages probably resulting from their versatilities in employing different pathways for reducing power generation ca accumulibacter and halomonas seemed to show higher dependency on the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase than other paos likely due to the low involvement of glyoxylate shunt pathway unlike tetrasphaera but similar to ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus took up glutamate and aspartate via the proton glutamate aspartate symporter driven by pmf this feature was testified using a pure culture of microlunatus phosphovorus stain nm 1 the major difference between paos and gaos highlights the potential to selectively suppress gaos for community regulation in ebpr systems the finer scale carbon uptake bioenergetics of paos or gaos from different lineages benefits in understanding their interactions

performance due to the occurrence of competing bacteria namely glycogen accumulating organisms gaos wong et al 2005 meyer et al 2006 wang et al 2021 gaos compete with paos for carbon sources but do not contribute to p removal the proliferation of which was considered as an important factor influencing the stability of ebpr lópez vázquez et al 2008 mcilroy et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the capability to obtain carbon sources is an important factor determining which group of bacteria paos or gaos would predominate the competition as a model pao the carbon uptake metabolism of cadidatus accumulibacter has been extensively studied their acetate uptake is achieved via a proton acetate symporter actp driven by proton motive force pmf the pmf is mainly generated via the efflux of proton h in symport with phosphate produced during poly p hydrolysis via the inorganic phosphate transporter pit garcia martin et al 2006 saunders et al 2007 burow et al 2008 qiu et al al 2020 when the pmf generated via the proton coupled phosphate symport was insufficient to cover that required for acetate uptake ca accumulibacter activated the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase to generate additional pmf at the expense of atp qiu et al 2020 different from ca accumulibacter gaos could not generate pmf via the efflux of phosphate due to the lack of intracellular poly p storage using an enrichment culture of defluviicoccus burow et al 2008 showed that pmf only contributed to a minor portion 28 of acetate uptake by defluviicoccus the pmf was mainly generated via anaerobic fumarate reduction coupled proton translocation catalyzed by fumarate reductase other than the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase the authors also hypothesized that a large proportion of acetate uptake was achieved via diffusion through acetate permease acs since diffusion may only be efficient at high extracellular acetate concentrations defluviicoccus were considered inefficient in competing with ca accumulibacter at low acetate concentrations by applying a slow feeding strategy tu and schuler 2013 demonstrated that lowering the in tank acetate concentrations effectively trigged the outcompetition of defluviicoccus cluster ii by ca accumulibacter in an impaired ebpr reactor similarly slow feeding strategy was shown to be effective in obtaining a highly enriched ca accumulibacter culture at high temperature 30 c qiu et al 2020 whereas certain lineage of defluviicoccus i e cluster iii members which were commonly found at high relative abundances in full scale systems mcilroy et al 2010 qiu et al 2019 onetto et al 2019 did survive under the low in tank acetate conditions in the long term qiu et al 2022 implying that they might have distinct carbon uptake bioenergetics from those analyzed by burow et al 2008 and tu and schuler 2013 on the other hand ca competibacter as gaos were shown to take up acetate fully rely on pmf 100 where the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase was the major source 81 of pmf generation saunders et al 2007 based on metagenomic analysis fumarate reductase was hypothesized to contribute to the generation of pmf required for acetate uptake by ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 however the hypothesis has yet to be testified the high dependency of ca competibacter on pmf for acetate uptake may explain their capability to survive and coexist with ca accumulibacter in full scale plants qiu et al 2019 and lab scale reactors employing slow feeding strategies qiu et al 2022 additionally current understanding of the carbon uptake bioenergetics is limited to the above mentioned paos and gaos obtained in enrichment cultures with acetate as a carbon source the bioenergetic characteristics of paos and gaos mentioned above for the uptake of other carbon sources as well as those of other paos or gaos for the uptake of any carbon sources are still not clear full scale ebpr plants harbor a wide range of paos including ca accumulibacter seviour et al 2003 halomonas nguyen et al 2012 tetrasphaera kong et al 2005 liu et al 2019 microlunatus phosphovorus nakamura et al 1995 dechloromonas kong et al 2007 petriglieri et al 2021 ca

sources given the key role of the carbon uptake bioenergetics in the competition between paos and gaos it is necessary to understand their bioenergetic behaviors in full scale plants for the uptake of different carbon sources fifteen activated samples were collected from five full scale wwtps the community composition was analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fresh activated sludge samples were subjected to anaerobic p release and carbon uptake assay using different carbon sources acetate propionate glutamate and aspartate with the presence absence of different inhibitors the pmf uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone cccp the f1 f0 atpase inhibitor n n dicyclohexylcarboiimide dccd and the fumarate reductase inhibitor oxantel further attempts were made to relate the community compositions to the observed carbon uptake bioenergetic behaviors to provide insights into the carbon uptake mechanisms of representative paos and gaos in full scale systems to the best of the authors knowledge this work represents the first comprehensive investigation of the carbon uptake bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale ebpr systems the outcomes are expected to enhance our understanding in the interactions competitions among and within pao and gao lineages benefiting the development of novel strategies for community regulation in ebpr systems 2 materials and

and asv327 members were detected but with low relative abundances fig 1a a majority of clades i and ii members were shown to be incapable of utilizing acetate for ebpr the high occurrence of clade iii members was probably a result of their ability to use both acetate and amino acids nguyen et al 2011 overall the total relative abundances of tetrasphaera in these full scale systems were lower than those found in danish wwtps 5 as indicated by fluorescence in situ hybridization microautoradiography fish mar and 9 9 11 9 as suggested by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing nguyen et al 2011 nielsen

et al 2013 the third most abundant asv 2107 was closely related to a clade iia member 99 79 similarity to ef565156 he et al 2007 despite the fact that some unique metabolic traits were shown for certain clades of ca accumulibacter in terms of denitrification capability and oxygen or phosphate affinities etc skennerton et al 2015 nurmiyanto et al 2017 camejo et al 2019 rubio rincón et al 2019 roy et al 2021 no distinguishing feature in carbon uptake characteristics was reported for these two specific clades iia and iib their high occurrences were commonly detected in full scale systems he et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 generally the relative abundances of ca accumulibacter in five wwtps were in the lower range of those found in other full scale systems 0 5 3 8 by 16s rrna

the highest relative abundances up to 0 08 fig 1a asv1050 is identical to 100 similarity the model strain of microlunatus phosphovorus strain nm 1 nr074642 nakamura et al 1995 as a fermentative pao microlunatus phosphovorus were shown to be capable of utilizing both acetate and amino acids anaerobically akar et al 2006 other paos e g halomonas and ca obscuribacter were present but with low

asv22 which were highly enriched 4 55 in wwtp4 1 asv22 is a cluster ii one of the three clusters of the defluviicoccus genus member closely related 99 54 similarity to a sequence obtained from a lab scale ebpr eu332810 mcilroy et al 2008 previous research suggested that cluster ii defluviicoccus enriched in a lab scale reactor did not extensively employ pmf 28 for acetate uptake burow et al 2008 cluster iii members asv134 affiliated to nostocoida limicola like morphotype defluviicoccus seviourii onetto et al 2019 were also detected and showed the highest occurrence in wwtp2 3 0 83 followed by wwtp5 3 0 49 nostocoida limicola like cluster iii members were previously observed to effectively survive low acetate conditions qiu et al 2022 implying that they may have distinct carbon uptake bioenergetics from their tetra forming relatives i e the cluster ii members which were shown to have low dependency on pmf for acetate uptake burow et al 2008 tu and schuler 2013 apart from ca competibacter and defluviicoccus high occurrences of micropruina 37 asvs were observed five asvs 58 424 589 755 and 767 were predominant where asvs 58 and 424 showed the highest relative abundances up

micropruina were shown to store both acetate and glucose as pha without p cycling mcilroy et al 2018 other gaos e g nakamurella multipartite and ca contendobacter were present at low relative abundances up to 0 18 overall five wwtps harbored a diverse range of paos and gaos commonly detected in worldwide wwtps gu et al 2008 law et al 2016 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 the pao gao community compositions were different among plants and showed dynamics among different sampling events providing appropriate specimens for the investigation of the carbon uptake bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale systems 3 3 vfa uptake bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale systems systematic tests were performed to analyze the anaerobic p release and carbon uptake behaviors with different carbon sources i e acetate propionate glutamate and aspartate in the presence absence of selective inhibitors targeting different transporters and or energy generation pathways i e the pmf uncoupler cccp the f1 f0 atpase inhibitor dccd targeting the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase in consumption of atp for proton translocation and pmf generation and the fumarate reductase inhibitor oxantel inhibiting fumarate reduction coupled proton translocation in control assays without inhibitors all samples showed detectable p release and carbon uptake with each carbon source acetate propionate glutamate or aspartate supplementary fig s5 s19 suggesting the presence of paos gaos which were capable of using these carbon sources among these carbon sources acetate induced the highest p release 3 01 13 64 mg p ss with p release to carbon uptake p c ratios of 0 11 0 43 mol p mol c followed by propionate 2 74 8 20 mg p g ss with p c ratios of 0 08 0 31 mol p mol c aspartate 1 63 8 30 mg p g ss with p c ratios of 0 09 0 40 mol p mol c and glutamate 1 60 7 35 mg p g ss with p c ratios of 0 08 0 39 mol p mol c supplementary tables s3 s7 in wwtp5 where ca competibacter were the dominant gao fig 1 the carbon uptake rates were 14 42 15 47 and 11 84 12 42 mg c g ss for acetate and propionate supplementary table s7 respectively while in wwtp4 where defluviicoccus were the dominant gao the carbon uptake rates were 7 93 9 91 mg c g ss for acetate and 8 73 10 32 mg c g ss for propionate supplementary table s6 suggesting that ca competibacter or defluviicoccus in these plants did not have significant preference of one vfa over another 3 3 1 paos and gaos showed major differences in vfa uptake bioenergetics among all paos ca accumlibacter clade iii members of tetrasparea microlunatus phosphovorus halomonas and tessaracoccus are capable of taking up acetate and or propionate anaerobically nakamura et al 1995 maszenan et al al 1999 nguyen et al 2011 nguyen et al 2012 qiu et al 2019 supplementary table s2 for gaos ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 defluviicoccus oehmen et al 2005b onetto et al 2019 and micropruina are known as effectively acetate and propionate users mcilroy et al 2018 supplementary table s2 when acetate or propionate was used as a carbon source cccp showed high inhibition 75 9 90 1 for acetate and 68 6 81 6 for propionate of p release for all samples suggesting that paos from all lineages largely relied on pmf for the uptake of these two carbon sources fig 2 a and 2c the inhibitions of carbon uptake by cccp were significantly lower than those of p release fig 2b and 2d implying that gaos generally relied less on pmf for acetate or propionate uptake than paos this result was supported by the reduced p c ratios in the cccp treatments than in the control fig 3 suggesting that although both paos and gaos were inhibited gaos obtained more carbon sources than paos at the presence of cccp although paos and gaos both relied on pmf the mechanisms for pmf generation were largely different figs 2 and 3 paos showed less susceptibility to dccd an f1 f0 atpase inhibitor inhibition rates below 6 4 and 11 7 for acetate and propionate respectively except for wwtp3 1 and wwtp4 1 and oxantel a fumarate reductase inhibitor 3 7 and 5 3 in average for acetate and propionate respective fig 2a and c showing that the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase and the fumarate reduction coupled proton translocation were not intensively required for the generation of pmf for these paos in contrast high inhibitions by dccd up to 35 7 and 49 2 respectively and oxantel up to 61 0 and 49 0 respectively fig 2b and d and supplementary table s3 s7 were observed for acetate and propionate uptake by gaos suggesting their high dependencies on the fumarate reduction and the f1 f0 atpase pathways for pmf generation additionally the sum of the inhibition rates by dccd and oxantel was not always equal to these by cccp for each sample supplementary fig s20 suggesting that gaos may also involve other unknown pathways for the generation of pmf for carbon uptake significantly increased p c ratios at the presence of dccd or oxantel than control fig 3a and supplementary tables s3 s7 pointed to a fact that oxantel and dccd have selectively inhibited gaos with little impacts on carbon uptake by paos reflected by the largely uncharged p release profiles supplementary fig s5 s19 3 3 2 bioenergetic uptake behaviors were similar between acetate and propionate previous research on enrichment cultures of ca accumulibacter paos and ca competibacter gaos suggested that pmf is a key driving force for acetate uptake saunders et al 2007 mcilroy et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 whereas burow et al 2008 showed that pmf only explained 28 acetate uptake by an enrichment culture of defluviicoccus gao our results demonstrated that in all samples pmf was a major driving force for vfa uptake by diverse paos and gaos even for a defluviicoccus dominated community wwtp4 1 fig 1 pmf explained a majority 73 0 supplementary table s6 of the carbon uptake contrasting the previous understanding that defluviicoccus has a low dependency on pmf for acetate uptake burow et al 2008 in full scale systems wastewater was fed in continuously resulting in low substrate concentrations which would essentially select for microorganisms that rely more on active transport e g pmf for carbon uptake the driving force for propionate uptake by paos or gaos was previously unknown our results showed that similar to acetate pmf is a key driving force for propionate uptake by paos and gaos in full scale systems fig 3 and 4 the uptake of these two vfas was considered to be achieved via the same transporter i e the acetate proton symporter actp garcia martin et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 since actp is energized by pmf it is reasonable that both propionate and acetate uptake showed high sensitivity to cccp a cluster analysis further confirmed that in these full scale plants the carbon uptake bioenergetics for acetate and propionate were largely similar supplementary fig s21 3 3 3 fine scale differences in bioenergetics for vfa uptake apart from the major differences between paos and gaos fine scale differences were observed among samples with different pao gao compositions implying that the paos gaos from different lineages may have degenerated tendencies in energy generation for acetate and propionate uptake no ca accumulibacter was detected in wwtp5 1 applicable p release was still observed when acetate was used supplementary fig s17 suggesting that other paos indeed used acetate as a carbon source for ebpr this sample also showed high dependency on pmf for acetate uptake fig 2a showing that the dominated paos e g tetrasphaera in this sample might have higher demands on pmf than ca accumulibacter this hypothesis was supported by wwtp3 3 where the highest relative abundance was observed for ca accumulibacter 0 49 but the lowest inhibition was observed with cccp 76 0 additionally wwtp4 1 was the only sample where significant dccd inhibition of both acetate and propionate uptake occurred fig 2a and 2c halomonas showed distinctively high relative abundance in wwtp4 1 as compared to other samples suggesting that this pao might be responsible for the high dccd inhibition observed in this sample i e they might have a higher dependency on f1 f0 atpase than other paos additionally high inhibition of p release by dccd was observed with acetate but not propionate in wwtp3 1 fig 2a and c and supplementary table s5 previous study showed that tessaracoccus were able to metabolize acetate but not propionate maszenan et al 1999 the high occurrence of tessaracoccus 0 15 in this sample may have resulted in its different responses to dccd with different carbon sources compared to p release fig 2a and c the inhibitions of carbon uptake fig 2b and d showed much higher variations among samples fig 4 suggesting that gaos were more variable in carbon uptake bioenergetics extremely high relative abundance of defluviicoccus 5 12 dominated by asv22 the relative abundances of other gaos were low i e ca competibacter 0 35 micropruina glycogenica 0 45 and nakamurella multipartita 0 21 was observed in wwtp4 1 than other plants all below 1 0 fig 1b this sample also showed high susceptibility towards oxantel 61 1 and 43 6 but low inhibition by dccd 7 1 and 12 6 when acetate or propionate was used as a carbon source fig 2b and 2d and supplementary table s6 suggesting high dependency of defluviicoccus asv22 a cluster ii member on fumarate reductase for pmf generation for acetate and propionate uptake in wwtp5 the total relative abundances of ca competibacter predominated by asv42 were 5 39 5 04 and 3 16 in wwtp5 1 5 2 and 5 3 respectively with low amounts of defluviicoccus 0 51 0 82 and 1 23 and micropruina 0 38 0 31 and 0 55 the corresponding cccp inhibition ratios of acetate uptake by gaos in these samples were 79 7 75 9 and 65 2 respectively calculated by deducting the part taken up by paos supplementary fig s20 and the corresponding inhibition ratios by oxantel were 51 2 45 4 and 28 0 respectively supplementary table s7 there was a clear positive correlation between the relative abundances of ca competibacter and the inhibition of acetate uptake by cccp and oxantel nevertheless a ca competibacter asv5 100 similarity to a subgroup 1 sequence hq158666 ji and chen 2010 dominated sample wwtp2 1 showed higher inhibition by dccd suggesting the asv s higher dependency on f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation these results implied differences in carbon uptake bioenergetics within the ca competibacter lineage indeed saunders et al 2007 reported an enrichment culture of ca competibacter which highly 81 relied on f1 f0 atpase to generate pmf for acetate uptake although fumarate reductase was predicted to contribute to pmf generation for ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 the hypothesis was not testified previously results obtained in this work suggested that ca competibacter in full scale systems used fumarate reductase more than f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation for the uptake of acetate and propionate supplementary fig s20a and s20b actually there was an overall trend that gaos in these full scale plants have higher dependency on fumarate reductase than f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation fig 2b but there was also a trend that dccd inhibition was generally higher for the uptake of propionate than acetate fig 2d according to gao metabolic models less glycolysis 0 67 versus 1 12 c mol c mol is required for the uptake of propionate than acetate zeng et al 2003 oehmen et al 2006 which would result in lower amounts of surplus reducing power to be consumed via the tca cycle thus less pmf was generated via the fumarate reductase 3 4 amino acid uptake bioenergetics of paos and gaos in full scale systems paos which are capable of metabolizing amino acids include tetrasphaera kong et al 2004 nguyen et al 2011 microlunatus phosphovorus nakamura et al 1995 and members from the ca accumulibacter lineages qiu et al 2020 supplementary table s2 gaos which are considered to be able to assimilate amino acids comprise defluviicoccus onetto et al 2019 micropruina glycogenica mcilroy et al 2018 and nakamurella multipartita tice et al 2010 supplementary table s2 3 4 1 pmf is the key driving force for amino acid uptake when glutamate or aspartate was used as a carbon source similar to those observed for acetate and propionate cccp showed high inhibitions of both p release and carbon uptake suggesting that pmf was also a key driving force for the uptake of these two amino acids by paos and gaos however different from acetate and propionate fig 2a and c both oxantel 2 2 29 3 and dccd 5 6 55 2 inhibited p release remarkably fig 2e and g suggesting that paos in a general sense required the operation of fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase to generate pmf for the uptake of these two amino acids 3 4 2 fine scale differences in bioenergetics for amino acid uptake the detailed metabolic traits of glutamate or aspartate utilization by tetraspharea or microlunatus phosphovorus paos were unknown recent research on ca accumulibacter suggested that the uptake of aspartate and glutamate were achieved via a glutamate proton symporter gltp fully energized by pmf half of the aspartate was oxidatively deaminized to oxaloacetate and to acetyl coa the other half was converted into fumarate which was further reduced to succinate and to propionyl coa qiu et al 2020 along the fumarate reduction pathway pmf was generated contributing to aspartate uptake the inhibition of oxantel on p release of paos suggested that other paos might employed a similar pathway as shown for ca accumulibacter clade iif stain scelse1 qiu et al 2020 interestingly oxantel also showed inhibition on glutamate uptake and glutamate induced p release as suggested by qiu et al 2020 the uptake and transformation of glutamate by ca accumulibacter did not seem to have involved mechanisms related to fumarate reductase a majority of glutamate was not routed to the tca cycle owing to the lack of a gene encoding the nadh dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in the ca accumulibacter genome pha formation was observed when glutamate was used as a carbon source in all fifteen samples although with glutamate uptake to pha formation ratios 0 04 0 24 mol c mol c significantly lower than those observed for aspartate 0 28 0 45 mol c mol c supplementary table s3 s7 additionally detectable glycogen consumption 0 13 0 56 mol c mol c supplementary table s3 s7 was observed together with glutamate uptake the pha formation and glycogen consumption were significantly inhibited at the presence of oxantel supplementary fig s22 supplementary tables s3 s7 collectively these results suggested the presence of a distinct glutamate metabolic pathway in these full scale systems where a fraction of glutamate might have been routed to tca cycle via ketoglutarate with additional reducing power being consumed via the reductive branch of the tca cycle involving the activity of fumarate reductase 3 5 relating carbon uptake bioenergetics to pao gao community compositions pearson correlation fig 5 and cca analysis fig 6 were performed to further analyze the relationship between community composition and associated carbon acetate propionate glutamate or aspartate uptake mechanisms as suggested by the cca analysis for acetate and propionate the responses of p release to different inhibitors were distinctly separated from those of toc fig 6a and b the pao community e g ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus halomonas and tetrasphaera generally correlated with p release related vectors and the gao community e g ca competibacter with toc related ones fig 6a and b the same pattern was shown by the pearson correlation analysis where pao asvs generally correlated with p release related factors and gao asvs with toc related ones fig 5a again manifesting that paos and gaos in full scale systems were largely different in carbon uptake bioenergetic characteristics when acetate or propionate was used as a carbon source specifically high dependency of gaos on fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase for the generation of pmf for carbon uptake supplementary fig s23 within each specific lineage high variability was observed among different asvs showing that high level of fine scale micro diversity in carbon uptake bioenergetics was well reserved within each lineage as a result each entire lineage total population for instance tetraspheara tessaracoccus microprunia glycogenica or ca competibacter did not show clear fondness of a specific energy generation pathway fig 5 for paos the flexibility in energy generation for carbon uptake may have been a result of their versatility in employing either glycolysis or tca cycle or both to generate the reducing power in their anaerobic metabolism he and mcmahon 2011a 2011b depending on the availability of glycogen zhou et al 2009 the anaerobic tca cycle might operate in three modes i e the full comeau et al 1986 partial the glyoxylate shunt louie et al 2000 and split ones hesselmann et al 2000 oehmen et al 2007 zhou et al 2010 either the full or the split tca cycle involves the activity of fumarate reductase he and mcmahon 2011a 2011b the inhibition of oxantel on p release although it is low i e 3 7 and 5 3 in average for acetate and propionate respectively fig 2a and c suggested the potential involvement of either the full or split tca cycle by paos predominantly microlunatus phosphovorus and tetrasphaera asv 219 as suggested by the pearson correlation analysis fig 5 different from glycolysis there is no atp generation in the glyoxylate shunt pathway the involvement of this pathway would result in increased poly p hydrolysis to generate additional atp for the activation of the same amount of acetate or propionate double the amount of these required in the glycolysis model if all the reducing power was generated via the glyoxylate shunt based on the pmf balance qiu et al 2020 showed that when nadh was fully generated from glycolysis the amount of poly p hydrolysis and resultant efflux of po4 3 p was insufficient to provide all the pmf required for acetate uptake around 25 pmf was generated via the reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase at the expense of atp that is to say if more than 25 of the reducing power was provided via the glyoxylate shunt pathway the amount of po4 3 p generated via poly p hydrolysis would be sufficient to generate enough pmf for acetate uptake no reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase would be required the low involvements of reverse operation of the f1 f0 atpase 6 4 and 11 7 for acetate and propionate uptake respectively fig 2 in the full scale plants suggested extensive employments of the glyoxylate shunt pathway for the generation of the reducing power by paos in these plants metatranscriptomic analysis also showed the activation of the tca cycle for reducing power generation by paos in field samples law et al 2016 in contrast the high correlation between the total population of ca accumulibacter as well as the total population of halomonas tessaracoccus asvs 596 and 603 and tetrasphaera asvs 187 and 219 fig 5 and dccd suggested that these microorganisms in full scale plants mainly rely on glycolysis for reducing power generation the result was supported by the high correlation between the extent of dccd inhibition on glycogen consumption and the relative abundance of ca accumulibacter supplementary fig s22 for gaos although most of the known ones to date seem to employ the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway for glycolysis genomic study showed that some species ca competibacter denitrificans mcilroy et al 2014 also encode a entner doudoroff ed pathway compared to emp pathway ed pathway generates the same amount of reducing power 2 3 mol nadh for the conversion of 1 c mol of glycogen to pyruvate but less atp 1 3 mol and 1 2 mol per 1 c mol of glycogen for ed and emp pathway respectively to generate the same amount of atp required for acetate activation increased amount by 33 of glycolysis is required for the ed pathway which in turn generates increased amount of reducing power the increased amount of reducing power needs to be consumed by routing increased amount of carbon acetyl coa to the reductive breach of the tca cycle which would result in increased generation of pmf via fumarate reductase the involvement of the f1 f0 atpase would thus be lowered in this regard high sensitivity to oxantel might suggest a high involvement of the ed pathway for glycolysis defluviicoccus and nakamurella multipartia fig 5 in contrast high dependency on the f1 f0 atpase might indicate the predominant use of the emp pathway ca contendobacter and some ca competibacter fig 5 by comparing the results from literatures with the metabolic model predictions oehman et al 2010 suggested that under high temperature gaos tend to employ ed pathway as indicated by their higher glycogen utilization and pha production a shift in their glycolysis metabolism from emp to ed pathways would allow them to maximize their pha storage and achieve higher biomass production this might explain the generally high sensitivity of gaos in these full scale plants to oxantel than to dccd since the operating temperature in these plants was in a high range 28 c these results also highlight a higher potential to selectively inhibit gaos for community regulation in these wwtps e g via potentially applying fumarate reductase inhibitors e g oxantel to the anaerobic tanks or the influent wastewater since paos rarely used this pathway for carbon uptake additionally oxantel may also have the potential to be applied to lab scale vfa fed bioreactors to facilitate and accelerate the selection and enrichment of paos for metabolic studies for amino acids glutamate and aspartate although the pao community was separated from the gao community in the cca analysis fig 6c and d the p related vectors were mixed up with toc related ones suggesting that the bioenergetic characteristics of paos and gaos for the uptake of two amino acids were not as distinctly different as those of vfas based on the pearson correlation ca accumulibacter and microlunatus phosphovorus seemed to have higher dependency on pmf while tetrasphaera likely have a higher sensitivity to dccd fig 5 ca accumulibacter clade iif strain scelse1 was shown to take up these two amino acids via a proton glutamate aspartate symporter gltp fully driven by pmf qiu et al 2020 apart from gltp there is another set of transporter systems reserved in the genomes of ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus and tetrasphaera for the uptake of these two amino acids i e the glutamate aspartate abc transporter complex to date the detailed glutamate aspartate uptake mechanisms of tetrasphaera and microlunatus phosphovorus are still unknown as suggested by kristiansen et al 2013 all four tetrasphaera genomes encode the glutamate aspartate abc transporter complex but no gltp related genes were annotated in these genomes since abc transport is energized by atp the high correlation between the total population of tetrasphaera and the inhibition of p release by dccd possibly suggested that tetrasphaera take up these two amino acids via the abc transporter while the correlation between the total population of microlunatus phosphovorus and the inhibition of p release by cccp suggested that microlunatus phosphovorus may behave similarly as ca accumulibacter to testify the hypothesis experiments were performed on microlunatus phosphovorus strain nm 1 to understand their amino acid uptake mechanisms as expected cccp showed remarkable 78 inhibitions of the p release and carbon uptake supplementary fig s24 supporting the hypothesis that microlunatus phosphovorus shared similar amino acid uptake bioenergetics with ca accumulibacter overall fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase activities were intensively involved in the uptake and metabolism of glutamate and aspartate by both paos and gaos in the full scale plants thus limited room was left for the regulation of their interaction via selective inhibition when amino acids were used as carbon sources 4 conclusions five wwtps harbored distinct and diverse paos tetrasphaera ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus etc and gaos ca competibacter defluviicoccus micropruina etc which were capable of using acetate propionate glutamate and aspartate despite the distinct community compositions pmf was found as a key driving force not only for the uptake of acetate propionate but for the uptake of glutamate and aspartate by both paos and gaos including defluviicoccus paos showed generally higher dependency on pmf for the uptake of these carbon sources than gaos paos and gaos in full scale wwtps showed community level universal and major differences in carbon uptake bioenergetics paos rarely activated fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase for the uptake of acetate and propionate whereas high dependency on these two pathways were shown for gaos gaos in the field generally depend more on fumarate reductase than f1 f0 atpase for pmf generation the application of the inhibitors targeting these two pathways selectively inhibited the carbon uptake by gaos different from acetate and propionate both paos and gaos highly relied on fumarate reductase and f1 f0 atpase for the uptake of amino acids glutamate or aspartate high level of fine scale micro diversity in carbon uptake bioenergetics was observed among and within different pao gao lineages ca accumulibacter and halomonas seemed to show higher dependency on the reverse operation of f1 f0 atpase to generate pmf for acetate propionate uptake than other paos different from tetrasphaera but similar to ca accumulibacter microlunatus phosphovorus take up glutamate and aspartate via the proton glutamate aspartate symporter driven by pmf declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
