4185,in recent years the impact of global warming has raised public concern over the precipitation induced geological hazards water security and energy security in the yalong river basin yrb therefore it is advisable to identify the variations of future precipitation hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and the operation of local hydropower reservoirs to this end the ensemble mean of the bias corrected nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp climate projections downscaled from 10 global climate models gcms was applied to seven precipitation indices proposed by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi and the ensemble of two distributed hydrologic models vic and crest under the global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and the hydropower optimization model were explicitly included in the routing module to represent the impact of the local hydropower reservoirs respectively the future natural runoff is likely to increase under rcp8 5 decrease under rcp4 5 and see a larger daily variability under both the local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative climate impact on the basin hydrology and the basin is expected to see increased dry season runoff decreased wet season runoff and lower daily variability of runoff under all scenarios as compared to the baseline period the future hydropower generation of the yrb is consistent with the variation of future runoff and reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce about 5 electricity more than the current actual operation rules highlighting the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions our framework and findings are expected to provide instructive information for water resources management not only in the yrb but also in different regions worldwide keywords climate change global warming hydropower generation extreme precipitation reservoir operation 1 introduction intensified industrial development and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases for the past 100 years have been considered a potential cause of global warming in the past few decades cubasch et al 1995 according to the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc from 1880 to 2012 the globe warmed by 0 85 c compared to the industrial revolution above pre industrial levels hulme 2016 rogelj et al 2016 schellnhuber et al 2016 chen et al 2019a the warming of the earth s climate has brought about notable alterations to the hydro climatic cycle among the atmosphere vegetation and soil and may have led to an increase in extreme hydrological and climatic events gu et al 2015 in view of the potentially negative impact induced by climate change the paris agreement was officially proposed in 2015 to control global warming by up to 2 c and strive to be within 1 5 c in terms of these goals set by the paris agreement extensive research has been conducted worldwide to investigate the warming induced hydrologic variations and socioeconomic consequences with 1 5 c and 2 c increases in global temperature lehner et al 2017 mitchell et al 2016 in general warming induced hydrologic variations was assessed by one way coupling the gcm global climate model or rcm regional climate model to the hydrologic model yu et al 2018 notably climate and hydrologic models can vary significantly in simulation results due to for example different parameterizations of microphysics radiation land surface cumulus convection for climate models and runoff generation interaction between surface water and groundwater soil moisture movement for hydrologic models therefore the multi model ensemble analysis is considered an effective tool to address the uncertainties and errors related to a single model gu et al 2018 for example zhou et al 2019 analyzed china s hydro climatic conditions in the context of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c with 27 cmip5 gcms and 10 precipitation indices recommended by etccdi donnelly 2017 used the multi model ensemble of 5 hydrologic models namely vic liang et al 1994 lisflood burek 2013 wbm vörösmarty et al 2000 e hype donnelly et al 2016 and lpjml schaphoff et al 2013 to evaluate the future hydrologic regime in europe under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c huang et al 2018 used an ensemble of swim mhm and vic models and four gcms to analyze the future floods of the upper mississippi rhine upper niger and upper yellow river basin under global warming of 1 5 c 2 c and 3 c most of the above mentioned research takes no account of reservoirs a major component of hydrologic cycle or implicitly include the reservoir operation in the calibration of hydrologic models however recent studies suggest doing so would cause much error in the projection of future hydrologic regime especially in highly regulated regions where reservoirs have a major impact dang et al 2019 therefore the explicit inclusion of reservoir operation in land surface and hydrologic models have been a major direction of recent climate change research hoang et al 2019 dong et al 2019 which often requires the knowledge of operation rules of each reservoir included in general there are four kinds of reservoir operation rules frequently employed in reservoir related research worldwide i e the actual conceptual data driven and optimized operation rules the actual operation rules can represent the exact reservoir operation at present and probably also in the future ngo et al 2018 however they are often subject to limited accessibility to researchers especially in cases where it involves a large number of reservoirs ehsani et al 2017 dong et al 2019 conceptual operation rules were derived by establishing a physically based function between the reservoir outflow and inflow hanasaki et al 2006 and data driven operation rules were usually obtained by establishing an artificial intelligence based black box model between the reservoir outflow and inflow with a large number of training data ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 optimized operation rules were derived by pre defining a single or a few optimization goals e g maximum flood control benefits and solving the reservoir outflow using specific optimizing algorithms based on the pre defined goals lauri et al 2012 chen et al 2019 specifically the conceptual and data driven rules are used as a substitute for the actual operation rules to reconstruct the actual reservoir operation in case actual rules are not available on the other hand the optimized rules can deviate significantly from the actual conditions and is often used to assess the reservoir impact under extreme or ideal conditions e g maximum possible flood control benefit maximum possible hydropower production lauri et al 2012 in recent years the impact of global warming has raised public concern in the yalong river basin yrb which is one of the thirteen hydropower bases across china and serves as an important component of china s west to east electricity transmission project gu et al 2018 currently there are four major operational hydropower reservoirs with a total capacity of 14 3 109 m3 in the mainstream and many more are under planning warming induced precipitation variations in the future can jeopardize the geological environment of the yrb which was historically threatened by debris flow landslides avalanches and other geological hazards induced by extreme precipitation events warming induced hydrologic variations in the future on the other hand can pose a challenge to the water security and energy security in the yrb especially regarding the hydropower generation because the power output designed based on historic hydrologic records may no longer be as desirable in the future as expected sene 2010 these considerations motivate our study to investigate the future precipitation hydrology and hydropower production in the yrb under the joint impact of global warming and reservoir operation to this end we first employed the nex gddp climate projection data downscaled from 10 gcms to investigate the warming induced precipitation variations over the yrb using seven representative precipitation indices recommended by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi then we applied the bias corrected ensemble average of the nex gddp climate data to two distributed hydrologic models to investigate the future hydrology and hydropower generation of the yrb for the global warming period of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in view of the significant disturbance of runoff routing by hydropower reservoirs in the yrb the reservoir operation was included in a one way coupled mode in the routing modules by applying the actual operation rules and the hydropower optimized operation rules to each of the hydropower reservoir respectively our framework and results are expected to bring new insights into the adaptive water resources management of the yrb under global warming and reservoir operation 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yalong river is one of the largest tributaries of the yangtze river the mainstream of the yalong river is 1571 km long with a drainage area is 136 103 km2 fig 1 the yalong river basin is dominated by a plateau climate and the average annual precipitation of the entire basin is 600 800 mm although with moderate total precipitation the basin historically experiences relatively frequent geological hazards such as landslides avalanches and debris flow as a result of extreme precipitation events and suffers a significant loss of lives and properties the average multi annual runoff of the basin is 1890 m3 s or 59 6 109 m3 which consists mainly of precipitation groundwater and snowmelt the runoff between june and october accounts for 77 of the whole year thus partitioning a year into the wet season and dry season there are currently five major reservoirs in operation along the mainstream of the yalong river namely jinping i jinping ii guandi ertan and tongzilin which are all designed primarily for hydropower generation the ertan hydrologic station is almost in a same location as the ertan reservoir and records the inflow of the ertan reservoir all reservoirs upstream of the ertan station i e jinping i jinping ii and guandi was put into operation around 2013 therefore the runoff recorded by ertan station before 2013 can be considered natural note that due to the lack of hydrologic data downstream of the ertan reservoir this study takes the ertan reservoir as the basin outlet and therefore the tongzilin reservoir is not considered in this study the other four reservoirs were included in this study which have a combined capacity of 14 3 109 m3 or approximately 24 of the total water resources of the yrb 2 2 data 2 2 1 reservoir data the detailed designed information of the four hydropower reservoirs along the yalong river were collected from the local agencies and briefly summarized in table 1 collected information include capacity control water levels installed capacity firm output storage area water level relationship tailwater level discharge relationship maximum release and other data necessary to calculate the hydropower generation 2 2 2 driving data for hydrologic models the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis product cgdpa published by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration was used as the observed historical data in this study the cgdpa was developed from thousands of rain gauges nationwide with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 and serves as one of the most reliable data sources of precipitation over china shen et al 2014 shen and xiong 2016 the daily maximum and minimum temperature data were extracted from the 0 5 degree gridded gauge based temperature dataset published by the national meteorological information center the digital elevation model dem data driving both types of hydrological models were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs the potential evapotranspiration pet data required in the crest model were obtained from the global daily evapotranspiration database available from the famine early warning systems network https fews net future pet calculations are based on the hargreaves samani hs pet estimation method and the applicability of the pet calculated by this method to the crest hydrological model has been verified li et al 2018a b in addition the vegetation and soil data required in the vic model were extracted from the land cover data developed by the university of maryland and the global 5 soil texture classification data were provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa hydrological office respectively 2 2 3 nex gddp climate projections the future climate projections in this study were derived from the global ultra high resolution statistical downscaled climate dataset nex gddp nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections and its spatial resolution is 0 25 nex gddp dataset contains the statistical downscaled daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation of 21 global climate models gcms under the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 thrasher et al 2012 its historical and future projection data covers the period of 1950 2005 and 2006 2099 respectively compared to the original gcms nex gddp vastly improves the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the average and extreme values of climate variables during historical periods particularly for areas with complex local terrain hence greatly improving the data reliability bao and wen 2017 chen et al 2019 a brief evaluation on the accuracy of the historic data of nex gddp can be found in the supporting information in this study the nex gddp downscaled data of ten gcms with a high resolution and wide application namely cnrm cm5 miroc5 cesm bgc access 1 0 ccsm4 csiro mk 3 6 0 inm cm4 ipsl cm5a mr mpi esm mr and mri cgcm3 were processed using bias correction and spatial disaggregation method bcsd wood et al 2004 and selected to provide the future projections of precipitation and temperature under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c the detailed information of the 10 gcms are listed in the supporting information the daily precipitation and temperature data were extracted from each of the ten gcms and two typical representative concentration pathways scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were selected to account for different emission scenarios which assume that the radiative forcing will be increased to 4 5 w m2 equivalent to 650 ppm co2 concentration and 8 5 w m2 equivalent to 1370 ppm co2 concentration by 2100 respectively these two scenarios indicate the expectable and worst scenarios in the future and are widely used in climate change research to diminish the uncertainties inherited in a single gcm the multi model ensemble mean mme of the daily precipitation and temperature under two rcps was then derived using equal weighted average i e 1 mme 1 n i 1 n p i where mme is the multi model ensemble mean n is the number of ensemble members which is 10 in this study p i is the projected climate data of a ensemble member in this study the mme of the nex gddp downscaled data of ten gcms was employed for the following analysis 3 methods 3 1 distributed hydrologic models subject to the model structure distributed hydrological models can exhibit different accuracies and bias in the hydrologic simulation for a specific watershed hattermann et al 2017 therefore the distributed hydrological model vic which is commonly used in future runoff projection and the crest model were adopted in this study to project future runoff in the yrb to have a better view of the uncertainties related to hydrologic models in this regard donnelly et al 2017 chen et al 2019 das et al 2018 das and umamahesh 2018 3 1 1 coupled routing and excess storage model crest crest is a grid based distributed hydrological model jointly developed by the university of oklahoma and nasa it can assimilate satellite remote sensing data and observed data for local regional and global hydrological analysis tang et al 2016 the model can be generally divided into runoff generation module evapotranspiration module soil infiltration and percolation module and runoff routing module specifically the variable permeability curve was used in the runoff generation module to calculate the surface and subsurface runoff and the linear reservoir method was used to route the surface and interflow on a raster grid basis detailed technical descriptions of the model can be further referred to wang et al 2011 currently crest is widely used in research across different scales huang et al 2012 khan et al 2011a khan et al 2011b 3 1 2 variable infiltration capacity model vic the vic model is a large scale distributed hydrological model developed by the university of washington and university of california berkeley the vic model integrates the heat and moisture exchange between the atmosphere vegetation and soil and simultaneously conserves the energy balance and water balance which compensates for the deficiency of traditional hydrological models in describing the energy flux the vic model calculates the runoff generation and evapotranspiration on a raster grid basis and then employs the routing module to derive the hydrograph at the basin outlet in this study the routing model developed by lohmann et al 1998 was employed which consists of the unit hydrograph and linearized st venant equations more detailed descriptions of the vic model can be found in the literature e g in liang et al 1994 previous studies have reported good simulation results for the yangtze river and yellow river using the vic model xie et al 2003 yuan et al 2004 3 2 reservoir operation simulation 3 2 1 designed operation curves the operation of reservoirs in the yrb generally follows the designed operating curves of the reservoir operation chart which form up the actual operation rules of the reservoirs these rules are of significance to reservoir modelling research because they not only can help to reconstruct the reservoir operation at present but is also expected to reflect the reservoir operation in the future therefore the designed operating curves were first extracted from the reservoir operation charts of the four hydropower reservoirs and were then formulated as operation rules in the forms of constraints and equations to simulate the reservoir operation at present and in the future a brief description of the actual operation rules for the ertan reservoir is presented as follows the reservoir water level should rise from the dead level of 1155 m in june to the normal water level of 1200 m in early september the reservoir is expected to maintain in the design normal water level for 1 3 months depending on the inflow conditions when the inflow is insufficient the release is reduced to keep a high water level and vice versa from early december to the june of the following year the reservoir releases water for electricity generation and generally lowers to the dead water level at the beginning of june when the water level is higher than 1200 m all water above 1200 m should be released 3 2 2 hydropower optimization model to investigate the maximum possible hydropower generation of the basin in the future an optimization model for hydropower is developed to derive the hydropower optimized operation rules for each of the four hydropower reservoirs with the timestep denoted as t t 1 2 3 t the objective function is expressed as follows 2 max t 1 t g t â δ t where g t is the output of each hydropower reservoir at the timestep t δ t is the period for each timestep given that the reservoirs are primarily intended for hydropower generation the flood control is simplified as part of the reservoir outflow limits and storage limits and other constraints include the water balance and reservoir output limits i e 3 s t s t 1 s t i t q t â δ t g t m i n g t g t m a x s t m i n s t s t m a x o t m i n o t o t m a x where s t 1 and s t are the storage of each reservoir at the timestep t 1 and t i t and q t are the average inflow and outflow of each reservoir at the timestep t g t m i n s t m i n and o t m i n are the minimum output storage and outflow of each reservoir at the timestep t and g t m a x s t m a x and o t m a x are the maximum output storage and outflow of each reservoir at the timestep t the multi timestep decision making problem described in eq 2 can be further converted to the backward recursive equation in consistent with the form of dynamic programming i e 4 b t s t max b t s t r t b t 1 s t 1 with 5 b t g t â δ t 6 s t s t 1 s t i t q t â δ t g min g t g max s min s t s max o min o t o max where b t is the cost function and b t is the cost to go function see above for the denotations of other symbols the eqs 4 6 are essentially equivalent of eqs 2 and 3 and can be solved to derive the optimal decisions from timesteps 1 to t in this study the backward recursive equations were solved by the improved dynamic programming idp algorithm zhao et al 2017 idp was developed based on the monotonic relationship in the reservoir optimization and can greatly enhance the computational efficiency as compared to the conventional dynamic programming dp 3 2 3 one way coupling to hydrologic models the reservoir operation is included in the routing module of both hydrological models in an offline one way coupled mode as follows a given the reservoir inflow and storage at a given timestep calculate the reservoir outflow by using the actual reservoir operation rules section 3 2 1 and hydropower optimized operation rules section 3 2 2 b replace the natural runoff i e reservoir inflow with the calculated reservoir outflow at the reservoir location in the routing module to investigate the reservoir operation on the routing process and downstream runoff c loop a and b for each reservoir downstream 3 3 a framework for assessing climate impact on runoff and hydropower 3 3 1 identifying the threshold crossing times of warming targets the impact of climate change under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c is typically evaluated by either stabilized approach or transient approach the stabilized approach is based on the recent simulation by the half a degree additional warming projections prognosis and impacts project happi which is designed to provide stabilized scenarios for global warming of 1 5 and 2 0 c hu et al 2019 mitchell et al 2017 thanigachalam and achutarao 2017 the transient method is based on transient climate states extracted from the cmip archive to evaluate climate change impacts at specific global temperature targets recent research has indicated that both approaches yield largely consistent results ruane et al 2018 in order to evaluate the climate impact under a specific warming condition we chose the transient method to evaluate climate change and the future study period was determined based on the points where the global warming targets of 1 5 c and 2 0 c are met for the ten gcms the threshold crossing times of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c above pre industrial levels under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are shown in fig 2 for the median value global warming will exceed the 1 5 c threshold in 2031 and in 2028 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and will exceed 2 c in approximately 2049 and 2041 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 2 notably there is a large difference among the 10 gcms in the threshold crossing times of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c for both of the warming targets the confidence range for reaching 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp8 5 is narrower and more consistent in comparison to that under rcp4 5 in general the global warming of 1 5 c is expected to occur around 2021 2040 and 2018 2037 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and the global warming of 2 0 c is expected to occur during 2041 2060 and 2031 2050 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively these results are line with the recent studies karmalkar and bradley 2017 gosling et al 2017 leng 2018 including two ensemble researches based on 27 gcms meng zi et al 2018 and 20 gcms li et al 2018a b respectively 3 3 2 scenario design in terms of the identified threshold crossing times of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c in the previous section we selected the periods of 2021 2040 rcp4 5 and 2018 2037 rcp8 5 as representing the global warming of 1 5 c and the periods of 2041 2060 rcp4 5 and 2031 2050 rcp8 5 as representing the global warming of 2 0 c for these future periods all of the four mainstream hydropower reservoirs are expected to be fully operational and the impact of these reservoirs were included in the models and quantitatively analyzed on its basis we further selected the period of 1985 2012 as the baseline period and the period of 2013 2019 as the historical period the baseline period was chosen as such because no major reservoir was put into operation before 2013 see section 2 1 upstream of the ertan station and the runoff at the ertan station during this period can be considered natural the historical period was chosen as such because the jinping i jinping ii and guandi reservoirs in yrb basin were all put into operation around 2013 for power generation in this study the runoff was compared between the baseline period the historical period and future periods to evaluate the runoff variations under global warming and reservoir operation and the hydropower generation was compared between the historical period and future periods to evaluate the hydropower variations under global warming and reservoir operation 3 4 quantifying the variation of precipitation the precipitation indexes recommended by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi are characterized by high stability and intuitive calculation and interpretation ability thus they are widely used in climate research and related fields filahi et al 2016 in this study seven representative precipitation indices were selected and table 2 lists the indices adopted in this study 4 results and analysis 4 1 model calibration and validation to drive the crest and vic models all driving data were uniformly interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with the inverse distance weight interpolation method which matches the spatial resolution of both models as well the daily runoff at the ertan station was employed for calibration and validation the calibration period was selected from 1996 to 2004 and the validation period from 2005 to 2012 the calibration and validation periods were selected as such because no major reservoirs were put into operation before 2013 and therefore the model can be considered to reconstruct the natural runoff in this study crest was auto calibrated in this study using the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm and 11 parameters were included in the calibration see supporting information for details the vic model was calibrated using the rosenbrock algorithm rosenbrock 1960 where seven parameters were calibrated see supporting information for details the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and relative bias pbias were chosen to evaluate the performance of the model during the calibration and validation periods nilawar and waikar 2018 fig 3 depicts the daily observed crest simulated and vic simulated runoff for the period of 1996 2012 and table 3 presents the performance metrics of the simulated daily runoff at ertan for both models it can be seen that both models can well capture the daily variations of runoff at ertan during the calibration and validation periods the nse values and pbias values are all above 0 7 and below 10 at a daily scale respectively for both models and both periods indicating that the models can yield very good simulation results moriasi et al 2007 specifically the nse values of the crest model ranges from 0 72 to 0 73 and the vic model derives equivalently accurate runoff simulation with the nse values of 0 71 to 0 76 despite that the crest model significantly underestimate the runoff in 1999 as compared to the vic model these results suggest both models can be applied to climate change impact assessment and be employed to have a better view of the uncertainties related to different hydrologic models 4 2 projections of future precipitation and its extremes to evaluate the climate induced precipitation variations in the yrb under different emission scenarios and global warming targets the boxplots of the relative change in seven precipitation indices were presented in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that except cdd and r95p other precipitation indexes all decreased under the rcp4 5 scenario and increased under the rcp8 5 scenario which indicates that the yrb is likely to experience more extreme precipitation events at the basin level and therefore a higher risk of floods droughts and geological hazards such as landslides and debris flow specifically the annual total precipitation decreases about 3 under rcp4 5 and increases about 9 under rcp8 5 and the 2 c warming induces more precipitation as compared to the 1 5 c warming in addition take rcp8 5 as an example the basin is likely to see a 3 increase in r1mm a 9 increase in sdii a 3 increase in r10mm a 0 03 increase in r95p a 12 increase in rx5day and a 4 decrease in cdd indicating a higher probability of extreme weather and hydrologic events in the future while the precipitation indexes show different variations under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the rcp8 5 scenario is generally expected to bring more precipitation and the extreme events under the two scenarios and warming targets is likely to become even worse than those during the baseline period as compared to the 1 5 c warming another 0 5 c warming is expected to induce a larger relative change in the precipitation induces i e enhance the climate impact under a certain emission scenario this is the case for all indices but cdd the relative change of cdd gets closer to zero with another 0 5 c warming in terms of the total amount of precipitation fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative change in the annual total precipitation prcptot during the global warming periods of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively it can be seen that under the rcp4 5 scenario the precipitation of the whole basin decreased while that of the upper reaches decreased and that of the middle and lower reaches increased under the rcp8 5 scenario with the 1 5 c warming the decrease in the precipitation generally concentrates in the lower basin under rcp4 5 with a maximum decrease of approximately 9 whereas it shifts to the upper basin under rcp8 5 with a maximum decrease of approximately 1 the additional 0 5 c warming under both rcps generally induces no considerable difference in the spatial distribution of the precipitation variation fig 6 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative change in other precipitation indices during the global warming periods of 1 5 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively with the 1 5 c warming the relative changes of most indices exhibit similar spatial distribution under both rcps expect sdii and rx5day the upper basin sees an increase of up to 10 in r1mm a decrease of up to 5 in r10mm and a decrease of up to 13 in cdd no significant difference in sdii and a considerable decrease in the consecutive 5 day precipitation rx5day under both rcps the lower basin on the other hand sees a decrease of up to 20 in r1mm an increase of around 0 10 in r10mm under both rcps a variation of 5 18 in sdii a significant variation of 42 118 in rx5day and an increase of 10 0 in cdd under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 many of these indices e g r1mm indicate that more extreme precipitation events are expected to occur particularly for the upper basin climate induced floods and geological hazards can be more severe as compared to the baseline period while droughts may occur less frequently due to the decreasing trend of dry days the additional 0 5 c warming under both rcps generally induces no considerable difference in the spatial distribution of the six extreme precipitation indices 4 3 historical runoff under reservoir operation and climate change the natural runoff and the runoff regulated by reservoirs hereinafter regulated runoff at the basin outlet in the historical period of 2013 2019 was simulated by the crest and vic model the baseline in the fig 7 represents the model averaged natural runoff at ertan during the baseline period and climate and climate reservior represent the model averaged natural runoff and the regulated runoff at the basin outlet during the historical period respectively actual operation rules were employed for reservoir operation as indicated in fig 7 the model averaged natural runoff at the basin outlet increased by about 15 from 2013 to 2019 compared with the baseline period the reservoirs further increased the runoff by 39 5 in the dry season and reduced the runoff by 16 6 in the wet season as compared to the natural runoff notably the runoff in july experienced a largest decrease of 42 1 under the impact of reservoir operation and the peak flow month was correspondingly postponed by two months from july to september 4 4 future runoff under climate impact and reservoir operation the natural runoff and the regulated runoff at the basin outlet in the future was simulated by the crest and vic model for the global warming periods of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively here the actual operation rules of reservoirs were employed in projecting the future regulated runoff of the yrb because they are more likely to reflect the actual reservoir operation in the future as compared to the optimized rules the annual averaged natural runoff in the future simulated by crest and vic was compared with the annual averaged natural runoff for the baseline period 1985 2012 and the relative change is presented in fig 8 the annual averaged regulated runoff is not shown given that the reservoir operation basically induces no variations in the annual averaged natural runoff for rcp4 5 crest and vic predicts that as compared to the baseline the runoff in the yrb changes by 6 68 2 09 and 4 46 0 82 during the global warming period of 1 5 c 2 c respectively for rcp 8 5 the crest model projects that the runoff of the yrb will increase by 0 68 and 4 38 during the global warming period of 1 5 and 2 c respectively and the vic model projects that the runoff will increase by 5 11 and 9 29 respectively in short the annual runoff sees a decrease of 0 8 6 7 under rcp4 5 and an increase of 0 7 9 2 under rcp8 5 the runoff is larger under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 which is consistent with the precipitation variation in the future and additional 0 5 c warming further increases the future runoff in the yrb for both rcps and both warming targets vic simulated runoff is larger than that simulated by crest model the difference in the runoff projections between the crest and vic may be due to the model structure which further highlights the added value of using multi hydrologic model ensemble in projecting the variation of future runoff under climate change zhou et al 2019 in addition to the annual total runoff the monthly natural and regulated runoff in the future was analyzed by using the simulation results of the crest vic model ensemble average and was compared with the runoff in the baseline period in the fig 9 note that actual operation rules were employed for reservoir operation the monthly natural runoff at the basin outlet generally experiences only slight changes in most months under the impact of global warming except for june and july under rcp4 5 and august and september under rcp8 5 specifically under the rcp4 5 the runoff in june and july is relatively reduced and under the rcp8 5 the runoff from august to september is relatively increased thereby making the peak monthly flow correspondingly shift two month later from july to september taking rcp8 5 as an example the climate change increases the runoff during the wet season by 5 18 and decreases the runoff by 2 75 in the dry season with the 1 5 c warming and increases the runoff by 9 01 in the wet season and decreases the runoff by 0 38 in the dry season with the 2 c warming on the other hand the natural runoff generally remains unchanged in the dry season and decreases in the wet season under rcp4 5 in general climate change generally induces a smaller larger imbalance of the natural runoff between the dry season and wet season as compared to the baseline under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the hydropower reservoirs in the yrb can effectively mitigate the climate impact by decreasing the runoff by 8 12 6 55 in the wet season and increasing the runoff by 31 15 30 88 in the dry season with the 1 5 c 2 c warming under the rcp4 5 the operation of reservoirs combined with the climate impact eventually results in a 14 72 8 89 decrease of the natural runoff in the wet season and a 27 62 30 86 increase in the dry season under rcp4 5 a similar case is also found for rcp8 5 by combining the effects of the reservoir operation and climate impact the averaged runoff eventually decreases by 6 84 1 54 in the wet season and increase by 36 89 36 96 in the dry season with the 1 5 c 2 c warming to further characterize the variability of runoff under the climate impact and reservoir operation the daily coefficient of variation cv was employed and calculated for each future scenario at a daily scale the results indicate that the cv of the natural runoff is 0 77 for the baseline and increases by 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 0 03 with 1 5 c 2 c warming under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively under the climate impact by further considering the impact of reservoir operation the cv of the future regulated runoff decreases to 0 7 0 69 and 0 7 0 67 with 1 5 c 2 c warming under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively 4 5 future hydropower production under climate impact and reservoir operation in this section the future hydropower generation of the four reservoirs in the yrb was calculated and compared with the hydropower generation during the historical period of 2013 2019 with the actual rules and optimized operation rules the outflow and generated electricity of the ertan reservoir under rcp4 5 and under rcp8 5 are selected for illustration in figs 10 and 11 respectively for the historical period of 2013 2019 the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was approximately 16 5 109 kw h per year for the rcp4 5 the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir is expected to decrease by 1 33 109 kw h 1 67 109 kw h 8 07 to 10 14 per year with the actual operation rules and 0 21 109 kwh 0 29 109 kw h 1 3 to 1 77 per year with the optimized operation rules for the rcp8 5 the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir is expected to increase by 0 95 109 kw h 1 16 109 kw h 5 73 7 02 per year with the actual operation rules and 1 52 109 kw h 1 97 109 kw h 9 19 11 92 per year with the optimized operation rules in addition to the total amount of power generation we can see that the optimized operation rules reduces the outflow in the wet season to ensure the water supply in dry season and increases the power out during that period as can also be seen from the figs 10 and 11 the inter annual variations of outflow in the wet season are somewhat larger than the power generation this is because the outflow is larger than the maximum discharge of turbine during most of the wet season and a large quantity of water flow is not used for hydropower generation but released directly as a result the reservoir almost reaches its installed capacity for the wet season black lines in figs 10 and 11 therefore the notable variations in the outflow are not expected to induce a similarly large variation in the power generation the results of the other reservoirs show a similar trend and the annual total electricity generation of the four hydropower reservoirs combined in the yrb under different scenarios is presented in fig 12 in general the future variations of hydropower generation under actual rules and optimized rules under both rcps compared to the historical period are consistent with the overall precipitation variation of the basin specifically the average hydropower generation of the yrb is expected to decrease by 9 11 per year with the actual operation rules and by 6 8 per year with the optimized operation rules under rcp4 5 the average hydropower generation of the yrb is expected to increase slightly per year with the actual operation rules and by 4 6 per year with the optimized operation rules more electricity will be generated under both rcps with the optimized rules and additional 0 5 c warming further increases the hydropower generation under each rcp scenario 5 discussion the previous section quantitatively depicts the warming induced variations in the future precipitation runoff and hydropower generation of the yrb under the climate impact and reservoir operation the ensemble mean precipitation of the yrb is expected to increase under rcp8 5 in the future especially under the 2 c warming and the higher emission scenario while the overall trend is a decrease under the rcp4 5 the ensemble averaged frequency and the temporal variability of extreme precipitation are likely to increase under global warming thereby leading to a higher risk of floods droughts and geological hazards such as landslides and debris flow especially in the upper basin the precipitation trend and the frequency variability of extreme precipitation are consistent with the most of the existing studies yuan et al 2018 sun et al 2019 for example huang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2007 reported that extreme precipitation indicators in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is expected to show an increasing trend in the future therefore in order to take care of the possible disastrous outcome of the increasing extreme precipitation pre cautious measures such as development of early warning system with longer forecast lead times and more frequent examination on the upper and middle areas of the basin may need to be considered by local agencies in terms of the future natural runoff both hydrologic models suggest that the runoff is likely to decrease under rcp4 5 but increase under rcp8 5 here we compared this finding with yin et al 2018 which reported that the runoff in the yrb would slightly decrease under rcp4 5 as compared with the baseline period which is similar to the results of our study the variation in the annual natural runoff is mostly concentrated in the wet season rather than the dry season thereby leading to a larger imbalance of water resources between the wet season and dry season under rcp8 5 which can result in a higher competition between stakeholders to meet different water demands in the future ehsani et al 2017 dong et al 2020 the daily variability of the natural runoff also sees an increase under all future scenarios as compared to the baseline which can pose a potential challenge to the effective water resources management of the yrb notably the discrepancy in the projected runoff between crest and vic in our research justifies the use of multi hydrologic model ensemble for future climate impact research as both models exhibit equivalently satisfactory results in the calibration and validation period the local reservoirs can mitigate the climate impact by storing the additional runoff in the wet season our findings indicate that they can fully reverse the increasing trend of runoff in the wet season under rcp8 5 and reverse the decreasing trend of water resources or further increasing the water resources in the dry season by releasing more water for hydropower under both rcps in view of the mitigating ability of reservoirs it is advisable that planning of future reservoirs take climate change impacts into consideration in terms of the hydropower generation a larger electricity output is expected in the future with both actual rules and optimized rules under rcp8 5 primarily because of the larger annual and wet season runoff notably reservoir operation with optimized rules can produce significantly more power than the actual operation rules by releasing more water in the dry season this can be informative to local water agencies in terms of the reservoir management policies to deal with the increasing electricity demand across the region in the future for rcp4 5 on the other hand the hydropower generation is projected to lower in the future as compared to historical period especially with the actual operation rules this suggests that the current operation rules may not be as suitable for hydropower generation in the future as in the historical period adjusting the reservoir operation policies cannot fully compensate for the climate induced decrease in the electricity output under rcp4 5 because the electricity output with the optimized operation rules is still less than that in in the historical period therefore adaptation measures are necessary to deal with the possible decline in the hydropower energy in the future to sum up despite the future electricity output exhibits somewhat opposite trends under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 both results highlight the need to adapt the current operation rules to the changing environment for the energy security of the region with respect to the power generation we further compared our results with liu et al 2020 which used five kinds of gcms to project the large scale cascade hydropower system in the upper jinsha river that includes the yrb under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the results show that the power generation increases under all models especially under rcp8 5 compared with the baseline period the power generation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 increases by 0 37 5 18 and 3 78 11 02 respectively this is in slight contrary to our study as we expect the power generation in the yrb under the rcp4 5 to slightly decrease compared to the historical period which could be due to the selection of climate projection data and the discrepancies in model structures 6 conclusions in this study we quantitatively project and analyze the future precipitation hydrology and hydropower generation of the yrb for the global warming period of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this was motivated by the fact that the yrb is a major hydropower base of china and that its geological environment water and energy security can have a significant impact on the economic development of southwest china the ensemble average of nex gddp climate projection data and the ensemble of vic and crest model were employed to project the future natural runoff for the global warming period of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and hydropower optimized operation rules were explicitly included in the routing modules to further project the regulated runoff and hydropower generation in the future the major conclusions are highlighted as follows the yrb is expected to experience more extreme precipitation events especially at the upper basin which raises the risk of floods droughts and geological hazards such as landslides avalanches and debris flow with the increase in the temperature and emission the frequency and the temporal variability of extreme precipitation is likely to increase therefore mitigating and pre cautious measures may need to be taken by local water agencies to better protect the lives and properties in the yrb and further downstream while the total natural runoff can either increase or decrease under different emission scenarios the basin is likely to see a larger daily variability of the natural runoff under both rcps especially with the higher temperature the local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative impact of climate change by displacing excessive water in the wet season to the dry season and lowering the runoff variability as a result in all future scenarios the basin is expected to see increased runoff in the dry season decreased runoff in the wet season and decreased daily variability of runoff under the joint impact of climate and reservoirs as compared to the baseline most notably the climate induced increase in the wet season runoff is expected to be fully offset by reservoirs under rcp8 5 the possible increase in the natural runoff for the year and for the wet season under rcp8 5 can bring additional advantages to hydropower generation which highly relies on the incoming streamflow on the other hand in consistent with the possible decline of precipitation and runoff we found that the future hydropower generation is likely to decrease under rcp4 5 as compared to the historical period the reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce significantly more electricity than the current actual operation rules with the increase in the temperature and emission these findings nevertheless highlight the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions in general our results are expected to provide instructive implications for future water resources management not only in the yrb but also in other basins along the upper of yangtze river given that these basins are characterized by a similar precipitation pattern and a similar development level to the yrb more importantly our framework of climate impact assessment is generally enough to identify the variations of future precipitation hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and reservoir operation which can be used to provide information for integrated water resources management in different climate regions worldwide credit authorship contribution statement yinmao zhao conceptualization methodology

4185,in recent years the impact of global warming has raised public concern over the precipitation induced geological hazards water security and energy security in the yalong river basin yrb therefore it is advisable to identify the variations of future precipitation hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and the operation of local hydropower reservoirs to this end the ensemble mean of the bias corrected nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp climate projections downscaled from 10 global climate models gcms was applied to seven precipitation indices proposed by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi and the ensemble of two distributed hydrologic models vic and crest under the global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and the hydropower optimization model were explicitly included in the routing module to represent the impact of the local hydropower reservoirs respectively the future natural runoff is likely to increase under rcp8 5 decrease under rcp4 5 and see a larger daily variability under both the local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative climate impact on the basin hydrology and the basin is expected to see increased dry season runoff decreased wet season runoff and lower daily variability of runoff under all scenarios as compared to the baseline period the future hydropower generation of the yrb is consistent with the variation of future runoff and reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce about 5 electricity more than the current actual operation rules highlighting the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions our framework and findings are expected to provide instructive information for water resources management not only in the yrb but also in different regions worldwide keywords climate change global warming hydropower generation extreme precipitation reservoir operation 1 introduction intensified industrial development and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases for the past 100 years have been considered a potential cause of global warming in the past few decades cubasch et al 1995 according to the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc from 1880 to 2012 the globe warmed by 0 85 c compared to the industrial revolution above pre industrial levels hulme 2016 rogelj et al 2016 schellnhuber et al 2016 chen et al 2019a the warming of the earth s climate has brought about notable alterations to the hydro climatic cycle among the atmosphere vegetation and soil and may have led to an increase in extreme hydrological and climatic events gu et al 2015 in view of the potentially negative impact induced by climate change the paris agreement was officially proposed in 2015 to control global warming by up to 2 c and strive to be within 1 5 c in terms of these goals set by the paris agreement extensive research has been conducted worldwide to investigate the warming induced hydrologic variations and socioeconomic consequences with 1 5 c and 2 c increases in global temperature lehner et al 2017 mitchell et al 2016 in general warming induced hydrologic variations was assessed by one way coupling the gcm global climate model or rcm regional climate model to the hydrologic model yu et al 2018 notably climate and hydrologic models can vary significantly in simulation results due to for example different parameterizations of microphysics radiation land surface cumulus convection for climate models and runoff generation interaction between surface water and groundwater soil moisture movement for hydrologic models therefore the multi model ensemble analysis is considered an effective tool to address the uncertainties and errors related to a single model gu et al 2018 for example zhou et al 2019 analyzed china s hydro climatic conditions in the context of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c with 27 cmip5 gcms and 10 precipitation indices recommended by etccdi donnelly 2017 used the multi model ensemble of 5 hydrologic models namely vic liang et al 1994 lisflood burek 2013 wbm vörösmarty et al 2000 e hype donnelly et al 2016 and lpjml schaphoff et al 2013 to evaluate the future hydrologic regime in europe under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c huang et al 2018 used an ensemble of swim mhm and vic models and four gcms to analyze the future floods of the upper mississippi rhine upper niger and upper yellow river basin under global warming of 1 5 c 2 c and 3 c most of the above mentioned research takes no account of reservoirs a major component of hydrologic cycle or implicitly include the reservoir operation in the calibration of hydrologic models however recent studies suggest doing so would cause much error in the projection of future hydrologic regime especially in highly regulated regions where reservoirs have a major impact dang et al 2019 therefore the explicit inclusion of reservoir operation in land surface and hydrologic models have been a major direction of recent climate change research hoang et al 2019 dong et al 2019 which often requires the knowledge of operation rules of each reservoir included in general there are four kinds of reservoir operation rules frequently employed in reservoir related research worldwide i e the actual conceptual data driven and optimized operation rules the actual operation rules can represent the exact reservoir operation at present and probably also in the future ngo et al 2018 however they are often subject to limited accessibility to researchers especially in cases where it involves a large number of reservoirs ehsani et al 2017 dong et al 2019 conceptual operation rules were derived by establishing a physically based function between the reservoir outflow and inflow hanasaki et al 2006 and data driven operation rules were usually obtained by establishing an artificial intelligence based black box model between the reservoir outflow and inflow with a large number of training data ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 optimized operation rules were derived by pre defining a single or a few optimization goals e g maximum flood control benefits and solving the reservoir outflow using specific optimizing algorithms based on the pre defined goals lauri et al 2012 chen et al 2019 specifically the conceptual and data driven rules are used as a substitute for the actual operation rules to reconstruct the actual reservoir operation in case actual rules are not available on the other hand the optimized rules can deviate significantly from the actual conditions and is often used to assess the reservoir impact under extreme or ideal conditions e g maximum possible flood control benefit maximum possible hydropower production lauri et al 2012 in recent years the impact of global warming has raised public concern in the yalong river basin yrb which is one of the thirteen hydropower bases across china and serves as an important component of china s west to east electricity transmission project gu et al 2018 currently there are four major operational hydropower reservoirs with a total capacity of 14 3 109 m3 in the mainstream and many more are under planning warming induced precipitation variations in the future can jeopardize the geological environment of the yrb which was historically threatened by debris flow landslides avalanches and other geological hazards induced by extreme precipitation events warming induced hydrologic variations in the future on the other hand can pose a challenge to the water security and energy security in the yrb especially regarding the hydropower generation because the power output designed based on historic hydrologic records may no longer be as desirable in the future as expected sene 2010 these considerations motivate our study to investigate the future precipitation hydrology and hydropower production in the yrb under the joint impact of global warming and reservoir operation to this end we first employed the nex gddp climate projection data downscaled from 10 gcms to investigate the warming induced precipitation variations over the yrb using seven representative precipitation indices recommended by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi then we applied the bias corrected ensemble average of the nex gddp climate data to two distributed hydrologic models to investigate the future hydrology and hydropower generation of the yrb for the global warming period of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in view of the significant disturbance of runoff routing by hydropower reservoirs in the yrb the reservoir operation was included in a one way coupled mode in the routing modules by applying the actual operation rules and the hydropower optimized operation rules to each of the hydropower reservoir respectively our framework and results are expected to bring new insights into the adaptive water resources management of the yrb under global warming and reservoir operation 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yalong river is one of the largest tributaries of the yangtze river the mainstream of the yalong river is 1571 km long with a drainage area is 136 103 km2 fig 1 the yalong river basin is dominated by a plateau climate and the average annual precipitation of the entire basin is 600 800 mm although with moderate total precipitation the basin historically experiences relatively frequent geological hazards such as landslides avalanches and debris flow as a result of extreme precipitation events and suffers a significant loss of lives and properties the average multi annual runoff of the basin is 1890 m3 s or 59 6 109 m3 which consists mainly of precipitation groundwater and snowmelt the runoff between june and october accounts for 77 of the whole year thus partitioning a year into the wet season and dry season there are currently five major reservoirs in operation along the mainstream of the yalong river namely jinping i jinping ii guandi ertan and tongzilin which are all designed primarily for hydropower generation the ertan hydrologic station is almost in a same location as the ertan reservoir and records the inflow of the ertan reservoir all reservoirs upstream of the ertan station i e jinping i jinping ii and guandi was put into operation around 2013 therefore the runoff recorded by ertan station before 2013 can be considered natural note that due to the lack of hydrologic data downstream of the ertan reservoir this study takes the ertan reservoir as the basin outlet and therefore the tongzilin reservoir is not considered in this study the other four reservoirs were included in this study which have a combined capacity of 14 3 109 m3 or approximately 24 of the total water resources of the yrb 2 2 data 2 2 1 reservoir data the detailed designed information of the four hydropower reservoirs along the yalong river were collected from the local agencies and briefly summarized in table 1 collected information include capacity control water levels installed capacity firm output storage area water level relationship tailwater level discharge relationship maximum release and other data necessary to calculate the hydropower generation 2 2 2 driving data for hydrologic models the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis product cgdpa published by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration was used as the observed historical data in this study the cgdpa was developed from thousands of rain gauges nationwide with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 and serves as one of the most reliable data sources of precipitation over china shen et al 2014 shen and xiong 2016 the daily maximum and minimum temperature data were extracted from the 0 5 degree gridded gauge based temperature dataset published by the national meteorological information center the digital elevation model dem data driving both types of hydrological models were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs the potential evapotranspiration pet data required in the crest model were obtained from the global daily evapotranspiration database available from the famine early warning systems network https fews net future pet calculations are based on the hargreaves samani hs pet estimation method and the applicability of the pet calculated by this method to the crest hydrological model has been verified li et al 2018a b in addition the vegetation and soil data required in the vic model were extracted from the land cover data developed by the university of maryland and the global 5 soil texture classification data were provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa hydrological office respectively 2 2 3 nex gddp climate projections the future climate projections in this study were derived from the global ultra high resolution statistical downscaled climate dataset nex gddp nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections and its spatial resolution is 0 25 nex gddp dataset contains the statistical downscaled daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation of 21 global climate models gcms under the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 thrasher et al 2012 its historical and future projection data covers the period of 1950 2005 and 2006 2099 respectively compared to the original gcms nex gddp vastly improves the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the average and extreme values of climate variables during historical periods particularly for areas with complex local terrain hence greatly improving the data reliability bao and wen 2017 chen et al 2019 a brief evaluation on the accuracy of the historic data of nex gddp can be found in the supporting information in this study the nex gddp downscaled data of ten gcms with a high resolution and wide application namely cnrm cm5 miroc5 cesm bgc access 1 0 ccsm4 csiro mk 3 6 0 inm cm4 ipsl cm5a mr mpi esm mr and mri cgcm3 were processed using bias correction and spatial disaggregation method bcsd wood et al 2004 and selected to provide the future projections of precipitation and temperature under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c the detailed information of the 10 gcms are listed in the supporting information the daily precipitation and temperature data were extracted from each of the ten gcms and two typical representative concentration pathways scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were selected to account for different emission scenarios which assume that the radiative forcing will be increased to 4 5 w m2 equivalent to 650 ppm co2 concentration and 8 5 w m2 equivalent to 1370 ppm co2 concentration by 2100 respectively these two scenarios indicate the expectable and worst scenarios in the future and are widely used in climate change research to diminish the uncertainties inherited in a single gcm the multi model ensemble mean mme of the daily precipitation and temperature under two rcps was then derived using equal weighted average i e 1 mme 1 n i 1 n p i where mme is the multi model ensemble mean n is the number of ensemble members which is 10 in this study p i is the projected climate data of a ensemble member in this study the mme of the nex gddp downscaled data of ten gcms was employed for the following analysis 3 methods 3 1 distributed hydrologic models subject to the model structure distributed hydrological models can exhibit different accuracies and bias in the hydrologic simulation for a specific watershed hattermann et al 2017 therefore the distributed hydrological model vic which is commonly used in future runoff projection and the crest model were adopted in this study to project future runoff in the yrb to have a better view of the uncertainties related to hydrologic models in this regard donnelly et al 2017 chen et al 2019 das et al 2018 das and umamahesh 2018 3 1 1 coupled routing and excess storage model crest crest is a grid based distributed hydrological model jointly developed by the university of oklahoma and nasa it can assimilate satellite remote sensing data and observed data for local regional and global hydrological analysis tang et al 2016 the model can be generally divided into runoff generation module evapotranspiration module soil infiltration and percolation module and runoff routing module specifically the variable permeability curve was used in the runoff generation module to calculate the surface and subsurface runoff and the linear reservoir method was used to route the surface and interflow on a raster grid basis detailed technical descriptions of the model can be further referred to wang et al 2011 currently crest is widely used in research across different scales huang et al 2012 khan et al 2011a khan et al 2011b 3 1 2 variable infiltration capacity model vic the vic model is a large scale distributed hydrological model developed by the university of washington and university of california berkeley the vic model integrates the heat and moisture exchange between the atmosphere vegetation and soil and simultaneously conserves the energy balance and water balance which compensates for the deficiency of traditional hydrological models in describing the energy flux the vic model calculates the runoff generation and evapotranspiration on a raster grid basis and then employs the routing module to derive the hydrograph at the basin outlet in this study the routing model developed by lohmann et al 1998 was employed which consists of the unit hydrograph and linearized st venant equations more detailed descriptions of the vic model can be found in the literature e g in liang et al 1994 previous studies have reported good simulation results for the yangtze river and yellow river using the vic model xie et al 2003 yuan et al 2004 3 2 reservoir operation simulation 3 2 1 designed operation curves the operation of reservoirs in the yrb generally follows the designed operating curves of the reservoir operation chart which form up the actual operation rules of the reservoirs these rules are of significance to reservoir modelling research because they not only can help to reconstruct the reservoir operation at present but is also expected to reflect the reservoir operation in the future therefore the designed operating curves were first extracted from the reservoir operation charts of the four hydropower reservoirs and were then formulated as operation rules in the forms of constraints and equations to simulate the reservoir operation at present and in the future a brief description of the actual operation rules for the ertan reservoir is presented as follows the reservoir water level should rise from the dead level of 1155 m in june to the normal water level of 1200 m in early september the reservoir is expected to maintain in the design normal water level for 1 3 months depending on the inflow conditions when the inflow is insufficient the release is reduced to keep a high water level and vice versa from early december to the june of the following year the reservoir releases water for electricity generation and generally lowers to the dead water level at the beginning of june when the water level is higher than 1200 m all water above 1200 m should be released 3 2 2 hydropower optimization model to investigate the maximum possible hydropower generation of the basin in the future an optimization model for hydropower is developed to derive the hydropower optimized operation rules for each of the four hydropower reservoirs with the timestep denoted as t t 1 2 3 t the objective function is expressed as follows 2 max t 1 t g t â δ t where g t is the output of each hydropower reservoir at the timestep t δ t is the period for each timestep given that the reservoirs are primarily intended for hydropower generation the flood control is simplified as part of the reservoir outflow limits and storage limits and other constraints include the water balance and reservoir output limits i e 3 s t s t 1 s t i t q t â δ t g t m i n g t g t m a x s t m i n s t s t m a x o t m i n o t o t m a x where s t 1 and s t are the storage of each reservoir at the timestep t 1 and t i t and q t are the average inflow and outflow of each reservoir at the timestep t g t m i n s t m i n and o t m i n are the minimum output storage and outflow of each reservoir at the timestep t and g t m a x s t m a x and o t m a x are the maximum output storage and outflow of each reservoir at the timestep t the multi timestep decision making problem described in eq 2 can be further converted to the backward recursive equation in consistent with the form of dynamic programming i e 4 b t s t max b t s t r t b t 1 s t 1 with 5 b t g t â δ t 6 s t s t 1 s t i t q t â δ t g min g t g max s min s t s max o min o t o max where b t is the cost function and b t is the cost to go function see above for the denotations of other symbols the eqs 4 6 are essentially equivalent of eqs 2 and 3 and can be solved to derive the optimal decisions from timesteps 1 to t in this study the backward recursive equations were solved by the improved dynamic programming idp algorithm zhao et al 2017 idp was developed based on the monotonic relationship in the reservoir optimization and can greatly enhance the computational efficiency as compared to the conventional dynamic programming dp 3 2 3 one way coupling to hydrologic models the reservoir operation is included in the routing module of both hydrological models in an offline one way coupled mode as follows a given the reservoir inflow and storage at a given timestep calculate the reservoir outflow by using the actual reservoir operation rules section 3 2 1 and hydropower optimized operation rules section 3 2 2 b replace the natural runoff i e reservoir inflow with the calculated reservoir outflow at the reservoir location in the routing module to investigate the reservoir operation on the routing process and downstream runoff c loop a and b for each reservoir downstream 3 3 a framework for assessing climate impact on runoff and hydropower 3 3 1 identifying the threshold crossing times of warming targets the impact of climate change under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c is typically evaluated by either stabilized approach or transient approach the stabilized approach is based on the recent simulation by the half a degree additional warming projections prognosis and impacts project happi which is designed to provide stabilized scenarios for global warming of 1 5 and 2 0 c hu et al 2019 mitchell et al 2017 thanigachalam and achutarao 2017 the transient method is based on transient climate states extracted from the cmip archive to evaluate climate change impacts at specific global temperature targets recent research has indicated that both approaches yield largely consistent results ruane et al 2018 in order to evaluate the climate impact under a specific warming condition we chose the transient method to evaluate climate change and the future study period was determined based on the points where the global warming targets of 1 5 c and 2 0 c are met for the ten gcms the threshold crossing times of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c above pre industrial levels under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are shown in fig 2 for the median value global warming will exceed the 1 5 c threshold in 2031 and in 2028 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and will exceed 2 c in approximately 2049 and 2041 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 2 notably there is a large difference among the 10 gcms in the threshold crossing times of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c for both of the warming targets the confidence range for reaching 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp8 5 is narrower and more consistent in comparison to that under rcp4 5 in general the global warming of 1 5 c is expected to occur around 2021 2040 and 2018 2037 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and the global warming of 2 0 c is expected to occur during 2041 2060 and 2031 2050 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively these results are line with the recent studies karmalkar and bradley 2017 gosling et al 2017 leng 2018 including two ensemble researches based on 27 gcms meng zi et al 2018 and 20 gcms li et al 2018a b respectively 3 3 2 scenario design in terms of the identified threshold crossing times of global warming of 1 5 c and 2 c in the previous section we selected the periods of 2021 2040 rcp4 5 and 2018 2037 rcp8 5 as representing the global warming of 1 5 c and the periods of 2041 2060 rcp4 5 and 2031 2050 rcp8 5 as representing the global warming of 2 0 c for these future periods all of the four mainstream hydropower reservoirs are expected to be fully operational and the impact of these reservoirs were included in the models and quantitatively analyzed on its basis we further selected the period of 1985 2012 as the baseline period and the period of 2013 2019 as the historical period the baseline period was chosen as such because no major reservoir was put into operation before 2013 see section 2 1 upstream of the ertan station and the runoff at the ertan station during this period can be considered natural the historical period was chosen as such because the jinping i jinping ii and guandi reservoirs in yrb basin were all put into operation around 2013 for power generation in this study the runoff was compared between the baseline period the historical period and future periods to evaluate the runoff variations under global warming and reservoir operation and the hydropower generation was compared between the historical period and future periods to evaluate the hydropower variations under global warming and reservoir operation 3 4 quantifying the variation of precipitation the precipitation indexes recommended by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi are characterized by high stability and intuitive calculation and interpretation ability thus they are widely used in climate research and related fields filahi et al 2016 in this study seven representative precipitation indices were selected and table 2 lists the indices adopted in this study 4 results and analysis 4 1 model calibration and validation to drive the crest and vic models all driving data were uniformly interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with the inverse distance weight interpolation method which matches the spatial resolution of both models as well the daily runoff at the ertan station was employed for calibration and validation the calibration period was selected from 1996 to 2004 and the validation period from 2005 to 2012 the calibration and validation periods were selected as such because no major reservoirs were put into operation before 2013 and therefore the model can be considered to reconstruct the natural runoff in this study crest was auto calibrated in this study using the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm and 11 parameters were included in the calibration see supporting information for details the vic model was calibrated using the rosenbrock algorithm rosenbrock 1960 where seven parameters were calibrated see supporting information for details the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and relative bias pbias were chosen to evaluate the performance of the model during the calibration and validation periods nilawar and waikar 2018 fig 3 depicts the daily observed crest simulated and vic simulated runoff for the period of 1996 2012 and table 3 presents the performance metrics of the simulated daily runoff at ertan for both models it can be seen that both models can well capture the daily variations of runoff at ertan during the calibration and validation periods the nse values and pbias values are all above 0 7 and below 10 at a daily scale respectively for both models and both periods indicating that the models can yield very good simulation results moriasi et al 2007 specifically the nse values of the crest model ranges from 0 72 to 0 73 and the vic model derives equivalently accurate runoff simulation with the nse values of 0 71 to 0 76 despite that the crest model significantly underestimate the runoff in 1999 as compared to the vic model these results suggest both models can be applied to climate change impact assessment and be employed to have a better view of the uncertainties related to different hydrologic models 4 2 projections of future precipitation and its extremes to evaluate the climate induced precipitation variations in the yrb under different emission scenarios and global warming targets the boxplots of the relative change in seven precipitation indices were presented in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that except cdd and r95p other precipitation indexes all decreased under the rcp4 5 scenario and increased under the rcp8 5 scenario which indicates that the yrb is likely to experience more extreme precipitation events at the basin level and therefore a higher risk of floods droughts and geological hazards such as landslides and debris flow specifically the annual total precipitation decreases about 3 under rcp4 5 and increases about 9 under rcp8 5 and the 2 c warming induces more precipitation as compared to the 1 5 c warming in addition take rcp8 5 as an example the basin is likely to see a 3 increase in r1mm a 9 increase in sdii a 3 increase in r10mm a 0 03 increase in r95p a 12 increase in rx5day and a 4 decrease in cdd indicating a higher probability of extreme weather and hydrologic events in the future while the precipitation indexes show different variations under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the rcp8 5 scenario is generally expected to bring more precipitation and the extreme events under the two scenarios and warming targets is likely to become even worse than those during the baseline period as compared to the 1 5 c warming another 0 5 c warming is expected to induce a larger relative change in the precipitation induces i e enhance the climate impact under a certain emission scenario this is the case for all indices but cdd the relative change of cdd gets closer to zero with another 0 5 c warming in terms of the total amount of precipitation fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative change in the annual total precipitation prcptot during the global warming periods of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively it can be seen that under the rcp4 5 scenario the precipitation of the whole basin decreased while that of the upper reaches decreased and that of the middle and lower reaches increased under the rcp8 5 scenario with the 1 5 c warming the decrease in the precipitation generally concentrates in the lower basin under rcp4 5 with a maximum decrease of approximately 9 whereas it shifts to the upper basin under rcp8 5 with a maximum decrease of approximately 1 the additional 0 5 c warming under both rcps generally induces no considerable difference in the spatial distribution of the precipitation variation fig 6 depicts the spatial distribution of the relative change in other precipitation indices during the global warming periods of 1 5 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively with the 1 5 c warming the relative changes of most indices exhibit similar spatial distribution under both rcps expect sdii and rx5day the upper basin sees an increase of up to 10 in r1mm a decrease of up to 5 in r10mm and a decrease of up to 13 in cdd no significant difference in sdii and a considerable decrease in the consecutive 5 day precipitation rx5day under both rcps the lower basin on the other hand sees a decrease of up to 20 in r1mm an increase of around 0 10 in r10mm under both rcps a variation of 5 18 in sdii a significant variation of 42 118 in rx5day and an increase of 10 0 in cdd under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 many of these indices e g r1mm indicate that more extreme precipitation events are expected to occur particularly for the upper basin climate induced floods and geological hazards can be more severe as compared to the baseline period while droughts may occur less frequently due to the decreasing trend of dry days the additional 0 5 c warming under both rcps generally induces no considerable difference in the spatial distribution of the six extreme precipitation indices 4 3 historical runoff under reservoir operation and climate change the natural runoff and the runoff regulated by reservoirs hereinafter regulated runoff at the basin outlet in the historical period of 2013 2019 was simulated by the crest and vic model the baseline in the fig 7 represents the model averaged natural runoff at ertan during the baseline period and climate and climate reservior represent the model averaged natural runoff and the regulated runoff at the basin outlet during the historical period respectively actual operation rules were employed for reservoir operation as indicated in fig 7 the model averaged natural runoff at the basin outlet increased by about 15 from 2013 to 2019 compared with the baseline period the reservoirs further increased the runoff by 39 5 in the dry season and reduced the runoff by 16 6 in the wet season as compared to the natural runoff notably the runoff in july experienced a largest decrease of 42 1 under the impact of reservoir operation and the peak flow month was correspondingly postponed by two months from july to september 4 4 future runoff under climate impact and reservoir operation the natural runoff and the regulated runoff at the basin outlet in the future was simulated by the crest and vic model for the global warming periods of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively here the actual operation rules of reservoirs were employed in projecting the future regulated runoff of the yrb because they are more likely to reflect the actual reservoir operation in the future as compared to the optimized rules the annual averaged natural runoff in the future simulated by crest and vic was compared with the annual averaged natural runoff for the baseline period 1985 2012 and the relative change is presented in fig 8 the annual averaged regulated runoff is not shown given that the reservoir operation basically induces no variations in the annual averaged natural runoff for rcp4 5 crest and vic predicts that as compared to the baseline the runoff in the yrb changes by 6 68 2 09 and 4 46 0 82 during the global warming period of 1 5 c 2 c respectively for rcp 8 5 the crest model projects that the runoff of the yrb will increase by 0 68 and 4 38 during the global warming period of 1 5 and 2 c respectively and the vic model projects that the runoff will increase by 5 11 and 9 29 respectively in short the annual runoff sees a decrease of 0 8 6 7 under rcp4 5 and an increase of 0 7 9 2 under rcp8 5 the runoff is larger under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 which is consistent with the precipitation variation in the future and additional 0 5 c warming further increases the future runoff in the yrb for both rcps and both warming targets vic simulated runoff is larger than that simulated by crest model the difference in the runoff projections between the crest and vic may be due to the model structure which further highlights the added value of using multi hydrologic model ensemble in projecting the variation of future runoff under climate change zhou et al 2019 in addition to the annual total runoff the monthly natural and regulated runoff in the future was analyzed by using the simulation results of the crest vic model ensemble average and was compared with the runoff in the baseline period in the fig 9 note that actual operation rules were employed for reservoir operation the monthly natural runoff at the basin outlet generally experiences only slight changes in most months under the impact of global warming except for june and july under rcp4 5 and august and september under rcp8 5 specifically under the rcp4 5 the runoff in june and july is relatively reduced and under the rcp8 5 the runoff from august to september is relatively increased thereby making the peak monthly flow correspondingly shift two month later from july to september taking rcp8 5 as an example the climate change increases the runoff during the wet season by 5 18 and decreases the runoff by 2 75 in the dry season with the 1 5 c warming and increases the runoff by 9 01 in the wet season and decreases the runoff by 0 38 in the dry season with the 2 c warming on the other hand the natural runoff generally remains unchanged in the dry season and decreases in the wet season under rcp4 5 in general climate change generally induces a smaller larger imbalance of the natural runoff between the dry season and wet season as compared to the baseline under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the hydropower reservoirs in the yrb can effectively mitigate the climate impact by decreasing the runoff by 8 12 6 55 in the wet season and increasing the runoff by 31 15 30 88 in the dry season with the 1 5 c 2 c warming under the rcp4 5 the operation of reservoirs combined with the climate impact eventually results in a 14 72 8 89 decrease of the natural runoff in the wet season and a 27 62 30 86 increase in the dry season under rcp4 5 a similar case is also found for rcp8 5 by combining the effects of the reservoir operation and climate impact the averaged runoff eventually decreases by 6 84 1 54 in the wet season and increase by 36 89 36 96 in the dry season with the 1 5 c 2 c warming to further characterize the variability of runoff under the climate impact and reservoir operation the daily coefficient of variation cv was employed and calculated for each future scenario at a daily scale the results indicate that the cv of the natural runoff is 0 77 for the baseline and increases by 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 0 03 with 1 5 c 2 c warming under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively under the climate impact by further considering the impact of reservoir operation the cv of the future regulated runoff decreases to 0 7 0 69 and 0 7 0 67 with 1 5 c 2 c warming under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively 4 5 future hydropower production under climate impact and reservoir operation in this section the future hydropower generation of the four reservoirs in the yrb was calculated and compared with the hydropower generation during the historical period of 2013 2019 with the actual rules and optimized operation rules the outflow and generated electricity of the ertan reservoir under rcp4 5 and under rcp8 5 are selected for illustration in figs 10 and 11 respectively for the historical period of 2013 2019 the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir was approximately 16 5 109 kw h per year for the rcp4 5 the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir is expected to decrease by 1 33 109 kw h 1 67 109 kw h 8 07 to 10 14 per year with the actual operation rules and 0 21 109 kwh 0 29 109 kw h 1 3 to 1 77 per year with the optimized operation rules for the rcp8 5 the average hydropower generation of the ertan reservoir is expected to increase by 0 95 109 kw h 1 16 109 kw h 5 73 7 02 per year with the actual operation rules and 1 52 109 kw h 1 97 109 kw h 9 19 11 92 per year with the optimized operation rules in addition to the total amount of power generation we can see that the optimized operation rules reduces the outflow in the wet season to ensure the water supply in dry season and increases the power out during that period as can also be seen from the figs 10 and 11 the inter annual variations of outflow in the wet season are somewhat larger than the power generation this is because the outflow is larger than the maximum discharge of turbine during most of the wet season and a large quantity of water flow is not used for hydropower generation but released directly as a result the reservoir almost reaches its installed capacity for the wet season black lines in figs 10 and 11 therefore the notable variations in the outflow are not expected to induce a similarly large variation in the power generation the results of the other reservoirs show a similar trend and the annual total electricity generation of the four hydropower reservoirs combined in the yrb under different scenarios is presented in fig 12 in general the future variations of hydropower generation under actual rules and optimized rules under both rcps compared to the historical period are consistent with the overall precipitation variation of the basin specifically the average hydropower generation of the yrb is expected to decrease by 9 11 per year with the actual operation rules and by 6 8 per year with the optimized operation rules under rcp4 5 the average hydropower generation of the yrb is expected to increase slightly per year with the actual operation rules and by 4 6 per year with the optimized operation rules more electricity will be generated under both rcps with the optimized rules and additional 0 5 c warming further increases the hydropower generation under each rcp scenario 5 discussion the previous section quantitatively depicts the warming induced variations in the future precipitation runoff and hydropower generation of the yrb under the climate impact and reservoir operation the ensemble mean precipitation of the yrb is expected to increase under rcp8 5 in the future especially under the 2 c warming and the higher emission scenario while the overall trend is a decrease under the rcp4 5 the ensemble averaged frequency and the temporal variability of extreme precipitation are likely to increase under global warming thereby leading to a higher risk of floods droughts and geological hazards such as landslides and debris flow especially in the upper basin the precipitation trend and the frequency variability of extreme precipitation are consistent with the most of the existing studies yuan et al 2018 sun et al 2019 for example huang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2007 reported that extreme precipitation indicators in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is expected to show an increasing trend in the future therefore in order to take care of the possible disastrous outcome of the increasing extreme precipitation pre cautious measures such as development of early warning system with longer forecast lead times and more frequent examination on the upper and middle areas of the basin may need to be considered by local agencies in terms of the future natural runoff both hydrologic models suggest that the runoff is likely to decrease under rcp4 5 but increase under rcp8 5 here we compared this finding with yin et al 2018 which reported that the runoff in the yrb would slightly decrease under rcp4 5 as compared with the baseline period which is similar to the results of our study the variation in the annual natural runoff is mostly concentrated in the wet season rather than the dry season thereby leading to a larger imbalance of water resources between the wet season and dry season under rcp8 5 which can result in a higher competition between stakeholders to meet different water demands in the future ehsani et al 2017 dong et al 2020 the daily variability of the natural runoff also sees an increase under all future scenarios as compared to the baseline which can pose a potential challenge to the effective water resources management of the yrb notably the discrepancy in the projected runoff between crest and vic in our research justifies the use of multi hydrologic model ensemble for future climate impact research as both models exhibit equivalently satisfactory results in the calibration and validation period the local reservoirs can mitigate the climate impact by storing the additional runoff in the wet season our findings indicate that they can fully reverse the increasing trend of runoff in the wet season under rcp8 5 and reverse the decreasing trend of water resources or further increasing the water resources in the dry season by releasing more water for hydropower under both rcps in view of the mitigating ability of reservoirs it is advisable that planning of future reservoirs take climate change impacts into consideration in terms of the hydropower generation a larger electricity output is expected in the future with both actual rules and optimized rules under rcp8 5 primarily because of the larger annual and wet season runoff notably reservoir operation with optimized rules can produce significantly more power than the actual operation rules by releasing more water in the dry season this can be informative to local water agencies in terms of the reservoir management policies to deal with the increasing electricity demand across the region in the future for rcp4 5 on the other hand the hydropower generation is projected to lower in the future as compared to historical period especially with the actual operation rules this suggests that the current operation rules may not be as suitable for hydropower generation in the future as in the historical period adjusting the reservoir operation policies cannot fully compensate for the climate induced decrease in the electricity output under rcp4 5 because the electricity output with the optimized operation rules is still less than that in in the historical period therefore adaptation measures are necessary to deal with the possible decline in the hydropower energy in the future to sum up despite the future electricity output exhibits somewhat opposite trends under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 both results highlight the need to adapt the current operation rules to the changing environment for the energy security of the region with respect to the power generation we further compared our results with liu et al 2020 which used five kinds of gcms to project the large scale cascade hydropower system in the upper jinsha river that includes the yrb under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the results show that the power generation increases under all models especially under rcp8 5 compared with the baseline period the power generation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 increases by 0 37 5 18 and 3 78 11 02 respectively this is in slight contrary to our study as we expect the power generation in the yrb under the rcp4 5 to slightly decrease compared to the historical period which could be due to the selection of climate projection data and the discrepancies in model structures 6 conclusions in this study we quantitatively project and analyze the future precipitation hydrology and hydropower generation of the yrb for the global warming period of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this was motivated by the fact that the yrb is a major hydropower base of china and that its geological environment water and energy security can have a significant impact on the economic development of southwest china the ensemble average of nex gddp climate projection data and the ensemble of vic and crest model were employed to project the future natural runoff for the global warming period of 1 5 c and 2 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and hydropower optimized operation rules were explicitly included in the routing modules to further project the regulated runoff and hydropower generation in the future the major conclusions are highlighted as follows the yrb is expected to experience more extreme precipitation events especially at the upper basin which raises the risk of floods droughts and geological hazards such as landslides avalanches and debris flow with the increase in the temperature and emission the frequency and the temporal variability of extreme precipitation is likely to increase therefore mitigating and pre cautious measures may need to be taken by local water agencies to better protect the lives and properties in the yrb and further downstream while the total natural runoff can either increase or decrease under different emission scenarios the basin is likely to see a larger daily variability of the natural runoff under both rcps especially with the higher temperature the local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative impact of climate change by displacing excessive water in the wet season to the dry season and lowering the runoff variability as a result in all future scenarios the basin is expected to see increased runoff in the dry season decreased runoff in the wet season and decreased daily variability of runoff under the joint impact of climate and reservoirs as compared to the baseline most notably the climate induced increase in the wet season runoff is expected to be fully offset by reservoirs under rcp8 5 the possible increase in the natural runoff for the year and for the wet season under rcp8 5 can bring additional advantages to hydropower generation which highly relies on the incoming streamflow on the other hand in consistent with the possible decline of precipitation and runoff we found that the future hydropower generation is likely to decrease under rcp4 5 as compared to the historical period the reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce significantly more electricity than the current actual operation rules with the increase in the temperature and emission these findings nevertheless highlight the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions in general our results are expected to provide instructive implications for future water resources management not only in the yrb but also in other basins along the upper of yangtze river given that these basins are characterized by a similar precipitation pattern and a similar development level to the yrb more importantly our framework of climate impact assessment is generally enough to identify the variations of future precipitation hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and reservoir operation which can be used to provide information for integrated water resources management in different climate regions worldwide credit authorship contribution statement yinmao zhao conceptualization methodology

4186,hydrometeorological teleconnections play a vital role in hydrological processes as they can reflect the influence of large scale atmospheric circulations understanding and accessing such teleconnections can help reveal the hydrometeorological phenomenon and its associated mechanisms therefore a decomposition based teleconnection framework dbtf is developed to identify the hydrological processes related to the teleconnections under climate change it consists of three modules namely hydrological series decomposition teleconnection patterns decomposition and attribution analysis specifically the streamflows are separated into the stationary and nonstationary components using the ssa decomposition technique then the teleconnection patterns enso ao pdo and sunspots are decomposed into multi layer signals by the eemd decomposition technique the multiple complex correspondences of different components from hydrological and climate variables are studied by factorial analysis wavelet coherence transformation maximum information coefficient and the partial autocorrelation coefficients basins from the humid semi humid and semiarid and arid climate zones are estimated by the framework the results show that 1 high frequency of teleconnection patterns has the highest correlation with the stationary components of streamflow while low frequency and trend have the most considerable association with the nonstationary components 2 the stationary components of streamflow show more pronounced correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary components 3 teleconnection patterns demonstrate more substantial on the decomposed components than the raw streamflow the contribution is to provide new insight into mechanisms in the effects of hydrometeorological teleconnections on hydrological variations keywords physical interactions decomposition techniques hydrometeorological teleconnection hydrological variation factorial analysis wct 1 introduction teleconnections have oscillatory patterns and recurring periodicities ranging from inter annual to inter decadal scales which can describe the correlations between remote atmospheric circulation variations and anomalies fluctuations in teleconnections are considered part of the long term natural variation in climate xu li 2019 which can further influence temperature precipitation hydrological processes and the intensity and frequency of extreme climate events e g heatwave tropical cyclones and drought liu et al 2019a b understanding hydro meteorological teleconnections can help characterize the hydrometeorology phenomenon elucidate the physical mechanism and reduce the uncertainties in portraying the hydrology process therefore it has received considerable attention in recent years mockler et al 2016 besides more explicit interpretations of hydro meteorological teleconnections could help provide scientific support for the design of adaptation and mitigation measures in response to such natural disasters under accelerated changing environments wei watkins 2011 the previous research has revealed the response of streamflow to different teleconnection patterns fleming et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 specifically the changing climate was shown to be affected by atmospheric heat moisture fluxes in teleconnection patterns and interactions between atmosphere and the oceans several mathematical models were demonstrated to reproduce the hydro meteorological variability well and the related climatic signals sippel et al 2020 for example statistical methods such as copula wavelets and independent component analysis have been developed to construct the dependence relationships between the hydro meteorological teleconnections and hydrological processes j h lee et al 2018 as an advanced time frequency analysis technique hilbert huang transformation was applied for transforming the nonstationary and non linear time series into linear and stationary processes the up to date mathematical method analyzed by hilbert spectra could facilitate a better understanding of time frequency variations for global information i e the intrinsic mode of variables xiao et al 2019 it is known that teleconnection patterns commonly contain irregular nonstationary oscillation processes also known as nonperiodic and quasiperiodic oscillations these irregular nonstationary oscillation processes are the reflection of external and internal forgings such as solar activity t lee ouarda 2019 recent literature has investigated the hydrometeorological teleconnection between hydrological series and various signals contained in the climate index signals for example han et al 2019 extracted a set of intrinsic modes of the multivariate enso index and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo index with various scales through the empirical mode decomposition emd method and hilbert spectral analysis to analyze the influences of tropical cyclones it showed that each imf could provide an instantaneous frequency corresponding to a different physical timescale that characterizes different dynamical oscillations lee et al adopted emd to decompose the observed climate indices and simulated the imfs with the nso resampling technique it also indicated that emd could provide a chance for exploring the dynamic physical interactions between hydrological variables and climate patterns tamaddun et al 2019 however the dynamic mechanisms behind the hydrometeorological teleconnections remain unsolved and are further complicated by the nonstationarity in hydrological processes apurv and cai 2019 a dominant teleconnection alone cannot fully explain the variability of hydrological processes this fact has led to an increasing need for studying the hydrometeorological teleconnection processes in several sub components especially nonstationary components furthermore the inconclusive identification of the physical process es and driver s behind the nonstationarity challenges the identification of an appropriate analytical framework and consequently might hinder its reliable implementation therefore comprehensive analyses of the potential dynamic mechanism of teleconnection patterns on stationary and nonstationary components of hydrological processes need to be further studied besides no relevant research that had been chosen to analyze the various teleconnections take into consideration the individual influence of nonstationary oscillation processes as an extension of the previous studies a decomposition based teleconnection framework dbtf is first constructed to reveal the potential dynamic mechanism the performance of the dbtf framework on various climate types is evaluated through applications on three study areas i e the pearl river basin prb wei river basin wrb and heihe river basin hrb in china which represents the humid semi humid and semiarid and arid climate zones respectively the main contributions and novelty are as follows 1 proposing a dbtf framework that couples the multiple decomposition techniques and teleconnection analysis methods 2 quantifying the relationships between teleconnection patterns and the stationary nonstationary components of streamflow respectively 3 differentiating the influence of nonstationary oscillation processes of the teleconnections on the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow respectively 2 development of dbtf framework the dbtf framework consists of three modules namely hydrological series decomposition teleconnection patterns decomposition and attribution analysis these analyses are used and carried out in matlab and minitab platforms the flowchart of the dbtf framework is displayed in fig 1 in the hydrological series decomposition the monthly streamflow including the trend periodic and irregular components can be processed by the ssa technique the combination of the trend and oscillatory components are considered as the stationary while the irregular component is defined as the nonstationary therefore the reconstructed series r and residual series r are generated representing the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow respectively in the teleconnection patterns decomposition section multi layer signals contained in the monthly climate indices enso pdo ao and sunspots can be extracted by the eemd these indices can be decomposed the series into several subseries c1 c7 and one trend series c8 the attribution analysis section is the main of three sections which includes multiple analysis techniques firstly factorial analysis fa is introduced for analyzing the impact of multi layer signals from climate indices enso on the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow subsequently the wavelet coherence analysis wct is applied to reveal the coupled oscillations of different components and climate indices in the fields of time and frequency rezaei gurdak 2020 thirdly lag time connections are assessed by the partial autocorrelation analysis pacf between the streamflow and climate indices over the previous 1 24 months zhao et al 2020 finally the maximum information coefficient mic can help to explain the non linear correlation 3 methodology 3 1 time series decomposition methods the ssa technique has been applied and used for the following purposes to decompose the original time series into different components to detect the stationary time series and to reconstruct irregular time series ssa technique can decompose the original time series into different pcs for detecting the stationary time series and reconstructing a new seasonal time series with less noisy specifically it aims to decompose the original series into a sum of a small number of interpretable components such as a slowly varying trend oscillatory components and random noise in this study ssa decomposes and reconstructs the raw hydrologic time series into reconstructed series and residual series which represent stationary streamflow component and nonstationary streamflow component respectively specifically ssa contains four steps 1 embedding step the one dimensional time series is represented as a multidimensional window length the multidimensional time series forms the trajectory matrix the only parameter in this step is the window length l usually where n is the time series length 2 svd step entails the singular n value decomposition of the trajectory matrix into a sum of rank one biorthogonal matrices 3 grouping step corresponds to splitting the matrices computed at the svd step into several groups and summing the matrices within each group the result of this step is a representation of the trajectory matrix as a sum of several resultant matrices 4 diagonal averaging step requires a linear operation and maps the trajectory matrix of the initial series into the initial series itself in this way we obtain a decomposition of the initial series into several additive components eemd decomposition method can identify various oscillatory modes that coexist and divide the raw series into a series of modes namely finite intrinsic mode functions imfs and a trend term t lee ouarda 2019 tan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 this method can decompose any complicated data into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions imfs each mode is represented as a function of both instantaneous frequency and amplitude and hence describes the scale and energy characteristics at any time the sum of all modes gives the full description of the frequency and time characteristics of the signal yin et al 2009 in this study the monthly climate indices series enso pdo ao and sunspots are analyzed by the eemd approach individually imfs with different frequencies and amplitudes are generated and each imf provides the instantaneous rate and corresponds to the different physical timescales compared with emd eemd can avoid the shortcomings of mode mixing and is more suitable for dealing with non linear and non stationary time series specifically eemd is a noise assisted data analysis technique in which an ensemble of emd trials are obtained for a time series prior to each emd run finite amplitude normally distributed white noise is added to the series the emd algorithm then adaptively decomposes the series into a set of intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residual trend an imf is a zero mean fluctuation whose frequency and amplitude may vary with time the highest frequency imf is extracted first with subsequent imfs having progressively lower frequency fluctuations once all imfs are extracted the residual represents any trend within the series which may be an unresolved low frequency fluctuation with an average period longer than the period of record or a linear or non linear trend the emd results from each ensemble member are grouped by imf order and the ensemble average of each imf group and residual forms the eemd result in summary noise is employed to eemd method to relieve the frequency mixing phenomenon of emd based on the theory that additional white noise is uniformly distributed across the entire time frequency space so that the signal regions of various scales can be mapped automatically to appropriate scales related to the background white noise 3 2 factorial analysis the potential physical dynamics behind climate indices and streamflow can be explored by the factorial analysis 2 k factorial design is applied for factorial analysis which requires all combinations of two levels of each k variable xin et al 2016 it can examine the magnitude and direction of effects to determine which factors are likely to be necessary in general the distinction for impact is as follows 1 contras t ab k a 1 b 1 k 1 the contrast associated with that effect can be determined for estimating an impact and calculating the sum of squares for effect if the factor is included in the effect the sign is negative conversely it is positive when the factor is not included in the effect it can be calculated as follows 2 ab k 1 n 2 k 1 c o n t r a s t ab k 3 s s ab k 1 n 2 k c o n t r a s t ab k 2 where ab k indicates single effect or joint effects of factors s s ab k represents the sum of squares for the impact 3 3 wavelet coherence transformation wct wct combines the wavelet power spectrum and cross spectrum in a specific time scale and frequency domain yaseen et al 2015 it can effectively analyze the correlation degree between nonstationary time series and can reveal the phase relationship for depicting the change characteristics and coupled oscillations hadi tombul 2018 in this study wct is applied for analyzing the periodic variations and spatiotemporal correlation characteristics of different streamflow components and global climatic 0scillation 3 4 maximum information coefficient mic is applicable to explore the potential correlation between pairs of variables in the continuous series which has generality and equitability it has gained popularity due to the ability to capture the non linear relationship among variables chen et al 2019 in this study mic method is introduced for calculating the non linear correlation coefficients between the teleconnection patterns and different components of streamflows 4 study area and data description 4 1 study area the study basin areas which include the pearl river basin prb weihe river basin wrb and heihe river basin hrb in china can be considered to represent the humid semi humid and semiarid and arid climate zones respectively fig 2 shows the map locations of the basins with the typical hydrological stations the prb is the third longest river in china and flows into the northern south china sea and the area has

the yellow river apurv and cai 2019 the hrb the second largest inland river watershed in northwestern china is located in the interior of the eurasian continent and characterized by arid hydrological features meng et al 2019 4 2 streamflow data streamflows are collected from prb wrb and hrb under the various climatic zones in china the observation data are obtained from the hydrologic manual whose quality is strictly controlled during its release the detailed information of the study basins and their typical hydrological stations are shown in table 1 4 3 teleconnection patterns enso is considered the most influential teleconnection patterns on a global scale and will be employed to reveal the potential dynamic mechanism of the nonstationary hydrological process in the present study other than the potential impact of climate change climate anomalies such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo american oscillation nao and sunspots may lead to significant changes in streamflow a brief description of the above mentioned teleconnection patterns is given in table 2 enso is a coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon associated with changes in the sea surface temperature in the tropical pacific and significant shifts in the intertropical convergence zone over the pacific ocean sahany et al 2018 the pdo is a long lived ei nino like pattern of pacific climate variability the index is the leading principal component from an un rotated empirical orthogonal analysis of monthly residuals of the north pacific ocean sea surface temperature anomaly poleward of 20 c bonan 2019 the ao is a weather phenomenon at the arctic and antarctic poles north or south of 20 latitude pan et al 2019 sunspots are darker colder areas on the surface of the sun in a region called the photosphere fang et al 2019 the monthly values were retrieved from the earth system research laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration shin et al 2019 5 results and analyses 5 1 data decomposition results 5 1 1 streamflow decomposition by ssa the streamflows with the trend oscillatory behavior periodic or quasi periodic components and noise filtering are confirmed by the previous research apurv and cai 2019 in this study ssa is selected and applied for decomposing and reconstructing the streamflows specifically the stationary component r is generated using principal components after removing the noise component the processes of parameter selection and decomposition are shown in fig 3 from fig 3 a e valuable insights are obtained via inspection breaks testing of the eigenvalue spectra eigenvalue spectrum breaks can therefore help to differentiate between signal eigentriples and noise the number of leading eigenvalues stands out for the prb wrb and hrb are 6 8 and 7 respectively the r and r components form streamflows are obtained in fig 3 b f 5 1 2 components extraction for streamflow and climate indices eemd is employed to decompose the representative climate indices enso pdo ao and sunspots into multi layer signals with different frequencies and amplitudes imf provides the instantaneous rate and corresponds to the different physical timescales the decomposition results of enso pdo ao and sunspots are shown in fig 4 a d respectively imfs are ordered from the highest to the lowest frequency which can characterize the multiple possible dynamical oscillations the first imf c1 is the most non linear and disorder components the central imfs c2 c5 are more regular and stable which contain a significant portion of energy besides the last imf c8 is the lowest change trend of the original time series which can be considered as the residual the imfs for the enso data fig 4a computed using the eemd method described above are shown in fig 4a the figure shows that c1 is composed of the finest timescales or highest frequency and the timescale increases as the index j of cj increases the imfs from 2 to 5 contain the significant portion of energy in the enso data as is known enso has irregular intervals for its occurrence of 36 60 months in the historical record this interval varies from 24 to 82 months c3 to c5 show characteristic periods from 20 to 70 months which may correspond to the irregular occurrence intervals of the el niño and la niña episodes the c6 also presents another possible oscillation with a characteristic period of 156 months c7 shows a possible multi decadal swing of enso with a distinctive period of 390 months fig 4b shows the imfs for the pdo index data computed by the eemd method the imfs from 1 to 5 represent the significant portion of energy throughout the entire data span in the pdo index the two general periodicities of the century long pdo fluctuations were from 180 to 300 months from the imfs of the pdo index c6 with a characteristics period of 200 months corresponded well with the 15 years of the pdo periodicity c7 has a fixed period of about 395 months these two imfs c6 and c7 again coincide well with the cycles of the month intensity of enso for the ao index the imfs computed by the method are shown in fig 4c similar to the case for the enso and pdo index as mentioned earlier from c1 to c5 represent the major portion of energy throughout the entire data span in the ao index the two general periodicities of the century long ao fluctuations were from 180 to 300 months from the imfs of the ao index c6 with a characteristics period of 200 months corresponded well with the 15 years of the pdo periodicity c7 has a characteristic period of about 395 months in fig 4d the imfs for the sunspots are computed by the eemd the imfs from 2 to 5 contain the major portion of energy in the sunspots index as is known it has irregular intervals for its occurrence of 24 40 months c3 to c5 show characteristic periods from 20 to 70 months which may correspond to the irregular occurrence intervals of the sunspots the c6 also presents another possible oscillation with a characteristic period of 200 months the c7 shows a possible multi decadal oscillation of sunspots with a characteristic period of 390 months 5 2 driving factors analysis the stationary r component and nonstationary r component of streamflow are generated by the ssa decomposition technique and the multiple climate index signals included in the teleconnection patterns are separated by the eemd decomposition method the complex dynamical mechanisms of streamflow components and climate indices signals are further explored by the fa method the main effect plots from teleconnection patterns on the streamflows from different basins are shown in figs 5 7 respectively in the prb the slopes of c1 c2 and c4 from the raw runoff are positive going while other components are negative going fig 5 a this indicates that the c1 c2 and c4 have positive effects from the and the c3 c5 c6 c7 and c8 have adverse effects moreover because c2 has the steepest slope this component is the most significant factor which indicates that the variation in this parameter has the most considerable effects on raw series the main results plot for the stationary component from prb is depicted in fig 5 b similarly c1 c2 and c4 have positive effects and c3 c5 c6 c7 and c8 have adverse effects among these factors c2 also has the steepest slope which indicates that the variation in this parameter has the most considerable effects on stationary component and streamflow simultaneously notably the hill at c1 is zero showing no significant impact on the stationary component in fig 5 c c1 c3 and c8 have positive effects on the nonstationary component and the c2 c5 c6 and c7 have adverse effects the slop at c4 is zero indicating no significant impact besides c6 and c7 have the steepest slope these components are the most significant which suggests that the variation in this parameter has the most considerable effects the analysis results showed that the responses of c1 c8 to the raw runoff and stationary component from the prb are relatively close while the nonstationary component shows the big difference meanwhile a full factorial design is adopted to analyze the multiple climate index signals correspondences between these factors in which effects including two way and higher order interactive effects are all considered fig 8 depicts the effects of the c1 c8 significant factors interactions e g enso in this figure the matrixes depict the interactions by describing specific changes in one design factor s effect on system robustness under the impact of another factor it can be seen that the interaction is the most obvious between c3 and c4 however the interaction is not apparent among other components 5 3 spatiotemporal correlation analysis the periodic variations and spatiotemporal correlation characteristics are analyzed for streamflow components by cwt figs 9 12 in these figures the cone of influence is the area outside of the black lines with a concave up slope and the thick black lines enclose regions of significant periodicities at α 5 the relative phase relationship is denoted as arrows the arrows pointing vertically downward or upward represent the advanced or lag of the ¼ cycle the anti phase pointing left and in phase pointing right indicates the positive correlation and negative correlation respectively cheng et al 2019 as shown in fig 9 a c enso and streamflow are significantly positively correlated for 8 14 months in the prb while it weakened considerably in the later period 1985 2015 besides there are lagged insignificantly positive on the scale of 4 8 months whereas relatively dispersed it did not form a long period of impact period enso and stationary components are significantly positively correlated for an 8 14 months scale throughout almost the entire period which is consistent with the raw series enso and nonstationary component show significantly advanced on the 1 6 months scale during 1980 1985 and 2008 2010 in fig 9 d f in the wrb enso and streamflow are significantly positively negatively correlated on the 8 16 months scale during 1960 1975 1980 2000 and 2005 2015 similarly enso and stationary components are significantly positively correlated on the scale of 8 16 months through almost the entire period enso and nonstationary components show significant lagged negative correlations on the 16 32 months scale during the 1965 1985 and 1990 1995 besides it proved relatively dispersed significantly lagged negative correlations on the 32 64 months scale from 1985 to 1995 as shown in fig 9 g i hrb has a significant relationship between raw and enso for an 8 14 months scale throughout almost the entire time the same to the stationary component it also has a strong correlation on the 8 14 months scale throughout nearly the whole period the nonstationary component and enso show significant lagged negative correlations on the 16 32 months and 32 64 months scale during 1975 1985 and 1985 2005 in summary the stationary component of streamflow shows more pronounced spatiotemporal correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary component besides teleconnection patterns demonstrate more substantial on the decomposed components than the raw streamflow 5 4 linear and non linear correlation analysis the correlation coefficients of teleconnection patterns and streamflow components with the 1 24 month lead lag are calculated by the pacf method table 3 fig 13 shows the plots for the correlogram of the stationary r and nonstationary r streamflow components related to the teleconnection patterns in the study basins respectively in the table where the closer the correlation coefficient is to zero the stronger the relationship is and correlation coefficients close to 0 indicate that there is no connection from table 3 and fig 13 the stationary streamflow component shows more pronounced correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary component meanwhile the peak value and its occurrence of positive negative correlation are different in the study basins for the nonstationary component the enso is the most obvious indices in the four indices in all three basins positive correlation occurs at the maximum step of 3 17 and 4 in the prb wrb and hrb respectively while the negative correlation occurs at the lag time of 10 9 and 9 respectively the nonstationary component shows a vast difference from the stationary component in the prb the positive and negative correlation of ao shows the most obvious among the four climate indices in the wrb the nonstationary component has a maximum positive correlation of ao and the maximum negative correlation of enso while in the hrb the maximum positive and negative relationships are depicted in the enso and ao indices respectively additionally the peak value and the occurrence of the lag time association are still different in the three basins the non linear correlation between the teleconnection patterns and different components of streamflows are studied by applying the mic method as shown in fig 14 the stationary component has a relatively high correlation which followed by the raw runoff and nonstationary component for the enso the hrb is more evident than wrb and prb the correlation coefficient of ao is higher than enso and pdo for the sunspots hrb and prb are more apparent than wrb in the previous studies it was pointed out that the stationary characteristics of runoff were broken by climate change in summary it could analyze the miscellaneous correspondence from a quantitative perspective through the linear and non linear correlation analysis meanwhile it can further help access the influence of the large scale atmospheric circulation on the stationary and nonstationary components of runoff respectively 6 discussions the monthly streamflow series from three hydrological stations along with prb wrb and hrb in china have been quantified and qualified the relationships of teleconnections by the proposed dbft framework notably the monthly streamflow data analyzed in this study is the observation runoff data from the hydrological stations along the related river basin in china most hydrological stations were built around 1950 so we can only get data of this length however it does not influence the evolutionary relationship between the hydrological process and teleconnections it is well known that the climate has changed gradually in recent decades due to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activities for example liu et al 2019 showed the significantly decreasing trends and change points in the low flow series from wrb which indicating that its stationarity assumption is invalid these findings contribute to a better understanding of temporal variation of low flow and their responses to changing environments based on this the streamflow series were reconstructed by using significant pairs of principal components obtained through ssa specifically the stationary component r is generated using principal components after removing the noise component similar to the current study eduardo et al 2010 also found that singular spectral analysis ssa is applied to augment the signal to noise ratio in the time series of annual and seasonal streamflow for 44 rivers in southern chile tamaddun et al 2019 applied the ssa to filter the flow time series to further improve the forecasting skill hence the ssa can decompose the original streamflow series into different components and detect the stationary streamflow component and nonstationary streamflow component in this study the primary goal is quantifying the relationships between teleconnection patterns and the stationary nonstationary components of streamflow respectively the second goal is to differentiate the influence of nonstationary oscillation processes of the teleconnections on the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow respectively from fig 13 the enso is the most obvious indices in the four indices enso ao pdo and sunspots in the prb wrb and hrb additionally the hrb located in the northern arid climate zones is more evident than wrb in the northwest semi humid and semiarid climate zones and prb in the southern semiarid climate zones previous studies exploring large scale climate signals and their teleconnections such as the studies by tamaddun et al 2019 suggested a strong correlation between enso and the streamflow patterns of the northwestern northeastern and north central regions which agrees with the findings of the current study cheng et al 2019 found the monthly runoff from hrb with ao nao pdo and amo had significant resonance periodicity by using the continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence for prb the teleconnections of pacific decadal oscillation pdo and especially with el niño southern oscillation enso were highly associated with the evolution of the streamflow and evaporation wu et al 2019 these results together with the performance of the dbft framework emphasizes information about watershed scale influences on the translation of enso signals into streamflow therefore the result highlights the role of decomposition techniques for studying the hydrometeorological teleconnections in creating new insight in the future the regional topographic heterogeneity land use atmospheric background e g air pressure wind speed and temperature and various human activities will be introduced in this framework to reveal the comprehensive dynamical mechanisms behind the hydrometeorological teleconnections under the changing environment 7 conclusion this study provides a decomposition based teleconnection framework and for explaining the hydrometeorological phenomenon and elucidating the relevant physical mechanisms specifically teleconnection patterns demonstrate more substantial on the decomposed components than the streamflow from the quantitative perspective the stationary component shows higher correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary component therefore the nonstationary and stationary components of streamflow could be expressed by the nature and lag time of the selected teleconnection patterns the dbft framework can provide scientific support for the design of adaptation and guide the flexible applications of nonstationary forecasting especially for extreme hydrological events in the future multiscale and multivariate analysis should be carried out for analyzing the teleconnection patterns on the nonstationary hydrological process in addition we will combine the regional topographic heterogeneity land use atmospheric background e g air pressure wind speed and temperature and

4186,hydrometeorological teleconnections play a vital role in hydrological processes as they can reflect the influence of large scale atmospheric circulations understanding and accessing such teleconnections can help reveal the hydrometeorological phenomenon and its associated mechanisms therefore a decomposition based teleconnection framework dbtf is developed to identify the hydrological processes related to the teleconnections under climate change it consists of three modules namely hydrological series decomposition teleconnection patterns decomposition and attribution analysis specifically the streamflows are separated into the stationary and nonstationary components using the ssa decomposition technique then the teleconnection patterns enso ao pdo and sunspots are decomposed into multi layer signals by the eemd decomposition technique the multiple complex correspondences of different components from hydrological and climate variables are studied by factorial analysis wavelet coherence transformation maximum information coefficient and the partial autocorrelation coefficients basins from the humid semi humid and semiarid and arid climate zones are estimated by the framework the results show that 1 high frequency of teleconnection patterns has the highest correlation with the stationary components of streamflow while low frequency and trend have the most considerable association with the nonstationary components 2 the stationary components of streamflow show more pronounced correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary components 3 teleconnection patterns demonstrate more substantial on the decomposed components than the raw streamflow the contribution is to provide new insight into mechanisms in the effects of hydrometeorological teleconnections on hydrological variations keywords physical interactions decomposition techniques hydrometeorological teleconnection hydrological variation factorial analysis wct 1 introduction teleconnections have oscillatory patterns and recurring periodicities ranging from inter annual to inter decadal scales which can describe the correlations between remote atmospheric circulation variations and anomalies fluctuations in teleconnections are considered part of the long term natural variation in climate xu li 2019 which can further influence temperature precipitation hydrological processes and the intensity and frequency of extreme climate events e g heatwave tropical cyclones and drought liu et al 2019a b understanding hydro meteorological teleconnections can help characterize the hydrometeorology phenomenon elucidate the physical mechanism and reduce the uncertainties in portraying the hydrology process therefore it has received considerable attention in recent years mockler et al 2016 besides more explicit interpretations of hydro meteorological teleconnections could help provide scientific support for the design of adaptation and mitigation measures in response to such natural disasters under accelerated changing environments wei watkins 2011 the previous research has revealed the response of streamflow to different teleconnection patterns fleming et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 specifically the changing climate was shown to be affected by atmospheric heat moisture fluxes in teleconnection patterns and interactions between atmosphere and the oceans several mathematical models were demonstrated to reproduce the hydro meteorological variability well and the related climatic signals sippel et al 2020 for example statistical methods such as copula wavelets and independent component analysis have been developed to construct the dependence relationships between the hydro meteorological teleconnections and hydrological processes j h lee et al 2018 as an advanced time frequency analysis technique hilbert huang transformation was applied for transforming the nonstationary and non linear time series into linear and stationary processes the up to date mathematical method analyzed by hilbert spectra could facilitate a better understanding of time frequency variations for global information i e the intrinsic mode of variables xiao et al 2019 it is known that teleconnection patterns commonly contain irregular nonstationary oscillation processes also known as nonperiodic and quasiperiodic oscillations these irregular nonstationary oscillation processes are the reflection of external and internal forgings such as solar activity t lee ouarda 2019 recent literature has investigated the hydrometeorological teleconnection between hydrological series and various signals contained in the climate index signals for example han et al 2019 extracted a set of intrinsic modes of the multivariate enso index and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo index with various scales through the empirical mode decomposition emd method and hilbert spectral analysis to analyze the influences of tropical cyclones it showed that each imf could provide an instantaneous frequency corresponding to a different physical timescale that characterizes different dynamical oscillations lee et al adopted emd to decompose the observed climate indices and simulated the imfs with the nso resampling technique it also indicated that emd could provide a chance for exploring the dynamic physical interactions between hydrological variables and climate patterns tamaddun et al 2019 however the dynamic mechanisms behind the hydrometeorological teleconnections remain unsolved and are further complicated by the nonstationarity in hydrological processes apurv and cai 2019 a dominant teleconnection alone cannot fully explain the variability of hydrological processes this fact has led to an increasing need for studying the hydrometeorological teleconnection processes in several sub components especially nonstationary components furthermore the inconclusive identification of the physical process es and driver s behind the nonstationarity challenges the identification of an appropriate analytical framework and consequently might hinder its reliable implementation therefore comprehensive analyses of the potential dynamic mechanism of teleconnection patterns on stationary and nonstationary components of hydrological processes need to be further studied besides no relevant research that had been chosen to analyze the various teleconnections take into consideration the individual influence of nonstationary oscillation processes as an extension of the previous studies a decomposition based teleconnection framework dbtf is first constructed to reveal the potential dynamic mechanism the performance of the dbtf framework on various climate types is evaluated through applications on three study areas i e the pearl river basin prb wei river basin wrb and heihe river basin hrb in china which represents the humid semi humid and semiarid and arid climate zones respectively the main contributions and novelty are as follows 1 proposing a dbtf framework that couples the multiple decomposition techniques and teleconnection analysis methods 2 quantifying the relationships between teleconnection patterns and the stationary nonstationary components of streamflow respectively 3 differentiating the influence of nonstationary oscillation processes of the teleconnections on the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow respectively 2 development of dbtf framework the dbtf framework consists of three modules namely hydrological series decomposition teleconnection patterns decomposition and attribution analysis these analyses are used and carried out in matlab and minitab platforms the flowchart of the dbtf framework is displayed in fig 1 in the hydrological series decomposition the monthly streamflow including the trend periodic and irregular components can be processed by the ssa technique the combination of the trend and oscillatory components are considered as the stationary while the irregular component is defined as the nonstationary therefore the reconstructed series r and residual series r are generated representing the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow respectively in the teleconnection patterns decomposition section multi layer signals contained in the monthly climate indices enso pdo ao and sunspots can be extracted by the eemd these indices can be decomposed the series into several subseries c1 c7 and one trend series c8 the attribution analysis section is the main of three sections which includes multiple analysis techniques firstly factorial analysis fa is introduced for analyzing the impact of multi layer signals from climate indices enso on the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow subsequently the wavelet coherence analysis wct is applied to reveal the coupled oscillations of different components and climate indices in the fields of time and frequency rezaei gurdak 2020 thirdly lag time connections are assessed by the partial autocorrelation analysis pacf between the streamflow and climate indices over the previous 1 24 months zhao et al 2020 finally the maximum information coefficient mic can help to explain the non linear correlation 3 methodology 3 1 time series decomposition methods the ssa technique has been applied and used for the following purposes to decompose the original time series into different components to detect the stationary time series and to reconstruct irregular time series ssa technique can decompose the original time series into different pcs for detecting the stationary time series and reconstructing a new seasonal time series with less noisy specifically it aims to decompose the original series into a sum of a small number of interpretable components such as a slowly varying trend oscillatory components and random noise in this study ssa decomposes and reconstructs the raw hydrologic time series into reconstructed series and residual series which represent stationary streamflow component and nonstationary streamflow component respectively specifically ssa contains four steps 1 embedding step the one dimensional time series is represented as a multidimensional window length the multidimensional time series forms the trajectory matrix the only parameter in this step is the window length l usually where n is the time series length 2 svd step entails the singular n value decomposition of the trajectory matrix into a sum of rank one biorthogonal matrices 3 grouping step corresponds to splitting the matrices computed at the svd step into several groups and summing the matrices within each group the result of this step is a representation of the trajectory matrix as a sum of several resultant matrices 4 diagonal averaging step requires a linear operation and maps the trajectory matrix of the initial series into the initial series itself in this way we obtain a decomposition of the initial series into several additive components eemd decomposition method can identify various oscillatory modes that coexist and divide the raw series into a series of modes namely finite intrinsic mode functions imfs and a trend term t lee ouarda 2019 tan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 this method can decompose any complicated data into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions imfs each mode is represented as a function of both instantaneous frequency and amplitude and hence describes the scale and energy characteristics at any time the sum of all modes gives the full description of the frequency and time characteristics of the signal yin et al 2009 in this study the monthly climate indices series enso pdo ao and sunspots are analyzed by the eemd approach individually imfs with different frequencies and amplitudes are generated and each imf provides the instantaneous rate and corresponds to the different physical timescales compared with emd eemd can avoid the shortcomings of mode mixing and is more suitable for dealing with non linear and non stationary time series specifically eemd is a noise assisted data analysis technique in which an ensemble of emd trials are obtained for a time series prior to each emd run finite amplitude normally distributed white noise is added to the series the emd algorithm then adaptively decomposes the series into a set of intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residual trend an imf is a zero mean fluctuation whose frequency and amplitude may vary with time the highest frequency imf is extracted first with subsequent imfs having progressively lower frequency fluctuations once all imfs are extracted the residual represents any trend within the series which may be an unresolved low frequency fluctuation with an average period longer than the period of record or a linear or non linear trend the emd results from each ensemble member are grouped by imf order and the ensemble average of each imf group and residual forms the eemd result in summary noise is employed to eemd method to relieve the frequency mixing phenomenon of emd based on the theory that additional white noise is uniformly distributed across the entire time frequency space so that the signal regions of various scales can be mapped automatically to appropriate scales related to the background white noise 3 2 factorial analysis the potential physical dynamics behind climate indices and streamflow can be explored by the factorial analysis 2 k factorial design is applied for factorial analysis which requires all combinations of two levels of each k variable xin et al 2016 it can examine the magnitude and direction of effects to determine which factors are likely to be necessary in general the distinction for impact is as follows 1 contras t ab k a 1 b 1 k 1 the contrast associated with that effect can be determined for estimating an impact and calculating the sum of squares for effect if the factor is included in the effect the sign is negative conversely it is positive when the factor is not included in the effect it can be calculated as follows 2 ab k 1 n 2 k 1 c o n t r a s t ab k 3 s s ab k 1 n 2 k c o n t r a s t ab k 2 where ab k indicates single effect or joint effects of factors s s ab k represents the sum of squares for the impact 3 3 wavelet coherence transformation wct wct combines the wavelet power spectrum and cross spectrum in a specific time scale and frequency domain yaseen et al 2015 it can effectively analyze the correlation degree between nonstationary time series and can reveal the phase relationship for depicting the change characteristics and coupled oscillations hadi tombul 2018 in this study wct is applied for analyzing the periodic variations and spatiotemporal correlation characteristics of different streamflow components and global climatic 0scillation 3 4 maximum information coefficient mic is applicable to explore the potential correlation between pairs of variables in the continuous series which has generality and equitability it has gained popularity due to the ability to capture the non linear relationship among variables chen et al 2019 in this study mic method is introduced for calculating the non linear correlation coefficients between the teleconnection patterns and different components of streamflows 4 study area and data description 4 1 study area the study basin areas which include the pearl river basin prb weihe river basin wrb and heihe river basin hrb in china can be considered to represent the humid semi humid and semiarid and arid climate zones respectively fig 2 shows the map locations of the basins with the typical hydrological stations the prb is the third longest river in china and flows into the northern south china sea and the area has

quality is strictly controlled during its release the detailed information of the study basins and their typical hydrological stations are shown in table 1 4 3 teleconnection patterns enso is considered the most influential teleconnection patterns on a global scale and will be employed to reveal the potential dynamic mechanism of the nonstationary hydrological process in the present study other than the potential impact of climate change climate anomalies such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo american oscillation nao and sunspots may lead to significant changes in streamflow a brief description of the above mentioned teleconnection patterns is given in table 2 enso is a coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon associated with changes in the sea surface temperature in the tropical

al 2019 the monthly values were retrieved from the earth system research laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration shin et al 2019 5 results and analyses 5 1 data decomposition results 5 1 1 streamflow decomposition by ssa the streamflows with the trend oscillatory behavior periodic or quasi periodic components and noise filtering are confirmed by the previous research apurv and cai 2019 in this study ssa is selected and applied for decomposing and reconstructing the streamflows specifically the stationary component r is generated using principal components after removing the noise component the processes of parameter selection and decomposition are shown in fig 3 from fig 3 a e valuable insights are obtained via inspection breaks testing of the eigenvalue spectra eigenvalue spectrum breaks can therefore help to differentiate between signal eigentriples and noise the number of leading eigenvalues stands out for the prb wrb and hrb are 6 8 and 7 respectively the r and r components form streamflows are obtained in fig 3 b f 5 1 2 components extraction for streamflow and climate indices eemd is employed to decompose the representative climate indices enso pdo ao and sunspots into multi layer signals with different frequencies and amplitudes imf provides the instantaneous rate and corresponds to the different physical timescales the decomposition results of enso pdo ao and sunspots are shown in fig 4 a d respectively imfs are ordered from the highest to the lowest frequency which can characterize the multiple possible dynamical oscillations the first imf c1 is the most non linear and disorder components the central imfs c2 c5 are more regular and stable which contain a significant portion of energy besides the last imf c8 is the lowest change trend of the original time series which can be considered as the residual the imfs for the enso data fig 4a computed using the eemd method described above are shown in fig 4a the figure shows that c1 is composed of the finest timescales or highest frequency and the timescale increases as the index j of cj increases the imfs from 2 to 5 contain the significant portion of energy in the enso data as is known enso has irregular intervals for its occurrence of 36 60 months in the historical record this interval varies from 24 to 82 months c3 to c5 show characteristic periods from 20 to 70 months which may correspond to the irregular occurrence intervals of the el niño and la niña episodes the c6 also presents another possible oscillation with a characteristic period of 156 months c7 shows a possible multi decadal swing of enso with a distinctive period of 390 months fig 4b shows the imfs for the pdo index data computed by the eemd method the imfs from 1 to 5 represent the significant portion of energy throughout the entire data span in the pdo index the two general periodicities of the century long pdo fluctuations were from 180 to 300 months from the imfs of the pdo index c6 with a characteristics period of 200 months corresponded well with the 15 years of the pdo periodicity c7 has a fixed period of about 395 months these two imfs c6 and c7 again coincide well with the cycles of the month intensity of enso for the ao index the imfs computed by the method are shown in fig 4c similar to the case for the enso and pdo index as mentioned earlier from c1 to c5 represent the major portion of energy throughout the entire data span in the ao index the two general periodicities of the century long ao fluctuations were from 180 to 300 months from the imfs of the ao index c6 with a characteristics period of 200 months corresponded well with the 15 years of the pdo periodicity c7 has a characteristic period of about 395 months in fig 4d the imfs for the sunspots are computed by the eemd the imfs from 2 to 5 contain the major portion of energy in the sunspots index as is known it has irregular intervals for its occurrence of 24 40 months c3 to c5 show characteristic periods from 20 to 70 months which may correspond to the irregular occurrence intervals of the sunspots the c6 also presents another possible oscillation with a characteristic period of 200 months the c7 shows a possible multi decadal oscillation of sunspots with a characteristic period of 390 months 5 2 driving factors analysis the stationary r component and nonstationary r component of streamflow are generated by the ssa decomposition technique and the multiple climate index signals included in the teleconnection patterns are separated by the eemd decomposition method the complex dynamical mechanisms of streamflow components and climate indices signals are further explored by the fa method the main effect plots from teleconnection patterns on the streamflows from different basins are shown in figs 5 7 respectively in the prb the slopes of c1 c2 and c4 from the raw runoff are positive going while other components are negative going fig 5 a this indicates that the c1 c2 and c4 have positive effects from the and the c3 c5 c6 c7 and c8 have adverse effects moreover because c2 has the steepest slope this component is the most significant factor which indicates that the variation in this parameter has the most considerable effects on raw series the main results plot for the stationary component from prb is depicted in fig 5 b similarly c1 c2 and c4 have positive effects and c3 c5 c6 c7 and c8 have adverse effects among these factors c2 also has the steepest slope which indicates that the variation in this parameter has the most considerable effects on stationary component and streamflow simultaneously notably the hill at c1 is zero showing no significant impact on the stationary component in fig 5 c c1 c3 and c8 have positive effects on the nonstationary component and the c2 c5 c6 and c7 have adverse effects the slop at c4 is zero indicating no significant impact besides c6 and c7 have the steepest slope these components are the most significant which suggests that the variation in this parameter has the most considerable effects the analysis results showed that the responses of c1 c8 to the raw runoff and stationary component from the prb are relatively close while the nonstationary component shows the big difference meanwhile a full factorial design is adopted to analyze the multiple climate index signals correspondences between these factors in which effects including two way and higher order interactive effects are all considered fig 8 depicts the effects of the c1 c8 significant factors interactions e g enso in this figure the matrixes depict the interactions by describing specific changes in one design factor s effect on system robustness under the impact of another factor it can be seen that the interaction is the most obvious between c3 and c4 however the interaction is not apparent among other components 5 3 spatiotemporal correlation analysis the periodic variations and spatiotemporal correlation characteristics are analyzed for streamflow components by cwt figs 9 12 in these figures the cone of influence is the area outside of the black lines with a concave up slope and the thick black lines enclose regions of significant periodicities at α 5 the relative phase relationship is denoted as arrows the arrows pointing vertically downward or upward represent the advanced or lag of the ¼ cycle the anti phase pointing left and in phase pointing right indicates the positive correlation and negative correlation respectively cheng et al 2019 as shown in fig 9 a c enso and streamflow are significantly positively correlated for 8 14 months in the prb while it weakened considerably in the later period 1985 2015 besides there are lagged insignificantly positive on the scale of 4 8 months whereas relatively dispersed it did not form a long period of impact period enso and stationary components are significantly positively correlated for an 8 14 months scale throughout almost the entire period which is consistent with the raw series enso and nonstationary component show significantly advanced on the 1 6 months scale during 1980 1985 and 2008 2010 in fig 9 d f in the wrb enso and streamflow are significantly positively negatively correlated on the 8 16 months scale during 1960 1975 1980 2000 and 2005 2015 similarly enso and stationary components are significantly positively correlated on the scale of 8 16 months through almost the entire period enso and nonstationary components show significant lagged negative correlations on the 16 32 months scale during the 1965 1985 and 1990 1995 besides it proved relatively dispersed significantly lagged negative correlations on the 32 64 months scale from 1985 to 1995 as shown in fig 9 g i hrb has a significant relationship between raw and enso for an 8 14 months scale throughout almost the entire time the same to the stationary component it also has a strong correlation on the 8 14 months scale throughout nearly the whole period the nonstationary component and enso show significant lagged negative correlations on the 16 32 months and 32 64 months scale during 1975 1985 and 1985 2005 in summary the stationary component of streamflow shows more pronounced spatiotemporal correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary component besides teleconnection patterns demonstrate more substantial on the decomposed components than the raw streamflow 5 4 linear and non linear correlation analysis the correlation coefficients of teleconnection patterns and streamflow components with the 1 24 month lead lag are calculated by the pacf method table 3 fig 13 shows the plots for the correlogram of the stationary r and nonstationary r streamflow components related to the teleconnection patterns in the study basins respectively in the table where the closer the correlation coefficient is to zero the stronger the relationship is and correlation coefficients close to 0 indicate that there is no connection from table 3 and fig 13 the stationary streamflow component shows more pronounced correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary component meanwhile the peak value and its occurrence of positive negative correlation are different in the study basins for the nonstationary component the enso is the most obvious indices in the four indices in all three basins positive correlation occurs at the maximum step of 3 17 and 4 in the prb wrb and hrb respectively while the negative correlation occurs at the lag time of 10 9 and 9 respectively the nonstationary component shows a vast difference from the stationary component in the prb the positive and negative correlation of ao shows the most obvious among the four climate indices in the wrb the nonstationary component has a maximum positive correlation of ao and the maximum negative correlation of enso while in the hrb the maximum positive and negative relationships are depicted in the enso and ao indices respectively additionally the peak value and the occurrence of the lag time association are still different in the three basins the non linear correlation between the teleconnection patterns and different components of streamflows are studied by applying the mic method as shown in fig 14 the stationary component has a relatively high correlation which followed by the raw runoff and nonstationary component for the enso the hrb is more evident than wrb and prb the correlation coefficient of ao is higher than enso and pdo for the sunspots hrb and prb are more apparent than wrb in the previous studies it was pointed out that the stationary characteristics of runoff were broken by climate change in summary it could analyze the miscellaneous correspondence from a quantitative perspective through the linear and non linear correlation analysis meanwhile it can further help access the influence of the large scale atmospheric circulation on the stationary and nonstationary components of runoff respectively 6 discussions the monthly streamflow series from three hydrological stations along with prb wrb and hrb in china have been quantified and qualified the relationships of teleconnections by the proposed dbft framework notably the monthly streamflow data analyzed in this study is the observation runoff data from the hydrological stations along the related river basin in china most hydrological stations were built around 1950 so we can only get data of this length however it does not influence the evolutionary relationship between the hydrological process and teleconnections it is well known that the climate has changed gradually in recent decades due to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activities for example liu et al 2019 showed the significantly decreasing trends and change points in the low flow series from wrb which indicating that its stationarity assumption is invalid these findings contribute to a better understanding of temporal variation of low flow and their responses to changing environments based on this the streamflow series were reconstructed by using significant pairs of principal components obtained through ssa specifically the stationary component r is generated using principal components after removing the noise component similar to the current study eduardo et al 2010 also found that singular spectral analysis ssa is applied to augment the signal to noise ratio in the time series of annual and seasonal streamflow for 44 rivers in southern chile tamaddun et al 2019 applied the ssa to filter the flow time series to further improve the forecasting skill hence the ssa can decompose the original streamflow series into different components and detect the stationary streamflow component and nonstationary streamflow component in this study the primary goal is quantifying the relationships between teleconnection patterns and the stationary nonstationary components of streamflow respectively the second goal is to differentiate the influence of nonstationary oscillation processes of the teleconnections on the stationary and nonstationary components of streamflow respectively from fig 13 the enso is the most obvious indices in the four indices enso ao pdo and sunspots in the prb wrb and hrb additionally the hrb located in the northern arid climate zones is more evident than wrb in the northwest semi humid and semiarid climate zones and prb in the southern semiarid climate zones previous studies exploring large scale climate signals and their teleconnections such as the studies by tamaddun et al 2019 suggested a strong correlation between enso and the streamflow patterns of the northwestern northeastern and north central regions which agrees with the findings of the current study cheng et al 2019 found the monthly runoff from hrb with ao nao pdo and amo had significant resonance periodicity by using the continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence for prb the teleconnections of pacific decadal oscillation pdo and especially with el niño southern oscillation enso were highly associated with the evolution of the streamflow and evaporation wu et al 2019 these results together with the performance of the dbft framework emphasizes information about watershed scale influences on the translation of enso signals into streamflow therefore the result highlights the role of decomposition techniques for studying the hydrometeorological teleconnections in creating new insight in the future the regional topographic heterogeneity land use atmospheric background e g air pressure wind speed and temperature and various human activities will be introduced in this framework to reveal the comprehensive dynamical mechanisms behind the hydrometeorological teleconnections under the changing environment 7 conclusion this study provides a decomposition based teleconnection framework and for explaining the hydrometeorological phenomenon and elucidating the relevant physical mechanisms specifically teleconnection patterns demonstrate more substantial on the decomposed components than the streamflow from the quantitative perspective the stationary component shows higher correlations with the teleconnection patterns than the nonstationary component therefore the nonstationary and stationary components of streamflow could be expressed by the nature and lag time of the selected teleconnection patterns the dbft framework can provide scientific support for the design of adaptation and guide the flexible applications of nonstationary forecasting especially for extreme hydrological events in the future multiscale and multivariate analysis should be carried out for analyzing the teleconnection patterns on the nonstationary hydrological process in addition we will combine the regional topographic heterogeneity land use atmospheric background e g air pressure wind speed and temperature and

4187,groundwater lens floating on the seawater in surficial coastal aquifers is an important freshwater supply for small island inhabitants this study addresses an unanswered simple but important question for groundwater resources management in small islands how much freshwater can be sustainably withdrawn from a groundwater lens in small islands we derive an approximate analytical solution to describe the freshwater seawater sharp interface profile in an idealized strip island subject to a pumping well located at the domain center to determine the critical or maximum allowable pumping rate that prevents saltwater upconing a simple formula of the critical pumping rate is provided as a function of hydrogeologic parameters including the recharge rate densities hydraulic conductivity and well penetrating depth it shows that the critical pumping rate increases linearly with the recharge rate and decreases linearly with the hydraulic conductivity and the squared well penetrating depth laboratory visualization experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to validate the derived analytical solution results indicate that the maximum pumping rate can be as high as 50 of the total recharge for a single well located at the top of the domain center our solutions and results provide useful insights for sustainable groundwater management in small islands and can potentially render significant social and economic impact for inhabitants on small islands keywords groundwater lens optimal pumping strip island 1 introduction inhabitants on small islands often face the stress of insufficient freshwater resources due to the lack of natural surface water reservoirs groundwater provides an important freshwater supply for small islands in surficial coastal aquifers fresh groundwater floats as a lens above the seawater due to density difference a transition zone can be delineated between the freshwater and seawater in many cases the transition zone may be approximated as a sharp interface when it is relatively thin compared with the aquifer thickness lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2010 lu and luo 2014 rathore et al 2018a rathore et al 2018b rathore et al 2020 the elevation or position of the interface determines the volume of freshwater potentially available for withdrawal which generally fluctuates with the long term change pattern of recharge intensity tang et al 2020 the interface equilibrium between freshwater and seawater can be broken when excessive freshwater is withdrawn from water supply wells causing an upward movement of the interface towards the pumping well commonly referred as upconing asghar et al 2002 bear 2012 thus for sustainable groundwater resources management on small islands a key is the determination of critical or maximum pumping rates that can be applied without inducing saltwater upconing into water production wells research of saltwater upconing has a long history muskat 1938 first provided an approximate solution for steady state flow to a pumping well above a freshwater seawater interface by assuming that the interface moves only a small distance compared with the original spacing between the well and interface since then several analytical solutions based on the sharp interface assumption have been developed to investigate the pumping induced upward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface dagan and bear 1968 strack 1972 zhang and hocking 1996 dagan and zeitoun 1998 bower et al 1999 zhang et al 2009 numerical modeling of saltwater upconing generally solves coupled variable density flow and transport including the most popular computer codes seawat and sutra both developed by u s geological survey langevin et al 2003 voss and provost 2002 the major difference between numerical simulations and sharp interface analytical solutions is the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion which yields a variable density transition zone between freshwater and seawater rubin and pinder 1977 wirojanagud and charbeneau 1985 reilly and goodman 1987 ma et al 1997 zhou et al 2005 lu et al 2019 for sharp interface solutions the critical pumping rate is solely determined by the position of cone apex while for a variable density transition zone the concentration in the pumping well or a specified iso concentration line needs to be defined to determine the critical pumping rate experimental studies abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 oswald et al 2002 werner et al 2009 and field investigation were also conducted to study the behavior of saltwater upconing schmork and mercado 1969 gopinath et al 2016 houben and post 2017 although saltwater upconing has been studied for many years the research of upconing in small islands is limited there are two major differences regarding the problem conceptualizations between the previous studies and in small islands firstly a typical assumption in previous studies is that the initial interface is horizontally infinite or semi infinite which may only be valid for describing local upconing behavior on the top of a large scale seawater intrusion wedge or a lens interface in large islands in small islands the sea boundary has significant impact to shape the lens interface profile secondly most previous studies assumed horizontal inflow freshwater flux from side boundaries to supply the withdrawal while the vertical recharge from the ground surface is considered as the freshwater source for the groundwater lens in small islands therefore most of previous studies discussed above cannot be directly applied to investigate the upconing problem of the freshwater seawater interface in a small island and to determine the critical groundwater withdrawal rate from a groundwater lens there are also extensive studies on freshwater lens behavior in small islands under varying conditions by analytical numerical and physical models bedekar et al 2019 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2015 dose et al 2014 fetter 1972 houben and post 2017 ketabchi et al 2014 memari et al 2020 post et al 2018 schneider and kruse 2006 stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2015 stoeckl et al 2016 vacher 1988 however few studies have been conducted to investigate the upconing problem of a freshwater lens interface to determine the critical pumping rate in small islands banerjee and singh 2011 kura et al 2014 piscopo et al 2020 many fundamental scientific questions remain unanswered for example the simplest but most important question is how high the pumping rate can be for withdrawing freshwater from the groundwater lens in a small island the answer to this question is very useful for sustainable groundwater management and can potentially render significant social and economic impact for inhabitants on small islands to this end the present study focuses on a single pumping well in a small strip island we provide an explicit analytical formula for the first time to determine the critical pumping rate of a pumping well located at the center of an island and the steady state lens interface profile under vertical recharge and groundwater withdrawal the analytical solution is validated by numerical models and laboratory visualization experiments sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the critical pumping rate under various hydrogeological conditions 2 conceptual model fig 1 shows the vertical cross section of a typical fresh groundwater lens in a small island strip islands are considered here for simplicity the island length is assumed much longer than its width 2w l allowing us to simplify the problem to the two dimensional vertical section the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and unconfined with a freshwater hydraulic conductivity k l t seawater boundaries at both domain sides are assumed constant head the impact of tidal activities is not considered by assuming that the interface fluctuations due to high frequency tidal activities are negligible tang et al 2020 a constant and uniformly distributed recharge rate ω l t is applied along the surface the transition zone between the seawater and freshwater is approximated as a sharp interface this simplification was initially validated by muskat 1938 and has been widely used by numerous researchers in coastal aquifers without high heterogeneity and large dispersion lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2014 freshwater is separated by this interface and floats above the seawater in the form of lens we define the thickness of lens as the distance from the interface to the sea level h we shall notice that the actual freshwater thickness is the distance from the interface to the water table i e h h shown in fig 1 a simple relationship can be established between h and h according to the ghyben herzberg relationship the interface is symmetric with the maximum thickness at the center x 0 the aquifer is assumed much thicker than the maximum thickness of the lens so that the lens is fully developed fig 1 schematically shows the shape of the lens under groundwater withdrawal from a single well the pumping well is placed at the center of the lens with a penetration depth of d l to achieve the maximum pumping rate since the conceptual model is two dimensional the pumping well actually represents a drain or a line sink strack 1972 zhang and hocking 1996 zhang et al 2009 the lens interface beneath the well rises in response to pumping changing the interface to an ω shape with the increase of the pumping rate the center of the interface moves toward the well a critical pumping rate can be defined as the maximum pumping rate that can be applied to prevent the interface peak from penetrating into the well i e the peak remains stable as long as the pumping rate does not exceed the critical pumping rate 3 approximate analytical solution 3 1 groundwater lens interface profile for the conceptual model shown in fig 1 the pumping rate is assumed low so that the upconing has not penetrated into the pumping well due to symmetry the analytical model describes the half island as the whole domain by neglecting the storage effect of water expansion and aquifer compaction i e the net water flux into the groundwater lens controls the lens shape and volume hantush 1968 we have the continuity equation 1 q x x q z z 0 where x l is the distance from the center z l is the vertical coordinate q x lt 1 and q z lt 1 are specific or darcy s velocities at x and z direction respectively we can integrate eq 1 over the freshwater lens thickness along the z direction of the lens cross section i e the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 and the positive upward direction and apply leibnitz s rule 2 h h q x d z x q x h h x q x h h x q z h q z h 0 3 q z h ε d h dt 4 q z h ε d h dt where ε is the porosity substituting darcy s law q x k h x and the ghyben herzberg relationship h δ h into eqs 3 and 4 and applying the linearization method of the boussinesq equation hantush 1968 bear 2012 the governing equation is derived as 5 k δ h ε 2 h 2 x 2 h 2 t where t t is the time δ ρ s ρ f ρ f ρ s m l3 and ρ f m l3 are seawater and freshwater density respectively h l is the average of the areal distribution of the depth according to dupuit assumption and the assumption that the hydraulic head along a vertical plane is the average value between the water table and interface the well discharge q l2t 1 through a vertical plane can be written as fetter 1972 bear 2012 rathore et al 2020 6 q k h h h x we can rearrange eq 6 as 7 q k δ 1 δ h 2 2 x at x 0 the interpretation of pumping point is analogous to eq 7 the only difference is that we consider the flow from both sides of the vertical plane thus at the pumping point we have a neumann boundary hantush 1968 8 h 2 0 t x q δ 1 δ k the sea level is assumed constant 9 h 2 w t 0 the transient state solution can be derived for eq 5 given the average depth which is not needed for the steady state the steady state solution of h 2 can be obtained as 10 h 2 x q δ 1 δ k x w eq 10 provides the solution to the interface profile subject to groundwater pumping for the impact of recharge the steady state solution of the lens interface under a recharge rate ω is given by fetter 1972 11 h 2 x ω w 2 x 2 δ 1 δ k since h 2 is approximated by a linear system eq 5 we can obtain the steady state interface profile under both pumping and recharge by superposing eq 10 and eq 11 12 h 2 x ω w 2 x 2 δ 1 δ k q δ 1 δ k x w 3 2 critical pumping rate the above approximate solution assumes that the pumping well is located at the surface i e the upconing peak can reach the top at the critical pumping rate thus by setting h 0 at x 0 in eq 12 we can get the critical pumping rate for the well at the top at the center of the island 13 q m a x ω w for a pumping well penetrating into the aquifer the saltwater can be prevented from entering the well if the steady state interface elevation in the pumping state is lower than the location of the well screen thus the critical pumping rate can be determined by specifying the vertical distance from the well screen to the bottom of the pre pumping lens as the maximum allowed interface elevation this method was applied in previous studies to obtain the critical pumping rate for a partially penetrating well chandler and mcwhorter 1975 for the analytical modeling approach the critical pumping rate can be calculated directly by setting the left side of eq 12 equal to the squared well depth at x 0 i e h 2 x 0 d 2 thus we obtain 14 q m a x ω w δ 1 δ k d 2 w eq 14 includes the case of well at the surface by letting d 0 the analytical solution also enables us to generalize the problem with the following dimensionless variables 15 h h w ω ω k h h w t kt w ε x x w d d w q q kw eqs 12 and 14 can be written as 16 h 2 x ω 1 x 2 δ 1 δ q δ 1 δ x 1 17 q ω δ 1 δ d 2 eq 17 indicates that the dimensionless critical pumping rate is controlled by two parameters the dimensionless recharge rate and the well penetrating depth to investigate how much water can be withdrawn from the total recharge we define the critical pumping ratio η by normalizing the critical pumping rate with the total recharge rate ω 2 w ω 18 η q ω q 2 ω 1 2 δ 1 δ d 2 2 ω which indicates that the maximum or critical pumping rate for a well located at the aquifer top i e d 0 is half of the total recharge rate 4 laboratory visualization experiments 4 1 experiment setup following the conceptual model we conducted laboratory experiments to visualize the interface upconing fig 2 shows the configuration parameters and real image of the experimental tank system an acrylic glass box of 60 cm length 18 cm height and 1 cm width was used as a sand tank to simulate the cross section of a strip island with coarse sand filled to a height of 17 cm fig 2 the left and right reservoirs used to represent the seawater boundary were connected to the glass box through a 5 cm long channel and contained seawater with water level 15 cm above the tank bottom also the two reservoirs were big enough to diminish seawater surface fluctuations due to outflow and connected to each other to keep the water level equal for both sides to avoid mixing between freshwater and saltwater four drippers at the rate of recharge rate were arranged on each side to pump the mixture from the upper port surface recharge was supplied by a multi channel peristaltic pump longerpump bt100 1l through twelve freshwater dippers recharge rate were set to 0 12 0 28 0 56 cm min respectively equal to 0 6 1 4 and 2 8 ml min per dipper a stainless steel pipe with a diameter of 2 mm was inserted into the flow tank at the center to simulate the horizontal well from the back to the front the total length of the steel pipe was 2 5 cm of which 1 cm was covered with small notches and the rest was located outside the sandbox and connected to another peristaltic pump through a rubber tube at the back for well pumping the steel pipe was placed at 0 2 5 and 5 cm below sea level for different experiments a density meter was used to determine fresh and saline water densities which were set to 998 and 1024 9 kg m3 respectively the density meter also monitors the concentration of pumping water a tracer dye was added to the saltwater for visualization and the density was checked to ensure this led to no measurable change all experiments were photographed at 10 minute intervals using a digital camera canon eos 800d coarse sands were filled uniformly in the tank several experiments were conducted in situ to determine the hydraulic conductivity value first we keep the right side as inlet side of specified flux q and the left side as an outlet side of specified head hout after reaching the steady state the head at the right side was recorded as hin then the k value can be calculated from 19 k 4 q w w t h in 2 h out 2 where w and w t are the half width and thickness of sand tank equal to 30 cm and 1 cm respectively according to our experiment setup four sets of q values were applied and corresponding k values were estimated from the equation above we adopted the arithmetic means 200 cm min as the k value in both analytical solutions and numerical modeling similar k values were used in previous studies of laboratory lenses dose et al 2014 lu et al 2019 stoeckl et al 2015 yan et al 2021 the porosity value was measured through the water saturation method fetter 2018 and determined to be 0 38 yan et al 2021 4 2 experimental validation results fig 3 compares the interface profiles given by eq 12 and the laboratory visualization experiments under the critical pumping rate determined by eq 14 for wells located at the tank top and partially penetrating into the tank media thin interfaces were created in the homogeneous sand abarca and clement 2009 lu et al 2013 all cases showed good agreement of interface profiles between experimental results and the approximate analytical solutions we used three different recharge rates fig 3a c for the water withdrawal at the top of the tank the volume of the freshwater lens or the interface thickness at the domain center increases with the recharge rate correspondingly a higher water withdrawal rate can be achieved for a higher recharge rate given a constant recharge rate the total freshwater volume available for withdrawal is constant however the critical pumping rate decreases with the well penetration depth fig 3d 3f because the interface upconing peak is limited to the pumping depth 5 numerical simulations 5 1 setup of numerical cases the approximate analytical solution is also validated by field scale numerical cases simulated using seawat langevin et al 2003 which combines modflow and mt3dms to simulate variable density flow table 1 lists typical hydrogeologic and geometric parameters for a base field scale numerical model recharge rates and well penetrating depths are varied to investigate the sensitivity each grid of the 600 m 150 m domain is 1 m 1 m we compare the magnitude of critical pumping rates and the corresponding upconing interface profiles in the case of various recharge rates and well depths for numerical simulations and analytical solutions in the dimensionless form in the next section we shall notice that it is not convenient to estimate the critical pumping rate by numerical modeling because the pumping rate needs to be predefined for numerical simulations one can only try different pumping rates and visualize the concentration distributions or obtain the concentration profile at the pumping well to determine the maximum pumping rate that can maintain a stable interface without penetrating into the well we use 1 as the salt concentration threshold to obtain the critical pumping rate in the numerical model one may define other threshold values such as the 50 concentration contour line rathore et al 2018a reilly and goodman 1987 which may yield similar behavior for thin lens interfaces 5 2 numerical case validation fig 4 a shows the field scale numerical simulation results at the critical pumping rates for the recharge rate ω at 10 4 5 10 4 and 10 3 for the pumping well located at the top of the aquifer symbols represent the contour lines of 1 salt concentration normalized by the seawater concentration for numerical simulations the interface profiles given by the approximate analytical solution match numerical simulations in all cases in general a higher recharge rate leads to a deeper interface indicating a larger freshwater volume stored in the aquifer moreover the upconing peak under the critical condition is located just below the well implying a critical interface rise ratio of 1 the interface rise ratio is defined as the interface upconing height normalized by the distance between the well screen and the original lens profile in infinite or semi infinite horizontally flow domain without the vertical recharge the critical rise ratio was found around 0 25 0 9 bower et al 1999 motz 1992 werner et al 2009 the difference is that the constant recharge of the lens from the top inhibits the upward movement of the interface and leads to a more stable interface than the cases with the recharge flow from side boundaries fig 4 b compares the analytical solution and 1 concentration contour lines in the numerical simulation for partially penetrating wells the lens is assumed to be in a steady state before pumping the critical pumping rate q is 8 10 4 and 5 10 4 for the dimensionless well depth d at 0 09 and 0 14 respectively the critical pumping rate is reduced when the well penetrates deeper because a deeper well leads to a smaller allowed interface upconing fig 6 clearly shows that the analytical solution provides excellent approximation of the numerical solution for different recharge rates and penetrating wells 5 3 sensitivity analysis 5 3 1 effects of recharge rate and well penetration depth eqs 14 and 17 provide simple first order relationships between the critical pumping rate and hydrogeological and well parameters that is the critical pumping rate q linearly increases with the recharge rate and linearly decreases with the squared well penetration depth fig 5 shows that these first order relationship are well confirmed by the numerical simulations especially at high recharge rates the reason is that the salt concentration at the pumping well is more likely to be affected by the transition zone between freshwater and seawater when the lens thickness becomes thinner under a lower recharge rate from fig 5 b we should note that there is a limit for the well depth at which the critical pumping rate is zero by letting the left side of eq 14 be zero we can have the depth limit d ω w 2 δ 1 δ k which is also the maximum thickness of the lens center 5 3 2 effects of hydraulic conductivity eq 14 indicates that the critical pumping rate decreases linearly with the hydraulic conductivity thus the recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity have opposite impact on the critical pumping rate such opposite impact was also observed in previous studies greskowiak et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2014 vacher 1988 another interesting observation given by eq 14 is that the critical pumping rate is independent of hydraulic conductivity if the pumping is applied at the aquifer top i e d 0 this case is common for a shallow well in a relatively thick groundwater lens to verify this finding we consider four cases for the well located at the top case1 ω 10 8 m s k 10 3 m s ω 10 5 case2 ω 10 7 m s k 10 3 m s ω 10 4 case3 ω 10 8 m s k 10 4 m s ω 10 4 case4 ω 10 7 m s k 10 4 m s ω 10 3 eq 16 shows that the lens interface under the critical pumping rate only depends on ω this is verified by the interface profiles under the critical pumping rates shown in fig 6 where cases 2 and 3 have the same ω from different combination of ω and k and almost overlapped interface profiles case 4 with a larger ω produces a thicker lens and case 1 with a smaller ω produces a thinner lens than those of cases 2 or 3 it also demonstrates that using the ratio between recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity as the dimensionless form of ω is valid thus cases 2 and 3 have the same dimensionless critical pumping rate q however due to the different recharge rates the actual pumping rates are an order of magnitude difference moreover cases 2 and 4 have different hydraulic conductivity i e 10 3 m s and 10 4 m s but the same actually pumping rate in the numerical simulations validating the conclusion from eq 14 that the magnitude of hydraulic conductivity has no impact on the actual critical pumping rate for a well located at the top 6 conclusion this study addresses a simple but important question for groundwater resources management in coastal islands how much freshwater can be withdrawn from a fresh groundwater lens in island aquifers we present an idealized conceptual model with a single pumping well located at the center of a two dimensional vertical cross section of a small strip island an explicit analytical solution is derived to determine the critical pumping rate for groundwater withdrawal at different well penetration depth the analytical solution indicates that the critical pumping rate linearly increases with the recharge rate and linearly decreases with the hydraulic conductivity and the squared well penetrating depth numerical simulations and laboratory visualization experiments are conducted to validate the results obtained by the analytical solutions we found that the maximum pumping rate of a well located at the aquifer top is not affected by hydraulic conductivity and can theoretically reach 50 of the total recharge in our idealized model that is a pumping rate greater than half of the recharge is not sustainable one may use this information as simple guidance for groundwater withdrawal for example st george island can extract about several millions of cubic meters of freshwater per year from the lens according to hydrogeological conditions and precipitation rates in the island schneider and kruse 2006 there are several limitations with the derived solution and findings in addition to the simplified hydrogeological settings such as homogeneous thick aquifer vertical section and uniform recharge etc the critical pumping rate from the approximate analytical solution may not guarantee the pumped water is pure freshwater due to the sharp interface assumption in particular for islands with thick variable density transitional zones it may be necessary to use the breakthrough concentrations in the pumping well to determine the critical pumping rate the pumping rate is also assumed to be constant but in reality it may vary in different seasons in addition we only consider a single pumping well in the practical field multiple wells are commonly used for pumping this leads to another interesting problem given a certain

4187,groundwater lens floating on the seawater in surficial coastal aquifers is an important freshwater supply for small island inhabitants this study addresses an unanswered simple but important question for groundwater resources management in small islands how much freshwater can be sustainably withdrawn from a groundwater lens in small islands we derive an approximate analytical solution to describe the freshwater seawater sharp interface profile in an idealized strip island subject to a pumping well located at the domain center to determine the critical or maximum allowable pumping rate that prevents saltwater upconing a simple formula of the critical pumping rate is provided as a function of hydrogeologic parameters including the recharge rate densities hydraulic conductivity and well penetrating depth it shows that the critical pumping rate increases linearly with the recharge rate and decreases linearly with the hydraulic conductivity and the squared well penetrating depth laboratory visualization experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to validate the derived analytical solution results indicate that the maximum pumping rate can be as high as 50 of the total recharge for a single well located at the top of the domain center our solutions and results provide useful insights for sustainable groundwater management in small islands and can potentially render significant social and economic impact for inhabitants on small islands keywords groundwater lens optimal pumping strip island 1 introduction inhabitants on small islands often face the stress of insufficient freshwater resources due to the lack of natural surface water reservoirs groundwater provides an important freshwater supply for small islands in surficial coastal aquifers fresh groundwater floats as a lens above the seawater due to density difference a transition zone can be delineated between the freshwater and seawater in many cases the transition zone may be approximated as a sharp interface when it is relatively thin compared with the aquifer thickness lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2010 lu and luo 2014 rathore et al 2018a rathore et al 2018b rathore et al 2020 the elevation or position of the interface determines the volume of freshwater potentially available for withdrawal which generally fluctuates with the long term change pattern of recharge intensity tang et al 2020 the interface equilibrium between freshwater and seawater can be broken when excessive freshwater is withdrawn from water supply wells causing an upward movement of the interface towards the pumping well commonly referred as upconing asghar et al 2002 bear 2012 thus for sustainable groundwater resources management on small islands a key is the determination of critical or maximum pumping rates that can be applied without inducing saltwater upconing into water production wells research of saltwater upconing has a long history muskat 1938 first provided an approximate solution for steady state flow to a pumping well above a freshwater seawater interface by assuming that the interface moves only a small distance compared with the original spacing between the well and interface since then several analytical solutions based on the sharp interface assumption have been developed to investigate the pumping induced upward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface dagan and bear 1968 strack 1972 zhang and hocking 1996 dagan and zeitoun 1998 bower et al 1999 zhang et al 2009 numerical modeling of saltwater upconing generally solves coupled variable density flow and transport including the most popular computer codes seawat and sutra both developed by u s geological survey langevin et al 2003 voss and provost 2002 the major difference between numerical simulations and sharp interface analytical solutions is the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion which yields a variable density transition zone between freshwater and seawater rubin and pinder 1977 wirojanagud and charbeneau 1985 reilly and goodman 1987 ma et al 1997 zhou et al 2005 lu et al 2019 for sharp interface solutions the critical pumping rate is solely determined by the position of cone apex while for a variable density transition zone the concentration in the pumping well or a specified iso concentration line needs to be defined to determine the critical pumping rate experimental studies abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 oswald et al 2002 werner et al 2009 and field investigation were also conducted to study the behavior of saltwater upconing schmork and mercado 1969 gopinath et al 2016 houben and post 2017 although saltwater upconing has been studied for many years the research of upconing in small islands is limited there are two major differences regarding the problem conceptualizations between the previous studies and in small islands firstly a typical assumption in previous studies is that the initial interface is horizontally infinite or semi infinite which may only be valid for describing local upconing behavior on the top of a large scale seawater intrusion wedge or a lens interface in large islands in small islands the sea boundary has significant impact to shape the lens interface profile secondly most previous studies assumed horizontal inflow freshwater flux from side boundaries to supply the withdrawal while the vertical recharge from the ground surface is considered as the freshwater source for the groundwater lens in small islands therefore most of previous studies discussed above cannot be directly applied to investigate the upconing problem of the freshwater seawater interface in a small island and to determine the critical groundwater withdrawal rate from a groundwater lens there are also extensive studies on freshwater lens behavior in small islands under varying conditions by analytical numerical and physical models bedekar et al 2019 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2015 dose et al 2014 fetter 1972 houben and post 2017 ketabchi et al 2014 memari et al 2020 post et al 2018 schneider and kruse 2006 stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2015 stoeckl et al 2016 vacher 1988 however few studies have been conducted to investigate the upconing problem of a freshwater lens interface to determine the critical pumping rate in small islands banerjee and singh 2011 kura et al 2014 piscopo et al 2020 many fundamental scientific questions remain unanswered for example the simplest but most important question is how high the pumping rate can be for withdrawing freshwater from the groundwater lens in a small island the answer to this question is very useful for sustainable groundwater management and can potentially render significant social and economic impact for inhabitants on small islands to this end the present study focuses on a single pumping well in a small strip island we provide an explicit analytical formula for the first time to determine the critical pumping rate of a pumping well located at the center of an island and the steady state lens interface profile under vertical recharge and groundwater withdrawal the analytical solution is validated by numerical models and laboratory visualization experiments sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the critical pumping rate under various hydrogeological conditions 2 conceptual model fig 1 shows the vertical cross section of a typical fresh groundwater lens in a small island strip islands are considered here for simplicity the island length is assumed much longer than its width 2w l allowing us to simplify the problem to the two dimensional vertical section the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and unconfined with a freshwater hydraulic conductivity k l t seawater boundaries at both domain sides are assumed constant head the impact of tidal activities is not considered by assuming that the interface fluctuations due to high frequency tidal activities are negligible tang et al 2020 a constant and uniformly distributed recharge rate ω l t is applied along the surface the transition zone between the seawater and freshwater is approximated as a sharp interface this simplification was initially validated by muskat 1938 and has been widely used by numerous researchers in coastal aquifers without high heterogeneity and large dispersion lu et al 2009 lu and luo 2014 freshwater is separated by this interface and floats above the seawater in the form of lens we define the thickness of lens as the distance from the interface to the sea level h we shall notice that the actual freshwater thickness is the distance from the interface to the water table i e h h shown in fig 1 a simple relationship can be established between h and h according to the ghyben herzberg relationship the interface is symmetric with the maximum thickness at the center x 0 the aquifer is assumed much thicker than the maximum thickness of the lens so that the lens is fully developed fig 1 schematically shows the shape of the lens under groundwater withdrawal from a single well the pumping well is placed at the center of the lens with a penetration depth of d l to achieve the maximum pumping rate since the conceptual model is two dimensional the pumping well actually represents a drain or a line sink strack 1972 zhang and hocking 1996 zhang et al 2009 the lens interface beneath the well rises in response to pumping changing the interface to an ω shape with the increase of the pumping rate the center of the interface moves toward the well a critical pumping rate can be defined as the maximum pumping rate that can be applied to prevent the interface peak from penetrating into the well i e the peak remains stable as long as the pumping rate does not exceed the critical pumping rate 3 approximate analytical solution 3 1 groundwater lens interface profile for the conceptual model shown in fig 1 the pumping rate is assumed low so that the upconing has not penetrated into the pumping well due to symmetry the analytical model describes the half island as the whole domain by neglecting the storage effect of water expansion and aquifer compaction i e the net water flux into the groundwater lens controls the lens shape and volume hantush 1968 we have the continuity equation 1 q x x q z z 0 where x l is the distance from the center z l is the vertical coordinate q x lt 1 and q z lt 1 are specific or darcy s velocities at x and z direction respectively we can integrate eq 1 over the freshwater lens thickness along the z direction of the lens cross section i e the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 and the positive upward direction and apply leibnitz s rule 2 h h q x d z x q x h h x q x h h x q z h q z h 0 3 q z h ε d h dt 4 q z h ε d h dt where ε is the porosity substituting darcy s law q x k h x and the ghyben herzberg relationship h δ h into eqs 3 and 4 and applying the linearization method of the boussinesq equation hantush 1968 bear 2012 the governing equation is derived as 5 k δ h ε 2 h 2 x 2 h 2 t where t t is the time δ ρ s ρ f ρ f ρ s m l3 and ρ f m l3 are seawater and freshwater density respectively h l is the average of the areal distribution of the depth according to dupuit assumption and the assumption that the hydraulic head along a vertical plane is the average value between the water table and interface the well discharge q l2t 1 through a vertical plane can be written as fetter 1972 bear 2012 rathore et al 2020 6 q k h h h x we can rearrange eq 6 as 7 q k δ 1 δ h 2 2 x at x 0 the interpretation of pumping point is analogous to eq 7 the only difference is that we consider the flow from both sides of the vertical plane thus at the pumping point we have a neumann boundary hantush 1968 8 h 2 0 t x q δ 1 δ k the sea level is assumed constant 9 h 2 w t 0 the transient state solution can be derived for eq 5 given the average depth which is not needed for the steady state the steady state solution of h 2 can be obtained as 10 h 2 x q δ 1 δ k x w eq 10 provides the solution to the interface profile subject to groundwater pumping for the impact of recharge the steady state solution of the lens interface under a recharge rate ω is given by fetter 1972 11 h 2 x ω w 2 x 2 δ 1 δ k since h 2 is approximated by a linear system eq 5 we can obtain the steady state interface profile under both pumping and recharge by superposing eq 10 and eq 11 12 h 2 x ω w 2 x 2 δ 1 δ k q δ 1 δ k x w 3 2 critical pumping rate the above approximate solution assumes that the pumping well is located at the surface i e the upconing peak can reach the top at the critical pumping rate thus by setting h 0 at x 0 in eq 12 we can get the critical pumping rate for the well at the top at the center of the island 13 q m a x ω w for a pumping well penetrating into the aquifer the saltwater can be prevented from entering the well if the steady state interface elevation in the pumping state is lower than the location of the well screen thus the critical pumping rate can be determined by specifying the vertical distance from the well screen to the bottom of the pre pumping lens as the maximum allowed interface elevation this method was applied in previous studies to obtain the critical pumping rate for a partially penetrating well chandler and mcwhorter 1975 for the analytical modeling approach the critical pumping rate can be calculated directly by setting the left side of eq 12 equal to the squared well depth at x 0 i e h 2 x 0 d 2 thus we obtain 14 q m a x ω w δ 1 δ k d 2 w eq 14 includes the case of well at the surface by letting d 0 the analytical solution also enables us to generalize the problem with the following dimensionless variables 15 h h w ω ω k h h w t kt w ε x x w d d w q q kw eqs 12 and 14 can be written as 16 h 2 x ω 1 x 2 δ 1 δ q δ 1 δ x 1 17 q ω δ 1 δ d 2 eq 17 indicates that the dimensionless critical pumping rate is controlled by two parameters the dimensionless recharge rate and the well penetrating depth to investigate how much water can be withdrawn from the total recharge we define the critical pumping ratio η by normalizing the critical pumping rate with the total recharge rate ω 2 w ω 18 η q ω q 2 ω 1 2 δ 1 δ d 2 2 ω which indicates that the maximum or critical pumping rate for a well located at the aquifer top i e d 0 is half of the total recharge rate 4 laboratory visualization experiments 4 1 experiment setup following the conceptual model we conducted laboratory experiments to visualize the interface upconing fig 2 shows the configuration parameters and real image of the experimental tank system an acrylic glass box of 60 cm length 18 cm height and 1 cm width was used as a sand tank to simulate the cross section of a strip island with coarse sand filled to a height of 17 cm fig 2 the left and right reservoirs used to represent the seawater boundary were connected to the glass box through a 5 cm long channel and contained seawater with water level 15 cm above the tank bottom also the two reservoirs were big enough to diminish seawater surface fluctuations due to outflow and connected to each other to keep the water level equal for both sides to avoid mixing between freshwater and saltwater four drippers at the rate of recharge rate were arranged on each side to pump the mixture from the upper port surface recharge was supplied by a multi channel peristaltic pump longerpump bt100 1l through twelve freshwater dippers recharge rate were set to 0 12 0 28 0 56 cm min respectively equal to 0 6 1 4 and 2 8 ml min per dipper a stainless steel pipe with a diameter of 2 mm was inserted into the flow tank at the center to simulate the horizontal well from the back to the front the total length of the steel pipe was 2 5 cm of which 1 cm was covered with small notches and the rest was located outside the sandbox and connected to another peristaltic pump through a rubber tube at the back for well pumping the steel pipe was placed at 0 2 5 and 5 cm below sea level for different experiments a density meter was used to determine fresh and saline water densities which were set to 998 and 1024 9 kg m3 respectively the density meter also monitors the concentration of pumping water a tracer dye was added to the saltwater for visualization and the density was checked to ensure this led to no measurable change all experiments were photographed at 10 minute intervals using a digital camera canon eos 800d coarse sands were filled uniformly in the tank several experiments were conducted in situ to determine the hydraulic conductivity value first we keep the right side as inlet side of specified flux q and the left side as an outlet side of specified head hout after reaching the steady state the head at the right side was recorded as hin then the k value can be calculated from 19 k 4 q w w t h in 2 h out 2 where w and w t are the half width and thickness of sand tank equal to 30 cm and 1 cm respectively according to our experiment setup four sets of q values were applied and corresponding k values were estimated from the equation above we adopted the arithmetic means 200 cm min as the k value in both analytical solutions and numerical modeling similar k values were used in previous studies of laboratory lenses dose et al 2014 lu et al 2019 stoeckl et al 2015 yan et al 2021 the porosity value was measured through the water saturation method fetter 2018 and determined to be 0 38 yan et al 2021 4 2 experimental validation results fig 3 compares the interface profiles given by eq 12 and the laboratory visualization experiments under the critical pumping rate determined by eq 14 for wells located at the tank top and partially penetrating into the tank media thin interfaces were created in the homogeneous sand abarca and clement 2009 lu et al 2013 all cases showed good agreement of interface profiles between experimental results and the approximate analytical solutions we used three different recharge rates fig 3a c for the water withdrawal at the top of the tank the volume of the freshwater lens or the interface thickness at the domain center increases with the recharge rate correspondingly a higher water withdrawal rate can be achieved for a higher recharge rate given a constant recharge rate the total freshwater volume available for withdrawal is constant however the critical pumping rate decreases with the well penetration depth fig 3d 3f because the interface upconing peak is limited to the pumping depth 5 numerical simulations 5 1 setup of numerical cases the approximate analytical solution is also validated by field scale numerical cases simulated using seawat langevin et al 2003 which combines modflow and mt3dms to simulate variable density flow table 1 lists typical hydrogeologic and geometric parameters for a base field scale numerical model recharge rates and well penetrating depths are varied to investigate the sensitivity each grid of the 600 m 150 m domain is 1 m 1 m we compare the magnitude of critical pumping rates and the corresponding upconing interface profiles in the case of various recharge rates and well depths for numerical simulations and analytical solutions in the dimensionless form in the next section we shall notice that it is not convenient to estimate the critical pumping rate by numerical modeling because the pumping rate needs to be predefined for numerical simulations one can only try different pumping rates and visualize the concentration distributions or obtain the concentration profile at the pumping well to determine the maximum pumping rate that can maintain a stable interface without penetrating into the well we use 1 as the salt concentration threshold to obtain the critical pumping rate in the numerical model one may define other threshold values such as the 50 concentration contour line rathore et al 2018a reilly and goodman 1987 which may yield similar behavior for thin lens interfaces 5 2 numerical case validation fig 4 a shows the field scale numerical simulation results at the critical pumping rates for the recharge rate ω at 10 4 5 10 4 and 10 3 for the pumping well located at the top of the aquifer symbols represent the contour lines of 1 salt concentration normalized by the seawater concentration for numerical simulations the interface profiles given by the approximate analytical solution match numerical simulations in all cases in general a higher recharge rate leads to a deeper interface indicating a larger freshwater volume stored in the aquifer moreover the upconing peak under the critical condition is located just below the well implying a critical interface rise ratio of 1 the interface rise ratio is defined as the interface upconing height normalized by the distance between the well screen and the original lens profile in infinite or semi infinite horizontally flow domain without the vertical recharge the critical rise ratio was found around 0 25 0 9 bower et al 1999 motz 1992 werner et al 2009 the difference is that the constant recharge of the lens from the top inhibits the upward movement of the interface and leads to a more stable interface than the cases with the recharge flow from side boundaries fig 4 b compares the analytical solution and 1 concentration contour lines in the numerical simulation for partially penetrating wells the lens is assumed to be in a steady state before pumping the critical pumping rate q is 8 10 4 and 5 10 4 for the dimensionless well depth d at 0 09 and 0 14 respectively the critical pumping rate is reduced when the well penetrates deeper because a deeper well leads to a smaller allowed interface upconing fig 6 clearly shows that the analytical solution provides excellent approximation of the numerical solution for different recharge rates and penetrating wells 5 3 sensitivity analysis 5 3 1 effects of recharge rate and well penetration depth eqs 14 and 17 provide simple first order relationships between the critical pumping rate and hydrogeological and well parameters that is the critical pumping rate q linearly increases with the recharge rate and linearly decreases with the squared well penetration depth fig 5 shows that these first order relationship are well confirmed by the numerical simulations especially at high recharge rates the reason is that the salt concentration at the pumping well is more likely to be affected by the transition zone between freshwater and seawater when the lens thickness becomes thinner under a lower recharge rate from fig 5 b we should note that there is a limit for the well depth at which the critical pumping rate is zero by letting the left side of eq 14 be zero we can have the depth limit d ω w 2 δ 1 δ k which is also the maximum thickness of the lens center 5 3 2 effects of hydraulic conductivity eq 14 indicates that the critical pumping rate decreases linearly with the hydraulic conductivity thus the recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity have opposite impact on the critical pumping rate such opposite impact was also observed in previous studies greskowiak et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2014 vacher 1988

under the critical pumping rates shown in fig 6 where cases 2 and 3 have the same ω from different combination of ω and k and almost overlapped interface profiles case 4 with a larger ω produces a thicker lens and case 1 with a smaller ω produces a thinner lens than those of cases 2 or 3 it also demonstrates that using the ratio between recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity as the

catchments cshc region has decreased significantly quantifying the impact of check dams on sediment reduction in the cshc region can provide a basis for regional management and decision making of check dam construction in this study data from12 main tributaries in the region were collected and the sediment reduction efficiency sre of key dams was quantified by evaluating the sediment retention capacity src of key dams in different periods the results showed that there were 3703 key dams in the cshc region among which the wuding river watershed had the largest number of key dams 1139 and the largest total storage capacity 1332 9 mm3 the annual sediment load of all tributaries showed a significant decreasing trend p less than 0 01 over the past six decades by 2018 the sediment reduction of the selected tributaries was basically more than 80 which was mainly caused by human activities although the construction area of key dams in the cshc region was increasing the annual src of key dams was decreasing in period 1 the average sre of key dams on the west side was much higher than that on the east side we determined that the influence of check dams in this area was weakening since the average sre of key dams for the selected watersheds decreased from 24 38 of period 1 1980 1999 to 11 24 of period 2 2000 2018 in the future the management strategy and construction planning of the

2003 wang et al 2011a while sediment is the main source of carbon and nutrients for maintaining river and ocean ecosystems aufdenkampe et al 2011 darby et al 2016 in recent decades many studies have documented that the runoff and sediment load of many rivers in the world have decreased significantly stanley and warne 1998 walling and fang 2003 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2006 tan 2018 as the second longest river in china the yellow river used to be the river with the largest sediment concentration in the world wang et al 2015 accounting for 6 of the global river sediment flux wang et al 2007 however since the 1950s the annual sediment discharge of the yellow river and its main tributaries have continued to decline wang et al 2010 xu 2004 zhao et al 2018 at present numerous studies have been made on the spatial temporal variations of sediment discharge and the potential reasons for the significant decrease of sediment load in the yellow river basin gao et al 2017 miao et al 2011 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2007 analyzed the sediment load changes in the yellow river basin from 1950 to 2005 and found that the sediment discharge of the upper middle and lower reaches decreased gradually but the main reasons for the results were different wang et al 2012 investigated the spatial temporal variations of suspended sediment deposition ssd in the upper reaches of the yellow river from 1952 to 2007 and discovered that the construction of check dams in the upper stream tributaries blocked a significant amount of sediment load which led to the reduction of sediment concentration in the main channels xu 2004 put forward that although both river flow and sediment load decreased if the excessive exploitation of river water resources cannot be well restrained the erosion and sediment control measures will not effectively reduce sediment concentration in the lower reaches of the yellow river nearly 90 of the sediment into the yellow river is supplied by the eroded soil of the loess plateau yu et al 2013 due to improper land use fragile ecosystem poor soil erosion resistance and high intensity rainstorm the soil erosion rates in this region are at the forefront of the world since the 1950s a series of soil erosion control measures have been carried out on the loess plateau in particular the grain for green project was implemented in 1999 which restored vegetation to curb serious soil erosion improved the natural ecological environment and reduced the sediment into the yellow river meanwhile due to the obvious benefits of intercepting sediment and providing fertile farmland the construction of check dam has also been developed rapidly in recent decades after half a century of development about 110 000 check dams were artificially distributed throughout the whole loess plateau which prevents approximately 21 billion m3 of sediments from entering the yellow river wang et al 2011b moreover the filled check dams can be reclaimed into cultivated land and its fertility and nutrients are much higher than those of sloping farmland according to the field survey results more than 3200 km2 of dam croplands are currently cultivated by local people to obtain more food output jin et al 2012 check dams have been recognized as an effective sedimentation mitigation technique which is generally arranged in rivers or gullies to slow down the flow velocity intercept sediment and reduce the erosion of downstream gullies nyssen et al 2004 zhang et al 2021 at present owing to the significant role of check dams in soil and water conservation and farmland expansion which have been applied as an important measure in regional soil and water loss prevention and control by many countries abedini et al 2012 borja et al 2018 fang 2017 polyakov et al 2014 evaluated the sediment retention capacity of check dams in the santa rita experimental range srer of the united states and found that these dams have stored 75 tons of sediment during four years reducing the sediment load by 50 by calculating the sediment accumulation in sediment traps borja et al 2018 indicated that more than 70 of sediments were prevented from passing through the check dams shi et al 2019 applied the swat model to simulate the erosion situation of the wuding river watershed on the loess plateau of china under different scenarios and found that the check dams reduced sediment yield by 11 7 according to the national census data there are 5340 key dams storage capacity 50 104 m3 distributed in the tributaries feeding the middle reaches of the yellow river of which 1090 have been filled with sediment wang et al 2015 as the most serious soil erosion area in the yellow river basin and even the whole of china the coarse sandy hilly catchments cshc region in the middle reaches of the yellow river has been concerned for decades although numerous studies have revealed the impact of check dams on soil erosion and sediment yield of typical watersheds fang 2017 zhao et al 2017 few studies have quantitatively evaluated the sediment reduction efficiency sre of key dams in a watershed let alone the main watersheds in the whole cshc region therefore to quantify the sre of key dams we selected 12 main tributaries in the cshc region as the research objects the objectives of this study are 1 to distinguish the contribution of climate changes and human activities to sediment reduction in the 12 main tributaries 2 to quantify the sre of key dams in the main watersheds 3 to evaluate the potential influence factors of the sre 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cshc region fig 1 is located in the middle of the loess plateau which is also usually referred to as the hekou longmen region in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the study area covers an area of 1 3 105 km2 which accounts for 15 of the entire yellow river basin the mainstream flows through the cshc region is 733 km long the most serious erosion area of the loess plateau is the cshc region which provides 69 of the sediment load for the yellow river in 1955 1969 and contributes 42 1 of the sediment load in 1970 2009 gao et al 2017 rustomji et al 2008 the region has become the focus for us to study the variation of sediment load and flow sediment relationships the annual average precipitation during 1956 2014 in the cshc region is 443 mm which ranges from 580 mm in the southeast to less than 300 mm in the northwest mcvicar et al 2007 72 of the total annual rainfall occurs during the flood period june september and it is often in the form of high intensity rainstorms zhang 2021 in addition the most common soil in this region is inceptisols soil usda soil taxonomy which is very easy to erode and transport wang et al 2009a as a result about 88 of the sediment within the csch region is eroded during the flood period we selected 20 main watersheds within the cshc region to analyze the current situation of key dams fig 1 then quantitatively analyzed the sre of key dams in the 12 main watersheds the characteristics of these watersheds are shown in table 1 2 2 datasets the key dam data of the whole cshc region is mainly based on the general survey data of water conservation of the yellow river conservancy committee in 2011 the data mainly includes the name construction time dam controlled area total storage capacity siltation storage capacity dam length dam height longitude and latitude coordinates of the key dams according to the longitude and latitude coordinates of all dams we distinguish the number of key dams and related information in each watershed by arcgis software annual rainfall and sediment data of the 12 main tributaries from 1954 to 2018 are mainly from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china hydrological data of the yellow river basin and some missing data extracted from previous studies moreover the rainfall data of some tributaries in some years are supplemented by the daily rainfall data of corresponding meteorological stations from 1951 to 2019 the daily rainfall data of all meteorological stations distributed in the cshc region were from the national meteorological information center of china the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was extracted by google earth engine gee platform using long term remote sensing image record landsat 5 7 tm at a spatial resolution of 30 m for the period of 1986 2018 meanwhile we first searched the literature according to the relevant keywords check dam watershed catchment sediment yield etc then all the information about sediment yield is extracted from the literature search results finally the sediment yield of the selected 12 watersheds is tabulated table s1 it can be used as the basis for estimating the sediment retention capacity src of key dams in different periods 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend test and change point analysis the significance of the trends in annual sediment discharge time series was estimated by the non parametric mann kendall m k test mann 1945 the m k test has been widely applied to evaluate the changing trends of annual meteorological and hydrological time series gao et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 the positive z value of m k test indicates an upward trend and vice versa when the absolute value of z is greater than or equal to 1 28 1 64 and 2 32 it means that it has passed the significance test with 90 95 and 99 confidence respectively in this study the change point analysis was applied to determine the possible mutation years of long time series sediment records chang points were determined by using the pettitt test pettitt 1979 method to detects a significant change of time series in addition wang et al 2015 explored the reasons for the reduction of sediment transport in the yellow river and found that there were two abrupt falls of sediment load in the middle reaches of the yellow river around the years 1979 and 1999 therefore we divide the time series of the past 60 years into three periods including 1954 1979 reference period 1980 1999 period 1 and 2000 2018 period 2 2 3 2 double mass curve method the principle of the double mass curve method is that when the proportionality between the two variables is constant the curve of the two cumulative quantities presents a straight line however once the original relationship between the two variables is disturbed the slope of the double mass curve will change accordingly hence in this study the double mass curve was applied to evaluate the impact of climate changes and human activities on sediment discharge in which precipitation was the primary factor reflecting the change of hydrological records caused by climate change fig 5 a detailed description of the double mass curve method can be referred to yang et al 2018 2 3 3 evaluating the src of key dams based on the statistical analysis of the key dam data in the typical watersheds of the cshc region the src of key dams is estimated according to the sediment yield of 12 watersheds in different periods on the contrary the measured total sediment is calculated based on the siltation storage capacity of the key dams to verify the estimation results the estimation method of sediment retention by key dams in different periods is as follows 1 s a s y n t e where s is the src of key dams in different periods 104 t a stands for the dam controlled area km2 sy represents the average sediment yield of each watershed in the corresponding period t km2 a n indicates the life expectancy of key dams in the calculation period a te is the sediment trapping efficiency of key dams according to the research results of pal et al 2018 and the technical code of key dam for soil and water conservation sl289 2003 the life expectancy of key dams in this study is determined as 25 years this means that in the 25 years after the construction time the key dams are involved in the calculation of the sediment amount and vice versa we applied the method proposed by brown 1943 to calculate the sediment trapping efficiency of all key dams in 2011 and obtained the average sediment trapping efficiency was about 81 as the key dams are generally built with spillway or drainage well and other facilities part of sediment will be discharged through these facilities in the process of sediment deposition according to the previous research results rahmati et al 2020 wei et al 2017 the sediment trapping efficiency of all key dams in this study is calculated as 85 the estimated results are verified according to the siltation storage capacity of key dams according to the general survey data of water conservation of the yellow river conservancy committee in 2011 we obtained the siltation storage capacity of each key dam and divided the watershed where each key dam is located by 2011 the siltation storage capacity of key dams in huangfuchuan gushanchuan and kuyehe river watershed has reached 68 17 million m3 42 22 million m3 and 58 69 million m3 respectively wang et al 2009b proposed that the average bulk density of sediment in the check dams can be approximately 1 3 t m3 so we use this value multiplied by the siltation storage capacity to calculate the sediment weight in the key dams from this the measured total sediment in each watershed can be obtained by adding up the sediment weight of all the key dams by comparing the measured total sediment and the calculated total sediment it can be found that the calculated results are basically equal to the measured results table 2 this indicates that the calculation result is credible and shows that the life expectancy of key dams the dam controlled area the sediment trapping efficiency and the sediment yield of the watershed can be used to estimate the src of key dams when we don t know the actual data moreover the key dam is one of the products created by human activities in this study the ratio of the total src of all key dams in a watershed to the total sediment reduction caused by human activities is defined as the sre of key dams 3 results 3 1 construction and siltation of key dams based on the water conservation data in the general survey obtained by the yellow river conservancy committee in 2011 the spatial distribution characteristics of the number of key dams total storage capacity and total filled ratio in different watersheds within the cshc region were shown in fig 2 there were 3703 key dams in the cshc region and nearly 86 of them were distributed in 20 selected watersheds however there were great differences in the number of key dams built in each watershed ranging from 3 to 1139 fig 2a the wuding river watershed had the largest number of key dams with a total of 1139 the fenchuan and shiwangchuan watershed had the least number of key dams with only 3 and 4 respectively by comparing the distribution of key dams on both sides of the yellow river it was found that the number of key dams on the west side of the yellow river was larger than that on the east side of the yellow river the number of key dams was also related to the size of the total storage capacity and they showed similar spatial distribution characteristics similarly the wuding river watershed had the largest total storage capacity of 1332 9 mm3 while the shiwangchuan and fenchuan watersheds had the smallest total storage capacity of only 3 and 5 6 mm3 respectively shiwangchuan and xinshui river watersheds had the lowest total filled ratio less than 10 the total filled ratio of wuding river jialu river and weifen river watersheds reached more than 60 3 2 variation characteristics of ndvi in the cshc region fig 3 a shows the dynamic changes of ndvi values in the whole cshc region huangfuchuan kuye river and yanhe watershed from 1986 to 2018 the variation trend of ndvi values in the huangfuchuan and kuye river watershed were basically the same mainly showing stable fluctuation before 1999 and increasing year by year after 1999 from 1986 to 2018 the ndvi value of the yanhe watershed decreased first and then increased step by step the ndvi value of the whole cshc region fluctuated before 1999 and increased after 1999 as shown in fig 3b the average ndvi of the 12 main tributaries and the whole cshc region increased from period 1 to period 2 the average ndvi of the whole cshc region in period 1 and period 2 were 0 152 and 0 188 respectively increased by 0 036 in the selected watersheds the ndvi of the zhujiachuan watershed increased the least only 0 018 while that of the yanhe watershed increased the most reaching 0 073 to sum up these results showed that the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 had achieved great results in the ecological restoration of the region 3 3 trends and change point year analysis for sediment regimes fig 4 shows the dynamic change process of sediment discharge of 12 typical tributaries selected in the cshc region during 1955 2018 the results of trends and change point year analysis for sediment regimes in 12 tributaries are given in table 2 the sediment discharge of all tributaries showed a significant decreasing trend p less than 0 01 over the past six decades compared with the reference period 1955 1979 the sediment discharge of all tributaries in period 1 decreased by 29 3 74 5 with an average decrease of 57 52 in period 2 the sediment discharge of all tributaries decreased by 78 1 97 3 with an average decrease of 89 2 by 1999 the sediment transport of the two tributaries jialu and zhujiachuan had decreased by more than 70 by 2018 the sediment transport of the eight tributaries had decreased by more than 90 among them the sediment reduction in the kuye river watershed was the most obvious and the average annual sediment discharge was reduced from 1 29 108 t in the reference period to 0 034 108 t in period 2 with a reduced rate of 97 33 the annual sediment reduction rate of typical tributaries in the cshc region was 34 8 358 5 104 t yr with an average of 106 83 104 t yr for 10 tributaries 83 the change point years were detected in the late 1990s and early 2000s mainly due to the implementation of the grain for green project for only two rivers jialu and pianguan were they detected between 1978 and 1983 these two kinds of change points exactly correspond to our period division results above 3 4 estimating the src of key dams in different watersheds in the reference period the proportion of dam controlled area in the selected watershed was between 0 29 58 with an average value of 8 28 the src of key dams in the selected watershed ranges from 0 6973 6 104 t a with an average value of 869 86 104 t a table 3 in period 1 the proportion of dam controlled area in the selected watershed was between 0 68 41 24 with an average value of 13 18 the src of key dams in the selected watershed ranges from 23 12 4805 9 104 t a with an average value of 718 60 104 t a in period 2 the proportion of dam controlled area in the selected watershed was between 8 3 43 79 with an average value of 20 41 the src of key dams in the selected watershed ranges from 149 65 3735 48 104 t a with an average value of 657 40 104 t a the results showed that the construction area of the key dams in the cshc region was increasing but the annual src of key dams was decreasing as of 2011 the largest proportion of dam controlled areas was in jialu and huangfuchuan watershed reaching more than 40 3 5 quantifying the sre of key dams in the main watersheds according to the double cumulative curves of accumulated rainfall and sediment discharge in the reference period 1955 1979 of all watersheds fig 5 the linear equations were fitted and the r2 of the equations was greater than 0 9 then the fitting equations were used to calculate the sediment discharge of all watersheds in different periods thereby quantitatively estimate the sediment reduction and the impact of climate changes and human activities on sediment discharge table 4 in period 1 the average contribution of precipitation variations to sediment reduction was less than 16 and the impact of human activities accounted for more than 84 in period 2 the impact of precipitation on sediment reduction was negative which indicated that rainfall increased during this period and human activities accounted for more and more more than 100 human activities played a leading role in the reduction of sediment discharge in period 1 the sre of key dams in the three watersheds huangfuchuan wuding and yanhe accounted for more than 40 table 4 the smallest sre of key dams in the xinshui river watershed accounted for 1 8 the average sre of key dams 32 03 in the west side of the yellow river basin was much higher than that 9 1 in the east side of the yellow river basin and the maximum value was concentrated around the wuding river watershed between 34 9 54 1 fig 6 in period 2 only the sre of key dams in the wuding river watershed accounted for more than 20 the sre of key dams in the kuye river watershed was the smallest which was 5 the average sre of key dams on the east and west sides of the yellow river was close which was 11 23 and 11 70 respectively indicating that the key dams on both sides of the yellow river had the same effect on preventing soil loss from period 1 to period 2 the sre of key dams in the wuding river watershed decreased the most reaching 31 2 and that of the xinshui river watershed increased the largest reaching 16 2 the average sre of key dams for the selected watershed in the period 1 and 2 was 24 38 and 11 24 respectively comparing the two periods with the delay of time the efficacy of key dams in the whole cshc region was weakening 4 discussion 4 1 potential influence factors of the sre according to the calculation results of the double mass curve the sharp decrease of sediment load in the main tributaries of the cshc region was mainly dominated by the related soil and water conservation measures carried out by human activities in the early 21st century these measures mainly include engineering measures such as check dams and reservoirs agricultural measures such as terraces and biological measures such as the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 which account for more than 60 of the sediment load reduction in this area wang et al 2015 therefore changes in the number of check dams terrace area vegetation coverage and other factors will indirectly affect the sre of key dams in order to further analyze the main influencing factors of the sre the pearson correlation coefficients between the sre of key dams and different influencing factors were shown in table 5 in period 1 the sre of key dams had a very significant positive correlation relationship with the dam controlled area and had a significant correlation relationship with the ndvi number of key dams and total storage capacity because the dam controlled area had a significant autocorrelation relationship with the number of key dams and total storage capacity the dam controlled area and ndvi were selected as the dominant factors for regression analysis the fitting results showed that r2 was above 0 8 which indicated that the fitting effect was good the results also showed that in period 1 the sre of key dams in an unmonitored watershed can be predicted by dam controlled area and ndvi in period 2 except for the number of key dams and the total storage capacity the sre of key dams still had a very significant correlation relationship with the dam controlled area however there was no significant relationship among the sre of key dams ndvi and other factors by fitting the relationship of the sre and the dam controlled area there was a good logarithmic function relationship between them to sum up the sre of key dams in different watersheds is mainly controlled by the dam controlled area wuding river watershed has a greater dam controlled area than other watersheds so the sre of key dams is the largest in both periods in period 1 xinshui river watershed has the least sre of key dams mainly because the dam controlled area of the watershed is only 29 km2 and the role of the key dams is limited however the kuye river watershed has been in a relatively low sre of key dams the main reason for this may be that the riverbed of the kuye river often dried up in recent years resulting in the measured sediment load of only 343 9 104t a from 2000 to 2018 table 4 according to the double mass curve method it is found that human activities reduce the huge sediment load in the kuye river watershed thus affecting the sre of key dams in the watershed in this study from 1979 to 1999 period 1 the average sre of key dams in the cshc region was 24 38 however in 2000 2018 period 2 it was only 11 24 yang et al 2018 indicated that terraces contribute less to sediment reduction in huangfuchuan kuye river wuding river and yanhe watersheds and vegetation restoration was the main reason for the sediment load reduction in conclusion the contribution of key dams to sediment reduction was weakening on the contrary the role of the ecological restoration project grain for green project was strengthening this was consistent with the results of wang et al 2015 4 2 effects of check dam construction on sediment discharge check dams as the main channel structure can not only essentially raise the base level to prevent the gully and headward erosion wang et al 2011b but also provide fertile flat agricultural land for residents mekonnen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 after half a century of construction there are about 110 000 check dams in the whole loess plateau and approximately 21 billion m3 of sediments have been intercepted wang et al 2011b these check dams blocked sediments from entering the yellow river at a rate of about 3 5 million tons annually and a total of 28 billion tons of sediment have been intercepted over the past 60 years wang et al 2011b ran et al 2008 made a statistical analysis of the check dam data in the hekouzhen longmen section of the yellow river from 1970 to 1996 and found that the sediment intercepted by check dams accounted for 64 7 of the total sediment reduction from all soil and water conservation measures as for the middle reaches of the yellow river between the toudaoguai gauging station and the tongguan gauging station wang et al 2015 demonstrated that check dams and reservoirs seem to account for 21 of the total sediment reduction between p1 1951 1979 and p2 1980 1999 and account for 12 of the total sediment reduction from p1 to p3 2000 2010 our results also showed that the sre of key dams was decreasing from 24 in period1 to 11 in period 2 therefore the large scale construction of check dams may lead to a considerable part of check dams without sediment to intercept and unable to provide fertile farmland jin et al 2012 at present check dam construction should be combined with topography and geographical function zones to carry out reasonable planning to maximize its benefits thereby achieve the effect of reducing human and material resource consumption 4 3 implications the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams is characterized by the ratio of retained sediment behind the dams to total sediment inflow during their life expectancy eizel din et al 2010 the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams is a very important parameter that affects the amount of sedimentation zhao et al 2017 made a statistical analysis of the check dams in huangfuchuan watershed and found that the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams is mainly concentrated in 60 100 which was used as an important factor to calculate the impact of check dams on sediment reduction lewis et al 2013 calculated the sediment trapping efficiency of a large reservoir in australia and found that the measured sediment trapping efficiency varied from 50 to 85 because it is very difficult to obtain the sediment trapping efficiency of a key dam in different periods and the life expectancy of each dam in this study we adopt the approximate average value to calculate the src of key dams although the sediment yield of the watershed can reflect the diversity of src of key dams in different periods to a certain extent the research results weaken the influence of sediment trapping efficiency and life expectancy of key dams on src of key dams at present there are few studies on the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams on the loess plateau in the future we can discuss the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams according to the classification of check dams key dams small and medium sized dams and put forward applicable calculation methods through the comprehensive effect of soil and water conservation measures and ecological restoration projects for many years the amount of sediment into the yellow river had been reduced to a historic levels the agricultural period of the tang dynasty in 740 ce chen et al 2015 as the main source area of sediment in the yellow river the sediment discharge in the cshc region had decreased significantly and the sediment discharge of the selected 12 main watersheds had been basically reduced by more than 80 table 4 according to the comparison of the sre between period1 and period 2 in the12 main watersheds fig 6c the effect of key dams was weakening however the total amount of sediment intercepted by the key dams in the 12 watersheds has not decreased significantly still reaching 88 million tons per year furthermore the check dams are easy to be damaged and collapsed in case of catastrophic floods zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 therefore the role of check dams in this area is still very important but in the future we should pay more attention to how to maintain the effectiveness of the existing check dams rather than continue to expand the construction scale in addition sediment control by check dams alone cannot fundamentally and permanently solve the problem of sediment entering the yellow river check dam construction combined with vegetation restoration project is the sustainable development strategy to maintain long term soil and water conservation function gao et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in the future the management strategy and construction planning of the cshc region in the middle reaches of the yellow river should not only consider the appropriate density and distribution of check dams but also explore how to maintain a sustainable vegetated ecosystem 5 conclusion in this study the data of all the key dams in the cshc region were collected to quantify the sre of key dams in 12 major watersheds there were 3703 key dams in the cshc region among which the wuding river watershed had the largest number of key dams 1139 and the largest total storage capacity 1332 9 mm3 the total filled ratio of wuding river jialu river and weifen river reached more than 60 the ndvi value of the whole cshc region fluctuated before 1999 and increased after 1999 this showed that the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 greatly promoted the ecological restoration of the region the annual sediment load of all tributaries showed a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 over the past six decades compared with the reference period the average annual sediment load of the selected 12 tributaries decreased by 57 5 in period 1 and by 89 2 in period 2 by 2018 the sediment reduction of the selected tributaries was basically more than 80 which was mainly caused by human activities the construction area of the key dams in the cshc region was increasing but the annual src of the key dams was decreasing in period 1 the average sre of key dams on the west side of the yellow river basin was much higher than that on the east side of the yellow river basin the average sre of key dams for the selected watersheds decreased from 24 38 of period 1 to 11 24 of period 2 the results showed

4188,with the implementation of a series of soil and water conservation measures especially vegetation restoration projects and check dam construction the sediment export in the coarse sandy hilly

check dam construction in this study data from12 main tributaries in the region were collected and the sediment reduction efficiency sre of key dams was quantified by evaluating the sediment retention

was decreasing in period 1 the average sre of key dams on the west side was much higher than that on the east side we determined that the influence of check dams in this area was weakening since the

2003 wang et al 2011a while sediment is the main source of carbon and nutrients for maintaining river and ocean ecosystems aufdenkampe et al 2011 darby et al 2016 in recent decades many studies have documented that the runoff and sediment load of many rivers in the world have decreased significantly stanley and warne 1998 walling and fang 2003 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2006 tan 2018 as the second longest river in china the yellow river used to be the river with the largest sediment concentration in the world wang et al 2015 accounting for 6 of the global river sediment flux wang et al 2007 however since the 1950s the annual sediment discharge of the yellow river and its main tributaries have continued to decline wang et al 2010 xu 2004 zhao et al 2018 at present numerous studies have been made on the spatial temporal variations of sediment discharge and the potential reasons for the significant decrease of sediment load in the yellow river basin gao et al 2017 miao et al 2011 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2007 analyzed the sediment load changes in the yellow river basin from 1950 to 2005 and found that the sediment discharge of the upper middle and lower reaches decreased gradually but the main reasons for the results were different wang et al 2012 investigated the spatial temporal variations of suspended sediment deposition ssd in the upper reaches of the yellow river from 1952 to 2007 and discovered that the construction of check dams in the upper stream tributaries blocked a significant amount of sediment load which led to the reduction of sediment concentration in the main channels xu 2004 put forward that although both river flow and sediment load decreased if the excessive exploitation of river water resources cannot be well restrained the erosion and sediment control measures will not effectively reduce sediment concentration in the lower reaches of the yellow river nearly 90 of the sediment into the yellow river is supplied by the eroded soil of the loess plateau yu et al 2013 due to improper land use fragile ecosystem poor soil erosion resistance and high intensity rainstorm the soil erosion rates in this region are at the forefront of the world since the 1950s a series of soil erosion control measures have been carried out on the loess plateau in particular the grain for green project was implemented in 1999 which restored vegetation to curb serious soil erosion improved the natural ecological environment and reduced the sediment into the yellow river meanwhile due to the obvious benefits of intercepting sediment and providing fertile farmland the construction of check dam has also been developed rapidly in recent decades after half a century of development about 110 000 check dams were artificially distributed throughout the whole loess plateau which prevents approximately 21 billion m3 of sediments from entering the yellow river wang et al 2011b moreover the filled check dams can be reclaimed into cultivated land and its fertility and nutrients are much higher than those of sloping farmland according to the field survey results more than 3200 km2 of dam croplands are currently cultivated by local people to obtain more food output jin et al 2012 check dams have been recognized as an effective sedimentation mitigation technique which is generally arranged in rivers or gullies to slow down the flow velocity intercept sediment and reduce the erosion of downstream gullies nyssen et al 2004 zhang et al 2021 at present owing to the significant role of check dams in soil and water conservation and farmland expansion which have been applied as an important measure in regional soil and water loss prevention and control by many countries abedini et al 2012 borja et al 2018 fang 2017 polyakov et al 2014 evaluated the sediment retention capacity of check dams in the santa rita experimental range srer of the united states and found that these dams have stored 75 tons of sediment during four years reducing the sediment load by 50 by calculating the sediment accumulation in sediment traps borja et al 2018 indicated that more than 70 of sediments were prevented from passing through the check dams shi et al 2019 applied the swat model to simulate the erosion situation of the wuding river watershed on the loess plateau of china under different scenarios and found that the check dams reduced sediment yield by 11 7 according to the national census data there are 5340 key dams storage capacity 50 104 m3 distributed in the tributaries feeding the middle reaches of the yellow river of which 1090 have been filled with sediment wang et al 2015 as the most serious soil erosion area in the yellow river basin and even the whole of china the coarse sandy hilly catchments cshc region in the middle reaches of the yellow river has been concerned for decades although numerous studies have revealed the impact of check dams on soil erosion and sediment yield of typical watersheds fang 2017 zhao et al 2017 few studies have quantitatively evaluated the sediment reduction efficiency sre of key dams in a watershed let alone the main watersheds in the whole cshc region therefore to quantify the sre of key dams we selected 12 main tributaries in the cshc region as the research objects the objectives of this study are 1 to distinguish the contribution of climate changes and human activities to sediment reduction in the 12 main tributaries 2 to quantify the sre of key dams in the main watersheds 3 to evaluate the potential influence factors of the sre 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cshc region fig 1 is located in the middle of the loess plateau which is also usually referred to as the hekou longmen region in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the study area covers an area of 1 3 105 km2 which accounts for 15 of the entire yellow river basin the mainstream flows through the cshc region is 733 km long the most serious erosion area of the loess plateau is the cshc region which provides 69 of the sediment load for the yellow river in 1955 1969 and contributes 42 1 of the sediment load in 1970 2009 gao et al 2017 rustomji et al 2008 the region has become the focus for us to study the variation of sediment load and flow sediment relationships the annual average precipitation during 1956 2014 in the cshc region is 443 mm which ranges from 580 mm in the southeast to less than 300 mm in the northwest mcvicar et al 2007 72 of the total annual rainfall occurs during the flood period june september and it is often in the form of high intensity rainstorms zhang 2021 in addition the most common soil in this region is inceptisols soil usda soil taxonomy which is very easy to erode and transport wang et al 2009a as a result about 88 of the sediment within the csch region is eroded during the flood period we selected 20 main watersheds within the cshc region to analyze the current situation of key dams fig 1 then quantitatively analyzed the sre of key dams in the 12 main watersheds the characteristics of these watersheds are shown in table 1 2 2 datasets the key dam data of the whole cshc region is mainly based on the general survey data of water conservation of the yellow river conservancy committee in 2011 the data mainly includes the name construction time dam controlled area total storage capacity siltation storage capacity dam length dam height longitude and latitude coordinates of the key dams according to the longitude and latitude coordinates of all dams we distinguish the number of key dams and related information in each watershed by arcgis software annual rainfall and sediment data of the 12 main tributaries from 1954 to 2018 are mainly from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china hydrological data of the yellow river basin and some missing data extracted from previous studies moreover the rainfall data of some tributaries in some years are supplemented by the daily rainfall data of corresponding meteorological stations from 1951 to 2019 the daily rainfall data of all meteorological stations distributed in the cshc region were from the national meteorological information center of china the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was extracted by google earth engine gee platform using long term remote sensing image record landsat 5 7 tm at a spatial resolution of 30 m for the period of 1986 2018 meanwhile we first searched the literature according to the relevant keywords check dam watershed catchment sediment yield etc then all the information about sediment yield is extracted from the literature search results finally the sediment yield of the selected 12 watersheds is tabulated table s1 it can be used as the basis for estimating the sediment retention capacity src of key dams in different periods 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend test and change point analysis the significance of the trends in annual sediment discharge time series was estimated by the non parametric mann kendall m k test mann 1945 the m k test has been widely applied to evaluate the changing trends of annual meteorological and hydrological time series gao et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 the positive z value of m k test indicates an upward trend and vice versa when the absolute value of z is greater than or equal to 1 28 1 64 and 2 32 it means that it has passed the significance test with 90 95 and 99 confidence respectively in this study the change point analysis was applied to determine the possible mutation years of long time series sediment records chang points were determined by using the pettitt test pettitt 1979 method to detects a significant change of time series in addition wang et al 2015 explored the reasons for the reduction of sediment transport in the yellow river and found that there were two abrupt falls of sediment load in the middle reaches of the yellow river around the years 1979 and 1999 therefore we divide the time series of the past 60 years into three periods including 1954 1979 reference period 1980 1999 period 1 and 2000 2018 period 2 2 3 2 double mass curve method the principle of the double mass curve method is that when the proportionality between the two variables is constant the curve of the two cumulative quantities presents a straight line however once the original relationship between the two variables is disturbed the slope of the double mass curve will change accordingly hence in this study the double mass curve was applied to evaluate the impact of climate changes and human activities on sediment discharge in which precipitation was the primary factor reflecting the change of hydrological records caused by climate change fig 5 a detailed description of the double mass curve method can be referred to yang et al 2018 2 3 3 evaluating the src of key dams based on the statistical analysis of the key dam data in the typical watersheds of the cshc region the src of key dams is estimated according to the sediment yield of 12 watersheds in different periods on the contrary the measured total sediment is calculated based on the siltation storage capacity of the key dams to verify the estimation results the estimation method of sediment retention by key dams in different periods is as follows 1 s a s y n t e where s is the src of key dams in different periods 104 t a stands for the dam controlled area km2 sy represents the average sediment yield of each watershed in the corresponding period t km2 a n indicates the life expectancy of key dams in the calculation period a te is the sediment trapping efficiency of key dams according to the research results of pal et al 2018 and the technical code of key dam for soil and water conservation sl289 2003 the life expectancy of key dams in this study is determined as 25 years this means that in the 25 years after the construction time the key dams are involved in the calculation of the sediment amount and vice versa we applied the method proposed by brown 1943 to calculate the sediment trapping efficiency of all key dams in 2011 and obtained the average sediment trapping efficiency was about 81 as the key dams are generally built with spillway or drainage well and other facilities part of sediment will be discharged through these facilities in the process of sediment deposition according to the previous research results rahmati et al 2020 wei et al 2017 the sediment trapping efficiency of all key dams in this study is calculated as 85 the estimated results are verified according to the siltation storage capacity of key dams according to the general survey data of water conservation of the yellow river conservancy committee in 2011 we obtained the siltation storage capacity of each key dam and divided the watershed where each key dam is located by 2011 the siltation storage capacity of key dams in huangfuchuan gushanchuan and kuyehe river watershed has reached 68 17 million m3 42 22 million m3 and 58 69 million m3 respectively wang et al 2009b proposed that the average bulk density of sediment in the check dams can be approximately 1 3 t m3 so we use this value multiplied by the siltation storage capacity to calculate the sediment weight in the key dams from this the measured total sediment in each watershed can be obtained by adding up the sediment weight of all the key dams by comparing the measured total sediment and the calculated total sediment it can be found that the calculated results are basically equal to the measured results table 2 this indicates that the calculation result is credible and shows that the life expectancy of key dams the dam controlled area the sediment trapping efficiency and the sediment yield of the watershed can be used to estimate the src of key dams when we don t know the actual data moreover the key dam is one of the products created by human activities in this study the ratio of the total src of all key dams in a watershed to the total sediment reduction caused by human activities is defined as the sre of key dams 3 results 3 1 construction and siltation of key dams based on the water conservation data in the general survey obtained by the yellow river conservancy committee in 2011 the spatial distribution characteristics of the number of key dams total storage capacity and total filled ratio in different watersheds within the cshc region were shown in fig 2 there were 3703 key dams in the cshc region and nearly 86 of them were distributed in 20 selected watersheds however there were great differences in the number of key dams built in each watershed ranging from 3 to 1139 fig 2a the wuding river watershed had the largest number of key dams with a total of 1139 the fenchuan and shiwangchuan watershed had the least number of key dams with only 3 and 4 respectively by comparing the distribution of key dams on both sides of the yellow river it was found that the number of key dams on the west side of the yellow river was larger than that on the east side of the yellow river the number of key dams was also related to the size of the total storage capacity and they showed similar spatial distribution characteristics similarly the wuding river watershed had the largest total storage capacity of 1332 9 mm3 while the shiwangchuan and fenchuan watersheds had the smallest total storage capacity of only 3 and 5 6 mm3 respectively shiwangchuan and xinshui river watersheds had the lowest total filled ratio less than 10 the total filled ratio of wuding river jialu river and weifen river watersheds reached more than 60 3 2 variation characteristics of ndvi in the cshc region fig 3 a shows the dynamic changes of ndvi values in the whole cshc region huangfuchuan kuye river and yanhe watershed from 1986 to 2018 the variation trend of ndvi values in the huangfuchuan and kuye river watershed were basically the same mainly showing stable fluctuation before 1999 and increasing year by year after 1999 from 1986 to 2018 the ndvi value of the yanhe watershed decreased first and then increased step by step the ndvi value of the whole cshc region fluctuated before 1999 and increased after 1999 as shown in fig 3b the average ndvi of the 12 main tributaries and the whole cshc region increased from period 1 to period 2 the average ndvi of the whole cshc region in period 1 and period 2 were 0 152 and 0 188 respectively increased by 0 036 in the selected watersheds the ndvi of the zhujiachuan watershed increased the least only 0 018 while that of the yanhe watershed increased the most reaching 0 073 to sum up these results showed that the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 had achieved great results in the ecological restoration of the region 3 3 trends and change point year analysis for sediment regimes fig 4 shows the dynamic change process of sediment discharge of 12 typical tributaries selected in the cshc region during 1955 2018 the results of trends and change point year analysis for sediment regimes in 12 tributaries are given in table 2 the sediment discharge of all tributaries showed a significant decreasing trend p less than 0 01 over the past six decades compared with the reference period 1955 1979 the sediment discharge of all tributaries in period 1 decreased by 29 3 74 5 with an average decrease of 57 52 in period 2 the sediment discharge of all tributaries decreased by 78 1 97 3 with an average decrease of 89 2 by 1999 the sediment transport of the two tributaries jialu and zhujiachuan had decreased by more than 70 by 2018 the sediment transport of the eight tributaries had decreased by more than 90 among them the sediment reduction in the kuye river watershed was the most obvious and the average annual sediment discharge was reduced from 1 29 108 t in the reference period to 0 034 108 t in period 2 with a reduced rate of 97 33 the annual sediment reduction rate of typical tributaries in the cshc region was 34 8 358 5 104 t yr with an average of 106 83 104 t yr for 10 tributaries 83 the change point years were detected in the late 1990s and early 2000s mainly due to the implementation of the grain for green project for only two rivers jialu and pianguan were they detected between 1978 and 1983 these two kinds of change points exactly correspond to our period division results above 3 4 estimating the src of key dams in different watersheds in the reference period the proportion of dam controlled area in the selected watershed was between 0 29 58 with an average value of 8 28 the src of key dams in the selected watershed ranges from 0 6973 6 104 t a with an average value of 869 86 104 t a table 3 in period 1 the proportion of dam controlled area in the selected watershed was between 0 68 41 24 with an average value of 13 18 the src of key dams in the selected watershed ranges from 23 12 4805 9 104 t a with an average value of 718 60 104 t a in period 2 the proportion of dam controlled area in the selected watershed was between 8 3 43 79 with an average value of 20 41 the src of key dams in the selected watershed ranges from 149 65 3735 48 104 t a with an average value of 657 40 104 t a the results showed that the construction area of the key dams in the cshc region was increasing but the annual src of key dams was decreasing as of 2011 the largest proportion of dam controlled areas was in jialu and huangfuchuan watershed reaching more than 40 3 5 quantifying the sre of key dams in the main watersheds according to the double cumulative curves of accumulated rainfall and sediment discharge in the reference period 1955 1979 of all watersheds fig 5 the linear equations were fitted and the r2 of the equations was greater than 0 9 then the fitting equations were used to calculate the sediment discharge of all watersheds in different periods thereby quantitatively estimate the sediment reduction and the impact of climate changes and human activities on sediment discharge table 4 in period 1 the average contribution of precipitation variations to sediment reduction was less than 16 and the impact of human activities accounted for more than 84 in period 2 the impact of precipitation on sediment reduction was negative which indicated that rainfall increased during this period and human activities accounted for more and more more than 100 human activities played a leading role in the reduction of sediment discharge in period 1 the sre of key dams in the three watersheds huangfuchuan wuding and yanhe accounted for more than 40 table 4 the smallest sre of key dams in the xinshui river watershed accounted for 1 8 the average sre of key dams 32 03 in the west side of the yellow river basin was much higher than that 9 1 in the east side of the yellow river basin and the maximum value was concentrated around the wuding river watershed between 34 9 54 1 fig 6 in period 2 only the sre of key dams in the wuding river watershed accounted for more than 20 the sre of key dams in the kuye river watershed was the smallest which was 5 the average sre of key dams on the east and west sides of the yellow river was close which was 11 23 and 11 70 respectively indicating that the key dams on both sides of the yellow river had the same effect on preventing soil loss from period 1 to period 2 the sre of key dams in the wuding river watershed decreased the most reaching 31 2 and that of the xinshui river watershed increased the largest reaching 16 2 the average sre of key dams for the selected watershed in the period 1 and 2 was 24 38 and 11 24 respectively comparing the two periods with the delay of time the efficacy of key dams in the whole cshc region was weakening 4 discussion 4 1 potential influence factors of the sre according to the calculation results of the double mass curve the sharp decrease of sediment load in the main tributaries of the cshc region was mainly dominated by the related soil and water conservation measures carried out by human activities in the early 21st century these measures mainly include engineering measures such as check dams and reservoirs agricultural measures such as terraces and biological measures such as the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 which account for more than 60 of the sediment load reduction in this area wang et al 2015 therefore changes in the number of check dams terrace area vegetation coverage and other factors will indirectly affect the sre of key dams in order to further analyze the main influencing factors of the sre the pearson correlation coefficients between the sre of key dams and different influencing factors were shown in table 5 in period 1 the sre of key dams had a very significant positive correlation relationship with the dam controlled area and had a significant correlation relationship with the ndvi number of key dams and total storage capacity because the dam controlled area had a significant autocorrelation relationship with the number of key dams and total storage capacity the dam controlled area and ndvi were selected as the dominant factors for regression analysis the fitting results showed that r2 was above 0 8 which indicated that the fitting effect was good the results also showed that in period 1 the sre of key dams in an unmonitored watershed can be predicted by dam controlled area and ndvi in period 2 except for the number of key dams and the total storage capacity the sre of key dams still had a very significant correlation relationship with the dam controlled area however there was no significant relationship among the sre of key dams ndvi and other factors by fitting the relationship of the sre and the dam controlled area there was a good logarithmic function relationship between them to sum up the sre of key dams in different watersheds is mainly controlled by the dam controlled area wuding river watershed has a greater dam controlled area than other watersheds so the sre of key dams is the largest in both periods in period 1 xinshui river watershed has the least sre of key dams mainly because the dam controlled area of the watershed is only 29 km2 and the role of the key dams is limited however the kuye river watershed has been in a relatively low sre of key dams the main reason for this may be that the riverbed of the kuye river often dried up in recent years resulting in the measured sediment load of only 343 9 104t a from 2000 to 2018 table 4 according to the double mass curve method it is found that human activities reduce the huge sediment load in the kuye river watershed thus affecting the sre of key dams in the watershed in this study from 1979 to 1999 period 1 the average sre of key dams in the cshc region was 24 38 however in 2000 2018 period 2 it was only 11 24 yang et al 2018 indicated that terraces contribute less to sediment reduction in huangfuchuan kuye river wuding river and yanhe watersheds and vegetation restoration was the main reason for the sediment load reduction in conclusion the contribution of key dams to sediment reduction was weakening on the contrary the role of the ecological restoration project grain for green project was strengthening this was consistent with the results of wang et al 2015 4 2 effects of check dam construction on sediment discharge check dams as the main channel structure can not only essentially raise the base level to prevent the gully and headward erosion wang et al 2011b but also provide fertile flat agricultural land for residents mekonnen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 after half a century of construction there are about 110 000 check dams in the whole loess plateau and approximately 21 billion m3 of sediments have been intercepted wang et al 2011b these check dams blocked sediments from entering the yellow river at a rate of about 3 5 million tons annually and a total of 28 billion tons of sediment have been intercepted over the past 60 years wang et al 2011b ran et al 2008 made a statistical analysis of the check dam data in the hekouzhen longmen section of the yellow river from 1970 to 1996 and found that the sediment intercepted by check dams accounted for 64 7 of the total sediment reduction from all soil and water conservation measures as for the middle reaches of the yellow river between the toudaoguai gauging station and the tongguan gauging station wang et al 2015 demonstrated that check dams and reservoirs seem to account for 21 of the total sediment reduction between p1 1951 1979 and p2 1980 1999 and account for 12 of the total sediment reduction from p1 to p3 2000 2010 our results also showed that the sre of key dams was decreasing from 24 in period1 to 11 in period 2 therefore the large scale construction of check dams may lead to a considerable part of check dams without sediment to intercept and unable to provide fertile farmland jin et al 2012 at present check dam construction should be combined with topography and geographical function zones to carry out reasonable planning to maximize its benefits thereby achieve the effect of reducing human and material resource consumption 4 3 implications the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams is characterized by the ratio of retained sediment behind the dams to total sediment inflow during their life expectancy eizel din et al 2010 the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams is a very important parameter that affects the amount of sedimentation zhao et al 2017 made a statistical analysis of the check dams in huangfuchuan watershed and found that the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams is mainly concentrated in 60 100 which was used as an important factor to calculate the impact of check dams on sediment reduction lewis et al 2013 calculated the sediment trapping efficiency of a large reservoir in australia and found that the measured sediment trapping efficiency varied from 50 to 85 because it is very difficult to obtain the sediment trapping efficiency of a key dam in different periods and the life expectancy of each dam in this study we adopt the approximate average value to calculate the src of key dams although the sediment yield of the watershed can reflect the diversity of src of key dams in different periods to a certain extent the research results weaken the influence of sediment trapping efficiency and life expectancy of key dams on src of key dams at present there are few studies on the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams on the loess plateau in the future we can discuss the sediment trapping efficiency of check dams according to the classification of check dams key dams small and medium sized dams and put forward applicable calculation methods through the comprehensive effect of soil and water conservation measures and ecological restoration projects for many years the amount of sediment into the yellow river had been reduced to a historic levels the agricultural period of the tang dynasty in 740 ce chen et al 2015 as the main source area of sediment in the yellow river the sediment discharge in the cshc region had decreased significantly and the sediment discharge of the selected 12 main watersheds had been basically reduced by more than 80 table 4 according to the comparison of the sre between period1 and period 2 in the12 main watersheds fig 6c the effect of key dams was weakening however the total amount of sediment intercepted by the key dams in the 12 watersheds has not decreased significantly still reaching 88 million tons per year furthermore the check dams are easy to be damaged and collapsed in case of catastrophic floods zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 therefore the role of check dams in this area is still very important but in the future we should pay more attention to how to maintain the effectiveness of the existing check dams rather than continue to expand the construction scale in addition sediment control by check dams alone cannot fundamentally and permanently solve the problem of sediment entering the yellow river check dam construction combined with vegetation restoration project is the sustainable development strategy to maintain long term soil and water conservation function gao et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in the future the management strategy and construction planning of the cshc region in the middle reaches of the yellow river should not only consider the appropriate density and distribution of check dams but also explore how to maintain a sustainable vegetated ecosystem 5 conclusion in this study the data of all the key dams in the cshc region were collected to quantify the sre of key dams in 12 major watersheds there were 3703 key dams in the cshc region among which the wuding river watershed had the largest number of key dams 1139 and the largest total storage capacity 1332 9 mm3 the total filled ratio of wuding river jialu river and weifen river reached more than 60 the ndvi value of the whole cshc region fluctuated before 1999 and increased after 1999 this showed that the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 greatly promoted the ecological restoration of the region the annual sediment load of all tributaries showed a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 over the past six decades compared with the reference period the average annual sediment load of the selected 12 tributaries decreased by 57 5 in period 1 and by 89 2 in period 2 by 2018 the sediment reduction of the selected tributaries was basically more than 80 which was mainly caused by human activities the construction area of the key dams in the cshc region was increasing but the annual src of the key dams was decreasing in period 1 the average sre of key dams on the west side of the yellow river basin was much higher than that on the east side of the yellow river basin the average sre of key dams for the selected watersheds decreased from 24 38 of period 1 to 11 24 of period 2 the results showed

4189,water supply management for hydroclimatic extremes has commonly been analysed using the cumulative difference between inflow and demand a concept known as the residual mass curve this paper extends the residual mass concept to develop a new method to quantify water availability termed the residual mass severity index rmsi the rmsi improves on the residual mass curve by allowing extreme deficit periods to be easily identified without the need for manual inspection of the residual mass curve another advantage of the rmsi is that it does not require a temporal window to be specified to characterise extreme deficit periods which is needed for many drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi this paper develops the method for calculating the rmsi using precipitation time series and compares it to the spi for different drought durations across australia major hydroclimatic extremes during the instrumental period are assessed using rmsi spi and by comparing the rmsi estimates with streamflow data from 467 catchments with varying sizes and climate across australia rmsi is a useful index for water managers interested in assessing water availability with potential applicability in summarising the features of historical hydroclimatic extremes as well as future changes in water availability due to anthropogenic climate change keywords residual mass curve water availability drought identification spi 1 introduction accurately understanding water availability is critical for managing the competing demands on a catchment which include water for human consumption agriculture industries and the environment at times when there is insufficient water the competition between these demands becomes even more fraught therefore drought is considered to be one of the most complex hydroclimatic extremes with enormous effects on the environment economy and society ehsani et al 2017 kiem and coauthors 2016 it is therefore vital to accurately characterize water availability and specifically the occurrence of dry hydroclimatic extremes which has been a long standing concern for hydrologists and agronomists hao and singh 2015 mishra et al 2009 tsakiris et al 2007 however characterizing water availability and dry extremes is not straightforward and as a result a range of approaches have been developed early work on water availability considered the multi year storage capacity of reservoirs which led to seminal work by hurst 1951 that assessed long term persistence or memory of hydrologic systems the basis for this approach was to consider the cumulative difference between inflows and demands in a system which results in the residual mass curve rmc and allows the required size for a reservoir to be estimated based on the difference between the maximum and ensuing minimum of the mass curve since then water managers have found the rmc to be useful to understand the patterns and influence of wet and dry periods on a system by considering the rate of change of the mass curve with negative positive slopes representing drying filling periods foley 1955 keyantash and dracup 2002 mcmahon and srikanthan 1989 often the hydroclimatic extremes that lead to drying periods in a system are the most critical to manage to ensure that limited water resources can be equitably shared thus there has been a strong focus on approaches to characterize these dry periods with a range of drought indices being developed the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 was one of the first such indices proposed the pdsi is based on a simple water balance of the soil column and compares the actual precipitation at any point of time to the precipitation that would lead to climatologically normal water availability at that time of year the initial form of the pdsi had several empirical constants which were calibrated based on a few sites in mid western usa the self calibrating pdsi scpdsi allows these constants to be calibrated for any location leading to better standardization across space wells et al 2004 although the pdsi and scpdsi have been extensively used around the world briffa et al 2009 sheffield et al 2012 van der schrier et al 2013 one of the major drawbacks of the approach is that the temporal averaging inherent in the calculation means that the pdsi tends to most strongly reflect droughts with durations of around 9 to 12 months jiang et al 2015 mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 wells et al 2004 which are often far shorter than the droughts of concern for water resources managers the fixed temporal frequency of the pdsi was addressed by mckee et al 1993 who developed the standardized precipitation index spi the spi can be calculated for varying time windows and can thus be used to analyze short droughts several months through to multi year drought events the spi has been widely adopted because it is based on precipitation alone a variable for which long records exist guttman 1999 the standardization of the precipitation distribution allows the spi to be compared across different sites where rainfall characteristics may differ mckee et al 1993 the spi has been used in operational drought products dutra and coauthors 2014 hao and singh 2015 hayes et al 1999 sheffield and coauthors 2014 zargar et al 2011 as well as for climate change impact assessments of water availability burke and brown 2008 lee et al 2017 li et al 2008 loukas et al 2008 taylor et al 2013 zarch et al 2015 the spi is also the basis for other drought indices which have been developed for example the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 which extends the concept of the spi to include evapotranspiration the spei may therefore provide a better assessment of climate change impacts on water availability since increasing temperatures and higher potential evapotranspiration pet will likely exacerbate drought a brief review of climate change drought assessments bonaccorso et al 2003 dubrovsky et al 2009 jiang et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2015 lee et al 2017 loukas et al 2003 naresh kumar et al 2009 ntale and gan 2003 pashiardis and michaelides 2008 tan et al 2015 tirivarombo et al 2018 tsakiris and vangelis 2004 wang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 shows that there is no consistency with the choice of time window in the spi spei and therefore it is difficult to compare conclusions on future drought frequency and severity across the studies the choice of the temporal window is subjective and difficult to justify guttman 1998 fig 1 compares the estimates of water availability for one catchment in south eastern australia hrs 206018 apsley river at apsley falls nsw based on the pdsi the spi calculated at 6 and 48 months spi6 and spi48 windows and finally the rmc due to the temporal averaging in the spi48 estimates of water availability cannot be made for the first 3 years of the time series the rmc clearly shows how water availability changes over a range of different temporal scales for example between 1970 and 1980 water supply and demand are in reasonably good balance evident by the plateau in the rmc and the pdsi values being close to neutral conditions the spi6 highlights some seasonal scale changes in availability in rainfall for this location whilst the long averaging window and lag in the spi48 calculations leads to estimates of wet to neutral conditions over the same period reflecting the reasonably high rainfalls in the lead up to 1980 thus similar information as found in the rmc can be extracted from the spi and pdsi time series but these require multiple evaluations to understand the full picture of water availability to leverage the benefits of the rmc by avoiding to pre define the drought time scale and potentially biasing any analyses through the choice of a single temporal window a new method is proposed in this study the rmc is adapted to focus primarily on dry periods when water deficits are the result of demand being greater than water availability the new method is named the residual mass severity index rmsi the rmsi is described in the next section along with the data used for the study the multi scaling properties of the rmsi and whether that it can be used to assess droughts of varying lengths are compared to existing drought indices and to streamflow data for a wide variety of catchments across australia 2 methodology 2 1 developing the rmsi the rmsi is a modification of the rmc hurst 1951 hurst 1956 which has a long history of being used to estimate water availability in reservoir systems around the world the rmc measures the cumulative difference between inflows and demand in the system johnson and sharma 2015 it is very easy to see by eye the periods when inflows are larger than the demands as the rmc increases and the converse occurs during drying periods fig 2 a however automating the selection of these change points in the system is difficult because of the higher frequency variability in the water availability that is also evident in the rmc thus filtering windows need to be manually applied to provide a suitably smooth time series to automatically find the maxima and minima points this means that although the rmc should have great potential for understanding future water availability or evaluating climate model simulations of historical water availability this has not yet been realized when water is freely available in a catchment or system demand less than availability then no drought management actions are required and the water deficit is zero therefore to focus on periods when stored water is needed to augment shortfalls in supply here the residual mass time series is modified by setting positive values of residual mass to zero to give the rmsi mathematically the rmsi is a monthly anomaly series calculated as the input to the system here monthly precipitation minus demand assumed equal to the median monthly precipitation for that month of the year and aggregating to form the modified residual mass denoting pt as precipitation for a given location at time step t dj as monthly demand for month j and mt representing the residual mass deficit i e the rmsi the residual mass at time t can be expressed as 1 m t m t 1 p t d j m t 0 w h e r e j m o n t h o f t i m e s t e p t 1 12 note that d j m e d i a n p j and as only deficits are of interest excess water i e mt 0 is set equal to zero before proceeding to the next time step this is analogous to the quantifying of the active storage in a water balance problem with excess storage resulting in spill in the context of reservoir simulation or overland flow in the context of runoff simulation any negative value of the residual mass mt 0 denotes a water shortage and represents a scenario where alternate water supply may be needed to meet the demands on the system this concept of water availability can be used to represent catchments where there is finite storage such that excess water cannot be captured to provide future drought protection tu et al 2018 the practical implication of the truncation to zero is that the drying periods in the system are easy to detect automatically as they will always commence from zero and lead to a maxima in the deficits before returning to zero again as wetter conditions are experienced fig 2b shows how the timing of the maximum deficits in the rmsi align perfectly with the end of the manually identified drying periods shown in red in the rmc the truncation to zero means that the ending residual mass may be different from its starting value even if the demand is assumed to equal the mean precipitation in a water resources system it is desirable to have simpler scales to ascertain water availability or drought severity keyantash and dracup 2002 hence the units of rmsi have been defined in mm however to compare water availability across different locations a standardized index may be preferable such as is the case with the spi mckee et al 1993 therefore if necessary the rmsi can be standardized srmsi to allow spatial comparisons by characterizing the residual depths using a suitable probability distribution as is done in the case of the spi or spei converting the residual depths to a standardized scale can be achieved in several ways an empirical cdf can be used or an appropriate probability distribution can be fitted to the sample of deficits in either case the distribution is then used to calculate the cumulative probability or exceedance probability of any deficit of interest however the drawback of using an empirical cdf is that future deficit values that are larger than the maximum deficit in the historical period cannot be characterized this can occur when calculating water availability in a forecasting setting or for climate change projections however finding a unique probability distribution is challenging due to differences in the shape of the distribution of the deficits in different locations because of differences in seasonality proportion of zero deficit periods and varying influences of large scale climate teleconnections which lead to different multi year to decadal signals in water resources systems previous drought analyses have found that non parametric probability distributions are often needed to provide sufficient flexibility to characterize droughts across all climate zones farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 soľáková et al 2013 to allow an empirical distribution to be used and overcome the issue of values outside the observed range a resampling approach efron and tibshirani 1994 is proposed here to formulate a large sample of deficits to this end an empirical cdf of deficits is constructed by resampling the precipitation time series with replacement while allowing for seasonality to accomplish this the precipitation for each month is randomly selected with replacement from the historical record the rmsi is then calculated from the resampled precipitation series the resampling is repeated 1000 times and all resulting deficits pooled into one sample from which the empirical cdf is ascertained the exceedance probabilities haan et al 1994 lane 2002 of the observed residual mass series can then be estimated as follows 2 f e m t r a n k m t m n 1 where the ranking is in ascending order and n is the number of resampled deficits that are less than zero if the intent is to assess actual water deficits or to compare drought severity with reference to an earlier drought at the same location then the rmsi i e deficits in depth units can be used directly conversely if the relative difference in water availability is required across space then the standardized metric can be adopted an example calculation of rmsi including converting from the rmsi to srmsi using the distribution of the resampled deficits is shown in fig 3 the maximum observed deficit of 450 mm at this location is found to have an exceedance probability of approximately 0 4 2 2 comparison methodology it is difficult when developing a new water availability index to establish a base line against which skill of the new method can be measured therefore the focus here is on comparing the properties of the rmsi to other commonly used drought indices and other measures of hydroclimatic extremes such as streamflow and historical drought information a multiple lines of evidence approach is adopted to understand the behavior of the rmsi and whether it achieves the objective of being a multi scaling measure of water availability the focus of the analysis is firstly at the australian continent scale and then more importantly at the catchment scale for a large number of well gauged catchments across australia at the catchment scale rmsi spi calculated at time periods of 6 12 24 and 48 months spi6 spi12 spi24 and spi48 respectively and pdsi have been compared finally the skill of the rmsi in detecting major historical droughts in the murray darling basin mdb is considered 2 2 1 continental scale analysis at the continental scale correlations between rmsi and spi are calculated by identifying the maximum rmsi for each drought period and its corresponding timing month and year droughts have been defined as events that last at least 5 months and for each of the deficit events the maximum deficit is the difference between the threshold value demand which is the median monthly rainfall and highest level of departure maximum amount of rainfall needed to meet the demand the value of spi at these times are identified and the two resulting data samples correlated this sub sampling approach is used to ensure that the high autocorrelation in both the rmsi and spi time series does not artificially inflate the correlations this analysis provides a broad understanding of the properties of rmsi across australia compared to spi 2 2 2 catchment scale analysis it is important to understand the inherent time scale of droughts that are detected by the different indices and how this impacts water management decisions at the catchment scale that may be made based on any drought index guttman 1998 used spectral analysis in developing the spi to overcome the issue of an inherent fixed time scale in the pdsi this method has been applied here to compare the rmsi with spi and pdsi and better understand the dependence timing and magnitude of deficits the spectral analysis provides a means of assessing difference in the long term or short term persistence in the hydrologic indicators assessed koirala et al 2010 for each catchment the drought indices are calculated using catchment averaged precipitation and pet in the case of pdsi in spectral analysis a time series is decomposed into underlying sinusoidal functions of different frequencies percival and walden 1993 and the dominant frequencies are identified when comparing two time series their coherence represents a measure of association in the frequency domain equivalent to correlation in the time domain shumway and stoffer 2017 high values of coherence indicate that the data have analogous spectral density across the frequency spectrum representing an association that is independent of phase differences the two time series may have with respect to each other given the differences in phase that can be expected in the characterization of drought using different levels of aggregation spi6 versus say spi36 or rmsi the coherence as used here provides an appropriate means of identifying similarity between the various drought metrics rmsi spi pdsi considered to further examine how water availability is measured by the suite of indices the catchment scale analysis examines the relationship between drought duration and the number of deficits in the record the joint dependence of drought duration and the number of deficits has been used to understand how each drought index filters the signals in the precipitation time series the final catchment scale validation considers the relationship of rmsi with another hydrological record of water availability specifically observed streamflow for each catchment given streamflow has not been used in the calculations of rmsi this represents a somewhat independent validation the spearman correlation between rmsi and streamflow has been calculated for each catchment to better understand how the precipitation based rmsi compares with a streamflow based assessment of water availability the spearman correlation was used to ensure that outliers in the highly skewed streamflow data did not influence the results classification analysis of low less than median flow and high greater than median flow periods compared to the rmsi deficits vs zero completes the streamflow based analyses for each of the 467 catchments a contingency table was formed to consider the four different combinations of flow and rmsi flow greater or less than median flow and rmsi equal to zero or less than zero to better understand these relationships to assess the skill of the rmsi in detecting high and low flow periods we have calculated the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far zhu et al 2016 the pod measures the percentage of times rmsi correctly detected low flows the far reflects the number of periods when there is an rmsi deficit i e wet conditions but the streamflow is actually low compared to the total number of dry periods predicted by the rmsi here pod and far based on the 2 2 contingency table with a focus on drought prediction are as follows 3 pod d d b 4 far c c d where b rmsi predicted wet conditions deficit 0 and streamflow is low miss c rmsi predicted dry conditions deficit 0 and streamflow is high false alarm d rmsi predicted dry conditions deficit 0 and streamflow is low hit 2 2 3 historical droughts in mdb the skill of the rmsi in detecting historical droughts which had large social and economic impacts is assessed as a drought prone country australia has experienced several major droughts that have been well documented and studied the three droughts assessed are the world war ii drought verdon kidd and kiem 2009 the 1960 s drought australian bureau of statistics abs 1988 bom 2019 and the recent millennium drought grant et al 2013 heberger 2012 lam et al 2018 van dijk and coauthors 2013 these historical droughts are notable due to their long duration widespread severity heberger 2012 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 and long term impacts for water management in australia although the extent of each of these droughts varied kendall 2013 van dijk and coauthors 2013 the mdb was affected in all cases thus the representation of the droughts in the mdb by rmsi and spi6 and spi48 are compared the srmsi for each grid point in the mdb region is first calculated and then has been averaged across space to calculate the exceedance probability for the most extreme instance of all the drought metrics 3 data 3 1 continental scale analysis monthly precipitation data from australian water availability project awap have been used to develop and evaluate the rmsi the awap data covers the period 1900 to present with a spatial resolution of 0 05 jones et al 2009 there are instabilities within the awap data in the central part of australia in early years of the record with anomalously high numbers of zero rainfall months compared to later parts of the 20th century thus analyses were only carried out for locations where 30 of months had zero values although flash droughts are increasingly recognized as an important problem basara et al 2019 haque et al 2017 mo and lettenmaier 2016 otkin et al 2018 most water resources management problems consider water availability over seasonal to multi year and multi decadal planning horizons and hence a monthly analysis is appropriate 3 2 catchment scale analysis streamflow turner 2012 turner et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 and precipitation data jones et al 2009 from 467 hydrologic reference stations hrs across australia have been used to compare the water availability estimates from the rmsi the pet across all stations have been calculated by mcguiness bordne method using the awaper package peterson et al 2020 in r the hrs stations are unregulated and relatively unmodified and have served as the basis for a number of hydrological assessments across the country ajami et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 these catchments vary in size and are distributed across a range of climate zones providing a good test of the performance of the rmsi in a range of climatic settings the catchment analyses were based on the period 1970 to 2019 4 results this section explores the properties of the rmsi in relation to other commonly used drought indices the skill of the rmsi in characterizing periods of low water availability is investigated by comparing the rmsi simulations with streamflow data for the 467 hrs catchments and how well it represents important historical droughts that have occurred in australia during the 20th century 4 1 continent scale multi scaling properties of the rmsi the rmsi is motivated by a desire to consider water availability across multiple time scales in a single index water availability across australia during the 20th century assessed using the rmsi is compared to spi estimates fig 4 it is evident that rmsi has high positive correlations with spi12 and spi24 all over australia as would be expected given the common intent across all indices however in the northern part of australia rmsi has a negative or zero correlation with spi6 as the region exhibits marked seasonality correlations between rmsi and spi48 are lower than for the shorter duration spis to further explore the temporal variability of the different drought indices the next section uses spectral analysis to further investigate the differences in correlations evident in fig 4 4 2 catchment scale analyses 4 2 1 spectral analysis of drought indices the spectral analysis shows that for each spi window there is low spectral power and also the cyclic pattern inherent in the spi series are evident from the fig 5 which expresses the periodicity of the metrics the predefined time window in spi measures is apparent where spi6 spi12 spi24 and spi48 clearly have 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 cycles per year respectively the pdsi has more fluctuations in its spectrum as it has an inherent time scale of 9 to 12 months the frequency peaks and periodicities identified by spectra confirms the impact of predefined time window of aggregation for the spi or pdsi for long term variability in drought characterization these fixed time periods impact the duration and magnitude of drought events as there is no such time scale for rmsi series the spectrum is smoother and provides more flexibility in capturing droughts with both shorter and longer durations we have investigated the frequency at which the maximum coherence of rmsi occurs with each of the drought measures fig 6 rmsi has maximum coherence with pdsi average 0 9 with similarly high coherence with spi6 and spi12 these high coherence values occur at short time scales frequency around 4 cycles per year for the multi year droughts the maximum coherence is at longer time scales and similar results are found for the streamflow coherence coherence for the multi year droughts spi24 and spi48 is lower than the shorter droughts with average maximum coherence around 0 7 the lowest maximum coherence of rmsi is with streamflow for reasons discussed below rmsi has higher coherence with rainfall based drought indices than with streamflow this is to be expected as the rmsi and other indicators all represent the aggregated departure between precipitation and an assumed reference while streamflow represents the complex aggregated catchment processes and includes both rainfall and evapotranspiration the coherence analysis shows how drought is a multi scaled process and provides further support for the concept of a time window independent approach that can represent the varying frequencies of drought in a flexible way 4 2 2 duration and frequency of droughts the spectral analyses and coherence results in the previous section show how each of the drought measures emphasizes different characteristics of australian hydroclimatology drought in australia is driven by a range of local regional and remote climate drivers cai et al 2014 kiem and coauthors 2016 van dijk and coauthors 2013 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 and as a result drought characteristics are not consistent across the country to further explore how this variability impacts on the droughts as assessed by each method the median duration and number of deficits estimated by rmsi is compared to spi for different durations and pdsi is compared in fig 7 to ensure consistency in the analyses the deficits are defined such that the month where the rmsi spi or pdsi value falls below zero is taken as the beginning of a deficit to maintain equality in comparison as would be expected longer spi windows have higher median durations of droughts and a corresponding decrease in the number of droughts there is more catchment variability in the longer spi windows with the median duration for spi48 ranging from 7 to 80 months with much smaller ranges for shorter spi as noted by guttman 1998 the inherent drought duration of 9 to 12 months based on pdsi is also very clear with almost no variability across the 467 hrs catchments depending on the catchment the median duration and number of droughts identified by rmsi falls within the range of median duration and number of droughts captured by spi6 to spi24 this shows the advantage of the rmsi in defining water availability because different parts of the country have different drought features and picking a single drought window for analysis as is commonly done does not allow for this natural variation 4 2 3 streamflow based assessment of rmsi as an independent validation of rmsi streamflow records from the hrs stations have been compared to the rmsi estimates streamflow of all 467 catchments is positively correlated with rmsi fig 8 the strongest correlations are found in eastern australia with smaller correlations in northern and central parts of australia where the flows tend to be much more strongly seasonal although the rmsi demand value is seasonally specified the memory inherent in the rmsi formulation leads to lower correlations under these conditions the frequency domain analysis fig 6 also indicates a lower coherence of streamflow with rmsi largely due to more power being associated with lower frequencies in a drought metric as compared to a hydrologic variable such as rainfall or flow of more interest is whether rmsi correctly classifies periods of above or below normal water availability in the catchments a wilcoxon rank sum test confirms that as should be expected rmsi deficits are significantly larger p 0 001 when flows are below median however for the rmsi to be a useful measure of water availability the converse also needs to be true such that when the rmsi is in deficit low flows are likely in the catchment and the analysis confirms that flows are indeed also significantly lower when rmsi detects deficits p 0 001 fig 9 demonstrates that the pod ranges from 0 6 to 1 and the highest values are found in eastern australia 438 of the 467 hrs stations have pod values greater than 0 7 and far 0 4 as expected the locations with lower pod have higher far values ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 thus it is concluded that on this independent validation rmsi has good skill in indicating catchment water availability 4 3 skill in representing major historical droughts the final evaluation of the rmsi is based on analyzing how it has represented the major historical droughts in the murray darling basin table 1 summarizes the onset and end of droughts with their severity and compares the estimated exceedance probabilities of each of the historical droughts based on the range of drought indices rmsi correctly identifies each historical drought as extreme and provides a similar estimate of its severity to spi6 and spi12 note that the spi exceedance probabilities are calculated for the same point in time as the largest deficit identified by the rmsi which may not be the worst conditions as identified by the spi the long filtering in the spi48 tends to delay the timing of the peak of the drought compared to the shorter spi windows and rmsi a comparison of the exceedance probability of rmsi coincident with the peak of the drought as detected by spi48 shows that rmsi still detects a severe water availability deficit at that point in time 5 discussion the rmsi analysis presented here show how a rmc based analysis can be automated and provide good skill in representing catchment water availability this is especially promising in terms of considering future water availability as estimated by climate models without the need to pre specify analysis windows for drought indices several important methodological choices were made in developing the rmsi that may affect the analyses which we now discuss the first was the choice of demand as the median of non zero monthly precipitation this choice was made because the median represents the most likely precipitation to occur and is not affected by the skewness or outliers in the data schellekens et al 1999 svensson and jones 2010 hence the median precipitation forms the likely environmental and other demand the region would need to cater to to understand the sensitivity of the rmsi to this choice alternate estimates of the demand extending to the expected value mean of the precipitation data were formulated which is always larger than the median due to the heavy right tail of the precipitation time series as would be expected an increase in demand was noted to result in larger residual mass deficits and longer periods of drought with an increase in correspondence with the spi48 the opposite was observed when demand was reduced setting the demand to be equal to median rainfall provides a balanced assessment of multi year droughts as the rmsi is formulated using monthly median precipitation as demand it is not possible to assess any drought which is shorter than a 1 month duration it should be noted that the focus of this study was on evaluating multiyear or long duration meteorological droughts and other alternatives exist basara et al 2019 mo and lettenmaier 2016 otkin et al 2018 pendergrass and coauthors 2020 for the evaluation of flash or shorter duration droughts the second methodological choice in the formulation of rmsi is the truncation to zero for times when water is freely available considering precipitation deficit as a drought indicator while setting any excess amount to zero has been previously used in hydrology as well as in forestry and agronomy beersma and buishand 2004 beersma and buishand 2007 kallache et al 2013 zamani et al 2016 as discussed in section 2 this is equivalent to assuming that there exists finite storage in the catchment above which spill occurs traditionally for a rmc analysis storage in this context would be thought of as a dam or other infrastructure designed to detain water in the catchment and hold it over to times of lower water availability with the capacity of the dam being the highest sequent drop in the residual mass over the data used in the context of rmsi this is equivalent to the highest residual mass deficit instead the final simplification that has been adopted in the procedure is the initialization of the residual mass at zero representing wet conditions readers are pointed to the substantial literature foley 1955 hurst 1956 keyantash and dracup 2002 mcmahon and srikanthan 1989 that exists on the sensitivity of these assumptions to the estimation of the rmc it has been clearly established that if drought is considered as a change in water scarcity from average condition then precipitation data is adequate to illustrate the severity duration and magnitude of drought bąk and kubiak wójcicka 2017 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 however the use of just precipitation data for the rmsi is a potential concern as the frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes like drought are expected to increase due to climate change dale et al 2001 ghosh 2019 it has been argued that with the influence of global warming evapotranspiration often with temperature assumed to be an adequate evapotranspiration proxy will play a vital role in drought characterization sheffield and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2010 zarch et al 2015 and should be included in drought indices e g spei and rdi the rmsi could easily be formulated by including evapotranspiration as demand however in water limited environments such as much of australia pet is not a good indicator of demand as precipitation will generally be lower than pet actual evapotranspiration could be used although it exhibits uncertainty given ground measurements are few necessitating model reconstructions which differ considerably depending on the model used kim 2021 one consideration is that if aet and precipitation are negatively correlated e g locations with winter dominated rainfall the drought characteristics will tend to be modulated which may underestimate the risks to water resources systems additionally alternatives can be formulated to project the rmsi into the future by relating it to climate model simulations jiang et al 2020a jiang et al 2020b rashid et al 2018 rashid et al 2020 however given that temperature changes are more certain in the future cook et al 2018 johnson and sharma 2009 ukkola et al 2018 the primary driver of uncertainty in future drought projections will be precipitation simulations and therefore the rmsi using just precipitation is well placed to assess this uncertainty 6 conclusions managing hydroclimatic extremes now and into the future requires a deep understanding of the most important drivers of stress in the water resources systems in many water resources systems this stress is induced by extended periods of low rainfall which may vary from several months through to multiple years the rmsi approach developed here captures the magnitude of drought events that vary in duration compares severity and identifies each drought event in the historical record using the principle of supply and demand the proposed framework is based on the well established principles of the rmc which has stood the test of time for water resource managers to balance supply monthly precipitation and demand median monthly precipitation the modification here allows periods of drying to be automatically detected in the record and compared across time and space through the definition of a standardized form of the rmsi rmsi provides a simple method of assessing sustained and severe hydroclimatic extremes with a clear and comprehensible procedure for calculation

4189,water supply management for hydroclimatic extremes has commonly been analysed using the cumulative difference between inflow and demand a concept known as the residual mass curve this paper extends the residual mass concept to develop a new method to quantify water availability termed the residual mass severity index rmsi the rmsi improves on the residual mass curve by allowing extreme deficit periods to be easily identified without the need for manual inspection of the residual mass curve another advantage of the rmsi is that it does not require a temporal window to be specified to characterise extreme deficit periods which is needed for many drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi this paper develops the method for calculating the rmsi using precipitation time series and compares it to the spi for different drought durations across australia major hydroclimatic extremes during the instrumental period are assessed using rmsi spi and by comparing the rmsi estimates with streamflow data from 467 catchments with varying sizes and climate across australia rmsi is a useful index for water managers interested in assessing water availability with potential applicability in summarising the features of historical hydroclimatic extremes as well as future changes in water availability due to anthropogenic climate change keywords residual mass curve water availability drought identification spi 1 introduction accurately understanding water availability is critical for managing the competing demands on a catchment which include water for human consumption agriculture industries and the environment at times when there is insufficient water the competition between these demands becomes even more fraught therefore drought is considered to be one of the most complex hydroclimatic extremes with enormous effects on the environment economy and society ehsani et al 2017 kiem and coauthors 2016 it is therefore vital to accurately characterize water availability and specifically the occurrence of dry hydroclimatic extremes which has been a long standing concern for hydrologists and agronomists hao and singh 2015 mishra et al 2009 tsakiris et al 2007 however characterizing water availability and dry extremes is not straightforward and as a result a range of approaches have been developed early work on water availability considered the multi year storage capacity of reservoirs which led to seminal work by hurst 1951 that assessed long term persistence or memory of hydrologic systems the basis for this approach was to consider the cumulative difference between inflows and demands in a system which results in the residual mass curve rmc and allows the required size for a reservoir to be estimated based on the difference between the maximum and ensuing minimum of the mass curve since then water managers have found the rmc to be useful to understand the patterns and influence of wet and dry periods on a system by considering the rate of change of the mass curve with negative positive slopes representing drying filling periods foley 1955 keyantash and dracup 2002 mcmahon and srikanthan 1989 often the hydroclimatic extremes that lead to drying periods in a system are the most critical to manage to ensure that limited water resources can be equitably shared thus there has been a strong focus on approaches to characterize these dry periods with a range of drought indices being developed the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 was one of the first such indices proposed the pdsi is based on a simple water balance of the soil column and compares the actual precipitation at any point of time to the precipitation that would lead to climatologically normal water availability at that time of year the initial form of the pdsi had several empirical constants which were calibrated based on a few sites in mid western usa the self calibrating pdsi scpdsi allows these constants to be calibrated for any location leading to better standardization across space wells et al 2004 although the pdsi and scpdsi have been extensively used around the world briffa et al 2009 sheffield et al 2012 van der schrier et al 2013 one of the major drawbacks of the approach is that the temporal averaging inherent in the calculation means that the pdsi tends to most strongly reflect droughts with durations of around 9 to 12 months jiang et al 2015 mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 wells et al 2004 which are often far shorter than the droughts of concern for water resources managers the fixed temporal frequency of the pdsi was addressed by mckee et al 1993 who developed the standardized precipitation index spi the spi can be calculated for varying time windows and can thus be used to analyze short droughts several months through to multi year drought events the spi has been widely adopted because it is based on precipitation alone a variable for which long records exist guttman 1999 the standardization of the precipitation distribution allows the spi to be compared across different sites where rainfall characteristics may differ mckee et al 1993 the spi has been used in operational drought products dutra and coauthors 2014 hao and singh 2015 hayes et al 1999 sheffield and coauthors 2014 zargar et al 2011 as well as for climate change impact assessments of water availability burke and brown 2008 lee et al 2017 li et al 2008 loukas et al 2008 taylor et al 2013 zarch et al 2015 the spi is also the basis for other drought indices which have been developed for example the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 which extends the concept of the spi to include evapotranspiration the spei may therefore provide a better assessment of climate change impacts on water availability since increasing temperatures and higher potential evapotranspiration pet will likely exacerbate drought a brief review of climate change drought assessments bonaccorso et al 2003 dubrovsky et al 2009 jiang et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2015 lee et al 2017 loukas et al 2003 naresh kumar et al 2009 ntale and gan 2003 pashiardis and michaelides 2008 tan et al 2015 tirivarombo et al 2018 tsakiris and vangelis 2004 wang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 shows that there is no consistency with the choice of time window in the spi spei and therefore it is difficult to compare conclusions on future drought frequency and severity across the studies the choice of the temporal window is subjective and difficult to justify guttman 1998 fig 1 compares the estimates of water availability for one catchment in south eastern australia hrs 206018 apsley river at apsley falls nsw based on the pdsi the spi calculated at 6 and 48 months spi6 and spi48 windows and finally the rmc due to the temporal averaging in the spi48 estimates of water availability cannot be made for the first 3 years of the time series the rmc clearly shows how water availability changes over a range of different temporal scales for example between 1970 and 1980 water supply and demand are in reasonably good balance evident by the plateau in the rmc and the pdsi values being close to neutral conditions the spi6 highlights some seasonal scale changes in availability in rainfall for this location whilst the long averaging window and lag in the spi48 calculations leads to estimates of wet to neutral conditions over the same period reflecting the reasonably high rainfalls in the lead up to 1980 thus similar information as found in the rmc can be extracted from the spi and pdsi time series but these require multiple evaluations to understand the full picture of water availability to leverage the benefits of the rmc by avoiding to pre define the drought time scale and potentially biasing any analyses through the choice of a single temporal window a new method is proposed in this study the rmc is adapted to focus primarily on dry periods when water deficits are the result of demand being greater than water availability the new method is named the residual mass severity index rmsi the rmsi is described in the next section along with the data used for the study the multi scaling properties of the rmsi and whether that it can be used to assess droughts of varying lengths are compared to existing drought indices and to streamflow data for a wide variety of catchments across australia 2 methodology 2 1 developing the rmsi the rmsi is a modification of the rmc hurst 1951 hurst 1956 which has a long history of being used to estimate water availability in reservoir systems around the world the rmc measures the cumulative difference between inflows and demand in the system johnson and sharma 2015 it is very easy to see by eye the periods when inflows are larger than the demands as the rmc increases and the converse occurs during drying periods fig 2 a however automating the selection of these change points in the system is difficult because of the higher frequency variability in the water availability that is also evident in the rmc thus filtering windows need to be manually applied to provide a suitably smooth time series to automatically find the maxima and minima points this means that although the rmc should have great potential for understanding future water availability or evaluating climate model simulations of historical water availability this has not yet been realized when water is freely available in a catchment or system demand less than availability then no drought management actions are required and the water deficit is zero therefore to focus on periods when stored water is needed to augment shortfalls in supply here the residual mass time series is modified by setting positive values of residual mass to zero to give the rmsi mathematically the rmsi is a monthly anomaly series calculated as the input to the system here monthly precipitation minus demand assumed equal to the median monthly precipitation for that month of the year and aggregating to form the modified residual mass denoting pt as precipitation for a given location at time step t dj as monthly demand for month j and mt representing the residual mass deficit i e the rmsi the residual mass at time t can be expressed as 1 m t m t 1 p t d j m t 0 w h e r e j m o n t h o f t i m e s t e p t 1 12 note that d j m e d i a n p j and as only deficits are of interest excess water i e mt 0 is set equal to zero before proceeding to the next time step this is analogous to the quantifying of the active storage in a water balance problem with excess storage resulting in spill in the context of reservoir simulation or overland flow in the context of runoff simulation any negative value of the residual mass mt 0 denotes a water shortage and represents a scenario where alternate water supply may be needed to meet the demands on the system this concept of water availability can be used to represent catchments where there is finite storage such that excess water cannot be captured to provide future drought protection tu et al 2018 the practical implication of the truncation to zero is that the drying periods in the system are easy to detect automatically as they will always commence from zero and lead to a maxima in the deficits before returning to zero again as wetter conditions are experienced fig 2b shows how the timing of the maximum deficits in the rmsi align perfectly with the end of the manually identified drying periods shown in red in the rmc the truncation to zero means that the ending residual mass may be different from its starting value even if the demand is assumed to equal the mean precipitation in a water resources system it is desirable to have simpler scales to ascertain water availability or drought severity keyantash and dracup 2002 hence the units of rmsi have been defined in mm however to compare water availability across different locations a standardized index may be preferable such as is the case with the spi mckee et al 1993 therefore if necessary the rmsi can be standardized srmsi to allow spatial comparisons by characterizing the residual depths using a suitable probability distribution as is done in the case of the spi or spei converting the residual depths to a standardized scale can be achieved in several ways an empirical cdf can be used or an appropriate probability distribution can be fitted to the sample of deficits in either case the distribution is then used to calculate the cumulative probability or exceedance probability of any deficit of interest however the drawback of using an empirical cdf is that future deficit values that are larger than the maximum deficit in the historical period cannot be characterized this can occur when calculating water availability in a forecasting setting or for climate change projections however finding a unique probability distribution is challenging due to differences in the shape of the distribution of the deficits in different locations because of differences in seasonality proportion of zero deficit periods and varying influences of large scale climate teleconnections which lead to different multi year to decadal signals in water resources systems previous drought analyses have found that non parametric probability distributions are often needed to provide sufficient flexibility to characterize droughts across all climate zones farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 soľáková et al 2013 to allow an empirical distribution to be used and overcome the issue of values outside the observed range a resampling approach efron and tibshirani 1994 is proposed here to formulate a large sample of deficits to this end an empirical cdf of deficits is constructed by resampling the precipitation time series with replacement while allowing for seasonality to accomplish this the precipitation for each month is randomly selected with replacement from the historical record the rmsi is then calculated from the resampled precipitation series the resampling is repeated 1000 times and all resulting deficits pooled into one sample from which the empirical cdf is ascertained the exceedance probabilities haan et al 1994 lane 2002 of the observed residual mass series can then be estimated as follows 2 f e m t r a n k m t m n 1 where the ranking is in ascending order and n is the number of resampled deficits that are less than zero if the intent is to assess actual water deficits or to compare drought severity with reference to an earlier drought at the same location then the rmsi i e deficits in depth units can be used directly conversely if the relative difference in water availability is required across space then the standardized metric can be adopted an example calculation of rmsi including converting from the rmsi to srmsi using the distribution of the resampled deficits is shown in fig 3 the maximum observed deficit of 450 mm at this location is found to have an exceedance probability of approximately 0 4 2 2 comparison methodology it is difficult when developing a new water availability index to establish a base line against which skill of the new method can be measured therefore the focus here is on comparing the properties of the rmsi to other commonly used drought indices and other measures of hydroclimatic extremes such as streamflow and historical drought information a multiple lines of evidence approach is adopted to understand the behavior of the rmsi and whether it achieves the objective of being a multi scaling measure of water availability the focus of the analysis is firstly at the australian continent scale and then more importantly at the catchment scale for a large number of well gauged catchments across australia at the catchment scale rmsi spi calculated at time periods of 6 12 24 and 48 months spi6 spi12 spi24 and spi48 respectively and pdsi have been compared finally the skill of the rmsi in detecting major historical droughts in the murray darling basin mdb is considered 2 2 1 continental scale analysis at the continental scale correlations between rmsi and spi are calculated by identifying the maximum rmsi for each drought period and its corresponding timing month and year droughts have been defined as events that last at least 5 months and for each of the deficit events the maximum deficit is the difference between the threshold value demand which is the median monthly rainfall and highest level of departure maximum amount of rainfall needed to meet the demand the value of spi at these times are identified and the two resulting data samples correlated this sub sampling approach is used to ensure that the high autocorrelation in both the rmsi and spi time series does not artificially inflate the correlations this analysis provides a broad understanding of the properties of rmsi across australia compared to spi 2 2 2 catchment scale analysis it is important to understand the inherent time scale of droughts that are detected by the different indices and how this impacts water management decisions at the catchment scale that may be made based on any drought index guttman 1998 used spectral analysis in developing the spi to overcome the issue of an inherent fixed time scale in the pdsi this method has been applied here to compare the rmsi with spi and pdsi and better understand the dependence timing and magnitude of deficits the spectral analysis provides a means of assessing difference in the long term or short term persistence in the hydrologic indicators assessed koirala et al 2010 for each catchment the drought indices are calculated using catchment averaged precipitation and pet in the case of pdsi in spectral analysis a time series is decomposed into underlying sinusoidal functions of different frequencies percival and walden 1993 and the dominant frequencies are identified when comparing two time series their coherence represents a measure of association in the frequency domain equivalent to correlation in the time domain shumway and stoffer 2017 high values of coherence indicate that the data have analogous spectral density across the frequency spectrum representing an association that is independent of phase differences the two time series may have with respect to each other given the differences in phase that can be expected in the characterization of drought using different levels of aggregation spi6 versus say spi36 or rmsi the coherence as used here provides an appropriate means of identifying similarity between the various drought metrics rmsi spi pdsi considered to further examine how water availability is measured by the suite of indices the catchment scale analysis examines the relationship between drought duration and the number of deficits in the record the joint dependence of drought duration and the number of deficits has been used to understand how each drought index filters the signals in the precipitation time series the final catchment scale validation considers the relationship of rmsi with another hydrological record of water availability specifically observed streamflow for each catchment given streamflow has not been used in the calculations of rmsi this represents a somewhat independent validation the spearman correlation between rmsi and streamflow has been calculated for each catchment to better understand how the precipitation based rmsi compares with a streamflow based assessment of water availability the spearman correlation was used to ensure that outliers in the highly skewed streamflow data did not influence the results classification analysis of low less than median flow and high greater than median flow periods compared to the rmsi deficits vs zero completes the streamflow based analyses for each of the 467 catchments a contingency table was formed to consider the four different combinations of flow and rmsi flow greater or less than median flow and rmsi equal to zero or less than zero to better understand these relationships to assess the skill of the rmsi in detecting high and low flow periods we have calculated the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far zhu et al 2016 the pod measures the percentage of times rmsi correctly detected low flows the far reflects the number of periods when there is an rmsi deficit i e wet conditions but the streamflow is actually low compared to the total number of dry periods predicted by the rmsi here pod and far based on the 2 2 contingency table with a focus on drought prediction are as follows 3 pod d d b 4 far c c d where b rmsi predicted wet conditions deficit 0 and streamflow is low miss c rmsi predicted dry conditions deficit 0 and streamflow is high false alarm d rmsi predicted dry conditions deficit 0 and streamflow is low hit 2 2 3 historical droughts in mdb the skill of the rmsi in detecting historical droughts which had large social and economic impacts is assessed as a drought prone country australia has experienced several major droughts that have been well documented and studied the three droughts assessed are the world war ii drought verdon kidd and kiem 2009 the 1960 s drought australian bureau of statistics abs 1988 bom 2019 and the recent millennium drought grant et al 2013 heberger 2012 lam et al 2018 van dijk and coauthors 2013 these historical droughts are notable due to their long duration widespread severity heberger 2012 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 and long term impacts for water management in australia although the extent of each of these droughts varied kendall 2013 van dijk and coauthors 2013 the mdb was affected in all cases thus the representation of the droughts in the mdb by rmsi and spi6 and spi48 are compared the srmsi for each grid point in the mdb region is first calculated and then has been averaged across space to calculate the exceedance probability for the most extreme instance of all the drought metrics 3 data 3 1 continental scale analysis monthly precipitation data from australian water availability project awap have been used to develop and evaluate the rmsi the awap data covers the period 1900 to present with a spatial resolution of 0 05 jones et al 2009 there are instabilities within the awap data in the central part of australia in early years of the record with anomalously high numbers of zero rainfall months compared to later parts of the 20th century thus analyses were only carried out for locations where 30 of months had zero values although flash droughts are increasingly recognized as an important problem basara et al 2019 haque et al 2017 mo and lettenmaier 2016 otkin et al 2018 most water resources management problems consider water availability over seasonal to multi year and multi decadal planning horizons and hence a monthly analysis is appropriate 3 2 catchment scale analysis streamflow turner 2012 turner et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 and precipitation data jones et al 2009 from 467 hydrologic reference stations hrs across australia have been used to compare the water availability estimates from the rmsi the pet across all stations have been calculated by mcguiness bordne method using the awaper package peterson et al 2020 in r the hrs stations are unregulated and relatively unmodified and have served as the basis for a number of hydrological assessments across the country ajami et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 these catchments vary in size and are distributed across a range of climate zones providing a good test of the performance of the rmsi in a range of climatic settings the catchment analyses were based on the period 1970 to 2019 4 results this section explores the properties of the rmsi in relation to other commonly used drought indices the skill of the rmsi in characterizing periods of low water availability is investigated by comparing the rmsi simulations with streamflow data for the 467 hrs catchments and how well it represents important historical droughts that have occurred in australia during the 20th century 4 1 continent scale multi scaling properties of the rmsi the rmsi is motivated by a desire to consider water availability across multiple time scales in a single index water availability across australia during the 20th century assessed using the rmsi is compared to spi estimates fig 4 it is evident that rmsi has high positive correlations with spi12 and spi24 all over australia as would be expected given the common intent across all indices however in the northern part of australia rmsi has a negative or zero correlation with spi6 as the region exhibits marked seasonality correlations between rmsi and spi48 are lower than for the shorter duration spis to further explore the temporal variability of the different drought indices the next section uses spectral analysis to further investigate the differences in correlations evident in fig 4 4 2 catchment scale analyses 4 2 1 spectral analysis of drought indices the spectral analysis shows that for each spi window there is low spectral power and also the cyclic pattern inherent in the spi series are evident from the fig 5 which expresses the periodicity of the metrics the predefined time window in spi measures is apparent where spi6 spi12 spi24 and spi48 clearly have 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 cycles per year respectively the pdsi has more fluctuations in its spectrum as it has an inherent time scale of 9 to 12 months the frequency peaks and periodicities identified by spectra confirms the impact of predefined time window of aggregation for the spi or pdsi for long term variability in drought characterization these fixed time periods impact the duration and magnitude of drought events as there is no such time scale for rmsi series the spectrum is smoother and provides more flexibility in capturing droughts with both shorter and longer durations we have investigated the frequency at which the maximum coherence of rmsi occurs with each of the drought measures fig 6 rmsi has maximum coherence with pdsi average 0 9 with similarly high coherence with spi6 and spi12 these high coherence values occur at short time scales frequency around 4 cycles per year for the multi year droughts the maximum coherence is at longer time scales and similar results are found for the streamflow coherence coherence for the multi year droughts spi24 and spi48 is lower than the shorter droughts with average maximum coherence around 0 7 the lowest maximum coherence of rmsi is with streamflow for reasons discussed below rmsi has higher coherence with rainfall based drought indices than with streamflow this is to be expected as the rmsi and other indicators all represent the aggregated departure between precipitation and an assumed reference while streamflow represents the complex aggregated catchment processes and includes both rainfall and evapotranspiration the coherence analysis shows how drought is a multi scaled process and provides further support for the concept of a time window independent approach that can represent the varying frequencies of drought in a flexible way 4 2 2 duration and frequency of droughts the spectral analyses and coherence results in the previous section show how each of the drought measures emphasizes different characteristics of australian hydroclimatology drought in australia is driven by a range of local regional and remote climate drivers cai et al 2014 kiem and coauthors 2016 van dijk and coauthors 2013 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 and as a result drought characteristics are not consistent across the country to further explore how this variability impacts on the droughts as assessed by each method the median duration and number of deficits estimated by rmsi is compared to spi for different durations and pdsi is compared in fig 7 to ensure consistency in the analyses the deficits are defined such that the month where the rmsi spi or pdsi value falls below zero is taken as the beginning of a deficit to maintain equality in comparison as would be expected longer spi windows have higher median durations of droughts and a corresponding decrease in the number of droughts there is more catchment variability in the longer spi windows with the median duration for spi48 ranging from 7 to 80 months with much smaller ranges for shorter spi as noted by guttman 1998 the inherent drought duration of 9 to 12 months based on pdsi is also very clear with almost no variability across the 467 hrs catchments depending on the catchment the median duration and number of droughts identified by rmsi falls within the range of median duration and number of droughts captured by spi6 to spi24 this shows the advantage of the rmsi in defining water availability because different parts of the country have different drought features and picking a single drought window for analysis as is commonly done does not allow for this natural variation 4 2 3 streamflow based assessment of rmsi as an independent validation of rmsi streamflow records from the hrs stations have been compared to the rmsi estimates streamflow of all 467 catchments is positively correlated with rmsi fig 8 the strongest correlations are found in eastern australia with smaller correlations in northern and central parts of australia where the flows tend to be much more strongly seasonal although the rmsi demand value is seasonally specified the memory inherent in the rmsi formulation leads to lower correlations under these conditions the frequency domain analysis fig 6 also indicates a lower coherence of streamflow with rmsi largely due to more power being associated with lower frequencies in a drought metric as compared to a hydrologic variable such as rainfall or flow of more interest is whether rmsi correctly classifies periods of above or below normal water availability in the catchments a wilcoxon rank sum test confirms that as should be expected rmsi deficits are significantly larger p 0 001 when flows are below median however for the rmsi to be a useful measure of water availability the converse also needs to be true such that when the rmsi is in deficit low flows are likely in the catchment and the analysis confirms that flows are indeed also significantly lower when rmsi detects deficits p 0 001 fig 9 demonstrates that the pod ranges from 0 6 to 1 and the highest values are found in eastern australia 438 of the 467 hrs stations have pod values greater than 0 7 and far 0 4 as expected the locations with lower pod have higher far values ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 thus it is concluded that on this independent validation rmsi has good skill in indicating catchment water availability 4 3 skill in representing major historical droughts the final evaluation of the rmsi is based on analyzing how it has represented the major historical droughts in the murray darling basin table 1 summarizes the onset and end of droughts with their severity and compares the estimated exceedance probabilities of each of the historical droughts based on the range of drought indices rmsi correctly identifies each historical drought as extreme and provides a similar estimate of its severity to spi6 and spi12 note that the spi exceedance probabilities are calculated for the same point in time as the largest deficit identified by the rmsi which may not be the worst conditions as identified by the spi the long filtering in the spi48 tends to delay the timing of the peak of the drought compared to the shorter spi windows and rmsi a comparison of the exceedance probability of rmsi coincident with the peak of the drought as detected by spi48 shows that rmsi still detects a severe water availability deficit at that point in time 5 discussion the rmsi analysis presented here show how a rmc based analysis can be automated and provide good skill in representing catchment water availability this is especially promising in terms of considering future water availability as estimated by climate models without the need to pre specify analysis windows for drought indices several important methodological choices were made in developing the rmsi that may affect the analyses which we now discuss the first was the choice of demand as the median of non zero monthly precipitation this choice was made because the median represents the most likely precipitation to occur and is not affected by the skewness or outliers in the data schellekens et al 1999 svensson and jones 2010 hence the median precipitation forms the likely environmental and other demand the region would need to cater to to understand the sensitivity of the rmsi to this choice alternate estimates of the demand extending to the expected value mean of the precipitation data were formulated which is always larger than the median due to the heavy right tail of the precipitation time series as would be expected an increase in demand was noted to result in larger residual mass deficits and longer periods of drought with an increase in correspondence with the spi48 the opposite was observed when demand was reduced setting the demand to be equal to median rainfall provides a balanced assessment of multi year droughts as the rmsi is formulated using monthly median precipitation as demand it is not possible to assess any drought which is shorter than a 1 month duration it should be noted that the focus of this study was on evaluating multiyear or long duration meteorological droughts and other alternatives exist basara et al 2019 mo and lettenmaier 2016 otkin et al 2018 pendergrass and coauthors 2020 for the evaluation of flash or shorter duration droughts the second methodological choice in the formulation of rmsi is the truncation to zero for times when water is freely available considering precipitation deficit as a drought indicator while setting any excess amount to zero has been previously used in hydrology as well as in forestry and agronomy beersma and buishand 2004 beersma and buishand 2007 kallache et al 2013 zamani et al 2016 as discussed in section 2 this is equivalent to assuming that there exists finite storage in the catchment above which spill occurs traditionally for a rmc analysis storage in this context would be thought of as a dam or other infrastructure designed to detain water in the catchment and hold it over to times of lower water availability with the capacity of the dam being the highest sequent drop in the residual mass over the data used in the context of rmsi this is equivalent to the highest residual mass deficit instead the final simplification that has been adopted in the procedure is the initialization of the residual mass at zero representing wet conditions readers are pointed to the substantial literature foley 1955 hurst 1956 keyantash and dracup 2002 mcmahon and srikanthan 1989 that exists on the sensitivity of these assumptions to the estimation of the rmc it has been clearly established that if drought is considered as a change in water scarcity from average condition then precipitation data is adequate to illustrate the severity duration and magnitude of drought bąk and kubiak wójcicka 2017 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 however the use of just precipitation data for the rmsi is a potential concern as the frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes like drought are expected to increase due to climate change dale et al 2001 ghosh 2019 it has been argued that with the influence of global warming evapotranspiration often with temperature assumed to be an adequate evapotranspiration proxy will play a vital role in drought characterization sheffield and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2010 zarch et al 2015 and should be included in drought indices e g spei and rdi the rmsi could easily be formulated by including evapotranspiration as demand however in water limited environments such as much of australia pet is not a good indicator of demand as precipitation will generally be lower than pet actual evapotranspiration could be used although it exhibits uncertainty given ground measurements are few necessitating model reconstructions which differ considerably depending on the model used kim 2021 one consideration is that if aet and precipitation are negatively correlated e g locations with winter dominated rainfall the drought characteristics will tend to be modulated which may underestimate the risks to water resources systems additionally alternatives can be formulated to project the rmsi into the future by relating it to climate model simulations jiang et al 2020a jiang et al 2020b rashid et al 2018 rashid et al 2020 however given that temperature changes are more certain in the future cook et al 2018 johnson and sharma 2009 ukkola et al 2018 the primary driver of uncertainty in future drought projections will be precipitation simulations and therefore the rmsi using just precipitation is well placed to assess this uncertainty 6 conclusions managing hydroclimatic extremes now and into the future requires a deep understanding of the most important drivers of stress in the water resources systems in many water resources systems this stress is induced by extended periods of low rainfall which may vary from several months through to multiple years the rmsi approach developed here captures the magnitude of drought events that vary in duration compares severity and identifies each drought event in the historical record using the principle of supply and demand the proposed framework is based on the well established principles of the rmc which has stood the test of time for water resource managers to balance supply monthly precipitation and demand median monthly precipitation the modification here allows periods of drying to be automatically detected in the record and compared across time and space through the definition of a standardized form of the rmsi rmsi provides a simple method of assessing sustained and severe hydroclimatic extremes with a clear and comprehensible procedure for calculation
