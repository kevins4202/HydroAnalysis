17185,cyanotoxin producing harmful algal blooms habs are a global occurrence and pose ecotoxicological threats to humans and animals alike the presence of cyanotoxins can seriously harm or kill nearby wildlife and restrict a body of water s use as a drinking water supply and recreational site making it imperative to fully understand their fate and transport in natural waters photodegradation contributes to the overall degradation of cyanotoxins in environmental systems especially for those present in the photic zone of surface waters this makes photochemical transformation mechanisms important factors to account for when assessing the persistence of cyanotoxins in environmental systems this paper reviews current knowledge on the photodegradation rates and pathways of cyanotoxins that can occur over the course of habs sensitized or indirect photolysis contributes to the degradation of all cyanotoxins addressed in this paper anatoxins cylindrospermopsins domoic acids microcystins and nodularins with hydroxyl radicals oh excited triplet states formed from the absorption of light by dissolved organic matter 3dom and photosynthetic pigment sensitized pathways being of primary interest direct photolysis pathways play a less significant role but are still relevant for most of the cyanotoxins discussed in this paper graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae have been present on earth for billions of years schopf and packer 1987 and are found in nearly all aquatic ecosystems cyanobacteria consume produce and transform many compounds with some genera producing cyanotoxins cyanotoxin producing blooms of cyanobacteria are commonly referred to as harmful algal blooms habs and can consist of both planktonic and benthic cyanobacterial species carmichael 2008 catherine et al 2013 the spread and increased occurrence of habs has been linked with anthropogenic activities eutrophication and the effects of climate change o neil et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 gehringer and wannicke 2014 visser et al 2016 buratti et al 2017 the increasing spread of toxic habs raises concerns as their presence in drinking agricultural and recreational waters poses health risks to humans and animals lee et al 2017 a study by zhang et al 2015a found that cyanobacterial blooms occurred in 62 of counties in coastal and mid north areas of the united states routes of exposure include ingestion dermal contact and inhalation lee et al 2017 as cyanotoxins have been identified in aerosols generated by lakes olson et al 2020 habs have resulted in the deaths of humans pets wildlife and livestock carmichael 2001a carmichael et al 2001b though human exposure to cyanotoxins rarely reaches lethal levels and more commonly results in short and long term health effects carmichael 2001a however some cyanotoxins have the potential to be used as chemical weapons due to their ubiquity and high toxicity van der merwe 2015 sierra and martínez álvarez 2019 cyanotoxins include cytotoxins dermatotoxins hepatotoxins and neurotoxins with the most common cyanotoxins being in the latter two categories hepatotoxins produced by habs include cylindrospermopsins microcystins mcs and nodularins which are produced by species within the genera anabaena cylindrospermopsis hapalosiphon microcystis nodularia nostoc and oscillitoria carmichael 1992 ohtani et al 1992 1997 hepatotoxins damage the liver and can lead to effects including hepatotoxicosis and hepatoenteritis charmichael 2001a neurotoxins produced by habs include anatoxins domoic acids and saxitoxins which are produced by species within the genera anabaena aphanizomenon oscillatoria and trichodesmium carmichael 1992 1997 neurotoxins damage nerve tissue and can lead to effects including muscle spasms muscle paralysis cyanosis and death carmichael 2001a testai et al 2016 however these classifications do not imply that effects are confined to only one bodily system for instance human exposure to cylindrospermopsins can also detrimentally impact the kidneys lungs spleen and intestines poniedziałek et al 2012 organic compounds in natural systems can undergo a variety of attenuation pathways such as hydrolysis sorption to soils and sediments bioaccumulation biotransformation and photochemical transformation schwarzenbach et al 2017 there are two main pathways for photochemical transformations in surface waters direct photolysis and sensitized photolysis direct photolysis occurs through the absorption of light by a compound resulting in its degradation packer et al 2003 latch et al 2005 werner et al 2005 guerard et al 2009 matamoros et al 2009 the second pathway sensitized photolysis refers to the degradation of a compound via reactions with reactive intermediates ris which are produced through the absorption of light by photosensitizers vione et al 2014 in natural systems the primary photosensitizer is typically dissolved organic matter dom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 these photogenerated ris include reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 blough and zeep 1995 zhang et al 2014 reactive halogen species rhs parker et al 2016a parker et al 2016b and carbonate radicals vione et al 2014 as well as excited triplet states formed from the absorption of light by dissolved organic matter 3dom canonica 2007 wenk et al 2011 yan and song 2014a mckay et al 2016 jin et al 2018 or photosynthetic pigments tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 robertson et al 1999 gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 kaminski et al 2013 further considerations when assessing photodegradation pathways are the spectral irradiance of sunlight and the attenuation of different spectra in natural waters uva 315 400 nm and photosynthetically active radiation 400 700 nm par penetrate further than uvb 280 315 nm leading to these spectra possibly contributing more to overall photodegradation than uvb despite a greater degradation rate typically being attributed to the uvb spectrum due its greater energy wörmer et al 2010 dissolved organic carbon doc can be used to predict par and uvr attenuation with the attenuation depth of par being between 0 5 20 m depending on the water s turbidity compared with a range of a few centimeters to approximately 5 m for the uva and uvb spectra morris et al 1995 bukaveckas and robbins forbes 2000 median depths for uva and uvb penetration were found to be 0 75 m and 0 45 m in a study that assessed eighty five lakes in the adirondacks of new york bukaveckas and robbins forbes 2000 whether cyanotoxins are intra or extracellular is also impactful when assessing their photodegradation while intracellular cyanotoxins and other cell metabolites can be shielded from light exposure due to the presence of light absorbing and or screening compounds garcia pichel and castenholz 1993 ehling schulz et al 1997 when an hab is actively producing cells the distribution of the cyanotoxin depends on the age of the bloom chiswell et al 1999 in younger blooms a greater amount of the cyanotoxin is found intracellularly while in older blooms a greater amount is found dissolved within the water column primarily due to cell lysis releasing the toxin chiswell et al 1999 subsequently even if the number of live cyanobacterial cells are decreasing towards the end of a hab episode toxins may still be present in high concentrations chiswell et al 1999 the age of the bloom also has implications for dom composition and photoreactivity as cellular material contributes to the pool of dom present there are four distinct growth phases for algal cells lag phase exponential phase early stationary phase and late stationary phase extracellular doc concentrations increase throughout these phases resulting in changes in fluorescence characteristics photoreactive species concentrations and quantum yields tenorio et al 2017 furthermore extracellular dom edom is more photolabile and has more heterogeneous optical properties than intracellular dom idom bittar et al 2015 with idom exhibiting distinct phycobiliprotein fluorescence at 500 650 nm korak et al 2015 the differing photochemical characteristics in edom and idom may result in the shifting importance of ris and subsequent photodegradation pathways throughout the course of a hab as the dom pool s makeup changes over time during cell lysis the contents of cyanobacterial cells are released allowing for cyanotoxins to be present with other cell components such as algal pigments in the water column some of the most prominent pigments in cyanobacteria are phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and phycoerythrin however other pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids may be present oliver et al 2012 the aforementioned phycobiliproteins are soluble in water and absorb light in the environmentally relevant spectrum singh et al 2009 whitton 2012 zhao et al 2019 the absorption maxima of some relevant algal pigments are presented in table 1 phycoerythrin and phycocyanin have been shown to be photosensitizers capable of producing 1o2 in engineered systems at high fluence bei et al 2002 but studies have also suggested that they may be photosensitizers in natural conditions tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 song et al 2007 phycoerythrin is also known to produce excited states when exposed to a range of wavelengths including uvb xue et al 2005 the nexus between climate change s impacts on habs and surface water chemistry also warrants discussion future impacts of climate change such as changes in temperature and light regimes earlier stratification and later destratification of large bodies of water changes in precipitation patterns and increased salinization due to longer periods of drought are proposed to support the growth of habs and further expand the areas in which they occur reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 gehringer and wannicke 2014 these impacts are also predicted to alter the photochemistry of surface waters along with other climate change impacts such as water browning in boreal lakes changes to the alkalinity of waters in temperate regions and shorter periods of ice cover de laurentiis et al 2014 vione and scozzaro 2019 these changes could increase the amount of direct and sensitized photodegradation that occurs at various times of the year as well as alter the steady state concentrations of ris such as 3dom 1o2 and oh that are relevant to the photodegradation of cyanotoxins vione et al 2019 wasswa et al 2020 these predicted impacts on habs and surface water chemistry synergize to suggest that the photodegradation of cyanotoxins will likely increase in importance over time 1 1 scope of this review this review will address the photochemical fate of cyanotoxins in surface waters many cyanotoxins have been left out of this paper due to a lack of literature on their photodegradation given the global occurrence of habs and the drinking water concerns associated with them photodegradation rates and pathways will be compiled and discussed in order to identify the relative significance of photodegradation pathways that need to be accounted for when assessing habs during transit from hab hotspots to downstream drinking water intakes toxin attenuation via photodegradation may be significant depending on environmental conditions and the toxin present possible transformation products will also be discussed relevant experimental data such as degradation rates quantum yields and rate coefficients from the referenced literature has been compiled in table si 1 the photochemistry of cyanotoxins in engineered systems has been reviewed by others he et al 2016 schneider and bláha 2020 and will not be discussed 2 anatoxins anatoxins include anatoxin a atx homoanatoxin a htx anatoxin a s also known as guanitoxin fiore et al 2020 2 3 2 3 dihydroanatoxin a dihydrohomoanatoxin a 4r and 4s hydroxyhomoanatoxin a 2 3 epoxyhomoanatoxin a 11 carboxyanatoxin a 4 oxohomoanatoxin a and 2 3 expoxyanatoxin a jones et al 2020 these cyanotoxins are produced by benthic and planktonic freshwater cyanobacteria osswald et al 2007 with anatoxin a being the only compound in this class whose photochemical fate in natural waters has received research attention due to anatoxin a s not being produced by the genus anabaena and fundamental differences in structures of anatoxin a s and atx fiore et al 2020 have suggested renaming anatoxin a s to guanitoxin the authors of this paper support this proposal and note that due to the structural differences in the molecules the photodegradation pathways of atx and gaunitoxin are likely to be dissimilar atx is a bicyclic secondary amine alkaloid 2 acetyl 9 azabicyclo 4 2 1 non 2 ene with a molecular weight of 165 23 g mol 1 devlin et al 1977 due to atx s pka of 9 36 0 06 koskinen and rapoport 1985 it will be protonated in most surface waters although atx s maximum absorption at 227 nm fig 1 james et al 1998 is outside the environmentally relevant spectrum it does absorb light in the uvb spectrum with htx having a similar uv absorption spectrum in the literature atx has been shown to undergo direct and sensitized photolysis stevens and krieger 1991 al momani 2007 afzal et al 2010 kaminski et al 2013 2 1 direct photolysis of anatoxins anatoxin a has been shown to undergo direct photolysis following first order degradation kinetics when exposed to sunlight stevens and krieger 1991 atx s degradation rate is independent of oxygen concentration and shows a positive correlation with ph and light intensity stevens and krieger 1991 suggesting that as atx deprotonates it becomes more susceptible to direct photolysis the half life of atx in sunlight is between 1 and 2 h at ph 6 and between 96 min and 330 min at ph 9 stevens and krieger 1991 it should be noted that this decay rate is faster than measured non photochemical degradation rates stevens and krieger 1991 light in the uvb spectrum is the main contributor of this photodegradation with atx concentrations being reduced by 82 and 84 after 1 hour of uvb irradiation 36 µmol m 2s 1 at ph 7 0 and 9 5 respectively alternatively 5 h of par irradiation 1500 µmol m 2s 1 at the same ph levels yielded no significant degradation kaminski et al 2013 this is in line with atx s absorption peak at 227 nm which then trails off with minor absorption in the uvb region james et al 1998 the direct photolysis quantum yields of atx at concentrations of 0 6 and 1 8 mg l over the wavelength range of 200 to 300 nm were measured as 0 15 and 0 05 respectively afzal et al 2010 this decrease in direct photolysis quantum yield with increasing atx concentration is suggested to be due to an increase in the formation of intermediates which can compete with atx for light absorption afzal et al 2010 alternatively this observation could also be explained by self quenching or back reduction however the applicability of these quantum yields to natural systems is questionable due to the irradiation spectra primarily falling in the uvc spectrum which is not relevant in natural systems photolysis of atx in sunlight produces products with the same molecular weight suggesting reaction pathways that lead to the formation of rearrangement products involving bridgehead positions stevens and krieger 1991 these transformation products were found to have a lower toxicity than atx stevens and krieger 1991 expanding on this work kaminski et al 2013 found that three degradation products were formed through uvb degradation one is likely an htx homologue one is thought to be hemiacetal and one results from atx hydration 2 2 sensitized photolysis of anatoxins there is also evidence that sensitized photolysis can contribute to the degradation of atx onstad et al 2007 afzal et al 2010 kaminski et al 2013 the second order rate constant between atx and oh was measured to be 3 0 0 02 109m 1s 1 at ph 7 by onstad et al 2007 and 5 2 0 3 109m 1s 1 in the ph range 4 5 9 5 by afzal et al 2010 this rate constant is independent of temperature and initial atx concentration afzal et al 2010 it should be noted that these values were measured using engineered systems relying on light spectra outside the range found in natural sunlight e g vacuum ultraviolet vuv afzal et al 2010 and oh formation through ozone decomposition onstad et al 2007 however the contribution of specific reactive intermediates to atx s sensitized photolysis in natural water matrices and possible reaction pathways have yet to be fully evaluated research has shown that phycocyanin may act as a photosensitizer for atx as atx degraded 7 an approximate half life of 2 days assuming first order kinetics when exposed to red light 620 nm 100 µmol m 2s 1 in the presence of phycocyanin for 5 h at ph 3 5 7 0 and 9 5 kaminski et al 2013 other possible photosensitizers such as dom have not been explored 3 cylindrospermopsins cylindrospermopsins are hepatotoxins with cylindrospermopsin cyn containing a hydroxylmethyl uracil moiety bridged to a tricyclic alkaloid moiety ohtani et al 1992 and having a molecular weight of 415 43 g mol 1 there are five known naturally occurring cylindrospermopsins cylindrospermopsin 7 epi cylindrospermopsin 7 epi cyn 7 deoxy cylindrospermopsin 7 deoxy cyn 7 deoxy desulfo cylindrospermopsin 7 deoxy desulfo 12 acetylcylindrospermopsin ohtani et al 1992 norris et al 1999 banker et al 2000 wimmer et al 2014 7 deoxy cyn is suggested to be a precursor to cyn and 7 epi cyn during their biosynthesis mazmouz et al 2011 although it has been detected as a major metabolite of lyngbya wollei cyanobacterium seifert et al 2007 cylindrospermopsins are produced by benthic and planktonic freshwater cyanobacteria which have been found on every continent except antarctica de la cruz et al 2013 cyn absorbs light in the uv spectrum with maximum absorption at 262 nm and minimal absorption occurring in the uva and uvb spectra sano et al 2008 merel et al 2010 cyn has an estimated pka of 8 8 onstad et al 2007 although the pka of the sulfate group in cyn is 1 92 and the arginine in the tricyclic guanidine group has a pka of 12 chen et al 2015 3 1 direct photolysis of cylindrospermopsins no significant amount of degradation has been observed when cyn is exposed to sunlight chiswell et al 1999 song et al 2012 par chiswell et al 1999 wörmer et al 2010 adamski et al 2016 or 350 nm light chen et al 2015 when exposed to uvb light 36 µmol m 2s 1 at neutral ph cyn has a half life of 69 h alternatively at ph 10 and 12 cyn has half lives of 7 and 5 h respectively adamski et al 2016 these observations can be explained by the deprotonation of cyn that likely occurs at ph 8 8 onstad et al 2007 six decomposition products are formed when cyn is exposed to uvb irradiation at ph 10 and 12 five unnamed compounds and 7 epi cyn adamski et al 2016 these products are formed primarily through alterations to the tricyclic guanidine moiety while the epimer 7 epi cyn has the hydroxyl group at c 7 shifted from an r to an s configuration since the conditions necessary to form these compounds are unlikely to be found in natural waters we refer the reader to adamski et al 2016 for a discussion of proposed reaction pathways 3 2 sensitized photoylsis of cylindrospermopsins like atx cyn is also susceptible to sensitized photolysis with multiple photosensitizers playing a role in cyn degradation and half lives of 11 and 15 days being observed in natural water samples exposed to natural sunlight chiswell et al 1999 cyn primarily undergoes oh mediated sensitized photolysis with a second order rate constant of 5 08 0 16 x 109 song et al 2012 transformations initiated by oh account for approximately 70 of cyn degradation in natural waters song et al 2012 primarily due to reactive intermediates such as 3dom and 1o2 playing less significant roles in the degradation of cyn wörmer et al 2010 song et al 2012 degradation pathways initiated by oh mediated sensitized photolysis include the hydroxylation of the uracil ring alcoholic oxidation of the hydroxylmethyl group and elimination of the sulfate group from the tricyclic alkaloid moiety song et al 2012 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b adamski et al 2016 oh addition at c5 of the carbon carbon c5 c6 double bond in the uracil ring forms a monohydroxylated product p431 which can further undergo oxidation to form the corresponding ketone product p429 song et al 2012 he et al 2014 oh addition at c6 of the c5 c6 double bond is a less favorable reaction pathway and likely leads to oxidative cleavage of the uracil ring to form other uncharacterized ring opening products song et al 2012 furthermore oh addition across the c5 c6 bond may produce dihydroxylated products that undergo further oxidation to form a pyrimidinetrione product p447 which may undergo ring cleavage to form cylindrospermopsic acid p349 p349 can undergo subsequent decarboxylation hydroxylation and oxidation to form a carboxylic acid product p319 song et al 2012 he et al 2014 oh addition to the urea group in the uracil ring forms a ring opening product p374 although this pathway has not been fully studied song et al 2012 he et al 2014 oh addition to the tricyclic alkaloid moiety may form multiple monohydroxylated isomers p431 following h abstraction alpha to nitrogen atoms in the guanidine group or to the sulfate group song et al 2012 he et al 2014 further hydroxylation produces additional di and trihydroxylated products that can undergo oxidation to form the corresponding ketone products he et al 2014 on the other hand h abstraction from the hydroxylmethyl group forms the corresponding ketone product p413 song et al 2012 he et al 2014 while h abstraction at the tertiary c12 with subsequent oxidation forms a desulfated ketone product p334 he et al 2014 the pigments found within c raciborskii cells phycocyanin and chlorophyll a may also play roles in the photochemical degradation of cyn degradation rates of cyn are seemingly dependent on the concentration of cyn and algal extracts suggesting second order kinetics in the presence of c raciborskii algal extracts cyn half lives in sunlight were 1 5 h in algal extracts containing 4 mg l cyn compared to 3 4 h in algal extracts containing 1 mg l cyn chiswell et al 1999 in natural waters taken from two separate reservoirs cyn s half life was found to be 11 and 15 days in natural sunlight chiswell et al 1999 though the authors do not provide any water quality data for these waters beyond stating that they contained natural amounts of plant pigments however no changes to cyn s degradation rate were observed in the presence of phycocyanin when exposed to red light 620 nm by adamski et al 2016 although phycocyanin s maximum absorption occurs at 620 nm it also has other absorption peaks at 550 nm 350 nm and 280 nm with these wavelengths absorbing approximately 60 17 and 30 of the light absorbed at 620 nm respectively zhao et al 2019 algal extracts of c raciborskii can contain the pigments chlorophyll a phycocyanin and carotenoids bonilla et al 2012 beamud et al 2016 therefore the lack of photodegradation in cyn observed by adamski et al 2016 could be a result of another pigment being responsible for the photosensitization of cyn or 620 nm light not having sufficient energy to induce excited states for phycocyanin chlorophyll a has absorption maxima at 429 nm and 661 nm table 1 porra et al 1989 and can produce excited singlet and triplet states which can go on to form ros including 1o2 ballatori et al 2013 subsequently it may be responsible for the cyn photodegradation observed in algal extract solutions although chlorophyll pigments are insoluble in water and have not been explored in depth as photosensitizers in aquatic systems phycocyanin has been shown to produce triplet states that can photosensitize other cyanotoxins when exposed to 350 nm light song et al 2007 but it is unclear if higher wavelengths have the same potential in the presence of doc and algal extracts cyn degraded 27 3 over 22 days in full sunlight 20 6 when exposed to par and uva and no degradation was observed when only exposed to par wörmer et al 2010 suggesting that uva irradiation plays the biggest role in the sensitized photodegradation of cyn followed by uvb comparatively when exposed to full sunlight at a depth of 1 m in the same solution cyn degraded 10 8 and at 4 m no degradation was observed wörmer et al 2010 the specific contributions of reactive intermediates that may have been present in solution e g 3dom 1o2 pigments in excited states were not explored by wörmer et al 2010 4 domoic acids domoic acid da is a neurotoxin consisting of a carboxymethyl proline ring and a conjugated diene side chain 2 4 hexadienoic acid it is primarily produced by marine toxigenic diatom species from the genus pseudo nitzschia bates 2000 da contains four groups that can protonate three carboxylic acids and one imino group giving it four pka s 1 85 4 47 4 75 and 10 60 walter et al 1992 subsequently in natural waters all three carboxylic acids will be deprotonated while the imino group will remain protonated da has a maximum absorption at 243 nm with very minimal absorption occurring in the 275 375 nm range falk et al 1989 bouillon et al 2008 4 1 direct photolysis of domoic acids studies suggest that direct photolysis is a contributing factor to the degradation of da bates et al 2003 bouillon et al 2006 bouillon et al 2008 while some argue that direct photolysis is a relatively minor contribution to the photodegradation of da fisher et al 2006 jin et al 2018 when exposed to sunlight da undergoes exponential decay bates et al 2003 bouillon et al 2006 2008 with photodegradation rates between da in di water and seawater not varying significantly suggesting a direct photochemical degradation pathway bates et al 2003 bouillon et al 2006 rates of measured da photodegradation in seawater vary slightly ranging from 64 degradation after 22 h exposure to simulated sunlight approximate half life of 34 h bates et al 2003 to 79 degradation after 10 h exposure to simulated sunlight approximate half life of 4 h bouillon et al 2006 similarly the photodegradation quantum yields for da in di water are equal to or greater than those in seawater bouillon et al 2006 for 366 0 280 0 nm da photodegradation quantum yields range from 0 037 0 200 in di water and 0 032 0 163 for seawater with quantum yields decreasing as wavelength increases bouillon et al 2006 temperature has been shown to have a slight impact on the photodegradation rate coefficient of da as it increases from 0 12 h 1 at 5 c to 0 15 h 1 at 20 c bouillon et al 2006 the relatively small impact of temperature on photodegradation rates suggests that reaction pathways for the photodegradation of da have minimal activation energies uvb radiation is the most effective radiation band when it comes to da photodegradation however due to the greater intensity of uva irradiance in sunlight uva radiation is estimated to account for approximately 90 of da photodegradation near the sea surface compared to 9 for uvb radiation with 330 nm light contributing the most to overall photodegradation bouillon et al 2006 bouillon et al 2006 estimate that between 1 7 and 3 5 of dissolved da in the top 5 m of the water column undergoes photodegradation daily the photolysis of da with sunlight primarily produces three products which are geometrical isomers of da isodomoic acids d e and f bouillon et al 2008 also known as 2 z 4 z da 2 e 4 e da and 2 e 4 z da respectively over the course of irradiation steady state concentrations of da and the photoproduced isomers are reached within 10 to 24 h with isodomoic acid e having the greatest abundance followed by da isodomoic acid f and isodomoic acid d bouillon et al 2008 the produced isodomoic acids can undergo further photodegradation producing decarboxylated derivatives or isomers with unconjugated double bonds bouillon et al 2008 the production rates of these isomers are dependent on da concentration and isomer concentrations are further impacted by the aforementioned photodegradation reactions resulting in an initial net increase in the concentration of isodomoic acids when da concentrations are high followed by a net decrease in their concentrations as da concentrations decrease bouillon et al 2008 4 2 sensitized photolyis of domoic acids dom rhs and fe iii have all been shown to be relevant photosensitizers for da bates et al 2003 fisher et al 2006 jin et al 2018 however these results are disputed by bouillon et al 2006 who found that dom dissolved oxygen trace metals cu ii and fe iii and ph in the range 4 7 do not impact da photodegradation rates bouillon et al 2006 in a halide free solution jin et al 2018 found that the reactive species contributing to the photodegradation of da can be ranked as follows oh 43 9 3dom electron transfer 22 6 direct photolysis 19 1 3dom energy transfer 18 3 alternatively in halide containing solutions this shifts to 3dom energy transfer 40 9 halogen radicals 20 5 oh 19 4 direct photolysis 11 9 3dom electron transfer 6 0 as a result of the ionic strength effect promoting 3dom induced photo isomerization parker et al 2013 energy transfer from 3dom to the conjugated diene moiety of da promotes the formation of its 2 z 4 z 2 e 4 e and 2 e 4 z geometrical isomers all of which may undergo decarboxylation to form a series of decarboxylated isomers p267 bouillon et al 2008 gagez et al 2017 besides this sensitized isomerization pathway zepp et al 1985 da reacts with 3dom via 1 2 h shift decarboxylation and h transfer pathways to form various other transformation products tps jin et al 2018 for example electron transfer from the n atom in the proline ring of da to 3dom initiates 1 2 h shift and addition of oxygen to generate peroxyl radicals which undergo either intramolecular h abstraction to form pyrroline products p309 or bimolecular decay through unstable tetraoxide intermediates i e russell mechanism russell 1957 von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 to form pyrrolidinol products p327 jin et al 2018 electron transfer between 3dom and the carboxylic acid group on the proline ring of da initiates decarboxylation and oxygen addition to generate a decarboxylated peroxyl radical which undergoes bimolecular decay to form pyrrolidone and pyrrolidinol products p281 and p283 jin et al 2018 h transfer from 3dom to the conjugated diene moiety of da followed by oxygen addition generates side chain peroxyl radicals which subsequently undergo bimolecular decay to form multiple ketone products p327 jin et al 2018 1o2 and oh have also been shown to contribute to the sensitized photolysis of da jin et al 2018 jaramillo et al 2020 and form tps different from those resulting from reactions with 3dom oh addition to the conjugated diene moiety of da forms isomeric 1 2 and 1 4 diol intermediate products p345 further oxidative cleavage of the 1 2 diol products forms the corresponding ketone and aldehyde products p215 and p241 p215 can undergo decarboxylation at the proline ring to form a pyrroline product p169 while p241 can undergo either hydroxylation at the conjugated diene side chain to form a dihydroxylated product p275 or 3dom mediated 1 2 h shift on the proline ring to form pyrrolidinol products p257 unlike the 1 2 diol products the 1 4 diol product forms pyrrolidinol products p361 through 3dom mediated 1 2 h shift which may further undergo 3dom mediated decarboxylation at the proline ring to form decarboxylated products p315 and p317 jin et al 2018 alternatively the pathways involving 1o2 reacting with da primarily consist of 2 2 cycloaddition and ene reactions both of which occur at the z double bond in the conjugated diene moiety of the molecule jaramillo et al 2020 since these products both involve the elimination of the diene moiety which has been suggested to play a role in da s toxicity singlet oxygenation appears to be relevant for the detoxification of da jaramillo et al 2020 a diels alder reaction pathway which produces an endoperoxide product p343 has also been proposed although this has only been suggested through experiments where sorbic acid was used as a model compound for da parekh 2012 the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction between da and 1o2 has been measured as 5 1 105m 1s 1 with an associated half life of between 5 and 63 days jaramillo et al 2020 in the presence of halides da s photodegradation increases jin et al 2018 and forms unique tps parker and mitch 2016 jin et al 2018 for instance h abstraction by halogen radicals at the tertiary carbon between the conjugated diene and the carboxylic acid on the side chain followed by hydroperoxyl radical addition forms a unique organic peroxide product p343 similarly h abstraction at the side chain and the proline ring followed by decarboxylation and hydroperoxyl radical addition forms two other organic peroxide products p299 jin et al 2018 the observed quantum yields for da photodegradation suggest that the importance of rhs is clbr cl2 br2 parker and mitch 2016 fe iii has also been shown to contribute to the photodegradation of da in freshwater and saltwater environments bates et al 2003 fisher et al 2006 which is suggested to be due to ligand to metal charge transfer degradation pathways fisher et al 2006 in di water solutions with fe iii da completely degrades within 24 h when exposed to simulated sunlight alternatively in seawater approximately 80 degradation occurs bates et al 2003 this difference in degradation is suggested to be due to salts present in seawater inhibiting the photodegradation of da in some way bates et al 2003 but this has yet to be fully elucidated similar studies have shown that the presence of po4 3 inhibits the degradation of da through fe iii photosensitized pathways due to po4 3 having a greater association constant k with fe iii than da estimated k of 1 72 1011 for fe iii and da and k of 1040 for fe iii and po4 3 resulting in the photodegradation rate of da decreasing up to a factor of 15 in the presence of po4 3 fisher et al 2006 5 microcystins microcystins are hepatotoxins produced by multiple genera including planktonic and benthic species and can be found on all continents buratti et al 2017 zaki et al 2020 mcs are monocyclic heptapeptides consisting of three d amino acids two characteristic amino acids i e n methyldehydroalanine mdha and 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl 4 e 6 e decadienoic acid adda and two variable l amino acids which are denoted in the abbreviations for different varieties i e mc lr mc rr etc botes et al 1984 1985 while mdha and adda are the most common amino acids found in mcs there are variations in these two functional groups bouaïcha et al 2019 currently there are over 300 known mc variants as a result of the seven functional groups that can vary in the molecule jones et al 2020 fig 4 bouaïcha et al 2019 showcases the variability in mc structures not including 30 new structures that have been recently discovered mc lr has three pka s 2 09 2 19 and 12 48 de maagd et al 1999 at neutral ph the carboxylic acids in two of the d amino acids present in mc lr are deprotonated with the l amino acid arginine containing an amino group which remains protonated all known mc variants contain a carboxylic acid group in the d masp or d aspamino acids twelve do not contain the carboxylic acid group in the d gluamino acid and 106 contain an l amino acid other than arginine bouaïcha et al 2019 therefore these pka values may apply to many other mc variants most mc producing cyanobacteria are primarily found in freshwater environments although they have been reported in marine environments as well van apeldoorn et al 2007 with mc producing blooms recorded in 79 countries harke et al 2016 mc lr and mc rr are the most common and most frequently studied mcs although the most abundant congener varies depending on the cyanobacterial strains present and environmental conditions buratti et al 2017 díez quijada et al 2019 photodegradation has been shown to not be significantly different between different mcs welker and steinberg 1999 song et al 2007 and once extracellular mcs have been shown to persist for between 2 and 4 weeks in freshwater environments jones and orr 1994 lahti et al 1997 5 1 direct photolysis of microcystins direct photolysis is not a significant degradation pathway that is recognized for mcs as mc lr mc yr and mc rr do not degrade when exposed to sunlight welker and steinberg 1999 parker et al 2016 this is expected as mc lr s peak absorption is approximately 239 nm with virtually no absorption occurring at wavelengths above approximately 270 nm harada et al 1990 chintalapati and mohseni 2020 other studies have further confirmed a lack of direct photolysis degradation pathways for mc lr specifically tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 welker and steinberg 2000 gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 5 2 sensitized photolysis of microcystins mcs mainly undergo sensitized photolysis in the presence of dom via pathways mediated by 3dom and oh tsuji et al 1994 1995 kaya and sano 1998 welker and steinberg 1999 2000 wörmer et al 2010 yan et al 2014b parker et al 2016 sun et al 2018 with phycocyanin also contributing to mc photodegradation tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 the presence of iron iii and nitrate are reported to not impact mc photodegradation rates parker and mitch 2016 par uva and uvb spectra all contribute to the degradation of mcs wörmer et al 2010 however par and uva contribute the most to mc photodegradation due to their greater intensity in the solar spectrum vähätalo et al 2000 wörmer et al 2010 in dom enhanced solutions oh and 1o2 accounted for 13 0 and 2 2 of mc lr loss respectively suggesting that 3dom mediated pathways are the most significant yan et al 2014b welker and steinberg 1999 found that mc variants degrade anywhere from 44 to 55 after 8 h of sunlight exposure in the presence of humic substances with degradation efficiency not being impacted by the concentration of humic substances the pseudo first order degradation rates of mcs increase by a factor of 3 in the presence of nom parker et al 2016 and 3 4 in the presence of fulvic acids welker and steinberg 1999 see table si 1 the photodegradation rate of mc lr also increases as ph decreases which is suggested to be a result of alkaline conditions deprotonating functional groups within dom and mcs increasing repulsive forces between the molecules yan et al 2014b for sensitized photolysis of mc lr energy transfer from 3dom is the predominant pathway and promotes the sensitized isomerization of mc lr to form its 4 e 6 z adda5 geometrical isomer also known as 6 z adda5 mc lr tsuji et al 1994 song et al 2007 yan et al 2014b the isomerization to form 6 z adda mc lr is reversible with mc lr being the more geometrically stable molecule yan et al 2014b hydroxyl radical can potentially react with mcs at four major sites the benzene ring the conjugated diene group the methoxy group in the adda amino acid and the carbon carbon double bond in the mdha amino acid song et al 2009 antoniou et al 2008a hydroxyl radical addition to the benzene ring in the adda moiety forms ortho para and meta monohydroxylated products e g p1011 and potentially dihydroxylated products e g p1027 antoniou et al 2008a 2008b song et al 2009 he et al 2015 hydroxyl radical addition to the conjugated diene forms isomeric 1 2 and 1 4 diol products e g p1029 which may undergo further hydroxylation to form tetrahydroxylated products liu et al 2003 antoniou et al 2008a 2008b song et al 2009 zong et al 2013 hydroxyl radical addition to the conjugated diene also leads to the oxidative cleavage of the double bond or the 1 2 diol intermediate to form the corresponding ketone aldehyde and eventually hydroxyl products e g p834 p794 and p782 liu et al 2003 antoniou et al 2008a zong et al 2013 he et al 2015 h abstraction at the methoxy carbon atom followed by oxygen addition generates mc peroxyl radicals which may undergo bimolecular decay through the russell mechanism russell 1957 von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 to form formic acid ester mc derivatives that are susceptible to further oxidation to form a demethoxylated product e g p965 antoniou et al 2008a hydroxyl radical addition to the cc double bond in the mdha moiety to form dihydroxylated products is a less favorable pathway due to the competing reactions at the adda moiety and steric hindrance antoniou et al 2008a alkalinity has been shown to reduce the sensitized photolysis of mcs likely due to the scavenging of oh he et al 2012 chintalapati and mohseni 2020 besides oh mediated pathways photohydration at the enone group in the mdha moiety can lead to the formation of a β hydroxyl ketone product he et al 2015 the presence of halides also contributes to mc photodegradation in sunlight with particular importance being noted once halide concentrations reach 40 of typical seawater concentrations parker et al 2016 the uva and uvb spectra were noted to be the sole contributors to rhs mc photodegradation parker et al 2016 due to rhs likely being generated by aromatic ketone sensitizers which absorb light primarily in these spectra loeff et al 1993 when halides are present at concentrations similar to seawater i e 540 mm nacl and 0 8 mm nabr mc lr and mc yr photodegradation increases by a factor of 3 parker et al 2016 as halide concentrations increased along an estuarine transect by a factor of 5 the indirect photodegradation quantum yield of mc lr increased from 0 6 10 6 mol mol photon to 4 2 10 6 mol mol photon table si 1 parker et al 2016 in natural water samples at a depth of 0 2 m calculated mc lr half lives decreased from 9 d to 2 d as halide concentrations increased from 103 mm cl and 0 12 mm br to 423 mm cl and 0 66 mm br parker et al 2016 similarly at a depth of 2 m calculated mc lr half lives decreased from 80 d to 14 d as halide concentrations increased consequently mc concentrations are expected to decrease by between 56 and 99 994 when travelling 5 km in freshwater estuarine streams for flowrates between 6 m3 s to 0 5 m3 s respectively parker et al 2016 the ionic strength effect induced by the presence of halides which increased the importance of 3dom energy transfer pathways in da photodegradation jin et al 2018 was not observed in mc lr and mc yr parker and mitch 2016 these seemingly conflicting observations are thought to be a result of the diene moiety in mcs being near the microcystin ring inhibiting the 3dom energy transfer pathways that target the conjugated diene moiety parker and mitch 2016 jin et al 2018 phycocyanin has also been shown to be a relevant photosensitizer for mcs including mc lr mc rr and mc lf tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 song et al 2007 with mc lr s degradation following pseudo first order kinetics with a half life of 120 24 min when exposed to 350 50 nm light 20 µw cm 2 in the presence of phycocyanin song et al 2007 up to 20 of the protein in cyanobacteria can be phycocyanins with the ratio of mcs to phycocyanins being approximately 0 7 weight percentage song et al 2007 the phototransformation rate of mc lr increases as phycocyanin concentrations increase but plateaus once phycocyanin concentrations reach 250 340 mg l due to increased light attenuation gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 increases in ph lead to a decrease in the first order rate constants of mc lr photosensitized transformation in the presence of phycocyanin song et al 2007 at neutral ph the carboxyl groups in mc lr and phycocyanin will be deprotonated leading to an increase in electrostatic repulsive forces this is similar to the effect that ph has in 3dom mediated photolysis of mcs yan et al 2014b that was previously discussed a comparison of reported first order reaction rate coefficients is presented in table 6 while both dom and phycocyanin have been shown to be photosensitizers for mcs due to variability in dom makeup dom concentration and phycocyanin concentration in natural systems it is difficult to quantify the exact significance of each sensitizer there is primarily one byproduct formed during phycocyanin mediated photodegradation of mc lr the isomer 6 z adda mc lr that is formed through energy transfer to the diene moiety in the adda portion of mc lr song et al 2007 this is a result of intersystem crossing isc forming an excited triplet state of phycocyanin which can result in the triplet diene undergoing isomerization from the e to the z isomer song et al 2007 excited state phycocyanin may also transfer an electron to oxygen forming the superoxide radical which can protonate to form the hydroperoxide radical or transfer energy to oxygen forming singlet oxygen robertson et al 1999 hydroperoxide radicals can attack the adda group of mcs forming hydroperoxides which have been shown to be nontoxic robertson et al 1999 1o2 may react with unsaturated bonds on mcs to form peroxides hydroperoxides dioxetanes and carbonyl compounds robertson et al 1999 although results from song et al 2007 suggest that singlet oxygen is likely not involved in the photodegradation of mcs other pigments chlorophyll a β carotene and mixoxanthophyll may also contribute to the degradation of mcs tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 with degradation rates sharing a positive correlation with pigment concentration as well as being dependent on the pigments present tsuji et al 1994 however the presence of intact cyanobacterial cells decreases mc degradation rates due to light absorption and oh scavenging chintalapati and mohseni 2020 6 nodularins nodularins nods are cyclic pentapeptide hepatotoxins produced by the brackish water filamentous cyanobacterium nodularia spumigena carmichael et al 1988 with 16 known variants jones et al 2020 the nod molecule is similar to microcystin in that both molecules consist of a carbon ring with an attached adda molecule leading to them having similar chemical properties and detection methods van apeldoorn et al 2007 the absorption of nod is similar to that of mc lr with a maximum at 238 nm and minimal absorption in the uvb spectrum due to the conjugated diene in the adda amino acid found in both compounds mazur and pliński 2003 6 1 direct photolysis of nodularins whether nodularin undergoes direct photolysis is up for debate as there is conflicting evidence in the literature twist and codd 1997 found that pure nod is stable when exposed to natural sunlight over a period of 9 days alternatively mazur marzec et al 2006 observed that pure nod photodegraded when exposed to various light sources over 48 h with the following efficiency uvb 6 0 w m 2 uva 6 0 w m 2 vis 6 5 w m 2 due to nod s lack of light absorption in these spectra these results are somewhat surprising especially considering mc lr s similar absorption characteristics and well documented lack of direct photolysis as previously discussed 6 2 sensitized photolysis of nodularins nodularin has been shown to degrade in the presence of n spumigena cell free extracts and whole filaments twist and codd 1997 mazur marzec et al 2006 nod s degradation rate is greatest when in the presence of cell free extracts twist and codd 1997 mazur marzec et al 2006 with cell free filtrate solutions resulting in 95 degradation of nod when exposed to sunlight over 9 d twist and codd 1997 comparatively exposing cells of n spumigena to light over 9 d resulted in intracellular nod concentrations decreasing by approximately 75 of nod due to release of the toxin rather than in vivo photodegradation with sunlight and sunlight minus uv spectra yielding similar results twist and codd 1997 once extracellular nod concentrations decreased to non detectable levels within 24 h with the remaining 25 of intracellular nod remaining constant during this time twist and codd 1997 the increase in degradation once the compounds are extracellular can be attributed to greater uvb exposure as radiation absorbing compounds within cyanobacterial cells can shield the toxin from incoming light xue et al 2005 uva and uvb radiation both contribute to nod degradation however uvb light has been shown to have a greater impact on the degradation rate of nod particularly in the presence of cell free extracts mazur marzec et al 2006 three uvb degradation products of nod have been identified and are thought to be stereoisomers of nod with the primary degradation product being an unknown nod analogue with an absorption maximum at 242 nm mazur marzec et al 2006 twist and codd 1997 suggest that extracellular degradation is likely due to nod degrading enzymes that may be present in the cell free extracts or pigment photosensitized reactions however cell components such as phycocyanin have been shown to promote the sensitized photolysis of cyanotoxins such as cyn and mc lr tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 robertson et al 1999 as previously discussed phycocyanin mediated mc degradation primarily occurs through energy transfer to the diene moiety in the adda portion of the molecule song et al 2007 which could also be relevant for nod photodegradation 7 conclusion the ris 3dom 1o2 and oh have been confirmed as contributors to the photodegradation of all cyanotoxins discussed in this review with the exception of atx and nod the role of 3dom and 1o2 in atx s sensitized photolysis have not been explored and the specific contribution of any ris to nod s photodegradation has also not received any research attention quantum yields and second order rate constants reported in the literature are compiled in tables 6 and 7 known oh mediated reactions with cyanotoxins are nearly diffusion controlled consistent with oh s known high reactivity with water constituents vione et al 2014 triplet state dom mediated isomerization reaction rate constants with da are also quite high alternatively observed reaction rate constants between singlet oxygen and cyanotoxins are approximately half that of 3dom mediated isomerization with da and oh reactions with atx cyn da and mcs specific cyanotoxins such as cylindrospermopsin domoic acid and mc lr have relatively well understood degradation kinetics and mechanisms but the same cannot be said for anatoxins and nodularins as well as other cyn and mc variants while some degradation rates and transformation products for these cyanotoxins have been identified a deeper understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms at play has yet to be achieved observed mc lr photodegradation pathways involving the adda and d asp amino acid moieties could also be relevant for other mc variants as well as nod where these moieties are also present however the impacts of these molecular variations on photodegradation rates and pathways needs to be explored before broad generalizations can be made about their transferability given the predicted increase in habs due to climate change the need for a greater understanding of the fate and transport of other cyanotoxins not discussed in this review such as aplysiatoxins β n methylamino l alanine bmaa lyngbyatoxins and saxitoxins is ever increasing poisonings due to cyanotoxins have steadily increased over the years with literature on the topic following suit merel et al 2013 saxitoxin is well represented in research literature with an estimated 1439 articles published focusing on the cyanotoxin as of 2013 merel et al 2013 but its photochemical fate has not been studied at length the fate of saxitoxins e g saxitoxin neosaxitoxins gonyautotoxins c toxins etc may be of particular interest due to their relatively high toxicity ld50 stx 27 8 nmol kg ld50 neostx 8 9 ld50 dcstx 35 4 nmol kg ld50 gtx 1 4 14 6 nmol kg ld50 gtx 2 3 36 7 nmol kg munday et al 2013 and saxitoxin s possible use as a chemical weapon sierra and martínez álvarez 2019 while the presence of pigments and other cell components have been shown to promote photodegradation twist and codd 1997 chiswell et al 1999 mazur marzec et al 2006 adamski et al 2016 the exact compounds and mechanisms at play have not been fully fleshed out phycocyanin s role as a photosensitizer is well known tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 robertson et al 1999 song et al 2007 kaminski et al 2013 but its relative importance for cyanotoxin photodegradation in relation to other pigments and chromophore containing cellular components warrants further

17185,cyanotoxin producing harmful algal blooms habs are a global occurrence and pose ecotoxicological threats to humans and animals alike the presence of cyanotoxins can seriously harm or kill nearby wildlife and restrict a body of water s use as a drinking water supply and recreational site making it imperative to fully understand their fate and transport in natural waters photodegradation contributes to the overall degradation of cyanotoxins in environmental systems especially for those present in the photic zone of surface waters this makes photochemical transformation mechanisms important factors to account for when assessing the persistence of cyanotoxins in environmental systems this paper reviews current knowledge on the photodegradation rates and pathways of cyanotoxins that can occur over the course of habs sensitized or indirect photolysis contributes to the degradation of all cyanotoxins addressed in this paper anatoxins cylindrospermopsins domoic acids microcystins and nodularins with hydroxyl radicals oh excited triplet states formed from the absorption of light by dissolved organic matter 3dom and photosynthetic pigment sensitized pathways being of primary interest direct photolysis pathways play a less significant role but are still relevant for most of the cyanotoxins discussed in this paper graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae have been present on earth for billions of years schopf and packer 1987 and are found in nearly all aquatic ecosystems cyanobacteria consume produce and transform many compounds with some genera producing cyanotoxins cyanotoxin producing blooms of cyanobacteria are commonly referred to as harmful algal blooms habs and can consist of both planktonic and benthic cyanobacterial species carmichael 2008 catherine et al 2013 the spread and increased occurrence of habs has been linked with anthropogenic activities eutrophication and the effects of climate change o neil et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 gehringer and wannicke 2014 visser et al 2016 buratti et al 2017 the increasing spread of toxic habs raises concerns as their presence in drinking agricultural and recreational waters poses health risks to humans and animals lee et al 2017 a study by zhang et al 2015a found that cyanobacterial blooms occurred in 62 of counties in coastal and mid north areas of the united states routes of exposure include ingestion dermal contact and inhalation lee et al 2017 as cyanotoxins have been identified in aerosols generated by lakes olson et al 2020 habs have resulted in the deaths of humans pets wildlife and livestock carmichael 2001a carmichael et al 2001b though human exposure to cyanotoxins rarely reaches lethal levels and more commonly results in short and long term health effects carmichael 2001a however some cyanotoxins have the potential to be used as chemical weapons due to their ubiquity and high toxicity van der merwe 2015 sierra and martínez álvarez 2019 cyanotoxins include cytotoxins dermatotoxins hepatotoxins and neurotoxins with the most common cyanotoxins being in the latter two categories hepatotoxins produced by habs include cylindrospermopsins microcystins mcs and nodularins which are produced by species within the genera anabaena cylindrospermopsis hapalosiphon microcystis nodularia nostoc and oscillitoria carmichael 1992 ohtani et al 1992 1997 hepatotoxins damage the liver and can lead to effects including hepatotoxicosis and hepatoenteritis charmichael 2001a neurotoxins produced by habs include anatoxins domoic acids and saxitoxins which are produced by species within the genera anabaena aphanizomenon oscillatoria and trichodesmium carmichael 1992 1997 neurotoxins damage nerve tissue and can lead to effects including muscle spasms muscle paralysis cyanosis and death carmichael 2001a testai et al 2016 however these classifications do not imply that effects are confined to only one bodily system for instance human exposure to cylindrospermopsins can also detrimentally impact the kidneys lungs spleen and intestines poniedziałek et al 2012 organic compounds in natural systems can undergo a variety of attenuation pathways such as hydrolysis sorption to soils and sediments bioaccumulation biotransformation and photochemical transformation schwarzenbach et al 2017 there are two main pathways for photochemical transformations in surface waters direct photolysis and sensitized photolysis direct photolysis occurs through the absorption of light by a compound resulting in its degradation packer et al 2003 latch et al 2005 werner et al 2005 guerard et al 2009 matamoros et al 2009 the second pathway sensitized photolysis refers to the degradation of a compound via reactions with reactive intermediates ris which are produced through the absorption of light by photosensitizers vione et al 2014 in natural systems the primary photosensitizer is typically dissolved organic matter dom rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 these photogenerated ris include reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 blough and zeep 1995 zhang et al 2014 reactive halogen species rhs parker et al 2016a parker et al 2016b and carbonate radicals vione et al 2014 as well as excited triplet states formed from the absorption of light by dissolved organic matter 3dom canonica 2007 wenk et al 2011 yan and song 2014a mckay et al 2016 jin et al 2018 or photosynthetic pigments tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 robertson et al 1999 gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 kaminski et al 2013 further considerations when assessing photodegradation pathways are the spectral irradiance of sunlight and the attenuation of different spectra in natural waters uva 315 400 nm and photosynthetically active radiation 400 700 nm par penetrate further than uvb 280 315 nm leading to these spectra possibly contributing more to overall photodegradation than uvb despite a greater degradation rate typically being attributed to the uvb spectrum due its greater energy wörmer et al 2010 dissolved organic carbon doc can be used to predict par and uvr attenuation with the attenuation depth of par being between 0 5 20 m depending on the water s turbidity compared with a range of a few centimeters to approximately 5 m for the uva and uvb spectra morris et al 1995 bukaveckas and robbins forbes 2000 median depths for uva and uvb penetration were found to be 0 75 m and 0 45 m in a study that assessed eighty five lakes in the adirondacks of new york bukaveckas and robbins forbes 2000 whether cyanotoxins are intra or extracellular is also impactful when assessing their photodegradation while intracellular cyanotoxins and other cell metabolites can be shielded from light exposure due to the presence of light absorbing and or screening compounds garcia pichel and castenholz 1993 ehling schulz et al 1997 when an hab is actively producing cells the distribution of the cyanotoxin depends on the age of the bloom chiswell et al 1999 in younger blooms a greater amount of the cyanotoxin is found intracellularly while in older blooms a greater amount is found dissolved within the water column primarily due to cell lysis releasing the toxin chiswell et al 1999 subsequently even if the number of live cyanobacterial cells are decreasing towards the end of a hab episode toxins may still be present in high concentrations chiswell et al 1999 the age of the bloom also has implications for dom composition and photoreactivity as cellular material contributes to the pool of dom present there are four distinct growth phases for algal cells lag phase exponential phase early stationary phase and late stationary phase extracellular doc concentrations increase throughout these phases resulting in changes in fluorescence characteristics photoreactive species concentrations and quantum yields tenorio et al 2017 furthermore extracellular dom edom is more photolabile and has more heterogeneous optical properties than intracellular dom idom bittar et al 2015 with idom exhibiting distinct phycobiliprotein fluorescence at 500 650 nm korak et al 2015 the differing photochemical characteristics in edom and idom may result in the shifting importance of ris and subsequent photodegradation pathways throughout the course of a hab as the dom pool s makeup changes over time during cell lysis the contents of cyanobacterial cells are released allowing for cyanotoxins to be present with other cell components such as algal pigments in the water column some of the most prominent pigments in cyanobacteria are phycobiliproteins such as phycocyanin and phycoerythrin however other pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids may be present oliver et al 2012 the aforementioned phycobiliproteins are soluble in water and absorb light in the environmentally relevant spectrum singh et al 2009 whitton 2012 zhao et al 2019 the absorption maxima of some relevant algal pigments are presented in table 1 phycoerythrin and phycocyanin have been shown to be photosensitizers capable of producing 1o2 in engineered systems at high fluence bei et al 2002 but studies have also suggested that they may be photosensitizers in natural conditions tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 song et al 2007 phycoerythrin is also known to produce excited states when exposed to a range of wavelengths including uvb xue et al 2005 the nexus between climate change s impacts on habs and surface water chemistry also warrants discussion future impacts of climate change such as changes in temperature and light regimes earlier stratification and later destratification of large bodies of water changes in precipitation patterns and increased salinization due to longer periods of drought are proposed to support the growth of habs and further expand the areas in which they occur reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 gehringer and wannicke 2014 these impacts are also predicted to alter the photochemistry of surface waters along with other climate change impacts such as water browning in boreal lakes changes to the alkalinity of waters in temperate regions and shorter periods of ice cover de laurentiis et al 2014 vione and scozzaro 2019 these changes could increase the amount of direct and sensitized photodegradation that occurs at various times of the year as well as alter the steady state concentrations of ris such as 3dom 1o2 and oh that are relevant to the photodegradation of cyanotoxins vione et al 2019 wasswa et al 2020 these predicted impacts on habs and surface water chemistry synergize to suggest that the photodegradation of cyanotoxins will likely increase in importance over time 1 1 scope of this review this review will address the photochemical fate of cyanotoxins in surface waters many cyanotoxins have been left out of this paper due to a lack of literature on their photodegradation given the global occurrence of habs and the drinking water concerns associated with them photodegradation rates and pathways will be compiled and discussed in order to identify the relative significance of photodegradation pathways that need to be accounted for when assessing habs during transit from hab hotspots to downstream drinking water intakes toxin attenuation via photodegradation may be significant depending on environmental conditions and the toxin present possible transformation products will also be discussed relevant experimental data such as degradation rates quantum yields and rate coefficients from the referenced literature has been compiled in table si 1 the photochemistry of cyanotoxins in engineered systems has been reviewed by others he et al 2016 schneider and bláha 2020 and will not be discussed 2 anatoxins anatoxins include anatoxin a atx homoanatoxin a htx anatoxin a s also known as guanitoxin fiore et al 2020 2 3 2

are produced by benthic and planktonic freshwater cyanobacteria osswald et al 2007 with anatoxin a being the only compound in this class whose photochemical fate in natural waters has received research attention due to anatoxin a s not being produced by the genus anabaena and fundamental differences in structures of anatoxin a s and atx fiore et al 2020 have suggested renaming anatoxin a s to guanitoxin the authors of this paper support this proposal and note that due to the structural differences in the molecules the photodegradation pathways of atx and gaunitoxin are likely to be dissimilar atx is a bicyclic secondary amine alkaloid 2 acetyl 9 azabicyclo 4 2 1 non 2 ene with a molecular weight of 165 23 g mol 1 devlin et al 1977 due to atx s pka of 9 36 0 06 koskinen and rapoport 1985 it will be protonated in most surface waters although atx s maximum absorption at 227 nm fig 1 james et al 1998 is outside the environmentally relevant spectrum it does absorb light in the uvb spectrum with htx having a similar uv absorption spectrum in the literature atx has been shown to undergo direct and sensitized photolysis stevens and krieger 1991 al momani 2007 afzal et al 2010 kaminski et al 2013 2 1 direct photolysis of anatoxins anatoxin a has been shown to undergo direct photolysis following first order degradation kinetics when exposed to sunlight stevens and krieger 1991 atx s degradation rate is independent of oxygen concentration and shows a positive correlation with ph and light intensity stevens and krieger 1991 suggesting that as atx deprotonates it becomes more susceptible to direct photolysis the half life of atx in sunlight is between 1 and 2 h at ph 6 and between 96 min and 330 min at ph 9 stevens and krieger 1991 it should be noted that this decay rate is faster than measured non photochemical degradation rates stevens and krieger 1991 light in the uvb spectrum is the main contributor of this photodegradation with atx concentrations being reduced by 82 and 84 after 1 hour of uvb irradiation 36 µmol m 2s 1 at ph 7 0 and 9 5 respectively alternatively 5 h of par irradiation 1500 µmol m 2s 1 at the same ph levels yielded no significant degradation kaminski et al 2013 this is in line with atx s absorption peak at 227 nm which then trails off with minor absorption in the uvb region james et al 1998 the direct photolysis quantum yields of atx at concentrations of 0 6 and 1 8 mg l over the wavelength range of 200 to 300 nm were measured as 0 15 and 0 05 respectively afzal et al 2010 this decrease in direct photolysis quantum yield with increasing atx concentration is suggested to be due to an increase in the formation of intermediates which can compete with atx for light absorption afzal et al 2010 alternatively this observation could also be explained by self quenching or back reduction however the applicability of these quantum yields to natural systems is questionable due to the irradiation spectra primarily falling in the uvc spectrum which is not relevant in natural systems photolysis of atx in sunlight produces products with the same molecular weight suggesting reaction pathways that lead to the formation of rearrangement products involving bridgehead positions stevens and krieger 1991 these transformation products were found to have a lower toxicity than atx stevens and krieger 1991 expanding on this work kaminski et al 2013 found that three degradation products were formed through uvb degradation one is likely an htx homologue one is thought to be hemiacetal and one results from atx hydration 2 2 sensitized photolysis of anatoxins there is also evidence that sensitized photolysis can contribute to the degradation of atx onstad et al 2007 afzal et al 2010 kaminski et al 2013 the second order rate constant between atx and oh was measured to be 3 0 0 02 109m 1s 1 at ph 7 by onstad et al 2007 and 5 2 0 3 109m 1s 1 in the ph range 4 5 9 5 by afzal et al 2010 this rate constant is independent of temperature and initial atx concentration afzal et al 2010 it should be noted that these values were measured using engineered systems relying on light spectra outside the range found in natural sunlight e g vacuum ultraviolet vuv afzal et al 2010 and oh formation through ozone decomposition onstad et al 2007 however the contribution of specific reactive intermediates to atx s sensitized photolysis in natural water matrices and possible reaction pathways have yet to be fully evaluated research has shown that phycocyanin may act as a photosensitizer for atx as atx degraded 7 an approximate half life of 2 days assuming first order kinetics when exposed to red light 620 nm 100 µmol m 2s 1 in the presence of phycocyanin for 5 h at ph 3 5 7 0 and 9 5 kaminski et al 2013 other possible photosensitizers such as dom have not been explored 3 cylindrospermopsins cylindrospermopsins are hepatotoxins with cylindrospermopsin cyn containing a hydroxylmethyl uracil moiety bridged to a tricyclic alkaloid moiety ohtani et al 1992 and having a molecular weight of 415 43 g mol 1 there are five known naturally occurring cylindrospermopsins cylindrospermopsin 7 epi cylindrospermopsin 7 epi cyn 7 deoxy cylindrospermopsin 7 deoxy cyn 7 deoxy desulfo cylindrospermopsin 7 deoxy desulfo 12 acetylcylindrospermopsin ohtani et al 1992 norris et al 1999 banker et al 2000 wimmer et al 2014 7 deoxy cyn is suggested to be a precursor to cyn and 7 epi cyn during their biosynthesis mazmouz et al 2011 although it has been detected as a major metabolite of lyngbya wollei cyanobacterium seifert et al 2007 cylindrospermopsins are produced by benthic and planktonic freshwater cyanobacteria which have been found on every continent except antarctica de la cruz et al 2013 cyn absorbs light in the uv spectrum with maximum absorption at 262 nm and minimal absorption occurring in the uva and uvb spectra sano et al 2008 merel et al 2010 cyn has an estimated pka of 8 8 onstad et al 2007 although the pka of the sulfate group in cyn is 1 92 and the arginine in the tricyclic guanidine group has a pka of 12 chen et al 2015 3 1 direct photolysis of cylindrospermopsins no significant amount of degradation has been observed when cyn is exposed to sunlight chiswell et al 1999 song et al 2012 par chiswell et al 1999 wörmer et al 2010 adamski et al 2016 or 350 nm light chen et al 2015 when exposed to uvb light 36 µmol m 2s 1 at neutral ph cyn has a half life of 69 h alternatively at ph 10 and 12 cyn has half lives of 7 and 5 h respectively adamski et al 2016 these observations can be explained by the deprotonation of cyn that likely occurs at ph 8 8 onstad et al 2007 six decomposition products are formed when cyn is exposed to uvb irradiation at ph 10 and 12 five unnamed compounds and 7 epi cyn adamski et al 2016 these products are formed primarily through alterations to the tricyclic guanidine moiety while the epimer 7 epi cyn has the hydroxyl group at c 7 shifted from an r to an s configuration since the conditions necessary to form these compounds are unlikely to be found in natural waters we refer the reader to adamski et al 2016 for a discussion of proposed reaction pathways 3 2 sensitized photoylsis of cylindrospermopsins like atx cyn is also susceptible to sensitized photolysis with multiple photosensitizers playing a role in cyn degradation and half lives of 11 and 15 days being observed in natural water samples exposed to natural sunlight chiswell et al 1999 cyn primarily undergoes oh mediated sensitized photolysis with a second order rate constant of 5 08 0 16 x 109 song et al 2012 transformations initiated by oh account for approximately 70 of cyn degradation in natural waters song et al 2012 primarily due to reactive intermediates such as 3dom and 1o2 playing less significant roles in the degradation of cyn wörmer et al 2010 song et al 2012 degradation pathways initiated by oh mediated sensitized photolysis include the hydroxylation of the uracil ring alcoholic oxidation of the hydroxylmethyl group and elimination of the sulfate group from the tricyclic alkaloid moiety song et al 2012 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b adamski et al 2016 oh addition at c5 of the carbon carbon c5 c6 double bond in the uracil ring forms a monohydroxylated product p431 which can further undergo oxidation to form the corresponding ketone product p429 song et al 2012 he et al 2014 oh addition at c6 of the c5 c6 double bond is a less favorable reaction pathway and likely leads to oxidative cleavage of the uracil ring to form other uncharacterized ring opening products song et al 2012 furthermore oh addition across the c5 c6 bond may produce dihydroxylated products that undergo further oxidation to form a pyrimidinetrione product p447 which may undergo ring cleavage to form cylindrospermopsic acid p349 p349 can undergo subsequent decarboxylation hydroxylation and oxidation to form a carboxylic acid product p319 song et al 2012 he et al 2014 oh addition to the urea group in the uracil ring forms a ring opening product p374 although this pathway has not been fully studied song et al 2012 he et al 2014 oh addition to the tricyclic alkaloid moiety may form multiple monohydroxylated isomers p431 following h abstraction alpha to nitrogen atoms in the guanidine group or to the sulfate group song et al 2012 he et al 2014 further hydroxylation produces additional di and trihydroxylated products that can undergo oxidation to form the corresponding ketone products he et al 2014 on the other hand h abstraction from the hydroxylmethyl group forms the corresponding ketone product p413 song et al 2012 he et al 2014 while h abstraction at the tertiary c12 with subsequent oxidation forms a desulfated ketone product p334 he et al 2014 the pigments found within c raciborskii cells phycocyanin and chlorophyll a may also play roles in the photochemical degradation of cyn degradation rates of cyn are seemingly dependent on the concentration of cyn and algal extracts suggesting second order kinetics in the presence of c raciborskii algal extracts cyn half lives in sunlight were 1 5 h in algal extracts containing 4 mg l cyn compared to 3 4 h in algal extracts containing 1 mg l cyn chiswell et al 1999 in natural waters taken from two separate reservoirs cyn s half life was found to be 11 and 15 days in natural sunlight chiswell et al 1999 though the authors do not provide any water quality data for these waters beyond stating that they contained natural amounts of plant pigments however no changes to cyn s degradation rate were observed in the presence of phycocyanin when exposed to red light 620 nm by adamski et al 2016 although phycocyanin s maximum absorption occurs at 620 nm it also has other absorption peaks at 550 nm 350 nm and 280 nm with these wavelengths absorbing approximately 60 17 and 30 of the light absorbed at 620 nm respectively zhao et al 2019 algal extracts of c raciborskii can contain the pigments chlorophyll a phycocyanin and carotenoids bonilla et al 2012 beamud et al 2016 therefore the lack of photodegradation in cyn observed by adamski et al 2016 could be a result of another pigment being responsible for the photosensitization of cyn or 620 nm light not having sufficient energy to induce excited states for phycocyanin chlorophyll a has absorption maxima at 429 nm and 661 nm table 1 porra et al 1989 and can produce excited singlet and triplet states which can go on to form ros including 1o2 ballatori et al 2013 subsequently it may be responsible for the cyn photodegradation observed in algal extract solutions although chlorophyll pigments are insoluble in water and have not been explored in depth as photosensitizers in aquatic systems phycocyanin has been shown to produce triplet states that can photosensitize other cyanotoxins when exposed to 350 nm light song et al 2007 but it is unclear if higher wavelengths have the same potential in the presence of doc and algal extracts cyn degraded 27 3 over 22 days in full sunlight 20 6 when exposed to par and uva and no degradation was observed when only exposed to par wörmer et al 2010 suggesting that uva irradiation plays the biggest role in the sensitized photodegradation of cyn followed by uvb comparatively when exposed to full sunlight at a depth of 1 m in the same solution cyn degraded 10 8 and at 4 m no degradation was observed wörmer et al 2010 the specific contributions of reactive intermediates that may have been present in solution e g 3dom 1o2 pigments in excited states were not explored by wörmer et al 2010 4 domoic acids domoic acid da is a neurotoxin consisting of a carboxymethyl proline ring and a conjugated diene side chain 2 4 hexadienoic acid it is primarily produced by marine toxigenic diatom species from the genus pseudo nitzschia bates 2000 da contains four groups that can protonate three carboxylic acids and one imino group giving it four pka s 1 85 4 47 4 75 and 10 60 walter et al 1992 subsequently in natural waters all three carboxylic acids will be deprotonated while the imino group will remain protonated da has a maximum absorption at 243 nm with very minimal absorption occurring in the 275 375 nm range falk et al 1989 bouillon et al 2008 4 1 direct photolysis of domoic acids studies suggest that direct photolysis is a contributing factor to the degradation of da bates et al 2003 bouillon et al 2006 bouillon et al 2008 while some argue that direct photolysis is a relatively minor contribution to the photodegradation of da fisher et al 2006 jin et al 2018 when exposed to sunlight da undergoes exponential decay bates et al 2003 bouillon et al 2006 2008 with photodegradation rates between da in di water and seawater not varying significantly suggesting a direct photochemical degradation pathway bates et al 2003 bouillon et al 2006 rates of measured da photodegradation in seawater vary slightly ranging from 64 degradation after 22 h exposure to simulated sunlight approximate half life of 34 h bates et al 2003 to 79 degradation after 10 h exposure to simulated sunlight approximate half life of 4 h bouillon et al 2006 similarly the photodegradation quantum yields for da in di water are equal to or greater than those in seawater bouillon et al 2006 for 366 0 280 0 nm da photodegradation quantum yields range from 0 037 0 200 in di water and 0 032 0 163 for seawater with quantum yields decreasing as wavelength increases bouillon et al 2006 temperature has been shown to have a slight impact on the photodegradation rate coefficient of da as it increases from 0 12 h 1 at 5 c to 0 15 h 1 at 20 c bouillon et al 2006 the relatively small impact of temperature on photodegradation rates suggests that reaction pathways for the photodegradation of da have minimal activation energies uvb radiation is the most effective radiation band when it comes to da photodegradation however due to the greater intensity of uva irradiance in sunlight uva radiation is estimated to account for approximately 90 of da photodegradation near the sea surface compared to 9 for uvb radiation with 330 nm light contributing the most to overall photodegradation bouillon et al 2006 bouillon et al 2006 estimate that between 1 7 and 3 5 of dissolved da in the top 5 m of the water column undergoes photodegradation daily the photolysis of da with sunlight primarily produces three products which are geometrical isomers of da isodomoic acids d e and f bouillon et al 2008 also known as 2 z 4 z da 2 e 4 e da and 2 e 4 z da respectively over the course of irradiation steady state concentrations of da and the photoproduced isomers are reached within 10 to 24 h with isodomoic acid e having the greatest abundance followed by da isodomoic acid f and isodomoic acid d bouillon et al 2008 the produced isodomoic acids can undergo further photodegradation producing decarboxylated derivatives or isomers with unconjugated double bonds bouillon et al 2008 the production rates of these isomers are dependent on da concentration and isomer concentrations are further impacted by the aforementioned photodegradation reactions resulting in an initial net increase in the concentration of isodomoic acids when da concentrations are high followed by a net decrease in their concentrations as da concentrations decrease bouillon et al 2008 4 2 sensitized photolyis of domoic acids dom rhs and fe iii have all been shown to be relevant photosensitizers for da bates et al 2003 fisher et al 2006 jin et al 2018 however these results are disputed by bouillon et al 2006 who found that dom dissolved oxygen trace metals cu ii and fe iii and ph in the range 4 7 do not impact da photodegradation rates bouillon et al 2006 in a halide free solution jin et al 2018 found that the reactive species contributing to the photodegradation of da can be ranked as follows oh 43 9 3dom electron transfer 22 6 direct photolysis 19 1 3dom energy transfer 18 3 alternatively in halide containing solutions this shifts to 3dom energy transfer 40 9 halogen radicals 20 5 oh 19 4 direct photolysis 11 9 3dom electron transfer 6 0 as a result of the ionic strength effect promoting 3dom induced photo isomerization parker et al 2013 energy transfer from 3dom to the conjugated diene moiety of da promotes the formation of its 2 z 4 z 2 e 4 e and 2 e 4 z geometrical isomers all of which may undergo decarboxylation to form a series of decarboxylated isomers p267 bouillon et al 2008 gagez et al 2017 besides this sensitized isomerization pathway zepp et al 1985 da reacts with 3dom via 1 2 h shift decarboxylation and h transfer pathways to form various other transformation products tps jin et al 2018 for example electron transfer from the n atom in the proline ring of da to 3dom initiates 1 2 h shift and addition of oxygen to generate peroxyl radicals which undergo either intramolecular h abstraction to form pyrroline products p309 or bimolecular decay through unstable tetraoxide intermediates i e russell mechanism russell 1957 von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 to form pyrrolidinol products p327 jin et al 2018 electron transfer between 3dom and the carboxylic acid group on the proline ring of da initiates decarboxylation and oxygen addition to generate a decarboxylated peroxyl radical which undergoes bimolecular decay to form pyrrolidone and pyrrolidinol products p281 and p283 jin et al 2018 h transfer from 3dom to the conjugated diene moiety of da followed by oxygen addition generates side chain peroxyl radicals which subsequently undergo bimolecular decay to form multiple ketone products p327 jin et al 2018 1o2 and oh have also been shown to contribute to the sensitized photolysis of da jin et al 2018 jaramillo et al 2020 and form tps different from those resulting from reactions with 3dom oh addition to the conjugated diene moiety of da forms isomeric 1 2 and 1 4 diol intermediate products p345 further oxidative cleavage of the 1 2 diol products forms the corresponding ketone and aldehyde products p215 and p241 p215 can undergo decarboxylation at the proline ring to form a pyrroline product p169 while p241 can undergo either hydroxylation at the conjugated diene side chain to form a dihydroxylated product p275 or 3dom mediated 1 2 h shift on the proline ring to form pyrrolidinol products p257 unlike the 1 2 diol products the 1 4 diol product forms pyrrolidinol products p361 through 3dom mediated 1 2 h shift which may further undergo 3dom mediated decarboxylation at the proline ring to form decarboxylated products p315 and p317 jin et al 2018 alternatively the pathways involving 1o2 reacting with da primarily consist of 2 2 cycloaddition and ene reactions both of which occur at the z double bond in the conjugated diene moiety of the molecule jaramillo et al 2020 since these products both involve the elimination of the diene moiety which has been suggested to play a role in da s toxicity singlet oxygenation appears to be relevant for the detoxification of da jaramillo et al 2020 a diels alder reaction pathway which produces an endoperoxide product p343 has also been proposed although this has only been suggested through experiments where sorbic acid was used as a model compound for da parekh 2012 the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction between da and 1o2 has been measured as 5 1 105m 1s 1 with an associated half life of between 5 and 63 days jaramillo et al 2020 in the presence of halides da s photodegradation increases jin et al 2018 and forms unique tps parker and mitch 2016 jin et al 2018 for instance h abstraction by halogen radicals at the tertiary carbon between the conjugated diene and the carboxylic acid on the side chain followed by hydroperoxyl radical addition forms a unique organic peroxide product p343 similarly h abstraction at the side chain and the proline ring followed by decarboxylation and hydroperoxyl radical addition forms two other organic peroxide products p299 jin et al 2018 the observed quantum yields for da photodegradation suggest that the importance of rhs is clbr cl2 br2 parker and mitch 2016 fe iii has also been shown to contribute to the photodegradation of da in freshwater and saltwater environments bates et al 2003 fisher et al 2006 which is suggested to be due to ligand to metal charge transfer degradation pathways fisher et al 2006 in di water solutions with fe iii da completely degrades within 24 h when exposed to simulated sunlight alternatively in seawater approximately 80 degradation occurs bates et al 2003 this difference in degradation is suggested to be due to salts present in seawater inhibiting the photodegradation of da in some way bates et al 2003 but this has yet to be fully elucidated similar studies have shown that the presence of po4 3 inhibits the degradation of da through fe iii photosensitized pathways due to po4 3 having a greater association constant k with fe iii than da estimated k of 1 72 1011 for fe iii and da and k of 1040 for fe iii and po4 3 resulting in the photodegradation rate of da decreasing up to a factor of 15 in the presence of po4 3 fisher et al 2006 5 microcystins microcystins are hepatotoxins produced by multiple genera including planktonic and benthic species and can be found on all continents buratti et al 2017 zaki et al 2020 mcs are monocyclic heptapeptides consisting of three d amino acids two characteristic amino acids i e n methyldehydroalanine mdha and 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl 4 e 6 e decadienoic acid adda and two variable l amino acids which are denoted in the abbreviations for different varieties i e mc lr mc rr etc botes et al 1984 1985 while mdha and adda are the most common amino acids found in mcs there are variations in these two functional groups bouaïcha et al 2019 currently there are over 300 known mc variants as a result of the seven functional groups that can vary in the molecule jones et al 2020 fig 4 bouaïcha et al 2019 showcases the variability in mc structures not including 30 new structures that have been recently discovered mc lr has three pka s 2 09 2 19 and 12 48 de maagd et al 1999 at neutral ph the carboxylic acids in two of the d amino acids present in mc lr are deprotonated with the l amino acid arginine containing an amino group which remains protonated all known mc variants contain a carboxylic acid group in the d masp or d aspamino acids twelve do not contain the carboxylic acid group in the d gluamino acid and 106 contain an l amino acid other than arginine bouaïcha et al 2019 therefore these pka values may apply to many other mc variants most mc producing cyanobacteria are primarily found in freshwater environments although they have been reported in marine environments as well van apeldoorn et al 2007 with mc producing blooms recorded in 79 countries harke et al 2016 mc lr and mc rr are the most common and most frequently studied mcs although the most abundant congener varies depending on the cyanobacterial strains present and environmental conditions buratti et al 2017 díez quijada et al 2019 photodegradation has been shown to not be significantly different between different mcs welker and steinberg 1999 song et al 2007 and once extracellular mcs have been shown to persist for between 2 and 4 weeks in freshwater environments jones and orr 1994 lahti et al 1997 5 1 direct photolysis of microcystins direct photolysis is not a significant degradation pathway that is recognized for mcs as mc lr mc yr and mc rr do not degrade when exposed to sunlight welker and steinberg 1999 parker et al 2016 this is expected as mc lr s peak absorption is approximately 239 nm with virtually no absorption occurring at wavelengths above approximately 270 nm harada et al 1990 chintalapati and mohseni 2020 other studies have further confirmed a lack of direct photolysis degradation pathways for mc lr specifically tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 welker and steinberg 2000 gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 5 2 sensitized photolysis of microcystins mcs mainly undergo sensitized photolysis in the presence of dom via pathways mediated by 3dom and oh tsuji et al 1994 1995 kaya and sano 1998 welker and steinberg 1999 2000 wörmer et al 2010 yan et al 2014b parker et al 2016 sun et al 2018 with phycocyanin also contributing to mc photodegradation tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 the presence of iron iii and nitrate are reported to not impact mc photodegradation rates parker and mitch 2016 par uva and uvb spectra all contribute to the degradation of mcs wörmer et al 2010 however par and uva contribute the most to mc photodegradation due to their greater intensity in the solar spectrum vähätalo et al 2000 wörmer et al 2010 in dom enhanced solutions oh and 1o2 accounted for 13 0 and 2 2 of mc lr loss respectively suggesting that 3dom mediated pathways are the most significant yan et al 2014b welker and steinberg 1999 found that mc variants degrade anywhere from 44 to 55 after 8 h of sunlight exposure in the presence of humic substances with degradation efficiency not being impacted by the concentration of humic substances the pseudo first order degradation rates of mcs increase by a factor of 3 in the presence of nom parker et al 2016 and 3 4 in the presence of fulvic acids welker and steinberg 1999 see table si 1 the photodegradation rate of mc lr also increases as ph decreases which is suggested to be a result of alkaline conditions deprotonating functional groups within dom and mcs increasing repulsive forces between the molecules yan et al 2014b for sensitized photolysis of mc lr energy transfer from 3dom is the predominant pathway and promotes the sensitized isomerization of mc lr to form its 4 e 6 z adda5 geometrical isomer also known as 6 z adda5 mc lr tsuji et al 1994 song et al 2007 yan et al 2014b the isomerization to form 6 z adda mc lr is reversible with mc lr being the more geometrically stable molecule yan et al 2014b hydroxyl radical can potentially react with mcs at four major sites the benzene ring the conjugated diene group the methoxy group in the adda amino acid and the carbon carbon double bond in the mdha amino acid song et al 2009 antoniou et al 2008a hydroxyl radical addition to the benzene ring in the adda moiety forms ortho para and meta monohydroxylated products e g p1011 and potentially dihydroxylated products e g p1027 antoniou et al 2008a 2008b song et al 2009 he et al 2015 hydroxyl radical addition to the conjugated diene forms isomeric 1 2 and 1 4 diol products e g p1029 which may undergo further hydroxylation to form tetrahydroxylated products liu et al 2003 antoniou et al 2008a 2008b song et al 2009 zong et al 2013 hydroxyl radical addition to the conjugated diene also leads to the oxidative cleavage of the double bond or the 1 2 diol intermediate to form the corresponding ketone aldehyde and eventually hydroxyl products e g p834 p794 and p782 liu et al 2003 antoniou et al 2008a zong et al 2013 he et al 2015 h abstraction at the methoxy carbon atom followed by oxygen addition generates mc peroxyl radicals which may undergo bimolecular decay through the russell mechanism russell 1957 von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 to form formic acid ester mc derivatives that are susceptible to further oxidation to form a demethoxylated product e g p965 antoniou et al 2008a hydroxyl radical addition to the cc double bond in the mdha moiety to form dihydroxylated products is a less favorable pathway due to the competing reactions at the adda moiety and steric hindrance antoniou et al 2008a alkalinity has been shown to reduce the sensitized photolysis of mcs likely due to the scavenging of oh he et al 2012 chintalapati and mohseni 2020 besides oh mediated pathways photohydration at the enone group in the mdha moiety can lead to the formation of a β hydroxyl ketone product he et al 2015 the presence of halides also contributes to mc photodegradation in sunlight with particular importance being noted once halide concentrations reach 40 of typical seawater concentrations parker et al 2016 the uva and uvb spectra were noted to be the sole contributors to rhs mc photodegradation parker et al 2016 due to rhs likely being generated by aromatic ketone sensitizers which absorb light primarily in these spectra loeff et al 1993 when halides are present at concentrations similar to seawater i e 540 mm nacl and 0 8 mm nabr mc lr and mc yr photodegradation increases by a factor of 3 parker et al 2016 as halide concentrations increased along an estuarine transect by a factor of 5 the indirect photodegradation quantum yield of mc lr increased from 0 6 10 6 mol mol photon to 4 2 10 6 mol mol photon table si 1 parker et al 2016 in natural water samples at a depth of 0 2 m calculated mc lr half lives decreased from 9 d to 2 d as halide concentrations increased from 103 mm cl and 0 12 mm br to 423 mm cl and 0 66 mm br parker et al 2016 similarly at a depth of 2 m calculated mc lr half lives decreased from 80 d to 14 d as halide concentrations increased consequently mc concentrations are expected to decrease by between 56 and 99 994 when travelling 5 km in freshwater estuarine streams for flowrates between 6 m3 s to 0 5 m3 s respectively parker et al 2016 the ionic strength effect induced by the presence of halides which increased the importance of 3dom energy transfer pathways in da photodegradation jin et al 2018 was not observed in mc lr and mc yr parker and mitch 2016 these seemingly conflicting observations are thought to be a result of the diene moiety in mcs being near the microcystin ring inhibiting the 3dom energy transfer pathways that target the conjugated diene moiety parker and mitch 2016 jin et al 2018 phycocyanin has also been shown to be a relevant photosensitizer for mcs including mc lr mc rr and mc lf tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 song et al 2007 with mc lr s degradation following pseudo first order kinetics with a half life of 120 24 min when exposed to 350 50 nm light 20 µw cm 2 in the presence of phycocyanin song et al 2007 up to 20 of the protein in cyanobacteria can be phycocyanins with the ratio of mcs to phycocyanins being approximately 0 7 weight percentage song et al 2007 the phototransformation rate of mc lr increases as phycocyanin concentrations increase but plateaus once phycocyanin concentrations reach 250 340 mg l due to increased light attenuation gajdek et al 2004 song et al 2007 increases in ph lead to a decrease in the first order rate constants of mc lr photosensitized transformation in the presence of phycocyanin song et al 2007 at neutral ph the carboxyl groups in mc lr and phycocyanin will be deprotonated leading to an increase in electrostatic repulsive forces this is similar to the effect that ph has in 3dom mediated photolysis of mcs yan et al 2014b that was previously discussed a comparison of reported first order reaction rate coefficients is presented in table 6 while both dom and phycocyanin have been shown to be photosensitizers for mcs due to variability in dom makeup dom concentration and phycocyanin concentration in natural systems it is difficult to quantify the exact significance of each sensitizer there is primarily one byproduct formed during phycocyanin mediated photodegradation of mc lr the isomer 6 z adda mc lr that is formed through energy transfer to the diene moiety in the adda portion of mc lr song et al 2007 this is a result of intersystem crossing isc forming an excited triplet state of phycocyanin which can result in the triplet diene undergoing isomerization from the e to the z isomer song et al 2007 excited state phycocyanin may also transfer an electron to oxygen forming the superoxide radical which can protonate to form the hydroperoxide radical or transfer energy to oxygen forming singlet oxygen robertson et al 1999 hydroperoxide radicals can attack the adda group of mcs forming hydroperoxides which have been shown to be nontoxic robertson et al 1999 1o2 may react with unsaturated bonds on mcs to form peroxides hydroperoxides dioxetanes and carbonyl compounds robertson et al 1999 although results from song et al 2007 suggest that singlet oxygen is likely not involved in the photodegradation of mcs other pigments chlorophyll a β carotene and mixoxanthophyll may also contribute to the degradation of mcs tsuji et al 1994 robertson et al 1999 with degradation rates sharing a positive correlation with pigment concentration as well as being dependent on the pigments present tsuji et al 1994 however the presence of intact cyanobacterial cells decreases mc degradation rates due to light absorption and oh scavenging chintalapati and mohseni 2020 6 nodularins nodularins nods are cyclic pentapeptide hepatotoxins produced by the brackish water filamentous cyanobacterium nodularia spumigena carmichael et al 1988 with 16 known variants jones et al 2020 the nod molecule is similar to microcystin in that both molecules consist of a carbon ring with an attached adda molecule leading to them having similar chemical properties and detection methods van apeldoorn et al 2007 the absorption of nod is similar to that of mc lr with a maximum at 238 nm and minimal absorption in the uvb spectrum due to the conjugated diene in the adda amino acid found in both compounds mazur and pliński 2003 6 1 direct photolysis of nodularins whether nodularin undergoes direct photolysis is up for debate as there is conflicting evidence in the literature twist and codd 1997 found that pure nod is stable when exposed to natural sunlight over a period of 9 days alternatively mazur marzec et al 2006 observed that pure nod photodegraded when exposed to various light sources over 48 h with the following efficiency uvb 6 0 w m 2 uva 6 0 w m 2 vis 6 5 w m 2 due to nod s lack of light absorption in these spectra these results are somewhat surprising especially considering mc lr s similar absorption characteristics and well documented lack of direct photolysis as previously discussed 6 2 sensitized photolysis of nodularins nodularin has been shown to degrade in the presence of n spumigena cell free extracts and whole filaments twist and codd 1997 mazur marzec et al 2006 nod s degradation rate is greatest when in the presence of cell free extracts twist and codd 1997 mazur marzec et al 2006 with cell free filtrate solutions resulting in 95 degradation of nod when exposed to sunlight over 9 d twist and codd 1997 comparatively exposing cells of n spumigena to light over 9 d resulted in intracellular nod concentrations decreasing by approximately 75 of nod due to release of the toxin rather than in vivo photodegradation with sunlight and sunlight minus uv spectra yielding similar results twist and codd 1997 once extracellular nod concentrations decreased to non detectable levels within 24 h with the remaining 25 of intracellular nod remaining constant during this time twist and codd 1997 the increase in degradation once the compounds are extracellular can be attributed to greater uvb exposure as radiation absorbing compounds within cyanobacterial cells can shield the toxin from incoming light xue et al 2005 uva and uvb radiation both contribute to nod degradation however uvb light has been shown to have a greater impact on the degradation rate of nod particularly in the presence of cell free extracts mazur marzec et al 2006 three uvb degradation products of nod have been identified and are thought to be stereoisomers of nod with the primary degradation product being an unknown nod analogue with an absorption maximum at 242 nm mazur marzec et al 2006 twist and codd 1997 suggest that extracellular degradation is likely due to nod degrading enzymes that may be present in the cell free extracts or pigment photosensitized reactions however cell components such as phycocyanin have been shown to promote the sensitized photolysis of cyanotoxins such as cyn and mc lr tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 robertson et al 1999 as previously discussed phycocyanin mediated mc degradation primarily occurs through energy transfer to the diene moiety in the adda portion of the molecule song et al 2007 which could also be relevant for nod photodegradation 7 conclusion the ris 3dom 1o2 and oh have been confirmed as contributors to the photodegradation of all cyanotoxins discussed in this review with the exception of atx and nod the role of 3dom and 1o2 in atx s sensitized photolysis have not been explored and the specific contribution of any ris to nod s photodegradation has also not received any research attention quantum yields and second order rate constants reported in the literature are compiled in tables 6 and 7 known oh mediated reactions with cyanotoxins are nearly diffusion controlled consistent with oh s known high reactivity with water constituents vione et al 2014 triplet state dom mediated isomerization reaction rate constants with da are also quite high alternatively observed reaction rate constants between singlet oxygen and cyanotoxins are approximately half that of 3dom mediated isomerization with da and oh reactions with atx cyn da and mcs specific cyanotoxins such as cylindrospermopsin domoic acid and mc lr have relatively well understood degradation kinetics and mechanisms but the same cannot be said for anatoxins and nodularins as well as other cyn and mc variants while some degradation rates and transformation products for these cyanotoxins have been identified a deeper understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms at play has yet to be achieved observed mc lr photodegradation pathways involving the adda and d asp amino acid moieties could also be relevant for other mc variants as well as nod where these moieties are also present however the impacts of these molecular variations on photodegradation rates and pathways needs to be explored before broad generalizations can be made about their transferability given the predicted increase in habs due to climate change the need for a greater understanding of the fate and transport of other cyanotoxins not discussed in this review such as aplysiatoxins β n methylamino l alanine bmaa lyngbyatoxins and saxitoxins is ever increasing poisonings due to cyanotoxins have steadily increased over the years with literature on the topic following suit merel et al 2013 saxitoxin is well represented in research literature with an estimated 1439 articles published focusing on the cyanotoxin as of 2013 merel et al 2013 but its photochemical fate has not been studied at length the fate of saxitoxins e g saxitoxin neosaxitoxins gonyautotoxins c toxins etc may be of particular interest due to their relatively high toxicity ld50 stx 27 8 nmol kg ld50 neostx 8 9 ld50 dcstx 35 4 nmol kg ld50 gtx 1 4 14 6 nmol kg ld50 gtx 2 3 36 7 nmol kg munday et al 2013 and saxitoxin s possible use as a chemical weapon sierra and martínez álvarez 2019 while the presence of pigments and other cell components have been shown to promote photodegradation twist and codd 1997 chiswell et al 1999 mazur marzec et al 2006 adamski et al 2016 the exact compounds and mechanisms at play have not been fully fleshed out phycocyanin s role as a photosensitizer is well known tsuji et al 1994 chiswell et al 1999 robertson et al 1999 song et al 2007 kaminski et al 2013 but its relative importance for cyanotoxin photodegradation in relation to other pigments and chromophore containing cellular components warrants further

moderate 40 70 and poor 40 removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin which can be possibly attributed to insufficient contact time despite high efficiency of all studied processes for phacs elimination from urban wastewater effluent cwpo seems to be more promising for continuous operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wastewater catalytic wet peroxide oxidation persulfate oxidation micropollutants activated carbon 1 introduction presence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in urban wastewater effluents is attracting significant attention recently which can be explained by the ability of these pollutants even at very low levels to cause biological effects suárez et al 2008 it can be expected that constant discharge of pharmaceutical compounds to the aquatic environment could pose a threat to the aquatic ecosystems françois et al 2015 quinn gagné and blaise 2009 quinn et al 2011 a list of these substances was recently included in the watch list by eu water framework directive eu decision 2018 840 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp are the main barrier preventing the release of pollutants into the receiving water bodies during the secondary wastewater treatment step biological some phacs can be eliminated the tertiary treatment step at conventional urban wastewater treatment plants usually aims at elimination of pathogens turbidity and nutrients hence filtration chlorination as well as uvc disinfection are often used as a tertiary treatment step however commonly applied tertiary treatment processes do not lead to efficient elimination of recalcitrant organic contaminants as a result emerging contaminants are often released to the aquatic environment with urban wastewater effluents gracia lor et al 2012 luo et al 2014 tertiary treatment of urban wastewater aiming at elimination of contaminants of emerging concern cecs pathogens etc is of high interest especially in view of recent eu regulation 2020 741 for wastewater reuse advanced oxidation processes aops can be considered as an alternative option for post treatment of urban wastewater effluents rueda marquez et al 2020 sichel garcia and andre 2011 rizzo agovino et al 2019 huang et al 2020 michael kordatou karaolia and fatta kassinos 2018 rizzo et al 2019 currently aops are extensively studied by many researchers mainly due to non selective behaviour and potential for pollutant oxidation as well as lack of solid waste formation during majority of aops among the different aops catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo and persulfate oxidation processes are of significant promise main advantages of cwpo include absence of sludge generation and possibility to work in a wide ph range wang et al 2016 mainly iron based catalysts are used for cwpo munoz et al 2017 while carbon based catalysts are not so widely studied similarly carbon based materials for the activation of different persulfate salts have been mainly addressed using dyes or phenol as model pollutants wang and wang 2018 accordingly the persulfate activation efficiency by carbonaceous based materials especially metal free is worth further research zhao et al 2017 thus the application of activated carbon as a catalyst for cwpo and persulfates at ambient temperature and pressure is emerging as a technique of significant promise recent studies have demonstrated formation of hydroxyl radicals during decomposition of h2o2 by carbon materials santos et al 2009 rueda márquez et al 2015a rueda márquez et al 2015b to the best of our knowledge there is only one study munoz et al 2017 devoted to post treatment of real urban wastewater effluents by cwpo iron based catalyst aiming at removal of pharmaceutical compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations thus there is an important knowledge gap in application of carbon based catalysts for the elimination of emerging pharmaceutical compounds from real urban wastewater effluents by cwpo and persulfate oxidation at ambient temperature and pressure rueda márquez levchuk and sillanpää 2018 this study aims at taking a step forward

urban wastewater effluents the effect of initial concentration of oxidizing agents h2o2 for cwpo peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds for persulfate oxidation was studied in order to identify optimal reaction conditions leading to highest toc conversion when optimal conditions were established removal of 22 phacs present in real urban wastewater effluents not spiked by cwpo pds gac and pms

can be equivalent to the point of zero charge under certain conditions moreno castilla et al 1995 menendez et al 1995 it was determined by mass titration with 5 wt gac loading in ultrapure water as described in the literature moreno castilla et al 1995 menendez et al 1995 in dark conditions and continuous stirring until the ph of the slurry was stabilized a calibrated ph meter crison glp21 was used for ph measurement 2 4 experimental set up all cwpo pms gac pds gac and gac experiments for urban wastewater treatment were conducted in discontinuous mode using up flow fixed bed reactors at ambient pressure and temperature 20 2 c methacrylate tubes with diameter of 4 5 cm and length of 13 cm were used as reactors fig 1 sm each reactor was charged with 68 825 0 345 g of gac catalyst real urban wastewater effluent 410 ml was placed in glass beaker volume 750 ml and mechanically stirred then the appropriate amount of h2o2 for cwpo pms for pms gac or pds for pds gac was added to the effluent and pumped to the fixed bed reactor using peristaltic pump masterflex adsorption experiments blank reference test were conducted in parallel with catalytic experiments cwpo pms gac pds gac in order to reach similar saturation of gac used for catalytic and adsorption tests the time zero of each experiment was considered when the effluent reached the top of the gac bed experimental set up for cwpo pms gac and pds gac experiments is shown in fig 2 sm residual concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured during all cwpo experiments by means of colorimetric method reported elsewhere eisenberg 1943 persulfate concentration was monitored using spectrophotometric methods according to the protocols proposed in liang et al 2008 wacławek grübel and černík 2015 long term cwpo tests were also performed in order to evaluate the stability of the catalyst using two different experimental set ups the first long term test was conducted using the experimental set up described above and shown in fig 2 sm for this test a model solution consisting of tap water and orange ii initial concentration 500 mg l was continuously pumped flow rate about 20 ml min through the fixed bed reactors during 47 h taking into consideration that the theoretical cod of orange ii model solution was estimated to be about 760 mg l 1 the amount of h2o2 was chosen based on optimum stoichiometric ratio obtained in previous experiments with wastewater effluent no hydrogen peroxide was added in adsorption column cwpo and adsorption tests were performed in parallel the contact time was decreased as compared to experiments with wastewater in order to ensure presence of residual h2o2 in the cwpo effluent concentration of orange ii in water was measured by means of uv visible spectrophotometer jenway 7315 at the wavelength 486 nm taking into account the large amount of catalyst used in this experimental set up it was difficult to reach saturation of gac hence similar tests were performed using smaller amounts of catalyst experimental set up shown in fig 3 sm two up flow fixed bed reactors polystyrene 1 cm diameter 5 cm bed length 22 cm total length filled with 2 g of gac each were used and operated in parallel one for cwpo and one for adsorption model solution except that ph was adjusted to 3 and concentration of h2o2 were similar to these used in the first long term test experiments were performed continuously during 400 min and model solution was pumped through reactors with flow rate of 2 ml min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of operational conditions of cwpo pms gac and pds gac 3 1 1 cwpo the cwpo experiments were conducted at ambient pressure and temperature with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in order to choose the optimal concentration of the oxidant to treat the wastewater effluent performance of the cwpo process with different initial hydrogen peroxide concentrations was evaluated based on toc conversion xtoc calculated as shown in equation 1 while hydrogen peroxide consumption xh2o2 was estimated using equation 2 1 xtoc toc inlet toc outlet toc inlet 100 2 xh2o2 h2o2 inlet h2o2 outlet h2o2 inlet 100 it is well known that concentration of hydrogen peroxide is a critical parameter for cwpo according to pliego et al 2012 the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide required for the complete mineralization of wastewater is 2 125 g per g of cod the initial cod and toc values of wastewater effluent used for cwpo experiments were 49 mg l 1 and 12 3 mg l 1 respectively thus the theoretical stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide was estimated to be about 104 mg l 1 taking into consideration the cod value 49 mg l 1 of the tested wastewater effluent following concentrations of hydrogen peroxide 104 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 stoichiometric 56 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 0 5 stoichiometric 189 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 8 stoichiometric and 1075 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 10 3 stoichiometric were tested results toc conversion and h2o2 consumption profiles are shown in fig 1 as it can be seen from fig 1 a with an initial increase of hydrogen peroxide concentration h2o2 cod from 0 5 to 1 8 stoichiometric the toc conversion increased while when the h2o2 concentration was too high h2o2 cod 10 3 stoichiometric the efficiency of cwpo decreased similar observations have been reported earlier fang et al 2018 and can be explained by the fact that an excess of hydrogen peroxide acts as scavenger of hydroxyl radicals reactions 3 and 4 chou and huang 1999 3 h2o2 ho h2o ho2 4 ho2 ho h2 o2 the highest toc conversion was achieved with initial h2o2 concentrations of 104 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 stoichiometric and 189 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 8 stoichiometric leading to approx 82 and 84 of toc removal respectively obtained results are in agreement with data reported earlier as in most of recent studies devoted to wastewater treatment by cwpo the h2o2 cod or toc ratios were with the range of 0 5 2 rueda márquez levchuk and sillanpää 2018 it should be mentioned that hydrogen peroxide was fully consumed during all cwpo tests fig 1b which is highly beneficial as the presence of h2o2 in effluents even at low concentrations can be possibly toxic for the receiving environment drábková et al 2007 the ph and conductivity values were measured before and after each cwpo test and similar results were obtained for all tested h2o2 cod ratios namely ph increased from 7 6 0 03 initial wastewater effluent to 8 04 0 03 while conductivity raised from 0 9 0 01 ms cm 1 to 1 08 0 04 ms cm 1 the values of ph and conductivity after adsorption test were 8 38 0 01 and 1 13 0 01 ms cm 1 respectively the h2o2 cod ratio 1 stoichiometric was chosen as the optimal among all cwpo tests and used for further experiments although toc conversion was slightly higher at ratio 1 8 stoichiometric however required amount of h2o2 at ratio 1 8 is almost two times higher as compared with ratio 1 while the toc removal is very similar reference blank test in absence of catalyst with 1 stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide was conducted and no changes in toc were observed the adsorption capacity of gac in absence of hydrogen peroxide was relatively high fig 1a as expected due to high gac load in the fixed bed reactor however experiments confirming that chemical oxidation and not sorption takes place when h2o2 is added to the gac column have been performed in our previous study rueda márquez et al 2015b briefly deionized water spiked with 4 chlorophenol and h2o2 was pumped through the gac column mass of catalyst 140 10 g and a stoichiometric amount of chloride ions was detected after treatment confirming that oxidation occurred it should be mentioned that the same gac was used in previous rueda márquez et al 2015b and current study in this sense this gac will promote h2o2 decomposition into reactive oxidizing species ros mainly ho radicals oliveira et al 2004 santos et al 2009 georgi and kopinke 2005 rey et al 2008 this reaction is favoured by surface defects unsaturated sites and basic surface oxygen groups sogs in activated carbons but also by the presence of metallic species mainly fe on their surface domínguez et al 2013b rey et al 2011 santos et al 2009 this latter being very low in the gac used in this study however the vast number of active sites in activated carbons is a disadvantage for the use of h2o2 during cwpo due to the recombination of the ros generated adsorption of organic molecules blocking some of the active sites has demonstrated to favour the overall process making the hydrogen peroxide decomposition more controllable domínguez et al 2013a more evidence about the mechanism during cwpo is presented in the long term test results section 3 3 2 with the characterization of the used gac samples 3 1 2 pds gac and pms gac the pds gac and pms gac experiments were conducted at ambient pressure and temperature with various concentrations of pds or pms in order to choose the optimal concentration of the oxidant to treat the wastewater effluent performance of pds gac and pms gac process with different initial pds or pms concentrations was evaluated based on toc conversion xtoc calculated as shown above in equation 1 while pds consumption xpds or pms consumption xpms was estimated using equation 5 6 5 xpds pds inlet pds outlet pds inlet 100 6 xpms pms inlet pms outlet pms inlet 100 in order to get comparable results with cwpo with h2o2 as an oxidant similar concentrations of persulfates pds pms have been used i e 10 100 1000 mg l 1 results obtained for each system pds gac pms gac are shown in fig 2 where the toc conversion fig 2 a b and the oxidant consumption profiles fig 2 c d are reported in pds gac system similar behaviour on toc conversion was obtained for all the concentrations tested in which 70 conversion was reached at 5 min of contact time regarding pds consumption fig 2 c it should be noted that at 2 5 min all pds has been consumed in fact the pds decomposition decreased as the concentration increased on the other hand pms was practically consumed independently of initial concentration at 1 5 minutes of contact time accordingly pms gac system shows better performance than pds gac as pms is more efficiently decomposed than pds and also shows better toc conversion rates about 72 vs about 69 fig 2 no major changes were detected in ph and conductivity values being similar to that reported on cwpo experiments although at 1000 mg pms l 1 the ph decreased to 5 80 at initial conditions and raised up to 7 98 at the end of the experiments with a conductivity of 1 3 ms cm 1 similar conclusions were obtained in the literature saputra et al 2013 in which authors showed that the ability of activated carbons acs to produce sulfate radicals was much higher in a pms system compared to pds saputra et al 2013 activated carbon ac is an electron transfer mediator in persulfates activation however a non radical activation pathway has also been reported yao et al 2019 which makes difficult to strictly explain activation mechanisms nevertheless the persulfates might be decomposed by the ac surface with the release of organic radicals and sulfate radicals via radical or non radical pathway zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 accordingly it is assumed that as persulfates are decomposed they produce chemical oxidation in some way and major toc mineralization rates can be achieved rather than sorption also taking into account that gac with very low iron content 0 03 wt was used in this study catalytic performance in pds gac or pms gac might be lower zhao et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 these systems have been previously studied by means of dyes yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 and phenol degradation saputra et al 2013 as well as antibiotic metronidazole forouzesh et al 2019 forouzesh ebadi and aghaeinejad meybodi 2019 generally the persulfate gac system shows promising degradation rates for dyes removal however when mineralization rates are analysed in form of toc it reduces its efficacy zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2011 the presence of other organic substances could imply the reduction of active surface sites available for the activation of persulfates and it is of high importance as real effluent was used in the experiments when more specific pollutants are studied for instance antibiotics forouzesh ebadi and aghaeinejad meybodi 2019 forouzesh et al 2019 significantly higher amounts of persulfates 3000 mg l 1 have been used in order to increase the degradation performance by comparison with single adsorption which can agree with our results the persulfates toc ratio 8 6 was selected for further pds gac or pms gac experiments due to i highest toc conversion obtained in pms gac 100 mg l 1 of pms ii comparative purposes in terms of initial oxidant concentration mg l 1 with cwpo which was the most efficient among studied aops 3 2 comparison of cwpo pms gac and pds gac for elimination of phacs from real urban wastewater effluent 3 2 1 occurrence of phacs in urban wastewater influent and effluent composite samples 48 h of urban wastewater influent and effluent were collected for screening and identifying phacs 83 in total see table 1 sm with higher concentrations to be monitored during further post treatment experiments cwpo pms gac pds gac at optimal conditions moreover some phacs the concentrations of which significantly increased after treatment negative removal efficiency were taken into consideration because those would be especially interesting to follow during possible post treatment cwpo pms gac pds gac results are shown in table 1 forty seven out of eighty three analysed phacs were detected in influent and effluent wastewater obtained concentrations of phacs in wastewater influent and effluent table 1 are in agreement with phacs concentration ranges previously reported for influents and effluents of conventional wwtps in different countries luo et al 2014 except for concentrations of acetaminophen in influent diclofenac in effluent and metoprolol in effluent which were slightly higher interestingly concentration of caffeine in wastewater influent measured in this study 492 223 143 239 µg l 1 was significantly higher than caffeine concentrations reported in wastewater influents of various countries 0 22 209 µg l 1 luo et al 2014 this result can be explained by the fact that coffee consumption in finland is among the highest in the world kempf et al 2010 out of all detected phacs only acetaminophen phenylbutazone pravastatin triclocarban tcc and tetracycline were completely removed concentration in effluent was lod after conventional wastewater treatment process high removal efficiency 70 was observed for lincomycin salicylic acid ibuprofen naproxen clofibric acid sparfloxacin and caffeine which is generally in agreement with the removal efficiency for micropollutants reported by luo et al 2014 moderate removal efficiency 40 70 was achieved for fenoprofen bezafibrate roxithromycin ofloxacin and ranitidine chloramphenicol indomethacin mefenamic acid diclofenac ketoprofen furosemide hydrochlorothiazide azithromycin clarithromycin ornidazole atenolol amitriptyline and albuterol were poorly removed 40 which is in agreement with removal efficiencies reported earlier for some of these compounds e g diclofenac mefenamic acid luo et al 2014 concentrations of some phacs such as phenazone gemfibrozil triclosan tcs monensin sulfathiazole sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sulfanilamide flumequine norfloxacin danofloxacin metronidazole trimethoprim propanolol timolol metoprolol carbamazepine were higher in effluent than in influent wastewater negative removal efficiency consulting the scientific literature similar results have been reported earlier rivera jaimes et al 2018 luo et al 2014 kasprzyk hordern dinsdale and guwy 2009 sun et al 2014 villar navarro et al 2018 observation of higher concentrations of some phacs in wastewater effluent in comparison with influent can possibly be ascribed to i desorption from activated sludge or suspended particulate matter during wastewater treatment process ii transformation of some phacs to their original state during wastewater treatment from metabolites present in influent e g carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole kasprzyk hordern dinsdale and guwy 2009 iii seasonal variations sampling and analytical uncertainties sun et al 2014 obtained results suggest that several phacs were poorly or negatively removed after conventional wastewater treatment thus it is of high importance to monitor such phacs during tertiary treatment of secondary wastewater effluent in order to ensure complete elimination of these compounds 3 2 2 removal of phacs from wastewater effluent by cwpo pms gac and pds gac efficiency of catalytic processes namely cwpo pms gac and pds gac was compared for removal of selected phacs in total 22 from real urban wastewater effluent physico chemical characterization of wastewater effluent used for experiments is shown in table 2 taking into account that the initial toc of urban wastewater used for phacs removal was higher than in previous experiments the optimal ratio of oxidant to organic matter obtained from previous experiments was kept for each process samples were collected after 5 min of contact time removal percentages of phacs after cwpo pms gac and pds gac are shown in table 3 results shown in table 3 revealed that concentrations of phacs in urban wastewater effluents may significantly vary in summer table 3 compared to winter table 1 which is in agreement with previously published works luo et al 2014 for instance concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine were significantly higher in effluent collected in summer complete removal of acetaminophen ketoprofen sulfadiazine trimethoprim propanolol atenolol and albuterol was achieved after treatment by cwpo pms gac pds gac and gac only adsorption interestingly sulfamethoxazole was fully eliminated by all applied processes except gac adsorption complete decomposition of gemfibrozil and clarithromycin compound included in watch list by eu decision 2018 840 was observed after cwpo while azithromycin compound included in watch list by eu decision 2018 840 was fully eliminated after pms gac in general for 18 out of 22 target phacs very high removal efficiencies 92 were achieved by all tested processes however moderate 40 70 and poor 40 removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin the last compound included in watch list by eu decision 2018 840 thus ofloxacin was poorly removed after gac 9 5 pds gac 35 7 and pms gac 33 while no removal was reached after cwpo observed differences in removal efficiency of ofloxacin by tested processes can be possibly attributed to more selective nature of sulfate radicals ye et al 2017 generated during pds gac and pms gac as compared to only hydroxyl radicals formed during cwpo poor removal efficiency of norfloxacin 26 was achieved after gac pds while this compound was not eliminated after cwpo gac and pms gac salicylic acid was poorly removed after cwpo 1 6 and pms gac 8 7 and not eliminated after gac pds and gac poor elimination of ciprofloxacin was reached after cwpo 11 2 gac 30 5 and pms gac 19 while it was moderately removed after pds gac 62 8 complete elimination of a mixture of six pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole atenolol metronidazole trimethoprim diltiazem ranitidine with initial concentration 10 µg l 1 each has been reported after application of cwpo 30 min of contact time 75 c fe3o4 ᵞ al2o3 2 g l 1 h2o2 100 mg l 1 ph0 3 munoz et al 2017 higher contact time 60 90 min was required for the removal of pharmaceuticals listed in eu watch list decision 2015 495 spiked to urban wastewater effluent 1000 µg l 1 by cwpo 25 c modified magnetite 2 g l 1 h2o2 35 mg l 1 in another study díaz garduño et al 2017 combination of uv h2o2 and cwpo ambient temperature gac 144 1g h2o2 160 mg l 1 contact time 3 5 min for the treatment of three different urban wastewater effluents was demonstrated to be extremely efficient and completely remove 53 compounds originally detected in used effluents except for fenofibrate w3 and bezafibrate w1 considering that in the current study the contact time was only 5 min it can be expected that with increase of contact time higher complete removal of salicylic acid and quinolones can be possibly achieved as far as authors are aware relatively few studies have been reported focused on elimination of pharmaceutical compounds mg l 1 level from deionized water using persulfates oxidation activated by carbonaceous based materials chen and carroll 2016 kang et al 2016 while there are no studies conducted in real wastewater matrices using environmentally representative concentrations ng l 1 µg l 1 of pharmaceuticals the results suggest that adsorption by gac was also very efficient for the elimination of studied phacs from wastewater effluent which can be explained by relatively low concentration of target phacs and high dose of gac obtained results are in agreement with earlier studies luo et al 2014 however keeping in mind the different nature of studied catalytic and sorption processes it can be expected that in a long term perspective catalytic processes may be more beneficial due to lower saturation of catalyst with organic compounds 3 3 long term cwpo and adsorption test 3 3 1 performance of long term tests based on results obtained with real urban wastewater effluents it can be concluded that among the studied processes under chosen operational conditions ambient temperature and pressure carbon based catalyst the highest performance was achieved for cwpo using the stoichiometric concentration of h2o2 hence additional experiments were performed in order to evaluate catalyst s stability during long term continuous operation and get better understanding of studied processes nature long term test was performed using the same fixed bed reactors which were used for experiments with urban wastewater orange ii was used as a model compound the flow rate was adjusted to 20 ml min 1 in order to ensure availability of residual h2o2 concentration in the effluent of fixed bed reactor long term adsorption experiments gac ads were conducted in parallel with cwpo gac aops test during 47 h judging from obtained results fig 4 sm 47 h was not sufficient for saturating gac column adsorption experiment hence no significant difference was observed in performance of cwpo and adsorption in order to get more evidence in the different nature of the studied cwpo and adsorption processes an additional long term experiment was conducted using fresh gac 2 g and orange ii as a model solution 500 mg l 1 ph 3 the model solution with ph 3 was selected and used at this part of the work only in order to check the differences between adsorption oxidation performance of gac when saturation with orange ii is reached at the tested conditions it was demonstrated in the literature that higher ph at low temperature can induce the inefficient decomposition of h2o2 or hydroxyl radical scavenging khalil girgis and tawfik 2001 buxton et al 1988 pignatello oliveros and mackay 2006 rivas et al 1998 thomsen 1998 hence ph near 3 used in many cases rey et al 2008 domínguez et al 2013a pinho et al 2015 experimental set up is shown in fig 3 sm results are presented in fig 3 and gac characterization after these tests is discussed below at these conditions after 360 min almost all the gac was saturated with orange ii in the adsorption experiment during cwpo gac aops where indicates that experimental set up presented in fig 3 sm was used a stationary h2o2 conversion of about 65 was reached whereas only 22 of orange ii in the influent was eliminated at 360 min it should be mentioned that the objective of this long term test was not to achieve high removal of orange ii but to observe the differences in gac saturation during cwpo and adsorption the difference between orange ii profiles during adsorption gac ads where indicates that experimental set up presented in fig 3 sm was used and cwpo tests was 13 indicating the oxidation of the dye by radical species produced onto the gac surface through h2o2 decomposition however at tested conditions an important part of h2o2 on gac was decomposed into oxygen and water which was supported by our observations and is in agreement with earlier studies oliveira et al 2004 huang et al 2003 rey et al 2016 further differences in nature of tested processes are discussed in the section 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 characterization of gac before and after cwpo and adsorption tests 3 3 2 1 fresh gac characterization according to the supplier the commercial gac used had a mesh size of 4 8 mm and average particle density of 0 47 g cm 3 textural characteristics of the gac samples calculated from n2 isotherm and hg porosimetry are summarized in table 4 the isotherm shape fig 5 sm of fresh gac is characteristic of microporous materials type i with h4 type hysteresis loop associated to some mesoporosity brunauer et al 1940 macropore volume was calculated by hg porosimetry figure 6 sm the gac presented a high bet surface area mainly because of its microporous structure but also an important contribution of macroporosity to the total pore volume was observed regarding the composition of the activated carbon tables 3 sm and 4 sm it is essentially constituted by c with h n and s in small amount the ashes content calculated from tga dta ms in oxidizing environment was 5 84 wt these ashes are composed mainly of k na cl si and mg according to wdxrf results for the relevance in cwpo and other aops domínguez et al 2013b the amount of fe in the gac structure was determined as c a 0 03 wt by xrd only graphitic carbon was detected figure 7 sm with the main reflection signals at 2θ values of 24 3 43 6 and 79 2 corresponding to 002 100 101 and 110 diffraction planes of graphene layers in activated carbon nieto márquez valverde and keane 2007 zhao et al 2009 lueking et al 2007 the wide peaks indicate a poor degree of graphitization in a common turbostratic carbon structure typical of activated carbons ac the values of the interplanar distance between graphene sheets in the activated carbon d002 and the crystal thickness lc were 0 365 and 2 82 nm respectively confirming the amorphous character of the activated carbon used in this study the structural distortion and defects may play a key role in the ac as catalyst for hydrogen peroxide decomposition rey et al 2011 no diffraction peaks corresponding to any other inorganic structure were observed in agreement with the wdxrf results and the vegetal origin of the gac the role of the surface composition of the activated carbon as catalyst is also well known the presence and distribution of surface oxygen groups in gac has been determined by ar tpd fig 4 table 5 summarizes the amount of co and co2 evolved and also the phslurry of the gac the assessment of the different sogs has been performed according to the literature moreno castilla lópez ramón and carrasco marı n 2000 moreno castilla et al 1998 figueiredo et al 1999 szymański et al 2002 the profile of co2 presents a main contribution of carboxylic 100 400 c followed by anhydride 400 600 c and lactone type 700 900 c sogs these structures mainly carboxylic acids would confer acidic character to the ac surface to some extent on the other hand the co profile presents a small contribution of the anhydride type sogs followed by phenolic structures 600 700 c with predominance of basic structures like carbonyl 700 900 c ether and chromene 800 c and pyrone like sog 800 1000 c the highest contribution of the basic sog compared to the acidic type evolving mainly as co2 is evident from the basic value of the phslurry for this gac the importance of the sogs content and distribution in the processes of adsorption of organic compounds or catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide pms and pds has been previously reported jung et al 2001 vidic tessmer and uranowski 1997 georgi and kopinke 2005 rey et al 2008 rey et al 2011 domínguez et al 2013b 3 3 2 2 gac characterization after long term cwpo and adsorption tests textural characterization of fresh and used gac after adsorption gac ads and aops gac aops tests including the long term tests experimental set up shown in fig 2 sm is presented in table 4 and figure 8 sm the decrease observed in the bet surface areas mainly microporous area and micropore volumes indicates that some organic compounds remain adsorbed onto the gac surface after both type of treatments adsorption and oxidation which is not surprising taking into consideration the relatively high concentration of chosen organic pollutant and short contact time macroporosity seems to be slightly affected also by the applied treatments the reduction of bet surface area of activated carbon or fe activated carbon catalysts has been previously reported after cwpo of phenol and orange ii zazo et al 2006 domínguez et al 2013a duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 condensation by products due to oxidative coupling of aromatic structures usually remain adsorbed and cannot be oxidized at the conditions of cwpo vidic tessmer and uranowski 1997 domínguez et al 2013a the presence of organic compounds adsorbed in used gac was analysed by tga dta ms in ar at this point it is necessary to highlight that the contribution of previous organic compounds from batch experiments can be considered negligible according to the toc of the water samples compared to orange ii long term experiments figure 9 sm shows the tga and calculated differential thermogravimetry dtg profiles of fresh and used gac the final mass loss is presented in table 5 the highest mass loss was found for gac ads confirming a high loading of organic compounds mainly orange ii in its surface the dtg profiles in figure 9 sm down agree with the results by duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 for gac physisorbed water is released at around 100 150 c with a weight loss overlapped with some co2 evolution from sogs this was confirmed by the coupled ms analysis during tga see fig 5 the next important mass loss between 600 1000 c is attributed to the decomposition of co evolving sogs on the other hand dtg of gac ads and gac aops samples presented two additional contributions at 346 c and 530 c that have been assigned to the thermal decomposition of orange ii duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 besides the weight loss corresponding to physisorbed water can be affected by some dehydration of orange ii regarding to the differences found between both used samples gac ads and gac aops the weight loss assigned to orange ii seems to be lower for oxidation sample thus around 346 c a peak in the profile of h2o co2 and co is observed fig 5 and around 530 c clear peaks of h2o and co2 were detected the total amounts of h2o co2 and co evolved during tga dta ms ar analysis are summarized in table 5 the highest values of the three compounds were detected for the adsorption sample gac ads confirming the presence of the highest amount of adsorbed organic matter the differences in the profiles of h2o co2 and co between both used samples in fig 5 in which different height ratio are observed for the same species can suggest some differences in the nature of adsorbed organic matter in both samples thus mainly orange ii is expected to be adsorbed onto gac ads but some oxidation intermediates can be also present in gac aops duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 hence according to the profiles in fig 5 the co peak located at 346 c can be a good indicator of orange ii or similar structures adsorbed onto gac thus the co profile has been decomposed in individual contributions see figure 9 sm and the value of the 346 c peak oii co has been included in table 5 from these results a higher amount of orange ii remained adsorbed onto gac after adsorption tests compared to oxidation finally the increase in the percentage of s determined by elemental analysis and wdxrf tables 3 sm and 4 sm can also confirm the presence of orange ii or s containing by products in the gac samples which was higher for gac ads gac samples gac ads and gac aops after the second long term test experimental set up is shown in fig 3 sm were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and tga dta ms in ar according to textural characterization fig 5 sm and table 4 a higher decrease of the bet surface area and pore volumes was observed after adsorption gac ads as compared to cwpo gac aops these results reveal a higher load of orange ii blocking the porous structure onto gac used for adsorption test in comparison with gac used for cwpo higher loading of orange ii on the surface of gac used for adsorption test can be also confirmed by higher mass loss and higher amounts of h2o co2 and co evolved during tga dta ms ar analysis observed for gac ads in comparison with gac aops table 5 moreover differences in profiles of h2o co2 and co obtained from tga dta ms analysis for gac ads and gac aops indicate differences in nature of adsorbed organic compounds figure 10 sm which is similar to results obtained after the first long term test additionally the peak at 346 c oii co was higher for gac ads in comparison with gac aops figure 11 sm results of gac characterization confirm the ability of the gac to promote catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and the subsequent organic matter oxidation despite the fact that difference between removal of organic pollutants by adsorption and cwpo was not very significant despite the high efficiency of gac only adsorption observed in experiments with wastewater effluent it should be noticed that oxidation processes are more beneficial for post treatment of wastewater effluents mainly due to higher long term performance 4 conclusions catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo and persulfate oxidation pms gac and pds gac performed at ambient temperature and pressure using an up flow fixed bed reactor exhibit high efficiency for the treatment of urban wastewater effluents thus in terms of toc mineralization difference in performance was observed with trend cwpo pms gac pds gac in terms of phacs removal from urban wastewater effluent similar performance was observed for all tested processes in general for 18 out of 22 target phacs very high removal efficiencies 92 were achieved after 5 min of contact time all tested processes including adsorption however moderate 40 70 and poor 40 removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin which can be attributed to insufficient contact time for elimination of these compounds results of gac characterization mainly by tga dta ms and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm after long term adsorption and cwpo tests with orange ii indicate that a higher amount of orange ii was loaded on gac used for adsorption tests this in turn confirms the different nature of processes cwpo and adsorption and the catalytic ability of gac results obtained in this study indicate possible

of 22 target phacs very high removal efficiencies 92 were achieved in all tested processes including adsorption performed at optimal operational conditions during 5 min of contact time however moderate 40 70 and poor 40 removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin which can be possibly attributed to insufficient contact time despite high efficiency of all studied processes for phacs elimination from urban wastewater effluent cwpo seems to be more promising for continuous operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wastewater catalytic wet peroxide oxidation persulfate oxidation micropollutants activated carbon 1 introduction presence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in urban wastewater effluents is attracting significant attention recently which can be explained by the ability of these pollutants even at very low levels to cause biological effects suárez et al 2008 it can be expected that constant discharge of pharmaceutical compounds to the aquatic environment could pose a threat to the aquatic ecosystems françois et al 2015 quinn gagné and blaise 2009 quinn et al 2011 a list of these substances was recently included in the watch list by eu water framework directive eu decision 2018 840 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp are the main barrier preventing the release of pollutants into the receiving water bodies during the secondary wastewater treatment step biological some phacs can be eliminated the tertiary treatment step at conventional urban wastewater treatment plants usually aims at elimination of pathogens turbidity and nutrients hence filtration chlorination as well as uvc disinfection are often used as a tertiary treatment step however commonly applied tertiary treatment processes do not lead to efficient elimination of recalcitrant organic contaminants as a result emerging contaminants are often released to the aquatic environment with urban wastewater effluents gracia lor et al 2012 luo et al 2014 tertiary treatment of urban wastewater aiming at elimination of contaminants of emerging concern cecs pathogens etc is of high interest especially in view of recent eu regulation 2020 741 for wastewater reuse advanced oxidation processes aops can be considered as an alternative option for post treatment of urban wastewater effluents

studied by many researchers mainly due to non selective behaviour and potential for pollutant oxidation as well as lack of solid waste formation during majority of aops among the different aops catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo and persulfate oxidation processes are of significant promise main advantages of cwpo include absence of sludge generation and possibility to work in a wide ph range wang et al 2016 mainly iron based catalysts are used for cwpo munoz et al 2017 while carbon based catalysts are not so widely studied similarly carbon based materials for the activation of different persulfate salts have been mainly addressed using dyes or phenol as model pollutants wang and wang 2018 accordingly the persulfate activation efficiency by carbonaceous based materials especially metal free is worth further research zhao et al 2017 thus the application of activated carbon as a catalyst for cwpo and persulfates at ambient temperature and pressure is emerging as a technique of significant promise recent studies have demonstrated formation of hydroxyl radicals during decomposition of h2o2 by carbon materials santos et al 2009 rueda márquez et al 2015a rueda márquez et al 2015b to the best of our knowledge there is only one study munoz et al 2017 devoted to post treatment of real urban wastewater effluents by cwpo iron based catalyst aiming at removal of

urban wastewater effluents the effect of initial concentration of oxidizing agents h2o2 for cwpo peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds for persulfate oxidation was studied in order to identify optimal reaction conditions leading to highest toc conversion when optimal conditions were established removal of 22 phacs present in real urban wastewater effluents not spiked by cwpo pds gac and pms

described in the literature moreno castilla et al 1995 menendez et al 1995 in dark conditions and continuous stirring until the ph of the slurry was stabilized a calibrated ph meter crison glp21 was used for ph measurement 2 4 experimental set up all cwpo pms gac pds gac and gac experiments for urban wastewater treatment were conducted in discontinuous mode using up flow fixed bed reactors at ambient pressure and temperature 20 2 c methacrylate tubes with diameter of 4 5 cm and length of 13 cm were used as reactors fig 1 sm each reactor was charged with 68 825 0 345 g of gac catalyst real urban wastewater effluent 410 ml was placed in glass beaker volume 750 ml and mechanically stirred then the appropriate amount of h2o2 for cwpo pms for pms gac or pds for pds gac was added to the effluent and pumped to the fixed bed reactor using peristaltic pump masterflex adsorption experiments blank reference test were conducted in parallel with catalytic experiments cwpo pms gac pds gac in order to reach similar saturation of gac used for catalytic and adsorption tests the time zero of each experiment was considered when the effluent reached the top of the gac bed experimental set up for cwpo pms gac and pds gac experiments is shown in fig 2 sm residual concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured during all cwpo experiments by means of colorimetric method reported elsewhere eisenberg 1943 persulfate concentration was monitored using spectrophotometric methods according to the protocols proposed in liang et al 2008 wacławek grübel and černík 2015 long term cwpo tests were also performed in order to evaluate the stability of the catalyst using two different experimental set ups the first long term test was conducted using the experimental set up described above and shown in fig 2 sm for this test a model solution consisting of tap water and orange ii initial concentration 500 mg l was continuously pumped flow rate about 20 ml min through the fixed bed reactors during 47 h taking into consideration that the theoretical cod of orange ii model solution was estimated to be about 760 mg l 1 the amount of h2o2 was chosen based on optimum stoichiometric ratio obtained in previous experiments with wastewater effluent no hydrogen peroxide was added in adsorption column cwpo and adsorption tests were performed in parallel the contact time was decreased as compared to experiments with wastewater in order to ensure presence of residual h2o2 in the cwpo effluent concentration of orange ii in water was measured by means of uv visible spectrophotometer jenway 7315 at the wavelength 486 nm taking into account the large amount of catalyst used in this experimental set up it was difficult to reach saturation of gac hence similar tests were performed using smaller amounts of catalyst experimental set up shown in fig 3 sm two up flow fixed bed reactors polystyrene 1 cm diameter 5 cm bed length 22 cm total length filled with 2 g of gac each were used and operated in parallel one for cwpo and one for adsorption model solution except that ph was adjusted to 3 and concentration of h2o2 were similar to these used in the first long term test experiments were performed continuously during 400 min and model solution was pumped through reactors with flow rate of 2 ml min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of operational conditions of cwpo pms gac and pds gac 3 1 1 cwpo the cwpo experiments were conducted at ambient pressure and temperature with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in order to choose the optimal concentration of the oxidant to treat the wastewater effluent performance of the cwpo process with different initial hydrogen peroxide concentrations was evaluated based on toc conversion xtoc calculated as shown in equation 1 while hydrogen peroxide consumption xh2o2 was estimated using equation 2 1 xtoc toc inlet toc outlet toc inlet 100 2 xh2o2 h2o2 inlet h2o2 outlet h2o2 inlet 100 it is well known that concentration of hydrogen peroxide is a critical parameter for cwpo according to pliego et al 2012 the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide required for the complete mineralization of wastewater is 2 125 g per g of cod the initial cod and toc values of wastewater effluent used for cwpo experiments were 49 mg l 1 and 12 3 mg l 1 respectively thus the theoretical stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide was estimated to be about 104 mg l 1 taking into consideration the cod value 49 mg l 1 of the tested wastewater effluent following concentrations of hydrogen peroxide 104 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 stoichiometric 56 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 0 5 stoichiometric 189 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 8 stoichiometric and 1075 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 10 3 stoichiometric were tested results toc conversion and h2o2 consumption profiles are shown in fig 1 as it can be seen from fig 1 a with an initial increase of hydrogen peroxide concentration h2o2 cod from 0 5 to 1 8 stoichiometric the toc conversion increased while when the h2o2 concentration was too high h2o2 cod 10 3 stoichiometric the efficiency of cwpo decreased similar observations have been reported earlier fang et al 2018 and can be explained by the fact that an excess of hydrogen peroxide acts as scavenger of hydroxyl radicals reactions 3 and 4 chou and huang 1999 3 h2o2 ho h2o ho2 4 ho2 ho h2 o2 the highest toc conversion was achieved with initial h2o2 concentrations of 104 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 stoichiometric and 189 mg l 1 h2o2 cod 1 8 stoichiometric leading to approx 82 and 84 of toc removal respectively obtained results are in agreement with data reported earlier as in most of recent studies devoted to wastewater treatment by cwpo the h2o2 cod or toc ratios were with the range of 0 5 2 rueda márquez levchuk and sillanpää 2018 it should be mentioned that hydrogen peroxide was fully consumed during all cwpo tests fig 1b which is highly beneficial as the presence of h2o2 in effluents even at low concentrations can be possibly toxic for the receiving environment drábková et al 2007 the ph and conductivity values were measured before and after each cwpo test and similar results were obtained for all tested h2o2 cod ratios namely ph increased from 7 6 0 03 initial wastewater effluent to 8 04 0 03 while conductivity raised from 0 9 0 01 ms cm 1 to 1 08 0 04 ms cm 1 the values of ph and conductivity after adsorption test were 8 38 0 01 and 1 13 0 01 ms cm 1 respectively the h2o2 cod ratio 1 stoichiometric was chosen as the optimal among all cwpo tests and used for further experiments although toc conversion was slightly higher at ratio 1 8 stoichiometric however required amount of h2o2 at ratio 1 8 is almost two times higher as compared with ratio 1 while the toc removal is very similar reference blank test in absence of catalyst with 1 stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide was conducted and no changes in toc were observed the adsorption capacity of gac in absence of hydrogen peroxide was relatively high fig 1a as expected due to high gac load in the fixed bed reactor however experiments confirming that chemical oxidation and not sorption takes place when h2o2 is added to the gac column have been performed in our previous study rueda márquez et al 2015b briefly deionized water spiked with 4 chlorophenol and h2o2 was pumped through the gac column mass of catalyst 140 10 g and a stoichiometric amount of chloride ions was detected after treatment confirming that oxidation occurred it should be mentioned that the same gac was used in previous rueda márquez et al 2015b and current study in this sense this gac will promote h2o2 decomposition into reactive oxidizing species ros mainly ho radicals oliveira et al 2004 santos et al 2009 georgi and kopinke 2005 rey et al 2008 this reaction is favoured by surface defects unsaturated sites and basic surface oxygen groups sogs in activated carbons but also by the presence of metallic species mainly fe on their surface domínguez et al 2013b rey et al 2011 santos et al 2009 this latter being very low in the gac used in this study however the vast number of active sites in activated carbons is a disadvantage for the use of h2o2 during cwpo due to the recombination of the ros generated adsorption of organic molecules blocking some of the active sites has demonstrated to favour the overall process making the hydrogen peroxide decomposition more controllable domínguez et al 2013a more evidence about the mechanism during cwpo is presented in the long term test results section 3 3 2 with the characterization of the used gac samples 3 1 2 pds gac and pms gac the pds gac and pms gac experiments were conducted at ambient pressure and temperature with various concentrations of pds or pms in order to choose the optimal concentration of the oxidant to treat the wastewater effluent performance of pds gac and pms gac process with different initial pds or pms concentrations was evaluated based on toc conversion xtoc calculated as shown above in equation 1 while pds consumption xpds or pms consumption xpms was estimated using equation 5 6 5 xpds pds inlet pds outlet pds inlet 100 6 xpms pms inlet pms outlet pms inlet 100 in order to get comparable results with cwpo with h2o2 as an oxidant similar concentrations of persulfates pds pms have been used i e 10 100 1000 mg l 1 results obtained for each system pds gac pms gac are shown in fig 2 where the toc conversion fig 2 a b and the oxidant consumption profiles fig 2 c d are reported in pds gac system similar behaviour on toc conversion was obtained for all the concentrations tested in which 70 conversion was reached at 5 min of contact time regarding pds consumption fig 2 c it should be noted that at 2 5 min all pds has been consumed in fact the pds decomposition decreased as the concentration increased on the other hand pms was practically consumed independently of initial concentration at 1 5 minutes of contact time accordingly pms gac system shows better performance than pds gac as pms is more efficiently decomposed than pds and also shows better toc conversion rates about 72 vs about 69 fig 2 no major changes were detected in ph and conductivity values being similar to that reported on cwpo experiments although at 1000 mg pms l 1 the ph decreased to 5 80 at initial conditions and raised up to 7 98 at the end of the experiments with a conductivity of 1 3 ms cm 1 similar conclusions were obtained in the literature saputra et al 2013 in which authors showed that the ability of activated carbons acs to produce sulfate radicals was much higher in a pms system compared to pds saputra et al 2013 activated carbon ac is an electron transfer mediator in persulfates activation however a non radical activation pathway has also been reported yao et al 2019 which makes difficult to strictly explain activation mechanisms nevertheless the persulfates might be decomposed by the ac surface with the release of organic radicals and sulfate radicals via radical or non radical pathway zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 accordingly it is assumed that as persulfates are decomposed they produce chemical oxidation in some way and major toc mineralization rates can be achieved rather than sorption also taking into account that gac with very low iron content 0 03 wt was used in this study catalytic performance in pds gac or pms gac might be lower zhao et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 these systems have been previously studied by means of dyes yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 and phenol degradation saputra et al 2013 as well as antibiotic metronidazole forouzesh et al 2019 forouzesh ebadi and aghaeinejad meybodi 2019 generally the persulfate gac system shows promising degradation rates for dyes removal however when mineralization rates are analysed in form of toc it reduces its efficacy zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2011 the presence of other organic substances could imply the reduction of active surface sites available for the activation of persulfates and it is of high importance as real effluent was used in the experiments when more specific pollutants are studied for instance antibiotics forouzesh ebadi and aghaeinejad meybodi 2019 forouzesh et al 2019 significantly higher amounts of persulfates 3000 mg l 1 have been used in order to increase the degradation performance by comparison with single adsorption which can agree with our results the persulfates toc ratio 8 6 was selected for further pds gac or pms gac experiments due to i highest toc conversion obtained in pms gac 100 mg l 1 of pms ii comparative purposes in terms of initial oxidant concentration mg l 1 with cwpo which was the most efficient among studied aops 3 2 comparison of cwpo pms gac and pds gac for elimination of phacs from real urban wastewater effluent 3 2 1 occurrence of phacs in urban wastewater influent and effluent composite samples 48 h of urban wastewater influent and effluent were collected for screening and identifying phacs 83 in total see table 1 sm with higher concentrations to be monitored during further post treatment experiments cwpo pms gac pds gac at optimal conditions moreover some phacs the concentrations of which significantly increased after treatment negative removal efficiency were taken into consideration because those would be especially interesting to follow during possible post treatment cwpo pms gac pds gac results are shown in table 1 forty seven out of eighty three analysed phacs were detected in influent and effluent wastewater obtained concentrations of phacs in wastewater influent and effluent table 1 are in agreement with phacs concentration ranges previously reported for influents and effluents of conventional wwtps in different countries luo et al 2014 except for concentrations of acetaminophen in influent diclofenac in effluent and metoprolol in effluent which were slightly higher interestingly concentration of caffeine in wastewater influent measured in this study 492 223 143 239 µg l 1 was significantly higher than caffeine concentrations reported in wastewater influents of various countries 0 22 209 µg l 1 luo et al 2014 this result can be explained by the fact that coffee consumption in finland is among the highest in the world kempf et al 2010 out of all detected phacs only acetaminophen phenylbutazone pravastatin triclocarban tcc and tetracycline were completely removed concentration in effluent was lod after conventional wastewater treatment process high removal efficiency 70 was observed for lincomycin salicylic acid ibuprofen naproxen clofibric acid sparfloxacin and caffeine which is generally in agreement with the removal efficiency for micropollutants reported by luo et al 2014 moderate removal efficiency 40 70 was achieved for fenoprofen bezafibrate roxithromycin ofloxacin and ranitidine chloramphenicol indomethacin mefenamic acid diclofenac ketoprofen furosemide hydrochlorothiazide azithromycin clarithromycin ornidazole atenolol amitriptyline and albuterol were poorly removed 40 which is in agreement with removal efficiencies reported earlier for some of these compounds e g diclofenac mefenamic acid luo et al 2014 concentrations of some phacs such as phenazone gemfibrozil triclosan tcs monensin sulfathiazole sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole sulfanilamide flumequine norfloxacin danofloxacin metronidazole trimethoprim propanolol timolol metoprolol carbamazepine were higher in effluent than in influent wastewater negative removal efficiency consulting the scientific literature similar results have been reported earlier rivera jaimes et al 2018 luo et al 2014 kasprzyk hordern dinsdale and guwy 2009 sun et al 2014 villar navarro et al 2018 observation of higher concentrations of some phacs in wastewater effluent in comparison with influent can possibly be ascribed to i desorption from activated sludge or suspended particulate matter during wastewater treatment process ii transformation of some phacs to their original state during wastewater treatment from metabolites present in influent e g carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole kasprzyk hordern dinsdale and guwy 2009 iii seasonal variations sampling and analytical uncertainties sun et al 2014 obtained results suggest that several phacs were poorly or negatively removed after conventional wastewater treatment thus it is of high importance to monitor such phacs during tertiary treatment of secondary wastewater effluent in order to ensure complete elimination of these compounds 3 2 2 removal of phacs from wastewater effluent by cwpo pms gac and pds gac efficiency of catalytic processes namely cwpo pms gac and pds gac was compared for removal of selected phacs in total 22 from real urban wastewater effluent physico chemical characterization of wastewater effluent used for experiments is shown in table 2 taking into account that the initial toc of urban wastewater used for phacs removal was higher than in previous experiments the optimal ratio of oxidant to organic matter obtained from previous experiments was kept for each process samples were collected after 5 min of contact time removal percentages of phacs after cwpo pms gac and pds gac are shown in table 3 results shown in table 3 revealed that concentrations of phacs in urban wastewater effluents may significantly vary in summer table 3 compared to winter table 1 which is in agreement with previously published works luo et al 2014 for instance concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine were significantly higher in effluent collected in summer complete removal of acetaminophen ketoprofen sulfadiazine trimethoprim propanolol atenolol and albuterol was achieved after treatment by cwpo pms gac pds gac and gac only adsorption interestingly sulfamethoxazole was fully eliminated by all applied processes except gac adsorption complete decomposition of gemfibrozil and clarithromycin compound included in watch list by eu decision 2018 840 was observed after cwpo while azithromycin compound included in watch list by eu decision 2018 840 was fully eliminated after pms gac in general for 18 out of 22 target phacs very high removal efficiencies 92 were achieved by all tested processes however moderate 40 70 and poor 40 removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin the last compound included in watch list by eu decision 2018 840 thus ofloxacin was poorly removed after gac 9 5 pds gac 35 7 and pms gac 33 while no removal was reached after cwpo observed differences in removal efficiency of ofloxacin by tested processes can be possibly attributed to more selective nature of sulfate radicals ye et al 2017 generated during pds gac and pms gac as compared to only hydroxyl radicals formed during cwpo poor removal efficiency of norfloxacin 26 was achieved after gac pds while this compound was not eliminated after cwpo gac and pms gac salicylic acid was poorly removed after cwpo 1 6 and pms gac 8 7 and not eliminated after gac pds and gac poor elimination of ciprofloxacin was reached after cwpo 11 2 gac 30 5 and pms gac 19 while it was moderately removed after pds gac 62 8 complete elimination of a mixture of six pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole atenolol metronidazole trimethoprim diltiazem ranitidine with initial concentration 10 µg l 1 each has been reported after application of cwpo 30 min of contact time 75 c fe3o4 ᵞ al2o3 2 g l 1 h2o2 100 mg l 1 ph0 3 munoz et al 2017 higher contact time 60 90 min was required for the removal of pharmaceuticals listed in eu watch list decision 2015 495 spiked to urban wastewater effluent 1000 µg l 1 by cwpo 25 c modified magnetite 2 g l 1 h2o2 35 mg l 1 in another study díaz garduño et al 2017 combination of uv h2o2 and cwpo ambient temperature gac 144 1g h2o2 160 mg l 1 contact time 3 5 min for the treatment of three different urban wastewater effluents was demonstrated to be extremely efficient and completely remove 53 compounds originally detected in used effluents except for fenofibrate w3 and bezafibrate w1 considering that in the current study the contact time was only 5 min it can be expected that with increase of contact time higher complete removal of salicylic acid and quinolones can be possibly achieved as far as authors are aware relatively few studies have been reported focused on elimination of pharmaceutical compounds mg l 1 level from deionized water using persulfates oxidation activated by carbonaceous based materials chen and carroll 2016 kang et al 2016 while there are no studies conducted in real wastewater matrices using environmentally representative concentrations ng l 1 µg l 1 of pharmaceuticals the results suggest that adsorption by gac was also very efficient for the elimination of studied phacs from wastewater effluent which can be explained by relatively low concentration of target phacs and high dose of gac obtained results are in agreement with earlier studies luo et al 2014 however keeping in mind the different nature of studied catalytic and sorption processes it can be expected that in a long term perspective catalytic processes may be more beneficial due to lower saturation of catalyst with organic compounds 3 3 long term cwpo and adsorption test 3 3 1 performance of long term tests based on results obtained with real urban wastewater effluents it can be concluded that among the studied processes under chosen operational conditions ambient temperature and pressure carbon based catalyst the highest performance was achieved for cwpo using the stoichiometric concentration of h2o2 hence additional experiments were performed in order to evaluate catalyst s stability during long term continuous operation and get better understanding of studied processes nature long term test was performed using the same fixed bed reactors which were used for experiments with urban wastewater orange ii was used as a model compound the flow rate was adjusted to 20 ml min 1 in order to ensure availability of residual h2o2 concentration in the effluent of fixed bed reactor long term adsorption experiments gac ads were conducted in parallel with cwpo gac aops test during 47 h judging from obtained results fig 4 sm 47 h was not sufficient for saturating gac column adsorption experiment hence no significant difference was observed in performance of cwpo and adsorption in order to get more evidence in the different nature of the studied cwpo and adsorption processes an additional long term experiment was conducted using fresh gac 2 g and orange ii as a model solution 500 mg l 1 ph 3 the model solution with ph 3 was selected and used at this part of the work only in order to check the differences between adsorption oxidation performance of gac when saturation with orange ii is reached at the tested conditions it was demonstrated in the literature that higher ph at low temperature can induce the inefficient decomposition of h2o2 or hydroxyl radical scavenging khalil girgis and tawfik 2001 buxton et al 1988 pignatello oliveros and mackay 2006 rivas et al 1998 thomsen 1998 hence ph near 3 used in many cases rey et al 2008 domínguez et al 2013a pinho et al 2015 experimental set up is shown in fig 3 sm results are presented in fig 3 and gac characterization after these tests is discussed below at these conditions after 360 min almost all the gac was saturated with orange ii in the adsorption experiment during cwpo gac aops where indicates that experimental set up presented in fig 3 sm was used a stationary h2o2 conversion of about 65 was reached whereas only 22 of orange ii in the influent was eliminated at 360 min it should be mentioned that the objective of this long term test was not to achieve high removal of orange ii but to observe the differences in gac saturation during cwpo and adsorption the difference between orange ii profiles during adsorption gac ads where indicates that experimental set up presented in fig 3 sm was used and cwpo tests was 13 indicating the oxidation of the dye by radical species produced onto the gac surface through h2o2 decomposition however at tested conditions an important part of h2o2 on gac was decomposed into oxygen and water which was supported by our observations and is in agreement with earlier studies oliveira et al 2004 huang et al 2003 rey et al 2016 further differences in nature of tested processes are discussed in the section 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 characterization of gac before and after cwpo and adsorption tests 3 3 2 1 fresh gac characterization according to the supplier the commercial gac used had a mesh size of 4 8 mm and average particle density of 0 47 g cm 3 textural characteristics of the gac samples calculated from n2 isotherm and hg porosimetry are summarized in table 4 the isotherm shape fig 5 sm of fresh gac is characteristic of microporous materials type i with h4 type hysteresis loop associated to some mesoporosity brunauer et al 1940 macropore volume was calculated by hg porosimetry figure 6 sm the gac presented a high bet surface area mainly because of its microporous structure but also an important contribution of macroporosity to the total pore volume was observed regarding the composition of the activated carbon tables 3 sm and 4 sm it is essentially constituted by c with h n and s in small amount the ashes content calculated from tga dta ms in oxidizing environment was 5 84 wt these ashes are composed mainly of k na cl si and mg according to wdxrf results for the relevance in cwpo and other aops domínguez et al 2013b the amount of fe in the gac structure was determined as c a 0 03 wt by xrd only graphitic carbon was detected figure 7 sm with the main reflection signals at 2θ values of 24 3 43 6 and 79 2 corresponding to 002 100 101 and 110 diffraction planes of graphene layers in activated carbon nieto márquez valverde and keane 2007 zhao et al 2009 lueking et al 2007 the wide peaks indicate a poor degree of graphitization in a common turbostratic carbon structure typical of activated carbons ac the values of the interplanar distance between graphene sheets in the activated carbon d002 and the crystal thickness lc were 0 365 and 2 82 nm respectively confirming the amorphous character of the activated carbon used in this study the structural distortion and defects may play a key role in the ac as catalyst for hydrogen peroxide decomposition rey et al 2011 no diffraction peaks corresponding to any other inorganic structure were observed in agreement with the wdxrf results and the vegetal origin of the gac the role of the surface composition of the activated carbon as catalyst is also well known the presence and distribution of surface oxygen groups in gac has been determined by ar tpd fig 4 table 5 summarizes the amount of co and co2 evolved and also the phslurry of the gac the assessment of the different sogs has been performed according to the literature moreno castilla lópez ramón and carrasco marı n 2000 moreno castilla et al 1998 figueiredo et al 1999 szymański et al 2002 the profile of co2 presents a main contribution of carboxylic 100 400 c followed by anhydride 400 600 c and lactone type 700 900 c sogs these structures mainly carboxylic acids would confer acidic character to the ac surface to some extent on the other hand the co profile presents a small contribution of the anhydride type sogs followed by phenolic structures 600 700 c with predominance of basic structures like carbonyl 700 900 c ether and chromene 800 c and pyrone like sog 800 1000 c the highest contribution of the basic sog compared to the acidic type evolving mainly as co2 is evident from the basic value of the phslurry for this gac the importance of the sogs content and distribution in the processes of adsorption of organic compounds or catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide pms and pds has been previously reported jung et al 2001 vidic tessmer and uranowski 1997 georgi and kopinke 2005 rey et al 2008 rey et al 2011 domínguez et al 2013b 3 3 2 2 gac characterization after long term cwpo and adsorption tests textural characterization of fresh and used gac after adsorption gac ads and aops gac aops tests including the long term tests experimental set up shown in fig 2 sm is presented in table 4 and figure 8 sm the decrease observed in the bet surface areas mainly microporous area and micropore volumes indicates that some organic compounds remain adsorbed onto the gac surface after both type of treatments adsorption and oxidation which is not surprising taking into consideration the relatively high concentration of chosen organic pollutant and short contact time macroporosity seems to be slightly affected also by the applied treatments the reduction of bet surface area of activated carbon or fe activated carbon catalysts has been previously reported after cwpo of phenol and orange ii zazo et al 2006 domínguez et al 2013a duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 condensation by products due to oxidative coupling of aromatic structures usually remain adsorbed and cannot be oxidized at the conditions of cwpo vidic tessmer and uranowski 1997 domínguez et al 2013a the presence of organic compounds adsorbed in used gac was analysed by tga dta ms in ar at this point it is necessary to highlight that the contribution of previous organic compounds from batch experiments can be considered negligible according to the toc of the water samples compared to orange ii long term experiments figure 9 sm shows the tga and calculated differential thermogravimetry dtg profiles of fresh and used gac the final mass loss is presented in table 5 the highest mass loss was found for gac ads confirming a high loading of organic compounds mainly orange ii in its surface the dtg profiles in figure 9 sm down agree with the results by duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 for gac physisorbed water is released at around 100 150 c with a weight loss overlapped with some co2 evolution from sogs this was confirmed by the coupled ms analysis during tga see fig 5 the next important mass loss between 600 1000 c is attributed to the decomposition of co evolving sogs on the other hand dtg of gac ads and gac aops samples presented two additional contributions at 346 c and 530 c that have been assigned to the thermal decomposition of orange ii duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 besides the weight loss corresponding to physisorbed water can be affected by some dehydration of orange ii regarding to the differences found between both used samples gac ads and gac aops the weight loss assigned to orange ii seems to be lower for oxidation sample thus around 346 c a peak in the profile of h2o co2 and co is observed fig 5 and around 530 c clear peaks of h2o and co2 were detected the total amounts of h2o co2 and co evolved during tga dta ms ar analysis are summarized in table 5 the highest values of the three compounds were detected for the adsorption sample gac ads confirming the presence of the highest amount of adsorbed organic matter the differences in the profiles of h2o co2 and co between both used samples in fig 5 in which different height ratio are observed for the same species can suggest some differences in the nature of adsorbed organic matter in both samples thus mainly orange ii is expected to be adsorbed onto gac ads but some oxidation intermediates can be also present in gac aops duarte maldonado hódar and madeira 2013 hence according to the profiles in fig 5 the co peak located at 346 c can be a good indicator of orange ii or similar structures adsorbed onto gac thus the co profile has been decomposed in individual contributions see figure 9 sm and the value of the 346 c peak oii co has been included in table 5 from these results a higher amount of orange ii remained adsorbed onto gac after adsorption tests compared to oxidation finally the increase in the percentage of s determined by elemental analysis and wdxrf tables 3 sm and 4 sm can also confirm the presence of orange ii or s containing by products in the gac samples which was higher for gac ads gac samples gac ads and gac aops after the second long term test experimental set up is shown in fig 3 sm were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and tga dta ms in ar according to textural characterization fig 5 sm and table 4 a higher decrease of the bet surface area and pore volumes was observed after adsorption gac ads as compared to cwpo gac aops these results reveal a higher load of orange ii blocking the porous structure onto gac used for adsorption test in comparison with gac used for cwpo higher loading of orange ii on the surface of gac used for adsorption test can be also confirmed by higher mass loss and higher amounts of h2o co2 and co evolved during tga dta ms ar analysis observed for gac ads in comparison with gac aops table 5 moreover differences in profiles of h2o co2 and co obtained from tga dta ms analysis for gac ads and gac aops indicate differences in nature of adsorbed organic compounds figure 10 sm which is similar to results obtained after the first long term test additionally the peak at 346 c oii co was higher for gac ads in comparison with gac aops figure 11 sm results of gac characterization confirm the ability of the gac to promote catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and the subsequent organic matter oxidation despite the fact that difference between removal of organic pollutants by adsorption and cwpo was not very significant despite the high efficiency of gac only adsorption observed in experiments with wastewater effluent it should be noticed that oxidation processes are more beneficial for post treatment of wastewater effluents mainly due to higher long term performance 4 conclusions catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo and persulfate oxidation pms gac and pds gac performed at ambient temperature and pressure using an up flow fixed bed reactor exhibit high efficiency for the treatment of urban wastewater effluents thus in terms of toc mineralization difference in performance was observed with trend cwpo pms gac pds gac in terms of phacs removal from urban wastewater effluent similar performance was observed for all tested processes in general for 18 out of 22 target phacs very high removal efficiencies 92 were achieved after 5 min of contact time all tested processes including adsorption however moderate 40 70 and poor 40 removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin which can be attributed to insufficient contact time for elimination of these compounds results of gac characterization mainly by tga dta ms and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm after long term adsorption and cwpo tests with orange ii indicate that a higher amount of orange ii was loaded on gac used for adsorption tests this in turn confirms the different nature of processes cwpo and adsorption and the catalytic ability of gac results obtained in this study indicate possible

17187,picocyanobacteria are small cyanobacteria being about 0 8 1 5 µm in size they are present in freshwater environments all over the world and are known to cause harmful algal blooms although their effects are not well understood algal blooms are important to manage because they threaten freshwater resources with potentially severe effects on ecological and human health there is also increased urgency due to urbanization and climate change trends which are expected to exacerbate these bloom dynamics these changes are expected to especially favour picocyanobacteria groups emphasizing the need for better characterization of their effects in the environment in this study we report the discovery that synechococcus sp could produce cylindrospermopsin cyn and anatoxin a atx this ability had never been previously reported for this species their toxin genes were also partial compared to other major producers such as raphidiopsis sp and anabaena sp demonstrating potentially unique

methylamino l alanine bmaa a neurotoxic non protein amino acid cox et al 2005 and microcystin mc bláha and maršálek 1999 furtado et al 2009 during a regular field monitoring programme we observed instances where high concentrations of cylindrospermopsin cyn coincided with low abundances of the typically causative raphidiopsis spp formerly known as cylindrospermopsis aguilera et al 2018 we further investigated this discrepancy and demonstrate for the first time that tropical freshwater synechococcus spp could produce cyn and anatoxin a atx this exciting discovery has implications on the potential risk of freshwater water resources for drinking water supply here we describe this novel ability in tropical strains of synechococcus spp to produce cyn and atx toxins and describe the prevalence of the species within a tropical freshwater system in singapore we also investigate the global distribution of this species and assess potential future impacts especially with regard to climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling sampling was conducted bi weekly during a prolonged bloom from february to may 2019 in an inland freshwater lake depth ranging from 2 6 m in equatorial singapore surface and bottom waters were collected from four stations at around 9 00 11 00 gmt 8hrs the water temperature was uniform with an average value of 28 0 72 c the sampling period occurred during the inter monsoon season with monthly rainfall ranging 14 8 132 2 mm chlorophyll a 124 6 89 8 µg l 1 total phosphorus 0 115 0 076 mg l 1 and total nitrogen 2 80 1 24 mg

were determined by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry uplc ms ms following methods outlined earlier tran et al 2020 for fcm absolute counts of picocyanobacteria were performed with a cytoflex s flow cytometer beckman coulter inc ca usa equipped with 488 nm blue and 638 nm red lasers water samples were passed through a 60 µm mesh filter to remove large particles prior to flow cytometric analysis 2 µm fluospheres microsphere beads thermo fisher scientific singapore were then added to the sample and run at an acquisition of slow to medium flowrates from 10 30 µl min 1 events were detected using red and orange fluorescence channel of 585 42 and 660 20 nm respectively data were then analysed with cytexpert software the concentration of

run nb is the number of beads counted during the same run cb is the concentration of beads in the sample and d is the dilution factor 2 3 isolation and establishment of cultures synechococcus sp strains c1 c6 c21 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 were isolated during the same sampling period the nucleotide sequences determined in this study have been deposited in genbank databases under the accession number mt376735 mt376740 water samples were first vacuum filtered through a 2 µm polycarbonate membrane filter followed by a 0 22 µm polycarbonate membrane filter residues retained on the 0 22 µm filter were then washed off into a centrifuge tube with a small amount of mla solution bolch and blackburn 1996 to obtain concentrated cells two methods for isolation were used the first method was a modified pour plate method brahamsha 1996 concentrated cells were serially diluted with mla medium and 100 µl of the diluted cells was mixed with mla medium containing 0 3 wt vol agar at 37 c into culturing plates the plates were incubated at 25 c and exposed to sunlight visible colonies that grew on the agar were then inoculated into a sterile vented tissue culture flask containing mla medium the second method utilized fcm sorting concentrated cells were aliquoted and diluted before sending for cell sorting sorting was performed using a mo flo legacy cell sorter beckman coulter cels nus singapore all isolated strains were maintained in mla medium at 25 c 15 µmol m 2 s 1 light flux and a 12h 12h light regime 2 4 detection of algal toxins cyanotoxins in the reservoir water were analysed using direct injection coupled with uplc ms ms for cyn samples were subjected to one freeze thaw cycle followed by sonication for 10 min the mixture was then filtered through a 0 22 µm polyethersulfone pes membrane syringe filter internal standards is consisting of acetaminophen d4 act d4 caffeine d9 cf d9 l phenylalanine d5 l phe d5 and 1 9 diaminononane 1 9 d were added to the filtrate at a 5 v v ratio and the mixture was stored at 20 c until analysis for total atx toxin was extracted using a solid phase extraction spe procedure using oasis hlb 200 mg 6 ml at a ph of 11 differences in the preparation for analyzing cyn and atx have been separately validated and optimized tran et al 2020 for the analysis of atx using spe 500 ml of freshwater sample were spiked with a fixed amount of is comprising of 500 ng of act d4 250 ng of cf d9 250 ng of l phe d5 and 250 ng of 1 9 d prior to spe extraction the spe cartridge was conditioned with 5 ml of dichloromethane dcm followed by 5 ml of methanol meoh and 5 ml of ultrapure water the is spiked filtrate samples were then percolated through the cartridges rinsed with 5 ml of ultrapure water and then vacuum dried for 30 min to remove excess water elution was performed with 5 ml meoh in 0 5 formic acid fa followed by 5 ml of a mixture of meoh dcm 50 50 v v in 0 5 fa the extract was evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c and reconstituted with a 1 ml mixture of meoh acetonitrile h2o 10 10 80 v v v in 0 1 fa final aliquots were transferred into amber vials and stored at 20 c until analysis tran et al 2020 the detection limits of the analytical method were 0 01 µg l 1 for cyn and 0 03 µg l 1 for atx and the recoveries were 73 1 for cyn and 102 2 for atx toxicity of the synechococcus isolates were analysed using both uplc ms ms and elisa assays extracellular toxins were obtained by removing cells using a 0 22 µm pes membrane syringe filter to obtain intracellular concentrations total toxin measurements were obtained by subjecting the samples to one freeze thaw cycle followed by sonication for 10 min and then passing the samples through a 0 22 µm pes membrane syringe filter intracellular toxin was calculated by subtracting extracellular concentrations from total toxin values uplc ms ms measurements were carried out according to tran et al 2020 but without spe extraction and with is added 5 v v ratio before direct injection into uplc ms ms for elisa we used 96 well cyn and atx assay kits purchased from abraxis inc 2 5 whole genome and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing dna of the synechococcus isolates were harvested at late exponential growth phase using a dneasy powerwater kit qiagen for genomic sequencing a library was prepared for an insert size of 350 base pair bp using 300 ng dna for each sample genome sequencing was performed on a novaseq 6000 sequencer illumina inc to generate 1 3 million of 2 150 bp paired end reads sequencing service was provided by novogeneait genomics singapore cyanobacterial population structure was analyzed using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing using primers 515f 806r this method was previously optimized by te et al 2017 2 6 metagenomic sequencing and toxin gene detection adaptor removal and read quality trimming were performed with bbduk and then subjected to assembly using megahit li et al 2015 the metagenomes of all unialgal cultures were extracted into several draft genomes bins using metawrap uritskiy et al 2018 followed by genome completeness and purity checks using checkm parks et al 2015 we identified toxin genes in the genomes by blasting the assembled contigs using reference genes from cylindrospermopsis raciborskii atw205 eu140798 1 and aphanizomenon sp 10e6 gq385961 1 full 16s rrna sequences of synechococcus were obtained using blast altschul et al 1990 algorithm against the silva rrna database 2 7 global distribution map synechococcus records were obtained from peer reviewed journals and culture collections the data was summarized using a global distribution map with the records also listed in a table where available the maximum recorded cell density and presence of toxin production were also included only records from freshwater or brackish water systems were included 2 8 statistical data analysis statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 23 correlations between picocyanobacteria concentration and cyanotoxins cyn or atx measured were calculated using the non parametric kendall s tau b τ b test 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characterization of local synechococcus isolates a total of six synechococcus sp strains i e c1 c6 c21 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 were isolated from an inland freshwater body visual inspection of all synechococcus isolates showed that all strains were unicellular free floating and green in colour with the exception of strains r4s1 and r4s2 which formed micro colonies and were reddish pink complete 16s rrna sequences extracted from the culture s metagenomes showed the same length of 1 486 bp 97 6 99 1 sequence similarity was shared among the isolates a comparison of these sequences against 16 synechococcus strains and other cyanobacteria genera is illustrated in the 16s rdna tree topology fig 1 synechococcus sequences formed five clades together with cyanobium and prochlorococcus sequences with three clades supported by bootstrap values 50 and two looser clades all our isolates fell into the looser clades comprised of synechococcus and cyanobium the isolates c1 and c21 were grouped in the freshwater clades showing closer relationship to cyanobium than synechococcus whereas c6 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 fell into the mixed freshwater marine clades these two clades were separated from the marine clade supported by high bootstrap values none of the sequences of our isolates displayed a 100 match to those available in the public database closest sequence matches had a range of 97 9 99 5 with 99 100 coverage thus confirming that these consisted of new strains 3 2 toxin production capabilities of synechococcus cyn and atx were detected in all synechococcus isolates using uplc ms ms although the concentrations were relatively low table 1 cellular concentrations for total cyn ranged from 9 0 10 5 6 8 10 4 fg cell 1 mean 3 5 10 4 1 7 10 5 whereas total atx ranged from 4 7 10 4 1 5 10 2 fg cell 1 4 6 10 3 1 7 10 4 the largest cyn producer was c21 whereas the largest producer for atx was strain r4s2 cyn was found to be stored intracellularly for all six strains fig 2 on the other hand atx existed in both extracellular and intracellular forms for strains c1 c6 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 strain c21 exhibited a different behavior compared to the other strains with almost all the atx detected in the culture being extracellular the amount of intracellular cyn in our synechococcus strains constituted over 90 of the total cyn available which differs from other cyn producing cyanobacteria where the toxin is mainly extracellular poniedziałek et al 2012 this means that lysis of synechococcus whether triggered by natural processes or anthropogenic bloom control measures can result in elevated amounts of cyn being released into the environment in contrast atx composition in all the strains varied widely with extracellular toxin generally occupying a larger proportion of the total toxin available this is consistent with the more commonly reported phenomenon of higher extracellular content osswald et al 2007 which poses a higher health risk than other toxins due to direct human exposure poniedziałek et al 2012 for comparison the total cyn produced by a raphidiopsis sp isolated from the same lake was about 54 5 fg cell 1 or about 105 times that of the synechococcus isolates while another raphidiopsis sp isolated from another lake in singapore produced 0 017 0 211 fg cyn cell 1 mohamed nor et al 2019 although it appears that synechococcus is a relatively small toxin producer in the freshwater environment this picocyanobacteria has the propensity to multiply very rapidly and can easily become dominant in the system it is noteworthy that elisa test kits did not detect the presence of atx and cyn in synechococcus cultures until concentrating the toxins approximately 100 times table 2 this can be interpreted by the low sensitivity and lack of specificity of elisa test kits compared to uplc ms ms earlier studies also highlighted elisa could not distinguish between different variants i e isomers other than the compound used as the calibrator carmichael and an 1999 in addition the molecular structure of cyn and atx produced by synechococcus may be slightly different from the known cyn and atx that is produced by raphidiopsis sp moreover matrix effects can affect the detection and quantification of atx and cyn by elisa test kits guo et al 2017 he et al 2017 for these reasons the use of elisa test kits were not sensitive and specific enough to detect and quantify these toxins in our synechococcus cultures unlike elisa test kits uplc ms ms appeared to be a more sensitive and specific method for both detection and quantification of cyn and atx the use of internal standards i e act d4 and 1 9 d for quantification of atx and cyn further improved the efficient correction of matrix effects on the signal intensity of these toxins during uplc ms ms analyses metagenomics analysis showed that complete cyn gene clusters were absent in all draft genomes and associated bacterial metagenomes however open reading frames orfs which partially matched cyn genes cyrb cyrc cyrd cyre and cryf were found in all synechococcus strains table 3 these genes encode for the polyketide synthase pks or mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetases nrps pks gene modules known to be part of the cyn biosynthesis gene cluster mihali et al 2008 sequence coverages of the cyr genes ranged between 9 8 56 with 26 2 47 7 amino acid sequence identity the closest alignments to the cyr gene were detected in the orfs of c1 c6 and c21 where 520 amino acids were highly similar to the cyre gene adf88280 1 fig 3 blast results indicated that the orfs are type i pks 55 38 identity belonging to the same multi domain enzyme family of cyr genes the pks sequences found in the isolates were not universal in members of this genus in a screening of seventeen publicly available synechococcus genomes i e pcc6301 pcc6312 pcc7003 cb0101 wh8101 kordi100 nies970 utex2973 cc9311 cc9616 cc9605 rs9916 u140 63ay4m1 gfb01 synace01 mits9508 using prosplign kiryutin et al 2007 only four strains pcc 7003 nies 970 utex 2973 and cc9311 possessed homologous sequences with identity 40 with only cyr gene homologs present in these cyn producing isolates the toxin synthesis pathway involved could be an important subject of investigation in the future in this study different sets of cyr genes were present across the synechococcus strains from singapore waters nevertheless strains that lacked the complete set of genes could still produce the toxin suggesting that synechococcus may possess novel cyn synthesis pathways phylogenetic mapping of the isolated strains also demonstrated clustering with the freshwater clade as well as a mixed freshwater marine clade several studies have noted the presence of this taxa across both environments cabello yeves et al 2017 kim et al 2018 noting that differential protein expression may account for their ability to thrive across a wide salinity range cabello yeves and rodriguez valera 2019 the strains in this study were isolated from an originally estuarine environment that was dammed in 2011 to form a freshwater body the persistence of marine associated clades reflects this land use history and furthermore emphasizes the ability for synechococcus to adapt to varying salinity conditions the amount of cyn and atx produced and stored by our synechococcus cultures table 1 did not appear to tally with the cell and toxin concentrations analysed in the studied water body fig 4 fcm demonstrated the changes in the picocyanobacteria abundance over the feb jun 2019 field sampling period comprising mostly of synechococcus supplementary fig 1 they were of higher abundance in surface waters where concentrations ranged from 1 3 104 2 9 107 2 2 106 5 4 106 cells ml 1 compared to the bottom waters which ranged from 9 0 103 1 8 107 1 9 106 3 9 106 cells ml 1 toxin concentration was particularly high for cyn ranging from 0 01 24 6 4 53 5 86 ppb interestingly raphidiopsis spp 1 9 102 3 3 104 8 1 103 8 3 103 cells ml 1 based on rna polymerase gene copy number the most ubiquitous cyn producers were not correlated with cyn levels in the studied system kendall s tau b p 0 05 instead a significant correlation between picocyanobacteria and cyn was detected τb 0 49 p 0 01 it was also noted that the high levels of cyn coincided with peak densities of picocyanobacteria in the studied water body and this correlation was supported by observations that isolates obtained could produce this toxin the highest concentration of picocyanobacteria detected in the studied freshwater body was around 2 9 107 cells ml 1 whereas laboratory cultured synechococcus isolates were only capable of producing less than 0 1 of the total cyn and atx found in the water body it is possible that toxin production may be accelerated in the presence of zooplankton grazers jang et al 2007 pančić and kiørboe 2018 or as a response to various environmental factors boopathi and ki 2014 that are not captured in the laboratory cultures further study is therefore needed to better characterize and understand the toxin dynamics of synechococcus especially within tropical urban impacted watersheds 3 3 global distribution the distribution pattern observed for synechococcus demonstrated its ability to tolerate and thrive in different conditions around the world with its marine counterparts being recorded even in the antarctic region tang et al 2019 this distribution across different climes coupled with the long evolutionary history of the species dvořák et al 2014 imply that the species is ubiquitous across all freshwater systems we found 47 literature references three additional records from a culture collection and one source through personal communication that contained geographical information for synechococcus fig 5 synechococcus was recorded at 59 locations of which only 11 had cell density information excluding this current study the global records appeared largely uneven with more records being clustered around europe and east southeast asia this is likely due to the difficulty of detecting synechococcus due to its small size of about 0 8 1 5 µm which requires sensitive but costly methods that are not easily accessible especially within poorer countries an extensive review of tropical blooms mowe et al 2015 previously identified freshwater environments that were prone to bloom events and provides a useful comparison for the synechococcus records several bloom records coincided with synechococcus distribution in the tropics but there were some exceptions where cyanobacterial blooms had occurred but no synechococcus records were found these were in west africa the india myanmar region and australia it is unclear if these environments are incompatible for synechococcus or if these trends might reflect poor sampling coverage within these locations furthermore only less than one fifth of the localities where synechococcus can be found also reported its density we therefore have poor existing knowledge about freshwater synechococcus which presents a concern because many climate models predict an increasing bloom threat posed by such genus śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 3 4 synechococcus adaptive responses to climate change synechococcus are gram negative with a thick peptidoglycan cell wall and an external s layer of glycoproteins that enhances environmental tolerance callieri 2017 they also possess several photosynthetic accessory pigments that allow for adaption to different light regimes these pigments phycocyanin pc and phycoerythrin pe absorb light at the 400 650 nm wavelengths which are inaccessible to chlorophyll a cabello yeves et al 2017 pe rich clusters are thought to be less common in freshwater systems that are of higher than mesoeutrophic condition cabello yeves et al 2017 callieri 2017 but r4s1 and r4s2 isolates displayed both the pc and pe pigments supplementary fig 2 such physiological traits demonstrate an advantage to rapidly adapt to different wavelengths of light and survive at different water depth cabello yeves et al 2017 synechococcus can also endure long periods of nitrogen starvation through degradation of their own light harvesting pigments including chlorophyll a görl et al 1998 different pigment compositions in local strains of synechococcus therefore imply a range of light uptake and nutrient recycling strategies which confer wide tolerance and survivability across diverse climate conditions this characteristic may be especially pertinent in understanding how the hab propensity of synechococcus may be altered under impending climate change scenarios synechococcus can also survive a wide range of temperatures with reports of their occurrence from near antarctic regions jang et al 2007 to the tropics siva and salleh 1997 the growth physiology of freshwater synechococcus differs between localities although the temperature optima appears similar in israel synechococcus attained a growth rate of 0 9 1 2 day 1 at 20 28 c malinsky rushansky et al 2002 whereas synechococcus from hungary displayed a faster growth rate of 2 3 day 1 at 28 30 c with cells able to survive up to 40 c albeit at lower growth rates mastala et al 1996 this optimal temperature range between 28 30 c matches the warm conditions of tropical countries like singapore 24 34 c but warming temperate lakes due to climate change drivers e g rasconi et al 2015 may also become increasingly conducive for synechoccocus the fast growth rates also confer a benefit over other cyanobacteria species that similarly thrive under warmer temperatures one taxon in particular microcystis is a major hab causative species in many freshwaters across the world mowe et al 2015 microcystis shares a similar optimum temperature at around 31 c although some strains can survive up to 37 c but have a slower growth rate of about 0 4 day 1 mastala et al 1996 in comparison increasing global temperatures under climate change scenarios is therefore likely to favour synechococcus over the currently dominant microcystis due to its faster growth rates making it a potentially problematic species in the future however more ongoing studies are needed to monitor this trend given the complexity of algal population dynamics previous studies have identified cylindrospermopsis now raphidiopsis aphanizomenon anabaena umezakia lyngbya and oscillatoria as prominent cyn genera guzmán guillén et al 2013 our findings showed that this sporadic distribution of cyn genes among the cyanobacteria lineage is not only restricted to filamentous taxa two evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to explain how phylogenetically distinct genera acquired cyn production ability horizontal gene transfer hgt and the presence of a common ancestor for all cyn potent genera dittmann et al 2013 high cyn gene similarity across different genera e g raphidiopsis and aphanizomenon possible transposase activity and untypical gc content indicate the potential for hgt mechanisms stüken and jakobsen 2010 conversely diverse cyn genes in oscillatoria mazmouz et al 2010 and highly congruent phylogeny patterns between 16s rrna and cyn genes jiang et al 2012 suggest an ancient origin of cyn genes which underwent a series of gene losses our findings here favour the latter explanation with all cyn producing synechococcus isolates clustering distinctly from other cyn producing genera under a 16s rrna phylogeny supplementary fig 3 we speculate that this descent of cyanobacteria might have undergone greater cyn gene loss compared to their filamentous counterparts which explains the partial cyn gene analogues detected in the synechococcus genomes our results demonstrate diverse cyn producers with high sequence dissimilarities providing insight into mechanisms of genetic variation that may drive cyn synthesis one major trend in freshwater environments around the world is an increase in the nutrient pollution of various watersheds due to more intensive agricultural and urbanization activities cavicchioli et al 2019 salas and subburayalu 2019 these processes are further exacerbated by rainfall which in some places have become more intense and frequent due to climate change patterns carey et al 2012 chou et al 2012 o neil et al 2012 increasing global temperatures could therefore favour synechococcus over microcystis with eutrophic conditions further exacerbating synechococcus productivity patterns the management of hab occurrences have traditionally and almost universally involved limiting the input of nutrients paerl et al 2018 however such efforts present a dilemma in the management of synechococcus blooms because their tolerance for low nutrient conditions liu et al 2019 would allow them to outcompete microcystis within such waters tan et al 2019a 2019b under a warming climate both eutrophic and oligotrophic conditions would hence favour synechococcus blooms while reducing the nutrient content of freshwater systems remains an important strategy for mitigating phytoplankton productivity and hab occurrences present indications suggest an inevitable period of conducive bloom conditions for synechococcus 4 conclusion the tolerance of synechococcus to a broad range of temperature and nutrient conditions are likely to be favourable under environmental stresses caused by climate change and urbanization which would lead to an exacerbation of synechococcus habs in the future the discovery of novel toxin producing ability in synechococcus suggests the possibility of latent toxicity posing a global concern due to the widespread distribution of the species we demonstrated that elisa kits developed for cyn and atx were not sufficiently sensitive to the toxins produced by synechococcus which may account for the lack of toxicity records for this species we also presented evidence that the molecular mechanisms underlying synechococcus toxicity may differ from what is commonly understood from anabaena sp and raphidiopsis sp more work is needed to understand the toxin dynamics of this species as well as to elucidate their physiology and ecological roles within freshwater environments development of more sensitive monitoring approaches would also be crucial in understanding and managing the threat posed by synechococcus habs poor

17187,picocyanobacteria are small cyanobacteria being about 0 8 1 5 µm in size they are present in freshwater environments all over the world and are known to cause harmful algal blooms although their effects are not well understood algal blooms are important to manage because they threaten freshwater resources with potentially severe effects on ecological and human health there is also increased urgency due to urbanization and climate change trends which are expected to exacerbate these bloom dynamics these changes are expected to especially favour picocyanobacteria groups emphasizing the need for better characterization of their effects in the environment in this study we report the discovery that synechococcus sp could produce cylindrospermopsin cyn and anatoxin a atx this ability had never been previously reported for this species their toxin genes were also partial compared to other major producers such as raphidiopsis sp and anabaena sp demonstrating potentially unique

methylamino l alanine bmaa a neurotoxic non protein amino acid cox et al 2005 and microcystin mc bláha and maršálek 1999 furtado et al 2009 during a regular field monitoring programme we observed instances where high concentrations of cylindrospermopsin cyn coincided with low abundances of the typically causative raphidiopsis spp formerly known as cylindrospermopsis aguilera et al 2018 we further investigated this discrepancy and demonstrate for the first time that tropical freshwater synechococcus spp could produce cyn and anatoxin a atx this exciting discovery has implications on the potential risk of freshwater water resources for drinking water supply here we describe this novel ability in tropical strains of synechococcus spp to produce cyn and atx toxins and describe the prevalence of the species within a tropical freshwater system in singapore we also investigate the global distribution of this species and assess potential future impacts especially with regard to climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling sampling was conducted bi weekly during a prolonged bloom from february to may 2019 in an inland freshwater lake depth ranging from 2 6 m in equatorial singapore surface and bottom waters were collected from four stations at around 9 00 11 00 gmt 8hrs the water temperature was uniform with an average value of 28 0 72 c the sampling period occurred during the inter monsoon season with monthly rainfall ranging 14 8 132 2 mm chlorophyll a 124 6 89 8 µg l 1 total phosphorus 0 115 0 076 mg l 1 and total nitrogen 2 80 1 24 mg l 1 concentrations indicated the waterbody was hypereutrophic carlson 1977 2 2 picocyanobacteria detection picocyanobacteria abundance was measured using flow cytometry fcm analyses of cyn and atx were determined by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry uplc ms ms following methods outlined earlier tran et al 2020 for fcm absolute counts of picocyanobacteria were performed with a cytoflex s flow cytometer beckman coulter inc ca usa equipped with 488 nm blue and 638 nm red lasers water samples were passed through a 60 µm mesh filter to remove large particles prior to flow cytometric analysis 2 µm fluospheres microsphere beads thermo fisher scientific singapore were then added to the sample and run at an acquisition of slow to medium flowrates from 10 30 µl min 1 events were detected using red and orange fluorescence channel of 585 42 and 660 20 nm respectively data were then analysed with cytexpert software the concentration of picocyanobacteria cc was calculated using eq 1 yang et al 2019 1 c c n c n b c b d where cc is the cell concentration in the original sample nc is the number of cells counted during the flow cytometer run nb is the number of beads counted during the same run cb is the concentration of beads in the sample and d is the dilution factor 2 3 isolation and establishment of cultures synechococcus sp strains c1 c6 c21 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 were isolated during the same sampling period the nucleotide sequences determined in this study have been deposited in genbank databases under the accession number mt376735 mt376740 water samples were first vacuum filtered through a 2 µm polycarbonate membrane filter followed by a 0 22 µm polycarbonate membrane filter residues retained on the 0 22 µm filter were then washed off into a centrifuge tube with a small amount of mla solution bolch and blackburn 1996 to obtain concentrated cells two methods for isolation were used the first method was a modified pour plate method brahamsha 1996 concentrated cells were serially diluted with mla medium and 100 µl of the diluted cells was mixed with mla medium containing 0 3 wt vol agar at 37 c into culturing plates the plates were incubated at 25 c and exposed to sunlight visible colonies that grew on the agar were then inoculated into a sterile vented tissue culture flask containing mla medium the second method utilized fcm sorting concentrated cells were aliquoted and diluted before sending for cell sorting sorting was performed using a mo flo legacy cell sorter beckman coulter cels nus singapore all isolated strains were maintained in mla medium at 25 c 15 µmol m 2 s 1 light flux and a 12h 12h light regime 2 4 detection of algal toxins cyanotoxins in the reservoir water were analysed using direct injection coupled with uplc ms ms for cyn samples were subjected to one freeze thaw cycle followed by sonication for 10 min the mixture was then filtered through a 0 22 µm polyethersulfone pes membrane syringe filter internal standards is consisting of acetaminophen d4 act d4 caffeine d9 cf d9 l phenylalanine d5 l phe d5 and 1 9 diaminononane 1 9 d were added to the filtrate at a 5 v v ratio and the mixture was stored at 20 c until analysis for total atx toxin was extracted using a solid phase extraction spe procedure using oasis hlb 200 mg 6 ml at a ph of 11 differences in the preparation for analyzing cyn and atx have been separately validated and optimized tran et al 2020 for the analysis of atx using spe 500 ml of freshwater sample were spiked with a fixed amount of is comprising of 500 ng of act d4 250 ng of cf d9 250 ng of l phe d5 and 250 ng of 1 9 d prior to spe extraction the spe cartridge was conditioned with 5 ml of dichloromethane dcm followed by 5 ml of methanol meoh and 5 ml of ultrapure water the is spiked filtrate samples were then percolated through the cartridges rinsed with 5 ml of ultrapure water and then vacuum dried for 30 min to remove excess water elution was performed with 5 ml meoh in 0 5 formic acid fa followed by 5 ml of a mixture of meoh dcm 50 50 v v in 0 5 fa the extract was evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c and reconstituted with a 1 ml mixture of meoh acetonitrile h2o 10 10 80 v v v in 0 1 fa final aliquots were transferred into amber vials and stored at 20 c until analysis tran et al 2020 the detection limits of the analytical method were 0 01 µg l 1 for cyn and 0 03 µg l 1 for atx and the recoveries were 73 1 for cyn and 102 2 for atx toxicity of the synechococcus isolates were analysed using both uplc ms ms and elisa assays extracellular toxins were obtained by removing cells using a 0 22 µm pes membrane syringe filter to obtain intracellular concentrations total toxin measurements were obtained by subjecting the samples to one freeze thaw cycle followed by sonication for 10 min and then passing the samples through a 0 22 µm pes membrane syringe filter intracellular toxin was calculated by subtracting extracellular concentrations from total toxin values uplc ms ms measurements were carried out according to tran et al 2020 but without spe extraction and with is added 5 v v ratio before direct injection into uplc ms ms for elisa we used 96 well cyn and atx assay kits purchased from abraxis inc 2 5 whole genome and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing dna of the synechococcus isolates were harvested at late exponential growth phase using a dneasy powerwater kit qiagen for genomic sequencing a library was prepared for an insert size of 350 base pair bp using 300 ng dna for each sample genome sequencing was performed on a novaseq 6000 sequencer illumina inc to generate 1 3 million of 2 150 bp paired end reads sequencing service was provided by novogeneait genomics singapore cyanobacterial population structure was analyzed using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing using primers 515f 806r this method was previously optimized by te et al 2017 2 6 metagenomic sequencing and toxin gene detection adaptor removal and read quality trimming were performed with bbduk and then subjected to assembly using megahit li et al 2015 the metagenomes of all unialgal cultures were extracted into several draft genomes bins using metawrap uritskiy et al 2018 followed by genome completeness and purity checks using checkm parks et al 2015 we identified toxin genes in the genomes by blasting the assembled contigs using reference genes from cylindrospermopsis raciborskii atw205 eu140798 1 and aphanizomenon sp 10e6 gq385961 1 full 16s rrna sequences of synechococcus were obtained using blast altschul et al 1990 algorithm against the silva rrna database 2 7 global distribution map synechococcus records were obtained from peer reviewed journals and culture collections the data was summarized using a global distribution map with the records also listed in a table where available the maximum recorded cell density and presence of toxin production were also included only records from freshwater or brackish water systems were included 2 8 statistical data analysis statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 23 correlations between picocyanobacteria concentration and cyanotoxins cyn or atx measured were calculated using the non parametric kendall s tau b τ b test 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characterization of local synechococcus isolates a total of six synechococcus sp strains i e c1 c6 c21 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 were isolated from an inland freshwater body visual inspection of all synechococcus isolates showed that all strains were unicellular free floating and green in colour with the exception of strains r4s1 and r4s2 which formed micro colonies and were reddish pink complete 16s rrna sequences extracted from the culture s metagenomes showed the same length of 1 486 bp 97 6 99 1 sequence similarity was shared among the isolates a comparison of these sequences against 16 synechococcus strains and other cyanobacteria genera is illustrated in the 16s rdna tree topology fig 1 synechococcus sequences formed five clades together with cyanobium and prochlorococcus sequences with three clades supported by bootstrap values 50 and two looser clades all our isolates fell into the looser clades comprised of synechococcus and cyanobium the isolates c1 and c21 were grouped in the freshwater clades showing closer relationship to cyanobium than synechococcus whereas c6 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 fell into the mixed freshwater marine clades these two clades were separated from the marine clade supported by high bootstrap values none of the sequences of our isolates displayed a 100 match to those available in the public database closest sequence matches had a range of 97 9 99 5 with 99 100 coverage thus confirming that these consisted of new strains 3 2 toxin production capabilities of synechococcus cyn and atx were detected in all synechococcus isolates using uplc ms ms although the concentrations were relatively low table 1 cellular concentrations for total cyn ranged from 9 0 10 5 6 8 10 4 fg cell 1 mean 3 5 10 4 1 7 10 5 whereas total atx ranged from 4 7 10 4 1 5 10 2 fg cell 1 4 6 10 3 1 7 10 4 the largest cyn producer was c21 whereas the largest producer for atx was strain r4s2 cyn was found to be stored intracellularly for all six strains fig 2 on the other hand atx existed in both extracellular and intracellular forms for strains c1 c6 r4s1 r4s2 and r4s6 strain c21 exhibited a different behavior compared to the other strains with almost all the atx detected in the culture being extracellular the amount of intracellular cyn in our synechococcus strains constituted over 90 of the total cyn available which differs from other cyn producing cyanobacteria where the toxin is mainly extracellular poniedziałek et al 2012 this means that lysis of synechococcus whether triggered by natural processes or anthropogenic bloom control measures can result in elevated amounts of cyn being released into the environment in contrast atx composition in all the strains varied widely with extracellular toxin generally occupying a larger proportion of the total toxin available this is consistent with the more commonly reported phenomenon of higher extracellular content osswald et al 2007 which poses a higher health risk than other toxins due to direct human exposure poniedziałek et al 2012 for comparison the total cyn produced by a raphidiopsis sp isolated from the same lake was about 54 5 fg cell 1 or about 105 times that of the synechococcus isolates while another raphidiopsis sp isolated from another lake in singapore produced 0 017 0 211 fg cyn cell 1 mohamed nor et al 2019 although it appears that synechococcus is a relatively small toxin producer in the freshwater environment this picocyanobacteria has the propensity to multiply very rapidly and can easily become dominant in the system it is noteworthy that elisa test kits did not detect the presence of atx and cyn in synechococcus cultures until concentrating the toxins approximately 100 times table 2 this can be interpreted by the low sensitivity and lack of specificity of elisa test kits compared to uplc ms ms earlier studies also highlighted elisa could not distinguish between different variants i e isomers other than the compound used as the calibrator carmichael and an 1999 in addition the molecular structure of cyn and atx produced by synechococcus may be slightly different from the known cyn and atx that is produced by raphidiopsis sp moreover matrix effects can affect the detection and quantification of atx and cyn by elisa test kits guo et al 2017 he et al 2017 for these reasons the use of elisa test kits were not sensitive and specific enough to detect and quantify these toxins in our synechococcus cultures unlike elisa test kits uplc ms ms appeared to be a more sensitive and specific method for both detection and quantification of cyn and atx the use of internal standards i e act d4 and 1 9 d for quantification of atx and cyn further improved the efficient correction of matrix effects on the signal intensity of these toxins during uplc ms ms analyses metagenomics analysis showed that complete cyn gene clusters were absent in all draft genomes and associated bacterial metagenomes however open reading frames orfs which partially matched cyn genes cyrb cyrc cyrd cyre and cryf were found in all synechococcus strains table 3 these genes encode for the polyketide synthase pks or mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetases nrps pks gene modules known to be part of the cyn biosynthesis gene cluster mihali et al 2008 sequence coverages of the cyr genes ranged between 9 8 56 with 26 2 47 7 amino acid sequence identity the closest alignments to the cyr gene were detected in the orfs of c1 c6 and c21 where 520 amino acids were highly similar to the cyre gene adf88280 1 fig 3 blast results indicated that the orfs are type i pks 55 38 identity belonging to the same multi domain enzyme family of cyr genes the pks sequences found in the isolates were not universal in members of this genus in a screening of seventeen publicly available synechococcus genomes i e pcc6301 pcc6312 pcc7003 cb0101 wh8101 kordi100 nies970 utex2973 cc9311 cc9616 cc9605 rs9916 u140 63ay4m1 gfb01 synace01 mits9508 using prosplign kiryutin et al 2007 only four strains pcc 7003 nies 970 utex 2973 and cc9311 possessed homologous sequences with identity 40 with only cyr gene homologs present in these cyn producing isolates the toxin synthesis pathway involved could be an important subject of investigation in the future in this study different sets of cyr genes were present across the synechococcus strains from singapore waters nevertheless strains that lacked the complete set of genes could still produce the toxin suggesting that synechococcus may possess novel cyn synthesis pathways phylogenetic mapping of the isolated strains also demonstrated clustering with the freshwater clade as well as a mixed freshwater marine clade several studies have noted the presence of this taxa across both environments cabello yeves et al 2017 kim et al 2018 noting that differential protein expression may account for their ability to thrive across a wide salinity range cabello yeves and rodriguez valera 2019 the strains in this study were isolated from an originally estuarine environment that was dammed in 2011 to form a freshwater body the persistence of marine associated clades reflects this land use history and furthermore emphasizes the ability for synechococcus to adapt to varying salinity conditions the amount of cyn and atx produced and stored by our synechococcus cultures table 1 did not appear to tally with the cell and toxin concentrations analysed in the studied water body fig 4 fcm demonstrated the changes in the picocyanobacteria abundance over the feb jun 2019 field sampling period comprising mostly of synechococcus supplementary fig 1 they were of higher abundance in surface waters where concentrations ranged from 1 3 104 2 9 107 2 2 106 5 4 106 cells ml 1 compared to the bottom waters which ranged from 9 0 103 1 8 107 1 9 106 3 9 106 cells ml 1 toxin concentration was particularly high for cyn ranging from 0 01 24 6 4 53 5 86 ppb interestingly raphidiopsis spp 1 9 102 3 3 104 8 1 103 8 3 103 cells ml 1 based on rna polymerase gene copy number the most ubiquitous cyn producers were not correlated with cyn levels in the studied system kendall s tau b p 0 05 instead a significant correlation between picocyanobacteria and cyn was detected τb 0 49 p 0 01 it was also noted that the high levels of cyn coincided with peak densities of picocyanobacteria in the studied water body and this correlation was supported by observations that isolates obtained could produce this toxin the highest concentration of picocyanobacteria detected in the studied freshwater body was around 2 9 107 cells ml 1 whereas laboratory cultured synechococcus isolates were only capable of producing less than 0 1 of the total cyn and atx found in the water body it is possible that toxin production may be accelerated in the presence of zooplankton grazers jang et al 2007 pančić and kiørboe 2018 or as a response to various environmental factors boopathi and ki 2014 that are not captured in the laboratory cultures further study is therefore needed to better characterize and understand the toxin dynamics of synechococcus especially within tropical urban impacted watersheds 3 3 global distribution the distribution pattern observed for synechococcus demonstrated its ability to tolerate and thrive in different conditions around the world with its marine counterparts being recorded even in the antarctic region tang et al 2019 this distribution across different climes coupled with the long evolutionary history of the species dvořák et al 2014 imply that the species is ubiquitous across all freshwater systems we found 47 literature references three additional records from a culture collection and one source through personal communication that contained geographical information for synechococcus fig 5 synechococcus was recorded at 59 locations of which only 11 had cell density information excluding this current study the global records appeared largely uneven with more records being clustered around europe and east southeast asia this is likely due to the difficulty of detecting synechococcus due to its small size of about 0 8 1 5 µm which requires sensitive but costly methods that are not easily accessible especially within poorer countries an extensive review of tropical blooms mowe et al 2015 previously identified freshwater environments that were prone to bloom events and provides a useful comparison for the synechococcus records several bloom records coincided with synechococcus distribution in the tropics but there were some exceptions where cyanobacterial blooms had occurred but no synechococcus records were found these were in west africa the india myanmar region and australia it is unclear if these environments are incompatible for synechococcus or if these trends might reflect poor sampling coverage within these locations furthermore only less than one fifth of the localities where synechococcus can be found also reported its density we therefore have poor existing knowledge about freshwater synechococcus which presents a concern because many climate models predict an increasing bloom threat posed by such genus śliwińska wilczewska et al 2018 3 4 synechococcus adaptive responses to climate change synechococcus are gram negative with a thick peptidoglycan cell wall and an external s layer of glycoproteins that enhances environmental tolerance callieri 2017 they also possess several photosynthetic accessory pigments that allow for adaption to different light regimes these pigments phycocyanin pc and phycoerythrin pe absorb light at the 400 650 nm wavelengths which are inaccessible to chlorophyll a cabello yeves et al 2017 pe rich clusters are thought to be less common in freshwater systems that are of higher than mesoeutrophic condition cabello yeves et al 2017 callieri 2017 but r4s1 and r4s2 isolates displayed both the pc and pe pigments supplementary fig 2 such physiological traits demonstrate an advantage to rapidly adapt to different wavelengths of light and survive at different water depth cabello yeves et al 2017 synechococcus can also endure long periods of nitrogen starvation through degradation of their own light harvesting pigments including chlorophyll a görl et al 1998 different pigment compositions in local strains of synechococcus therefore imply a range of light uptake and nutrient recycling strategies which confer wide tolerance and survivability across diverse climate conditions this characteristic may be especially pertinent in understanding how the hab propensity of synechococcus may be altered under impending climate change scenarios synechococcus can also survive a wide range of temperatures with reports of their occurrence from near antarctic regions jang et al 2007 to the tropics siva and salleh 1997 the growth physiology of freshwater synechococcus differs between localities although the temperature optima appears similar in israel synechococcus attained a growth rate of 0 9 1 2 day 1 at 20 28 c malinsky rushansky et al 2002 whereas synechococcus from hungary displayed a faster growth rate of 2 3 day 1 at 28 30 c with cells able to survive up to 40 c albeit at lower growth rates mastala et al 1996 this optimal temperature range between 28 30 c matches the warm conditions of tropical countries like singapore 24 34 c but warming temperate lakes due to climate change drivers e g rasconi et al 2015 may also become increasingly conducive for synechoccocus the fast growth rates also confer a benefit over other cyanobacteria species that similarly thrive under warmer temperatures one taxon in particular microcystis is a major hab causative species in many freshwaters across the world mowe et al 2015 microcystis shares a similar optimum temperature at around 31 c although some strains can survive up to 37 c but have a slower growth rate of about 0 4 day 1 mastala et al 1996 in comparison increasing global temperatures under climate change scenarios is therefore likely to favour synechococcus over the currently dominant microcystis due to its faster growth rates making it a potentially problematic species in the future however more ongoing studies are needed to monitor this trend given the complexity of algal population dynamics previous studies have identified cylindrospermopsis now raphidiopsis aphanizomenon anabaena umezakia lyngbya and oscillatoria as prominent cyn genera guzmán guillén et al 2013 our findings showed that this sporadic distribution of cyn genes among the cyanobacteria lineage is not only restricted to filamentous taxa two evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to explain how phylogenetically distinct genera acquired cyn production ability horizontal gene transfer hgt and the presence of a common ancestor for all cyn potent genera dittmann et al 2013 high cyn gene similarity across different genera e g raphidiopsis and aphanizomenon possible transposase activity and untypical gc content indicate the potential for hgt mechanisms stüken and jakobsen 2010 conversely diverse cyn genes in oscillatoria mazmouz et al 2010 and highly congruent phylogeny patterns between 16s rrna and cyn genes jiang et al 2012 suggest an ancient origin of cyn genes which underwent a series of gene losses our findings here favour the latter explanation with all cyn producing synechococcus isolates clustering distinctly from other cyn producing genera under a 16s rrna phylogeny supplementary fig 3 we speculate that this descent of cyanobacteria might have undergone greater cyn gene loss compared to their filamentous counterparts which explains the partial cyn gene analogues detected in the synechococcus genomes our results demonstrate diverse cyn producers with high sequence dissimilarities providing insight into mechanisms of genetic variation that may drive cyn synthesis one major trend in freshwater environments around the world is an increase in the nutrient pollution of various watersheds due to more intensive agricultural and urbanization activities cavicchioli et al 2019 salas and subburayalu 2019 these processes are further exacerbated by rainfall which in some places have become more intense and frequent due to climate change patterns carey et al 2012 chou et al 2012 o neil et al 2012 increasing global temperatures could therefore favour synechococcus over microcystis with eutrophic conditions further exacerbating synechococcus productivity patterns the management of hab occurrences have traditionally and almost universally involved limiting the input of nutrients paerl et al 2018 however such efforts present a dilemma in the management of synechococcus blooms because their tolerance for low nutrient conditions liu et al 2019 would allow them to outcompete microcystis within such waters tan et al 2019a 2019b under a warming climate both eutrophic and oligotrophic conditions would hence favour synechococcus blooms while reducing the nutrient content of freshwater systems remains an important strategy for mitigating phytoplankton productivity and hab occurrences present indications suggest an inevitable period of conducive bloom conditions for synechococcus 4 conclusion the tolerance of synechococcus to a broad range of temperature and nutrient conditions are likely to be favourable under environmental stresses caused by climate change and urbanization which would lead to an exacerbation of synechococcus habs in the future the discovery of novel toxin producing ability in synechococcus suggests the possibility of latent toxicity posing a global concern due to the widespread distribution of the species we demonstrated that elisa kits developed for cyn and atx were not sufficiently sensitive to the toxins produced by synechococcus which may account for the lack of toxicity records for this species we also presented evidence that the molecular mechanisms underlying synechococcus toxicity may differ from what is commonly understood from anabaena sp and raphidiopsis sp more work is needed to understand the toxin dynamics of this species as well as to elucidate their physiology and ecological roles within freshwater environments development of more sensitive monitoring approaches would also be crucial in understanding and managing the threat posed by synechococcus habs poor awareness and mitigation could severely threaten our already limited freshwater resources all around the world author contributions g k y h s z y g k c k j w k t s h and t n h wrote the main text of

17188,hydraulic models have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating the real behavior of water distribution systems wdss in using the models for estimating nodal water demands measurement uncertainty must be considered a common approach is to use the covariance of measurement noises to quantify the measurement uncertainty the noise covariance is typically assumed constant and estimated a priori however such an assumption is frequently misleading as actual measurement accuracies are affected by measuring instruments and environmental noises in this study we develop a variational bayesian approach for real time estimation of noise covariance and nodal water demands the approach can adaptively adjust the noise covariance with the variation of the noise intensity thereby efficiently avoiding model overfitting the measurement residual decomposition reveals that this new approach is effective in determining model structural errors caused by topological structure

are essential infrastructures that are used for transporting drinking water to various residential and business consumers while satisfying requirements such as achieving sufficient tap pressure zhao et al 2016 with an increase in urban population such systems encounter numerous challenges which include pipe bursts contamination and excessive energy consumption nerantzis et al 2020 these challenges highlight the demands for the control and management of wdss in the past decades steady flow hydraulic models have been widely implemented to address the system analysis design and operation of wdss the steady flow hydraulic wds models which can dynamically simulate the behavior of hydraulic and water quality conditions have been widely studied in recent years with the consistent development of remote metering technologies real time estimation of state variables making the model capable of replicating the system performance at a certain accuracy du et al 2018 is a critical step before implementing the models in actual applications as the most uncertain state variables nodal water demands vary with time and can significantly affect the model accuracy shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 real time estimation of nodal water demands is one of the most significant challenges for the real time modeling of wdss nodal water demands can be estimated by adjusting them in a direction to make the model outputs match the real time measurements ostfeld et al 2012 generally this problem involves thousands of nodal water demands having highly variable and stochastic behavior but gauged measurements are obtained at only a few selected locations kang and lansey 2009 preis et al 2011 this leads to the ill conditioning problem of having an insufficient number of measurements to calculate the unique solution in the feasible domain chu et al 2020 which in turn has motivated several researchers to develop efficient algorithms to make the systems solvable three commonly used methods have been developed to estimate nodal water demands trial and error explicit and optimization methods du et al 2018 the trial and error method adjusts the nodal water demands manually through engineering experience and domain knowledge this traditional method can be easily operated however the procedure must be repeated frequently and is time consuming for large scale networks limiting its application in real time modeling of wdss alternatively the explicit method was developed to increase computational efficiency it explicitly solves an extended set of hydraulic equations to identify unknown state variables ormsbee and wood 1986 although this method is computationally efficient the equations can only be solved when the number of unknown state variables is equal to the number of measurements moreover it cannot consider measurement uncertainties leading to overfitting in the case of noisy measured data in the optimization method the nodal water demands are considered as decision variables and an objective function is formulated to reduce the deviation between the model outputs and measurements examples include evolutionary algorithm ea based methods di nardo et al 2015 do et al 2016 and sensitivity matrix based methods cheng and he 2011 chu et al 2020 shao et al 2019 although ea based methods have been successfully implemented to address demand estimation problems their applications are not without difficulties one of the challenges encountered is that computational overheads required by eas to identify optimal solutions are intensive because of the inherently stochastic nature of eas in searching behavior and the high complexity associated with the increase in the number of decision variables particularly for large scale networks lin et al 2020 zheng et al 2017 sensitivity matrix based methods are more computationally efficient than ea based methods however the estimation of nodal water demands is an ill conditioning problem as the number of measurements is significantly less than the number of unknown state variables thus the estimated value is one of the numerous feasible solutions although the estimated result performs well in matching the measurements the nodal water demands are frequently beyond the acceptable range recently data assimilation methods were adopted to address the problem of ill conditioning in real time modeling of wdss examples include the markov chain monte carlo algorithm malve et al 2007 qin and boccelli 2019 particle filter algorithm do et al 2017 xie et al 2017 kalman filter algorithm kang and lansey 2009 zhou et al 2018 ensemble kalman filter algorithm rajakumar et al 2019 shang et al 2008 and extended kalman filter algorithm shang et al 2008 these algorithms propagate the model forward from a previous time step to the current time step this involves two update stages namely the prediction and correction stages hutton et al 2014 the prediction stage provides a prior distribution for the nodal water demands through a prediction from the previous time step the prior distribution is further corrected using the measurements in the correction stage compared with the optimization methods the incorporation of the prior distribution makes the system solvable and reduces system uncertainties therefore data assimilation methods were observed to perform better than other demand estimation methods liu et al 2012 rajakumar et al 2019 although the abovementioned methods can solve the problem of ill conditioning their applications are limited particularly for realistic problems the primary challenge is that both the measurements and the mathematical model contain considerable noises or errors hutton et al 2014 sensors distributed over a network can log real time data to estimate nodal water demands abokifa et al 2019 rajakumar et al 2019 however the measured data are inevitably polluted by background noises leading to a degradation in data quality wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the estimation of nodal water demands from noisy data is a challenging problem in real time modeling and control rosen and medvedev 2013 for the estimation of nodal water demands noisy data are treated as stochastic variables noise covariance is a critical parameter to quantify noise intensity previous studies generally assumed a constant noise covariance and estimated it a priori bragalli et al 2016 du et al 2015 kapelan et al 2007 kumar et al 2010 however in actual applications it is unreasonable to have an exact knowledge of noise statistics sarkka and nummenmaa 2009 zhao et al 2019b measurement noises are generally affected by time varying background noises and equipment properties thus the accuracy of the measurement gradually deteriorates as the service life increases this indicates that covariance is also a time varying variable considering it as a constant is a major shortcoming of previous studies hence a robust estimation must consider the variation in covariance the challenge is to simultaneously estimate the noise covariance and nodal water demands in real time zhao et al 2019b undertaking the modeling required to address noisy data as mentioned above is particularly difficult when the model structure itself has considerable errors the design of topological structures in model parameterization including nodal elevation pipe diameter valve status and pipe length can cause structural errors in the model chu et al 2020 hutton et al 2014 shao et al 2019 wds hydraulic model is complex dynamic and nonlinear despite the best efforts errors easily creep into a model walski 2019 leading to incorrect model outputs some studies e g piller et al 2010 indicated that model structural errors significantly reduce estimation accuracy the quantification of the uncertainty of the wds model structure is important but difficult managing model structural errors is another challenge for the real time modeling of wdss to date research for the estimation of nodal water demands in the presence of such problems has received insufficient interest the primary aim of this study is to propose an efficient method for the robust modeling of wdss which can estimate the nodal water demands and noise covariance simultaneously in real time to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to study the real time modeling problem of wdss with consideration to the estimation of noise covariance this method can adaptively estimate noise covariance with variation in noise intensity efficiently avoiding overfitting the model on noisy data based on the measurement residual decomposition this method exhibits significant potential in determining model structural errors the developed method is expected to increase the accuracy of wds modeling in the presence of both measurement noises and model structural errors 2 material and methods the methodology developed in this study is a framework to estimate the nodal water demands and noise covariance in real time using a variational bayesian vb method the methodology begins with the formulation of the prior probability density function pdf for the nodal water demands and noise covariance this is followed by the definition of a likelihood function using a fusion of the measurements with the prior pdf and the likelihood function the joint pdf of the two parameters can be formulated using bayesian formulation a vb approach is adopted to estimate the conditional posterior pdf of the nodal water demands and noise covariance from the joint pdf 2 1 prior probability distribution consider a dynamic markov process in which the nodal water demands at the current time step t can be predicted from the previous time step t 1 1 x t a x t 1 ω where x t r n is the nodal water demand vector to be estimated a r n n is the prediction matrix ω r n is the vector of prediction errors ω n 0 p ω p ω r n n n is the number of nodal water demands and t is the time step accordingly the pdf can be expressed as 2 p x t y 0 t 1 o b s n x t a x t 1 p t t 1 3 p t t 1 a p t 1 a t p ω where p t 1 r n n is the covariance for x t 1 p t t 1 r n n is the predicted covariance y t o b s r m is the measurement vector m is the number of measurements n is the normal distribution in practice the increasing use of automatic meter reading equipment provides a direct mean to get real time water demands x t creaco et al 2016 moreover consumer billings can be used to directly estimate nodal water demands for example based on the water usage proportion calculated from months of billing the total real time water demand for a district meter area dma can be decomposed and re distributed to each node as measured nodal water demand the fusion of the directly measured nodal water demand in the demand estimation process can aid in improving the modeling accuracy we denote the directly measured nodal water demands as x t o b s r n and we obtain 4 x t x t o b s τ t 5 p x t x t o b s n x t x t o b s p τ where τ t r n are the noises of the directly measured nodal water demands τ t n 0 p τ p τ r n n note that although x t o b s provides a direct measure of the nodal water demands its accuracy may be very low hence it has to be coupled with real time measured nodal pressure and pipe flow rate to increase modeling accuracy accordingly eq 5 can be derived from eq 4 furthermore the prior pdf for x t has the form of 6 p x t y 0 t 1 o b s x t o b s p x t x t o b s p x t y 0 t 1 o b s n x t x t t 1 p t t 1 7 p t t 1 p t t 1 1 p τ 1 1 8 x t t 1 p t t 1 p t t 1 1 a x t 1 p τ 1 x t o b s where p t t 1 1 and p τ 1 are the matrix inversion of the matrix p t t 1 and p τ respectively eqs 7 and 8 give the formulations to calculate the covariance p t t 1 and expectation value x t t 1 of the prior pdf errors or noises in model structures or measurements can propagate into the estimated nodal water demands by comparing model outputs with the measurements as discussed in the following section distinguishing the source of the errors is difficult as errors in the model structure and the noises in field measurements are equally critical explicitly analyzing the error sources complicates the problem temporarily we assume that there is no distinction between the two types of errors and that the errors obey the normal distribution n 0 r t r t r m m is the covariance to be estimated using the framework provided by simo and hartikainen 2013 we assume that r t obeys the inverse wishart distribution iw 9 p r t y 0 t o b s i w r t α t v t where v t r m m is a positive definite matrix α t is a time varying variable α m 1 for the current time step both α t and v t can be predicted from the previous time step t 1 the prediction of α t and v t can be calculated from eqs 10 and 11 zhao et al 2019b 10 α t t 1 μ α t 1 m 1 m 1 11 v t t 1 b v t 1 b t where α t t 1 and v t t 1 are the predicted values μ is introduced to prorogate from t 1 to t 0 μ 1 b μ i subsequently the prior pdf for r t can be expressed as 12 p r t y 0 t 1 o b s i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 here the prior pdf of x t and r t can be derived from eqs 6 and 12 denoting p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s x t o b s as p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s we can obtain 13 p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s n x t x t t 1 p t t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 eq 13 results in a prior pdf for the state variables x t and r t subsequently the prior pdf can be further supplemented by the likelihood driven by the measurements that will change the probability distribution of x t and r t and thus generally reduce the uncertainty law et al 2015 2 2 likelihood function owing to the errors in the wds model structure the outputs of the model generally differ from true values 14 y t g x t e t where y t r m represents the true value g r m is the output of the wds hydraulic model e t r m are the normally distributed errors and e t n 0 c e c e r m m using eq 14 we can derive the following 15 p y t x t c e n y t g x t c e eq 15 indicates that given the state variable x t the model results in an uncertain output owing to the model s structural errors e t the covariance c e gives a measure of the model s uncertainty the measurement y t o b s also has a certain degree of uncertainty which can be expressed as 16 y t o b s y t η t 17 p y t o b s y t c y n y t o b s y t c y where η t is the noise vector η t n 0 c y c y r m m thus the conditional probability density can be expressed by eq 18 subsequently the likelihood function can be easily derived as indicated by eq 19 18 p y t y t o b s x t c y c e p y t x t c e p y t o b s y t c y 19 p y t o b s x t r t p y t y t o b s x t c y c e d y t n y t o b s g x t r t 20 r t c e c y eq 19 is the likelihood function that describes the dependence of y t o b s on x t and r t note that eq 19 is different from the widely used observation function simo and hartikainen 2013 in eq 19 r t contains both the model structural error covariance c e and measurement noise covariance c y eq 20 the separate analysis of c e and c y would complicate the problem here we directly consider r t as a time varying stochastic variable and estimate both x t and r t in real time using the prior and likelihood functions 2 3 joint probability distribution given the prior pdf eq 13 and likelihood function eq 19 the joint pdf takes the following form 21 p x t r t y 0 t o b s p y t o b s x t r t p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s n y t o b s g x t r t n x t x t t 1 p t t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 we aim to estimate the conditional posterior pdfs p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s from the joint pdf p x t r t y 0 t o b s subsequently the expected x t and r t can be calculated by maximizing p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s respectively given p x t r t y 0 t o b s p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s can be calculated using 22 p x t y 0 t o b s p x t r t y 0 t o b s p r t y 0 t o b s d r t 23 p r t y 0 t o b s p x t r t y 0 t o b s p x t y 0 t o b s d x t the integrals in eqs 22 and 23 are quite complex the calculation of p x t y 0 t o b s relies on the calculation of p r t y 0 t o b s and vice versa to address this problem a vb estimation is adopted as described in the following section 2 4 variational bayesian estimation vb estimation is widely used in statistical modeling to estimate the model state variable and adaptively adjust the time varying noise covariance sarkka and nummenmaa 2009 simo and hartikainen 2013 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b in simo and hartikainen 2013 the noise covariance is assumed to be a stochastic variable and obey the inverse wishart iw distribution the pdfs of both the state variable and noise covariance are estimated recursively zhao et al 2019a proposed a scheme for the estimation of real time noise covariance based on the vb framework in which the sensor noises were assumed to be uncorrelated and the system was linear in zhao et al 2019b this method was extended to address correlated noises and nonlinear systems the vb approach adopted in our paper is based on the framework provided by simo and hartikainen 2013 and zhao et al 2019b here we assume that p x t r t y 0 t o b s can be approximated by the product of two independent pdfs simo and hartikainen 2013 zhao et al 2019b 24 p x t r t y 0 t o b s x t o b s q x t q r t where q x t and q r t are the yet unknown approximating pdfs of p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s which can be calculated by minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence between the approximation and true distribution 25 m i n kl q x t q r t p x t r t y 0 t o b s q x t q r t l n q x t q r t p x t r t y 0 t o b s d x t d r t subsequently we obtain the following equations simo and hartikainen 2013 26 l n q x t l n p x t r t y 0 t o b s p y 0 t o b

water demand x t can be estimated using the maximum l n q x t eq 26 and the objective function to compute x t can be expressed as eq 29 29 m i n g x t y t o b s t r t 1 g x t y t o b s x t x t t 1 t p t t 1 1 x t x t t 1 the right hand side of eq 29 consists of two parts the first minimizes the square of weight measurement residual g x t y t o b s and the second minimizes the square of weight prior residual x t x t t 1 this indicates that the estimated nodal water demand should match the measurements and maximize its prior probability distribution because of the nonlinear function g the minimization of eq 29 is complex and x t should be solved iteratively here we directly provide the iterative solutions indicated as eqs 30 33 the detailed proof is available in chu et al 2020 30 δ x t

o b s g x t y t o b s t 40 r t v t α t m 1 eqs 34 and 37 give the estimated conditional posterior probability density for x t and r t however as shown in eq 27 the estimation of q x t relies on the prior estimation of q r t and vice versa therefore eqs 34 and 37 should be estimated iteratively the resulting algorithm is shown in fig 1 and the pseudocode is shown in figure s1 s 2 in the electronic supplementary material 3 results the proposed approach is applied to a hypothetical simple network and a realistic large scale network with field data in the simple network we focus on the modeling attributes to avoid overfitting the model on noisy data the realistic network is used to illustrate the robustness of the algorithm when a model structural error exists in the realistic network in the simple network the directly measured nodal water demands x t o b s and the covariance p τ have been pre acquired and are available in the realistic network the directly measured nodal water demands x t o b s are not used as the automatic metered nodal water demand or the consumer billings are not available for the realistic problems 3 1 case study 1 hypothetical simple network the hypothetical simple network is a steady flow hydraulic model which consists of 8 nodes n 8 11 pipes and 1 reservoir fig 2 the nodes are at a 0 m elevation and the reservoir head is at 50 m the pressures at nodes n3 n5 and n7 are selected as the measured values m 3 a real time simulation of 1500 t 1500 time steps is illustrated here the measured values of y t 1 t o b s are generated by adding the normally distributed random noises to the true values with a standard deviation of std 0 2 m hence the true c y d i a g 0 04 0 04 0 04 which represents the normal operating status of the sensors specifically when the time is 480 t 720 we give an extremely large noise with std 4 m and c y d i a g 16 16 16 indicating that sensors are malfunctioning or the measurements are completely contaminated the model structure is assumed to be accurate with c e d i a g 0 0 0 thus the true value r t is equal to c y with r t d i a g 16 16 16 when 480 t 720 and r t d i a g 0 04 0 04 0 04 for other time steps the directly measured nodal water demands x t 1 t o b s are also generated by adding normally distributed random noises to the true values of the 8 nodal water demands and the stds are 0 4 0 53 1 47 0 13 0 93 0 8 0 93 and 1 47 a comparison between the estimated values and true values is used to evaluate the performance of the approach the following parameters are adopted in the simulations k 25 l 2 m 3 n 8 μ 0 99 a i b μ i p ω d i a g 2 25 2 25 2 25 2 25 2 25 2 25 2 25 2 25 p τ 0 36 0 63 4 86 0 04 1 95 1 44 1 95 4 86 v 0 d i a g 100 100 100 p 0 d i a g 20 20 20 20 20 20 20

corresponding to std 0 2 m fig 3 shows the estimated errors deviation between the estimated and true values for the three measurements the figure indicates that the performance of the bayesian estimation deteriorated significantly while the vb approach exhibits considerable robustness to noise when 480 t 720 during which time extremely large noises std 4 m exist in the measurements gray line the main reason is that the bayesian approach adopts a constant noise covariance while the vb approach dynamically adjusts the noise covariance fig 5 in the bayesian estimation the noise covariance provides a quantitative measure of the operating status of the sensors zhao et al 2019b in the normal operating status t 480 or t 720 the adoption of r t d i a g 0 04 0 04 0 04 may be effective however when 480 t 720 using a constant covariance will result in overfitting on noisy data by contrast the vb approach dynamically magnified the covariance reducing the weight of the measurements and effectively avoiding overfitting on noises fig 4 shows the estimated demand errors at the 8 nodes we observe that when 480 t 720 the demand errors for the bayesian approach are considerable n1 n3 n5 n6 and n7 whereas vb consistently has small estimation errors this result can be explained by the overfitting of the bayesian approach propagating the measurement uncertainties noises to the nodal water demands leading to considerable estimation errors whereas vb adaptively enlarges the covariance in the presence of large noises additionally we observe that errors for both vb and bayesian estimation are smaller than the added noises of the directly measured demands gray line this improvement is attributed to the bayesian framework in the fusion of measurements at n3 n5 and n7 fig 5 presents the estimated stds of the measurements square root of the diagonal element in r t by vb approach when t 480 the stds rapidly converge from the initial to the true value when 480 t 720 the stds are adaptively adjusted to larger values reducing the weight of measurements the mechanism is that the vb approach can use the inherently inconsistent information within the prior and measurements in a bayesian framework the prior pdf attempts to maintain the x t approach to its prior mean value x t t 1 whereas the likelihood function tends to reduce the measurement residuals g x t y t o b s chu et al 2020 the residual implies that conflicting information existed within the data provided by the prior pdf and measurements which can be further illustrated by eq 30 assuming that the noise covariance r t is a diagonal matrix eq 30 can be rewritten as eq 41 41 δ x t k δ x p r i o r δ x o b s 42 δ x o b s i 1 m α i p t k g i k t 43 δ x p r i o r p t k p t t 1 1 x t k x t t 1 44 α i g i x t k y t i o b s r t i i 45 g i k g i x t k x t k where δ x o b s and δ x p r i o r are the demand correctors calculated by the measurements eq 42 and the prior pdf eq 43 g i x t k r 1 is the model output corresponding to the i th sensor y t i o b s r t i i r 1 and g i k r 1 n are the measured value variance and jacobian matrix for sensor i and α i r 1 is the coefficient considering that the corrector is calculated by the measurements shown in eq 42 p t k g i k t and α i are the corrector direction and magnitude respectively eq 42 indicates that the demand corrector calculated from measurements is the sum of p t k g i k t weighted by α i in the presence of large noises or model structural errors the noises or errors will be incorporated into the residual resulting in a wrong p t k g i k t and α i eq 44 leading to an unreasonable estimated result this is the primary cause of the bayesian estimation overfitting on noisy data to further clarify the mechanism of the vb approach eq 41 can be rewritten as eq 46 for a certain sensor i with large noises it s corrector δ x i α i p t k g i k t generally deviates from the corrector caused by other sensors and prior pdf δ x δ x p r i o r j 1 j i m α j p t k g j k t indicating that the information provided by sensor i is inconsistent with the information provided by other sensors and prior pdf in this scenario the vb method will appropriately enlarge r t i i eq 39 which lowers α i eq 44 and avoids overfitting on the noisy data for sensor i 46 δ x t k α i p i k g i k t δ x p r i o r j 1 j i m α j p t k g j k t 3 2 case study 2 realistic large scale network case study 2 is a realistic large scale network in the city of zhejiang province china the network consists of 3 reservoirs 4242 nodes and 4841 pipes as shown in fig 6 the network has installed 63 pressure sensors to collect pressure data every 15 minutes among the 63 pressure sensors 48 pressure sensors are used to estimate the nodal water demand and the remaining 15 are used to validate the estimation accuracy the measured pressure data from february 1 2020 to february 6 2020 5 days are used to estimate nodal water demand the pipe roughness is estimated based on the ages and materials of the pipes bhave and gupta 2006 in this case study the directly measured nodal water demand x t o b s are not used as the automatic metered nodal water demand and the consumer billings are not available for the realistic problems here x t o b s is directly set to be 0 and the diagonal element of p τ is set to be a large value p τ d i a g 10000 10000 giving x t o b s a minor weight in eq 8 as mentioned previously the sensors collect pressure data every 15 minutes thus the time step is 15 minutes and 480 simulations 5 days are performed in this case study for each time step the following parameters are used k 10 l 2 m 67 n 4242 μ 0 99 a i b μ i p ω d i a g 0 0001 0 0001 v 0 d i a g 150 150 p 0 d i a g 25 25 x 0 1 0 1 0 α 0 10 for comparison the modeling results that are estimated by bayesian inference shao et al 2019 in which the noise std or covariance are given priority as a constant are presented to give a comprehensive comparison three different scenarios with sensor noise std 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 are designed for the bayesian inference method details are listed in table s1 s 3 in the electronic supplementary material 3 2 1 modeling accuracy for the realistic problem table s1 gives the estimated noise stds and the average absolute residuals aars of 480 simulations 5 days for the 48 estimation sensors table s2 s 3 in the electronic supplementary material gives the aars for the 15 validation sensors besides the comparison of measured and estimated nodal pressure for the estimation sensors and validation sensors are shown in figures s2 s49 s 4 in the electronic supplementary material and figures s50 s64 s 5 in the electronic supplementary material as shown in table s1 for most sensors the pressure residuals are within 0 8 m this implies that the developed vb approach can efficiently solve the estimation problem by minimizing the residuals between the measurements and model outputs the estimation accuracy is further validated by the 15 validation sensors that were not included within the estimation process as shown in table s2 the majority of the pressure residuals of the 15 validation sensors are within 0 7m with the largest residual being 1 12m this indicates that the estimation is successful as the pressure residuals are lower than the criteria 2m for all sensors specified by the water research centre 1989 3 2 2 residual decomposition in finding model structural errors as can be seen from table s1 for most sensors the estimated stds are below 0 7m indicating that the noises are relatively small and the measured data is accurate however we also find that the aar and std for 47 sensor are 3 98m and 2 84m which are much greater than other sensors as stated in case study 1 in the presence of large noises or model structural errors the vb method will appropriately enlarge the std of the sensor noise therefore the enlargement of the noise std usually indicates the existence of large noises or model structural errors thus we conclude that there are huge noises at 47 sensor or errors in the model structures residual decomposition is an efficient method in distinguishing the measurement noise and model structural error this is because the vb method is an unbiased estimation approach given unbiased measurements mean of the noise is 0 the residuals deviation between the estimated pressure and measured pressure will be unbiased however once a biased disturbance is given in the model or measurements the residuals will also be biased considering the measurement noise is typically unbiased it will result in unbiased residuals on the contrary the model structural error is generally a biased disturbance leading to a biased residual for example errors in pipe diameter or nodal elevation will cause biased disturbances in nodal pressure residual decomposition helps to find the measurement noises and model errors as can be seen from fig 7 the residuals the left figure of 47 sensor can be divided into three parts the right figure namely the unbiased residuals biased residuals and periodic residuals the biased residuals are the mean values of the residuals by subtracting the biased residuals from the total residuals the rest of the residuals can be divided into periodic residuals and unbiased residuals where the mean value of unbiased residuals is 0 the periodic residuals show the periodic variation of residuals the mechanism of the periodic variation has not been explored we guess that this is because the pipe roughness is not well calibrated here we focus on the analysis of the biased and unbiased residuals as shown in fig 7 the aar of the unbiased residuals is a relatively small value 0 16m indicating a small noise intensity the biased residuals are large 3 98m implying that there is an error in the model structure up to now we can conclude that there are faults in the model structure fortunately this has been validated by the field investigation after the investigation we found that the actual position of 47 sensor is on a small pipe to the right of the current position after the model structural simplification the small pipe is removed and 47 sensor was mistakenly placed on the nearest large diameter pipe current position resulting in a sensor position error the actual elevation of the 47 sensor is higher than the elevation in the hydraulic model current position as the small pipe supplies water to areas with higher terrain therefore the sensor position error further causes the elevation error the elevation error makes the estimated pressures much higher than the measured values figure s 48 this suggests that the model structural error may be one of the main reasons for the non convergence of the demand estimation algorithm we would like to emphasize that accurate identification of the model structural errors is still a complex problem because the biased residuals can be caused by different model faults such as sensor position errors nodal elevation errors or pipe diameter errors the model errors may be located by using engineering experiences for example checking the status of the surrounding valves or the nodal elevation 3 2 3 robustness analysis by comparison with bayesian approach table s1 and s2 also give the estimated results by bayesian inference shao et al 2019 more detailed results of the 480 time steps for each sensor are shown in figures s2 s49 s 4 in the electronic supplementary material and figures s50 s64 s 5 in the electronic supplementary material as can be seen from table s1 for most sensors the bayesian method has similar performance comparing with the vb method however as for 47 sensor the aar for the bayesian method is larger than the vb method the main reason is that the same std is adopted for all the sensors in the bayesian approach while the vb approach can adaptively enlarge the std or variance in the presence of large noises or model errors as can be seen from eq 29 the demand estimation is achieved by minimizing the measurement residual g x t y t o b s weighted by the inverse of the covariance matrix r t 1 for the bayesian approach the weights of all the sensors are the same as the same std is adopted therefore the bayesian approach is easier to make the estimated values match the measured value at 47 sensor figure s48 unfortunately the matching at 47 sensor is considerably misleading as the position and elevation of 47 sensor are wrong with the existence of the model structural errors this matching usually means overfitting in this case the estimated value tries to match with the measurements but deviates from the real value compared with the bayesian approach the vb approach adaptively enlarges the std 2 84 m of 47 sensor reducing the weight of 47 sensor therefore vb approach can avoid overfitting on the measurements of 47 sensor and achieve more reliable estimation results as can be seen from table s1 the aars of the estimation sensors at 20 22 32 34 35 and 48 which are around 47 sensors see fig 6 are greater than vb approach a similar phenomenon is found at validation sensors as can be seen from table s2 the aars of the validation sensors at 3 7 and 10 which are also around 47 sensors are greater than the vb approach the developed adaptive method is more robust to model structural errors and is expected to be more efficient when dealing with the realistic problem 3 3 discussion this study investigates a robust estimation framework for the estimation of nodal water demands which estimates nodal water demands and noise covariance simultaneously in real time based on the two cases presented above the features of this approach are discussed in the following this approach can automatically adjust the noise covariance with a change in noise intensity and avoid overfitting on noisy data the mechanism of the vb approach can be expounded from the inherent characteristic of the bayesian method in the bayesian method the estimated nodal water demands should match the measurements and maximize the prior probability distribution eq 29 the prior probability distribution can maintain the nodal water demands adjusted within a domain that has a higher prior probability density the prior mean value x t t 1 whereas the likelihood function attempts to adjust the nodal water demands to match the measurements eq 29 the competitive ability in the prior and likelihood functions is quantified by their covariance matrices p t t 1 and r t the residual of the i th sensor usually implies that the demand correction δ x i α i p t k g i k t caused by the i th sensor deviates from the corrections of other measurements or prior thus indicating that considerable noises or errors existed in the measurement or model structure in this scenario the vb approach appropriately enlarges the noise covariance eq 39 reducing the competitive ability of the corresponding measurement and avoiding overfitting on the noises this mechanism makes it more flexible and robust when addressing model structural errors or time varying noises this approach exhibits significant potential in determining model structural errors the estimated covariance can help to find the existence of noises or model errors as the excessive std usually means that the sensor or model is faulty when the faults in the system are determined a residual decomposition will be adopted to explain their sources the decomposition method divided the residuals into three parts namely the unbiased residuals biased residuals and periodic residuals the mean value of the sensor noises is generally 0 0 mean while the model structural error is generally biased disturbance therefore an unbiased residual indicates a faulty sensor whereas a biased residual usually corresponds to a model structural error the above procedure can determine whether the measurement or model is faulty however accurate identification of the model errors is a complex problem the model error may be located by hydraulic analysis or using engineering experiences in case study 2 the estimated std and aar for 47 sensor are very large while the sensors 20 22 and 3 around 47 sensor achieve good performance in matching the measurement table s1 and s2 as shown in figure s48 for 47 sensor there is a large deviation between the measured pressure black line and the estimated pressure red line however the deviations of 20 22 and 3 sensors figure s21 s23 and s52 are much less than 47 sensor this indicates that the model error location is closely related to 47 sensor in hydraulics but not related to the surrounding sensors 20 22 and 3 this helps to narrow down the location of the model error we just compared the model topological structure around 47 sensor with the gis system and found the sensor position fault 4 conclusions the estimation of nodal water demands is a critical step for the real time modeling of wdss the noises and errors in the measurement and model structure are the key factors restricting the application of real time models this study provided an efficient method for the robust modeling of wdss by taking into consideration noises and errors in the measurement and model structure the developed variational bayesian approach can estimate the nodal water demands and noise covariance in real time in this approach the noise covariance is estimated adaptively with the variation in noise intensity when considerable noise or model errors exist in the measurements this approach can enlarge the noise covariance reducing the weight of the measurement and avoiding the overfitting on the noisy data moreover the estimated covariance can aid in determining the faults errors in sensors or model structures based on the measurement residual decomposition the 0 mean residual indicates that considerable noises exist in the measurements whereas the biased residuals correspond to the model structural errors this is useful for the fault detection of wds model structural or sensor networks however accurate locating of the model errors is a complex problem and beyond the scope of this paper and a more efficient

17188,hydraulic models have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating the real behavior of water distribution systems wdss in using the models for estimating nodal water demands measurement uncertainty must be considered a common approach is to use the covariance of measurement noises to quantify the measurement uncertainty the noise covariance is typically assumed constant and estimated a priori however such an assumption is frequently misleading as actual measurement accuracies are affected by measuring instruments and environmental noises in this study we develop a variational bayesian approach for real time estimation of noise covariance and nodal water demands the approach can adaptively adjust the noise covariance with the variation of the noise intensity thereby efficiently avoiding model overfitting the measurement residual decomposition reveals that this new approach is effective in determining model structural errors caused by topological structure parameterization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords variational bayesian noise covariance nodal water demands model structural errors 1 introduction water distribution systems wdss are essential infrastructures that are used for transporting drinking water to various residential and business consumers while satisfying requirements such as achieving sufficient tap pressure zhao et al 2016 with an increase in urban population such systems encounter numerous challenges which include pipe bursts contamination and excessive energy consumption nerantzis et al 2020 these challenges highlight the demands for the control and management of wdss in the past decades steady flow hydraulic models have been widely implemented to address the system analysis design and operation of wdss the steady flow hydraulic wds models which can dynamically simulate the behavior of hydraulic and water quality conditions have been widely studied in recent years with the consistent development of remote metering technologies real time estimation of state variables making the model capable of replicating the system performance at a certain accuracy du et al 2018 is a critical step before implementing the models in actual applications as the most uncertain state variables nodal water demands vary with time and can significantly affect the model accuracy shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 real time estimation of nodal water demands is one of the most significant challenges for the real time modeling of wdss nodal water demands can be estimated by adjusting them in a direction to make the model outputs match the real time measurements ostfeld et al 2012 generally this problem involves thousands of nodal water demands having highly variable and stochastic behavior but gauged measurements are obtained at only a few selected locations kang and lansey 2009 preis et al 2011 this leads to the ill conditioning problem of having an insufficient number of measurements to calculate the unique solution in the feasible domain chu et al 2020 which in turn has motivated several researchers to develop efficient algorithms to make the systems solvable three commonly used methods have been developed to estimate nodal water demands trial and error explicit and optimization methods du et al 2018 the trial and error method adjusts the nodal water demands manually through engineering experience and domain knowledge this traditional method can be easily operated however the procedure must be repeated frequently and is time consuming for large scale networks limiting its application in real time modeling of wdss alternatively the explicit method was developed to increase computational efficiency it explicitly solves an extended set of hydraulic equations to identify unknown state variables ormsbee and wood 1986 although this method is computationally efficient the equations can only be solved when the number of unknown state variables is equal to the number of measurements moreover it cannot consider measurement uncertainties leading to overfitting in the case of noisy measured data in the optimization method the nodal water demands are considered as decision variables and an objective function is formulated to reduce the deviation between the model outputs and measurements examples include evolutionary algorithm ea based methods di nardo et al 2015 do et al 2016 and sensitivity matrix based methods cheng and he 2011 chu et al 2020 shao et al 2019 although ea based methods have been successfully implemented to address demand estimation problems their applications are not without difficulties one of the challenges encountered is that computational overheads required by eas to identify optimal solutions are intensive because of the inherently stochastic nature of eas in searching behavior and the high complexity associated with the increase in the number of decision variables particularly for large scale networks lin et al 2020 zheng et al 2017 sensitivity matrix based methods are more computationally efficient than ea based methods however the estimation of nodal water demands is an ill conditioning problem as the number of measurements is significantly less than the number of unknown state variables thus the estimated value is one of the numerous feasible solutions although the estimated result performs well in matching the measurements the nodal water demands are frequently beyond the acceptable range recently data assimilation methods were adopted to address the problem of ill conditioning in real time modeling of wdss examples include the markov chain monte carlo algorithm malve et al 2007 qin and boccelli 2019 particle filter algorithm do et al 2017 xie et al 2017 kalman filter algorithm kang and lansey 2009 zhou et al 2018 ensemble kalman filter algorithm rajakumar et al 2019 shang et al 2008 and extended kalman filter algorithm shang et al 2008 these algorithms propagate the model forward from a previous time step to the current time step this involves two update stages namely the prediction and correction stages hutton et al 2014 the prediction stage provides a prior distribution for the nodal water demands through a prediction from the previous time step the prior distribution is further corrected using the measurements in the correction stage compared with the optimization methods the incorporation of the prior distribution makes the system solvable and reduces system uncertainties therefore data assimilation methods were observed to perform better than other demand estimation methods liu et al 2012 rajakumar et al 2019 although the abovementioned methods can solve the problem of ill conditioning their applications are limited particularly for realistic problems the primary challenge is that both the measurements and the mathematical model contain considerable noises or errors hutton et al 2014 sensors distributed over a network can log real time data to estimate nodal water demands abokifa et al 2019 rajakumar et al 2019 however the measured data are inevitably polluted by background noises leading to a degradation in data quality wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the estimation of nodal water demands from noisy data is a challenging problem in real time modeling and control rosen and medvedev 2013 for the estimation of nodal water demands noisy data are treated as stochastic variables noise covariance is a critical parameter to quantify noise intensity previous studies generally assumed a constant noise covariance and estimated it a priori bragalli et al 2016 du et al 2015 kapelan et al 2007 kumar et al 2010 however in actual applications it is unreasonable to have an exact knowledge of noise statistics sarkka and nummenmaa 2009 zhao et al 2019b measurement noises are generally affected by time varying background noises and equipment properties thus the accuracy of the measurement gradually deteriorates as the service life increases this indicates that covariance is also a time varying variable considering it as a constant is a major shortcoming of previous studies hence a robust estimation must consider the variation in covariance the challenge is to simultaneously estimate the noise covariance and nodal water demands in real time zhao et al 2019b undertaking the modeling required to address noisy data as mentioned above is particularly difficult when the model structure itself has considerable errors the design of topological structures in model parameterization including nodal elevation pipe diameter valve status and pipe length can cause structural errors in the model chu et al 2020 hutton et al 2014 shao et al 2019 wds hydraulic model is complex dynamic and nonlinear despite the best efforts errors easily creep into a model walski 2019 leading to incorrect model outputs some studies e g piller et al 2010 indicated that model structural errors significantly reduce estimation accuracy the quantification of the uncertainty of the wds model structure is important but difficult managing model structural errors is another challenge for the real time modeling of wdss to date research for the estimation of nodal water demands in the presence of such problems has received insufficient interest the primary aim of this study is to propose an efficient method for the robust modeling of wdss which can estimate the nodal water demands and noise covariance simultaneously in real time to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to study the real time modeling problem of wdss with consideration to the estimation of noise covariance this method can adaptively estimate noise covariance with variation in noise intensity efficiently avoiding overfitting the model on noisy data based on the measurement residual decomposition this method exhibits significant potential in determining model structural errors the developed method is expected to increase the accuracy of wds modeling in the presence of both measurement noises and model structural errors 2 material and methods the methodology developed in this study is a framework to estimate the nodal water demands and noise covariance in real time using a variational bayesian vb method the methodology begins with the formulation of the prior probability density function pdf for the nodal water demands and noise covariance this is followed by the definition of a likelihood function using a fusion of the measurements with the prior pdf and the likelihood function the joint pdf of the two parameters can be formulated using bayesian formulation a vb approach is adopted to estimate the conditional posterior pdf of the nodal water demands and noise covariance from the joint pdf 2 1 prior probability distribution consider a dynamic markov process in which the nodal water demands at the current time step t can be predicted from the previous time step t 1 1 x t a x t 1 ω where x t r n is the nodal water demand vector to be estimated a r n n is the prediction matrix ω r n is the vector of prediction errors ω n 0 p ω p ω r n n n is the number of nodal water demands and t is the time step accordingly the pdf can be expressed as 2 p x t y 0 t 1 o b s n x t a x t 1 p t t 1 3 p t t 1 a p t 1 a t p ω where p t 1 r n n is the covariance for x t 1 p t t 1 r n n is the predicted covariance y t o b s r m is the measurement vector m is the number of measurements n is the normal distribution in practice the increasing use of automatic meter reading equipment provides a direct mean to get real time water demands x t creaco et al 2016 moreover consumer billings can be used to directly estimate nodal water demands for example based on the water usage proportion calculated from months of billing the total real time water demand for a district meter area dma can be decomposed and re distributed to each node as measured nodal water demand the fusion of the directly measured nodal water demand in the demand estimation process can aid in improving the modeling accuracy we denote the directly measured nodal water demands as x t o b s r n and we obtain 4 x t x t o b s τ t 5 p x t x t o b s n x t x t o b s p τ where τ t r n are the noises of the directly measured nodal water demands τ t n 0 p τ p τ r n n note that although x t o b s provides a direct measure of the nodal water demands its accuracy may be very low hence it has to be coupled with real time measured nodal pressure and pipe flow rate to increase modeling accuracy accordingly eq 5 can be derived from eq 4 furthermore the prior pdf for x t has the form of 6 p x t y 0 t 1 o b s x t o b s p x t x t o b s p x t y 0 t 1 o b s n x t x t t 1 p t t 1 7 p t t 1 p t t 1 1 p τ 1 1 8 x t t 1 p t t 1 p t t 1 1 a x t 1 p τ 1 x t o b s where p t t 1 1 and p τ 1 are the matrix inversion of the matrix p t t 1 and p τ respectively eqs 7 and 8 give the formulations to calculate the covariance p t t 1 and expectation value x t t 1 of the prior pdf errors or noises in model structures or measurements can propagate into the estimated nodal water demands by comparing model outputs with the measurements as discussed in the following section distinguishing the source of the errors is difficult as errors in the model structure and the noises in field measurements are equally critical explicitly analyzing the error sources complicates the problem temporarily we assume that there is no distinction between the two types of errors and that the errors obey the normal distribution n 0 r t r t r m m is the covariance to be estimated using the framework provided by simo and hartikainen 2013 we assume that r t obeys the inverse wishart distribution iw 9 p r t y 0 t o b s i w r t α t v t where v t r m m is a positive definite matrix α t is a time varying variable α m 1 for the current time step both α t and v t can be predicted from the previous time step t 1 the prediction of α t and v t can be calculated from eqs 10 and 11 zhao et al 2019b 10 α t t 1 μ α t 1 m 1 m 1 11 v t t 1 b v t 1 b t where α t t 1 and v t t 1 are the predicted values μ is introduced to prorogate from t 1 to t 0 μ 1 b μ i subsequently the prior pdf for r t can be expressed as 12 p r t y 0 t 1 o b s i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 here the prior pdf of x t and r t can be derived from eqs 6 and 12 denoting p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s x t o b s as p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s we can obtain 13 p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s n x t x t t 1 p t t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 eq 13 results in a prior pdf for the state variables x t and r t subsequently the prior pdf can be further supplemented by the likelihood driven by the measurements that will change the probability distribution of x t and r t and thus generally reduce the uncertainty law et al 2015 2 2 likelihood function owing to the errors in the wds model structure the outputs of the model generally differ from true values 14 y t g x t e t where y t r m represents the true value g r m is the output of the wds hydraulic model e t r m are the normally distributed errors and e t n 0 c e c e r m m using eq 14 we can derive the following 15 p y t x t c e n y t g x t c e eq 15 indicates that given the state variable x t the model results in an uncertain output owing to the model s structural errors e t the covariance c e gives a measure of the model s uncertainty the measurement y t o b s also has a certain degree of uncertainty which can be expressed as 16 y t o b s y t η t 17 p y t o b s y t c y n y t o b s y t c y where η t is the noise vector η t n 0 c y c y r m m thus the conditional probability density can be expressed by eq 18 subsequently the likelihood function can be easily derived as indicated by eq 19 18 p y t y t o b s x t c y c e p y t x t c e p y t o b s y t c y 19 p y t o b s x t r t p y t y t o b s x t c y c e d y t n y t o b s g x t r t 20 r t c e c y eq 19 is the likelihood function that describes the dependence of y t o b s on x t and r t note that eq 19 is different from the widely used observation function simo and hartikainen 2013 in eq 19 r t contains both the model structural error covariance c e and measurement noise covariance c y eq 20 the separate analysis of c e and c y would complicate the problem here we directly consider r t as a time varying stochastic variable and estimate both x t and r t in real time using the prior and likelihood functions 2 3 joint probability distribution given the prior pdf eq 13 and likelihood function eq 19 the joint pdf takes the following form 21 p x t r t y 0 t o b s p y t o b s x t r t p x t r t y 0 t 1 o b s n y t o b s g x t r t n x t x t t 1 p t t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 we aim to estimate the conditional posterior pdfs p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s from the joint pdf p x t r t y 0 t o b s subsequently the expected x t and r t can be calculated by maximizing p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s respectively given p x t r t y 0 t o b s p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s can be calculated using 22 p x t y 0 t o b s p x t r t y 0 t o b s p r t y 0 t o b s d r t 23 p r t y 0 t o b s p x t r t y 0 t o b s p x t y 0 t o b s d x t the integrals in eqs 22 and 23 are quite complex the calculation of p x t y 0 t o b s relies on the calculation of p r t y 0 t o b s and vice versa to address this problem a vb estimation is adopted as described in the following section 2 4 variational bayesian estimation vb estimation is widely used in statistical modeling to estimate the model state variable and adaptively adjust the time varying noise covariance sarkka and nummenmaa 2009 simo and hartikainen 2013 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b in simo and hartikainen 2013 the noise covariance is assumed to be a stochastic variable and obey the inverse wishart iw distribution the pdfs of both the state variable and noise covariance are estimated recursively zhao et al 2019a proposed a scheme for the estimation of real time noise covariance based on the vb framework in which the sensor noises were assumed to be uncorrelated and the system was linear in zhao et al 2019b this method was extended to address correlated noises and nonlinear systems the vb approach adopted in our paper is based on the framework provided by simo and hartikainen 2013 and zhao et al 2019b here we assume that p x t r t y 0 t o b s can be approximated by the product of two independent pdfs simo and hartikainen 2013 zhao et al 2019b 24 p x t r t y 0 t o b s x t o b s q x t q r t where q x t and q r t are the yet unknown approximating pdfs of p x t y 0 t o b s and p r t y 0 t o b s which can be calculated by minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence between the approximation and true distribution 25 m i n kl q x t q r t p x t r

water demand x t can be estimated using the maximum l n q x t eq 26 and the objective function to compute x t can be expressed as eq 29 29 m i n g x t y t o b s t r t 1 g x t y t o b s x t x t t 1 t p t t 1 1 x t x t t 1 the right hand side of eq 29 consists of two parts the first minimizes the square of weight measurement residual g x t y t o b s and the second minimizes the square of weight prior residual x t x t t 1 this indicates that the estimated nodal water demand should match the measurements and maximize its prior probability distribution because of the nonlinear function g the minimization of eq 29 is complex and x t should be solved iteratively here we directly provide the iterative solutions indicated as eqs 30 33 the detailed proof is available in chu et al 2020 30 δ x t

prior estimation of q r t and vice versa therefore eqs 34 and 37 should be estimated iteratively the resulting algorithm is shown in fig 1 and the pseudocode is shown in figure s1 s 2 in the electronic supplementary material 3 results the proposed approach is applied to a hypothetical simple network and a realistic large scale network with field data in the simple network we focus on the modeling attributes to avoid overfitting the model on noisy data the realistic network is used to illustrate the robustness of the algorithm when a model structural error exists in the realistic network in the simple network the directly measured nodal water demands x t o b s and the covariance p τ have been pre acquired and are available in the realistic network the directly measured nodal water demands x t o b s are not used as the automatic metered nodal water demand or the consumer billings are not available for the realistic problems 3 1 case study 1 hypothetical simple network the hypothetical simple network is a steady flow hydraulic model which consists of 8 nodes n 8 11 pipes and 1 reservoir fig 2 the nodes are at a 0 m elevation and the reservoir head is at 50 m the pressures at nodes n3 n5 and n7 are selected as the measured values m 3 a real time simulation of 1500 t 1500 time steps is illustrated here the measured values of y t 1 t o b s are generated by adding the normally distributed random noises to the true values with a standard deviation of std 0 2 m hence the true c y d i a g 0 04 0 04 0 04 which represents the normal operating status of the sensors specifically when the time is 480 t 720 we give an extremely large noise with std 4 m and c y d i a g 16 16 16 indicating that sensors are malfunctioning or the measurements are completely contaminated the model structure is assumed to be accurate with c e d i a g 0 0 0 thus the true value r t is equal to c y with r t d i a g 16 16 16 when 480 t 720 and r t d i a g 0 04 0 04 0 04 for other time steps the directly measured nodal water demands x t 1 t o b s are also generated by adding normally distributed random noises to the true values of the 8 nodal water demands and the stds are 0 4 0 53 1 47 0 13 0 93 0 8 0 93 and 1 47 a comparison between the estimated values and true values is used to evaluate the performance of the approach the following parameters are adopted in the

corresponding to std 0 2 m fig 3 shows the estimated errors deviation between the estimated and true values for the three measurements the figure indicates that the performance of the bayesian estimation deteriorated significantly while the vb approach exhibits considerable robustness to noise when 480 t 720 during which time extremely large noises std 4 m exist in the measurements gray line the main reason is that the bayesian approach adopts a constant noise covariance while the vb approach dynamically adjusts the noise covariance fig 5 in the bayesian estimation the noise covariance provides a quantitative measure of the operating status of the sensors zhao et al 2019b in the normal operating status t 480 or t 720 the adoption of r t d i a g 0 04 0 04 0 04 may be effective however when 480 t 720 using a constant covariance will result in overfitting on noisy data by contrast the vb approach dynamically magnified the covariance reducing the weight of the measurements and effectively avoiding overfitting on noises fig 4 shows the estimated demand errors at the 8 nodes we observe that when 480 t 720 the demand errors for the bayesian approach are considerable n1 n3 n5 n6 and n7 whereas vb consistently has small estimation errors this result can be explained by the overfitting of the bayesian approach propagating the measurement uncertainties noises to the nodal water demands leading to considerable estimation errors whereas vb adaptively enlarges the covariance in the presence of large noises additionally we observe that errors for both vb and bayesian estimation are smaller than the added noises of the directly measured demands gray line this improvement is attributed to the bayesian framework in the fusion of measurements at n3 n5 and n7 fig 5 presents the estimated stds of the measurements square root of the diagonal element in r t by vb approach when t 480 the stds rapidly converge from the initial to the true value when 480 t 720 the stds are adaptively adjusted to larger values reducing the weight of measurements the mechanism is that the vb approach can use the inherently inconsistent information within the prior and measurements in a bayesian framework the prior pdf attempts to maintain the x t approach to its prior mean value x t t 1 whereas the likelihood function tends to reduce the measurement residuals g x t y t o b s chu et al 2020 the residual implies that conflicting information existed within the data provided by the prior pdf and measurements which can be further illustrated by eq 30 assuming that the noise covariance r t is a diagonal matrix eq 30 can be rewritten as eq 41 41 δ x t k δ x p r i o r δ x o b s 42 δ x o b s i 1 m α i p t k g i k t 43 δ x p r i o r p t k p t t 1 1 x t k x t t 1 44 α i g i x t k y t i o b s r t i i 45 g i k g i x t k x t k where δ x o b s and δ x p r i o r are the demand correctors calculated by the measurements eq 42 and the prior pdf eq 43 g i x t k r 1 is the model output corresponding to the i th sensor y t i o b s r t i i r 1 and g i k r 1 n are the measured value variance and jacobian matrix for sensor i and α i r 1 is the coefficient considering that the corrector is calculated by the measurements shown in eq 42 p t k g i k t and α i are the corrector direction and magnitude respectively eq 42 indicates that the demand corrector calculated from measurements is the sum of p t k g i k t weighted by α i in the presence of large noises or model structural errors the noises or errors will be incorporated into the residual resulting in a wrong p t k g i k t and α i eq 44 leading to an unreasonable estimated result this is the primary cause of the bayesian estimation overfitting on noisy data to further clarify the mechanism of the vb approach eq 41 can be rewritten as eq 46 for a certain sensor i with large noises it s corrector δ x i α i p t k g i k t generally deviates from the corrector caused by other sensors and prior pdf δ x δ x p r i o r j 1 j i m α j p t k g j k t indicating that the information provided by sensor i is inconsistent with the information provided by other sensors and prior pdf in this scenario the vb method will appropriately enlarge r t i i eq 39 which lowers α i eq 44 and avoids overfitting on the noisy data for sensor i 46 δ x t k α i p i k g i k t δ x p r i o r j 1 j i m α j p t k g j k t 3 2 case study 2 realistic large scale network case study 2 is a realistic large scale network in the city of zhejiang province china the network consists of 3 reservoirs 4242 nodes and 4841 pipes as shown in fig 6 the network has installed 63 pressure sensors to collect pressure data every 15 minutes among the 63 pressure sensors 48 pressure sensors are used to estimate the nodal water demand and the remaining 15 are used to validate the estimation accuracy the measured pressure data from february 1 2020 to february 6 2020 5 days are used to estimate nodal water demand the pipe roughness is estimated based on the ages and materials of the pipes bhave and gupta 2006 in this case study the directly measured nodal water demand x t o b s are not used as the automatic metered nodal water demand and the consumer billings are not available for the realistic problems here x t o b s is directly set to be 0 and the diagonal element of p τ is set to be a large value p τ d i a g 10000 10000 giving x t o b s a minor weight in eq 8 as mentioned previously the sensors collect pressure data every 15 minutes thus the time step is 15 minutes and 480 simulations 5 days are performed in this case study for each time step the following parameters are used k 10 l 2 m 67 n 4242 μ 0 99 a i b μ i p ω d i a g 0 0001 0 0001 v 0 d i a g 150 150 p 0 d i a g 25 25 x 0 1 0 1 0 α 0 10 for comparison the modeling results that are estimated by bayesian inference shao et al 2019 in which the noise std or covariance are given priority as a constant are presented to give a comprehensive comparison three different scenarios with sensor noise std 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 are designed for the bayesian inference method details are listed in table s1 s 3 in the electronic supplementary material 3 2 1 modeling accuracy for the realistic problem table s1 gives the estimated noise stds and the average absolute residuals aars of 480 simulations 5 days for the 48 estimation sensors table s2 s 3 in the electronic supplementary material gives the aars for the 15 validation sensors besides the comparison of measured and estimated nodal pressure for the estimation sensors and validation sensors are shown in figures s2 s49 s 4 in the electronic supplementary material and figures s50 s64 s 5 in the electronic supplementary material as shown in table s1 for most sensors the pressure residuals are within 0 8 m this implies that the developed vb approach can efficiently solve the estimation problem by minimizing the residuals between the measurements and model outputs the estimation accuracy is further validated by the 15 validation sensors that were not included within the estimation process as shown in table s2 the majority of the pressure residuals of the 15 validation sensors are within 0 7m with the largest residual being 1 12m this indicates that the estimation is successful as the pressure residuals are lower than the criteria 2m for all sensors specified by the water research centre 1989 3 2 2 residual decomposition in finding model structural errors as can be seen from table s1 for most sensors the estimated stds are below 0 7m indicating that the noises are relatively small and the measured data is accurate however we also find that the aar and std for 47 sensor are 3 98m and 2 84m which are much greater than other sensors as stated in case study 1 in the presence of large noises or model structural errors the vb method will appropriately enlarge the std of the sensor noise therefore the enlargement of the noise std usually indicates the existence of large noises or model structural errors thus we conclude that there are huge noises at 47 sensor or errors in the model structures residual decomposition is an efficient method in distinguishing the measurement noise and model structural error this is because the vb method is an unbiased estimation approach given unbiased measurements mean of the noise is 0 the residuals deviation between the estimated pressure and measured pressure will be unbiased however once a biased disturbance is given in the model or measurements the residuals will also be biased considering the measurement noise is typically unbiased it will result in unbiased residuals on the contrary the model structural error is generally a biased disturbance leading to a biased residual for example errors in pipe diameter or nodal elevation will cause biased disturbances in nodal pressure residual decomposition helps to find the measurement noises and model errors as can be seen from fig 7 the residuals the left figure of 47 sensor can be divided into three parts the right figure namely the unbiased residuals biased residuals and periodic residuals the biased residuals are the mean values of the residuals by subtracting the biased residuals from the total residuals the rest of the residuals can be divided into periodic residuals and unbiased residuals where the mean value of unbiased residuals is 0 the periodic residuals show the periodic variation of residuals the mechanism of the periodic variation has not been explored we guess that this is because the pipe roughness is not well calibrated here we focus on the analysis of the biased and unbiased residuals as shown in fig 7 the aar of the unbiased residuals is a relatively small value 0 16m indicating a small noise intensity the biased residuals are large 3 98m implying that there is an error in the model structure up to now we can conclude that there are faults in the model structure fortunately this has been validated by the field investigation after the investigation we found that the actual position of 47 sensor is on a small pipe to the right of the current position after the model structural simplification the small pipe is removed and 47 sensor was mistakenly placed on the nearest large diameter pipe current position resulting in a sensor position error the actual elevation of the 47 sensor is higher than the elevation in the hydraulic model current position as the small pipe supplies water to areas with higher terrain therefore the sensor position error further causes the elevation error the elevation error makes the estimated pressures much higher than the measured values figure s 48 this suggests that the model structural error may be one of the main reasons for the non convergence of the demand estimation algorithm we would like to emphasize that accurate identification of the model structural errors is still a complex problem because the biased residuals can be caused by different model faults such as sensor position errors nodal elevation errors or pipe diameter errors the model errors may be located by using engineering experiences for example checking the status of the surrounding valves or the nodal elevation 3 2 3 robustness analysis by comparison with bayesian approach table s1 and s2 also give the estimated results by bayesian inference shao et al 2019 more detailed results of the 480 time steps for each sensor are shown in figures s2 s49 s 4 in the electronic supplementary material and figures s50 s64 s 5 in the electronic supplementary material as can be seen from table s1 for most sensors the bayesian method has similar performance comparing with the vb method however as for 47 sensor the aar for the bayesian method is larger than the vb method the main reason is that the same std is adopted for all the sensors in the bayesian approach while the vb approach can adaptively enlarge the std or variance in the presence of large noises or model errors as can be seen from eq 29 the demand estimation is achieved by minimizing the measurement residual g x t y t o b s weighted by the inverse of the covariance matrix r t 1 for the bayesian approach the weights of all the sensors are the same as the same std is adopted therefore the bayesian approach is easier to make the estimated values match the measured value at 47 sensor figure s48 unfortunately the matching at 47 sensor is considerably misleading as the position and elevation of 47 sensor are wrong with the existence of the model structural errors this matching usually means overfitting in this case the estimated value tries to match with the measurements but deviates from the real value compared with the bayesian approach the vb approach adaptively enlarges the std 2 84 m of 47 sensor reducing the weight of 47 sensor therefore vb approach can avoid overfitting on the measurements of 47 sensor and achieve more reliable estimation results as can be seen from table s1 the aars of the estimation sensors at 20 22 32 34 35 and 48 which are around 47 sensors see fig 6 are greater than vb approach a similar phenomenon is found at validation sensors as can be seen from table s2 the aars of the validation sensors at 3 7 and 10 which are also around 47 sensors are greater than the vb approach the developed adaptive method is more robust to model structural errors and is expected to be more efficient when dealing with the realistic problem 3 3 discussion this study investigates a robust estimation framework for the estimation of nodal water demands which estimates nodal water demands and noise covariance simultaneously in real time based on the two cases presented above the features of this approach are discussed in the following this approach can automatically adjust the noise covariance with a change in noise intensity and avoid overfitting on noisy data the mechanism of the vb approach can be expounded from the inherent characteristic of the bayesian method in the bayesian method the estimated nodal water demands should match the measurements and maximize the prior probability distribution eq 29 the prior probability distribution can maintain the nodal water demands adjusted within a domain that has a higher prior probability density the prior mean value x t t 1 whereas the likelihood function attempts to adjust the nodal water demands to match the measurements eq 29 the competitive ability in the prior and likelihood functions is quantified by their covariance matrices p t t 1 and r t the residual of the i th sensor usually implies that the demand correction δ x i α i p t k g i k t caused by the i th sensor deviates from the corrections of other measurements or prior thus indicating that considerable noises or errors existed in the measurement or model structure in this scenario the vb approach appropriately enlarges the noise covariance eq 39 reducing the competitive ability of the corresponding measurement and avoiding overfitting on the noises this mechanism makes it more flexible and robust when addressing model structural errors or time varying noises this approach exhibits significant potential in determining model structural errors the estimated covariance can help to find the existence of noises or model errors as the excessive std usually means that the sensor or model is faulty when the faults in the system are determined a residual decomposition will be adopted to explain their sources the decomposition method divided the residuals into three parts namely the unbiased residuals biased residuals and periodic residuals the mean value of the sensor noises is generally 0 0 mean while the model structural error is generally biased disturbance therefore an unbiased residual indicates a faulty sensor whereas a biased residual usually corresponds to a model structural error the above procedure can determine whether the measurement or model is faulty however accurate identification of the model errors is a complex problem the model error may be located by hydraulic analysis or using engineering experiences in case study 2 the estimated std and aar for 47 sensor are very large while the sensors 20 22 and 3 around 47 sensor achieve good performance in matching the measurement table s1 and s2 as shown in figure s48 for 47 sensor there is a large deviation between the measured pressure black line and the estimated pressure red line however the deviations of 20 22 and 3 sensors figure s21 s23 and s52 are much less than 47 sensor this indicates that the model error location is closely related to 47 sensor in hydraulics but not related to the surrounding sensors 20 22 and 3 this helps to narrow down the location of the model error we just compared the model topological structure around 47 sensor with the gis system and found the sensor position fault 4 conclusions the estimation of nodal water demands is a critical step for the real time modeling of wdss the noises and errors in the measurement and model structure are the key factors restricting the application of real time models this study provided an efficient method for the robust modeling of wdss by taking into consideration noises and errors in the measurement and model structure the developed variational bayesian approach can estimate the nodal water demands and noise covariance in real time in this approach the noise covariance is estimated adaptively with the variation in noise intensity when considerable noise or model errors exist in the measurements this approach can enlarge the noise covariance reducing the weight of the measurement and avoiding the overfitting on the noisy data moreover the estimated covariance can aid in determining the faults errors in sensors or model structures based on the measurement residual decomposition the 0 mean residual indicates that considerable noises exist in the measurements whereas the biased residuals correspond to the model structural errors this is useful for the fault detection of wds model structural or sensor networks however accurate locating of the model errors is a complex problem and beyond the scope of this paper and a more efficient approach or engineering experiences should be adopted to accurately locate the model structural errors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17189,anaerobic dry fermentation of food wastes can be utilized for the production of volatile fatty acids vfa however especially for high load fermentation systems accumulation of vfas may result in inhibition of fermentation process in this study separation of vfas from synthetic mixtures via a vapor permeation membrane contactor vpmc system with an air filled polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane was assessed at various temperatures and permeate solution concentrations in addition a pioneering integrated leach bed fermentation and membrane separation system was operated with undefined mixed culture for the purpose of enhanced vfa production along with its recovery hybrid system resulted in 42 enhancement in total vfa production and 60 of total vfas were recovered through the vpmc system the results of this study revealed that integrated system can be exploited as a means of increasing organic loading to fermentation systems and increasing the value of vfa production keywords anaerobic carboxylate platform fermentation membrane separation short chain fatty acids 1 introduction majority of the commodity chemicals are currently synthesized through fossil fuel based technologies however considering the concerns about climate change due to excessive use of fossil fuel resources scientific research interest has shifted from the improvement of existing fossil fuel based processes to the recovery of valuable chemicals from waste streams zacharof and lovitt 2013 agler et al 2011 da ros et al 2020 anaerobic digestion of various waste streams using undefined mixed microbial cultures can yield valuable products such as methane hydrogen and carboxylates short and medium chain volatile fatty acids vfas agler et al 2011 among all these valuable products fermentation of complex organic wastes to carboxylates also known as the carboxylate platform has gained considerable attention lately agler et al 2011 holtzapple et al 2015 holtzapple and granda 2009 fernandez dominguez et al 2020 atasoy et al 2020 basically through mixed culture fermentation short chain volatile fatty acids such as acetic ethanoic and propionic propanoic acids and medium chain volatile fatty acids such as butyric butanoic valeric pentanoic and caproic hexanoic acids are formed through the carboxylate platform holtzapple et al 2015 produced vfas through carboxylate platform may then be used as intermediate chemicals in the fields of food and beverage pharmaceutical and chemical industries zacharof and lovitt 2013 atasoy et al 2018 especially the utilization of vfas for microbial protein production has gained significant attention lately sakarika et al 2020 andersen et al 2014 however continuous vfa production via anaerobic fermentation of wastes can be difficult since undissociated vfas can easily penetrate through the cell membrane and inhibit microbial processes in anaerobic digestion cheng et al 2010 zoetemeyer et al 1982 silva et al 2013 vfa accumulation can also lower the local ph and suppress the intracellular enzyme activity thus deteriorating hydrolytic and acidogenic processes cheng et al 2010 zoetemeyer et al 1982 arora et al 2007 pind et al 2003 it has been reported that for systems with high vfa concentrations vfa concentration of 17 g cod l results in cessation of vfa production during fermentation of pretreated waste activated sludge at operational ph values of 6 0 to 6 6 pratt et al 2012 whereas siegert and banks 2005 suggests that vfa concentrations as low as 4 g l results in slight inhibition of glucose fermentation therefore it is essential to constantly remove vfas during anaerobic fermentation in order to optimize vfa production and to possibly recover vfas concentration gradient driven vapor permeation membrane contactors vpmc has been proven to successfully remove vfas from synthetic feeds and actual waste streams rodríguez et al 1997 aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 in vpmc systems two aqueous phases are separated from each other via a membrane to prevent dispersion of one phase into the other han et al 2005 albrecht et al 2005 vpmc systems are different from the microfiltration and nanofiltration processes as the system is not pressurized and the separation principle does not base on size exclusion aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 only gaseous species can pass through the membrane and there is no convective flow through the pores of microporous hydrophobic membranes aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 gaseous forms of vfas desorb from the acidic feed solution diffuse through the hydrophobic membrane pores and subsequently are absorbed by the alkaline permeate solution where vfas rapidly dissociate into their ionic forms consequently partial pressure of vfas or other volatile species of interest in the feed solution is always higher than in the permeate solution therefore a constant concentration gradient can be created across the membrane and back diffusion of vfas can be prevented tugtas 2014 han et al 2005 anaerobic fermenters can be classified based on total solids ts content of organic waste to be fermented as wet 10 ts semi dry 10 20 ts or dry 20 karthikeyan and visvanathan 2013 dry fermentation reactors can be operated with high organic loading therefore organic fractions of municipal solid wastes animal wastes or lignocellulosic biomass can be treated through dry fermentation digestion processes karthikeyan and visvanathan 2013 li et al 2011 although continuous systems have also been used for the fermentation of wastes with high ts values operational simplicity and minimum capital cost of batch systems make them favorable for the dry fermentation processes karthikeyan and visvanathan 2013 li et al 2011 leach bed reactors lbrs are a batch type systems and mainly used for dry fermentation of wastes lbrs do not require mixing solid and liquid separation occurs within the reactor and wetting of the solid waste is obtained through leachate recycle from the bottom to the top of the tank bayrakdar et al 2018 compared to other reactor types liquid volume within the lbr can be kept low resulting in leachate production with more concentrated vfa content which is preferred for obtaining higher yields through vfa chemical platform anaerobic fermentation of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes for the purpose of vfa production have been reported in the literature silva et al 2013 dogan and demirer 2009 cheah et al 2019 cavdar et al 2011 yesil et al 2014 recovery of produced vfas having two to six carbon atoms from an anaerobic fermenter is very important in terms of recovering valuable chemicals from organic rich wastes and preventing inhibition in high load anaerobic fermentation systems in addition continuous removal of vfas from fermentation systems may enhance the vfa production within the reactor integration of vpmc system to an anaerobic fermenter treating organic rich solid wastes sw would enable constant removal of vfas which then can increase the vfa yield and enable recovery of valuable commodity chemicals the objectives of this study were to a investigate vfa recovery from synthetic vfa mixtures using air filled polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes through vpmc system and b determine vfa production and separation efficiency in integrated fermentation and vpmc system treating organic fraction of municipal solid wastes ofmsw this is the first study investigating vfa production and separation through high solids dry fermentation of ofmsw through a pioneering integrated hybrid leach bed reactor fermentation and vpmc system 2 materials and methods 2 1 vapor permeation membrane contactor module the vapor permeation membrane contactor module aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 ortakci et al 2019 was made of two acrylic plates which were adjoined using stainless steel bolts fig 1 a the plates including liquid flow channels height 5 mm depth 3 mm each channel length 60 mm were separated by a flat sheet hydrophobic ptfe membrane pore size 0 45 µm emflon ptfe membrane pall co usa having a non woven polypropylene support fig 1a other specific information provided by the manufacturer are given in supporting information table si 1 the vpmc used in this study was designed as a laboratory scale single module system however stack configurations of membranes may be required at full scale applications to increase the recovery efficiencies as mentioned in a study by brown et al 2020 vfa separation through vpmc was first optimized through the use of synthetic vfa solutions the optimized operational conditions were then used for the operation of integrated system the ptfe membrane of vpmc system was in contact with an acidic feed solution synthetic vfa solution and an alkaline permeate solution 0 5 n or 1 0 n naoh solution on two sides of the contactor fig 1a the contactor was operated in counter current flow mode and the solutions were recycled at a flow rate of 50 l day using a dual head peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d uk fig 1a the feed and the permeate solutions were continuously mixed using a magnetic stirrer sbs ans 003 usa to quickly equilibrate the solutions before being recycled back into the contactor fig 1a composition of the synthetic vfa solution was decided according to the vfa concentrations observed in the leachate of an organic solid waste reported in a previous study cavdar et al 2011 accordingly vfa concentrations in the synthetic vfa solution were as follows 6000 mg l acetic acid merck germany 6000 mg l propionic acid merck germany 2000 mg l butyric acid merck germany 2000 mg l valeric acid riedel de haën germany and 1000 mg l caproic acid riedel de haën germany vfa separation efficiency of the vpmc system was optimized via six assays under different operational temperatures 21 c 30 c and 38 c and permeate solution concentrations 0 5 n and 1 0 n the experimental setup was placed in a temperature controlled cabinet wtw ts 606 g 2 i germany and temperature was kept constant at a desired value throughout the separation assays the feed side ph 4 and the permeate side ph 12 was not controlled during the separation assays operational conditions in which the highest vfa separation was achieved were selected to be used in separation of vfas from integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system 2 2 preparation of ofmsw mechanically and manually sorted municipal solid wastes msw were taken from istac co kemerburgaz compost facility istanbul turkey during winter and summer seasons of the year the msw was mainly composed of yard and raw vegetable and fruit wastes rather than cooked food scraps based on our previous experiences winter ofmsw had more porous structure compared to that of summer ofmsw therefore we decided to use a mixture of winter and summer wastes as a feed in our assays the collected municipal solid wastes in summer 20 kg and winter 20 kg were mixed roughly at equal weights the inorganic components in the pre sorted msw were further separated manually in the laboratory the remaining organic rich fraction of municipal solid waste 8 kg was then shredded to an average size of 2 3 mm using a 1000 watt food shredder and mixed thoroughly approximately 1 kg of the waste was collected from different parts of the prepared waste and used as samples for the characterization of raw ofmsw the remaining part of the ofmsw was stored at 4 c prior to use composition of the ofmsw prior to the fermentation assay is given in table 1 2 3 operation of integrated fermentation and vpmc system a laboratory scale lbr which was equipped with a 1 l headspace a 4 l solid waste compartment and a 2 l cone bottomed leachate collection system was selected for anaerobic fermentation of the ofmsw fig 1b solid waste compartment and leachate collection cone were separated by a stainless steel mesh having a pore size less than 1 mm plastic rings of 2 cm depth were placed on top of the stainless steel mesh to prevent clogging two leach bed reactors lbrs named control and test were used for the anaerobic fermentation of ofmsw in the control lbr main aim was to determine the amount of vfa that can be produced from anaerobic fermentation of ofmsw in the absence of vfa separation process while the test lbr was within the integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system where vfa separation was achieved via an vpmc system and the effect of vfa separation on total vfa production from ofmsw was investigated the vpmc was integrated to leachate recirculation line of the test lbr and the leachate was fed to the membrane contactor using a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d uk fig 1b a down flow filtration apparatus diameter 5 cm and height 6 cm was placed before the membrane contactor to avoid solid accumulation on the membrane surface fig 1b the filtration apparatus was a cylindrical acrylic vessel packed with shredded scouring sponge the sponge in the vessel acted as a coarse filter media that could allow leachate to pass through while blocking the passage of some particulate matters throughout the study the sponge in the filtration vessel was not replaced as it did not become completely fouled or clogged our previous experiences revealed that when leachate was directly send to vpmc without being filtered the ptfe membrane became completely clogged within a day whereas when the leachate was filtered through the filtration apparatus complete membrane clogging occurred in 4 7 days therefore it can be concluded that coarse filtration prior to vpmc process extended the duty cycle of the membrane 1 0 n naoh solution which has an expected theoretical vfa stripping capacity of 60 g l as acetic acid was used as a permeate solution to enable constant concentration gradient between the feed and permeate sides by quickly ionizing the transferred vfas during the operation of integrated lbr and vpmc system permeate solution was replaced with a new solution every time ph of the permeate solution decreased to 9 0 which resulted in replacement of the permeate solution at every 4 days of operation the retentate of the vpmc was recycled back to the test lbr fig 1b the gas produced as a result of anaerobic fermentation process in both control and test lbrs were collected in 2 l aluminum gas bags at the beginning of the study the control lbr and the test lbr were packed with 1 75 kg wet weight of ofmsw and filled with 1 5 l of tap water the lbrs were purged with n2 gas for 15 min to remove all the oxygen moreover a gas bag filled with n2 was connected to lbrs in order to maintain anaerobic conditions and to avoid vacuum throughout the study fig 1b both the control and the test lbrs were not inoculated at any time during the incubation the bacteria in the ofmsw was enough to initiate fermentation both reactors were operated for 53 days in order to enable constant wetting of the solid waste and thus sustain biodegredation leachate collected at the bottom of the lbrs were recycled to the top using a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d uk fig 1b our previous experiences revealed that continuous operation of laboratory scale lbrs is very difficult as less leachate accumulate at the bottom of lbrs resulting in uneven distribution of leachate over the top of solid waste due to low recycle flow rate uneven distribution of leachate decreases moisture content in some parts of the solid waste resulting in decrease of biodegradation efficiency in addition the progression of the biodegradation causes solid waste to become viscous resulting in decreased leaching which further decreases the recycled leachate amount cavdar et al 2011 yesil et al 2014 therefore in order to assure the collection of enough leachate for the operation of vpmc system the membrane contactor integrated to test lbr was operated in a semi continuous mode as explained in section 3 2 at the permeate phase of the membrane contactor 250 ml of 1 n naoh

initial feed side vapor pressures of the individual vfas were calculated using estimated henry s law constants at each temperature according to khan et al 1995 and feed side initial concentration of

apha 1998 samples for vfa analysis were diluted and acidified with 1 w w phosphoric acid solution prepared samples were immediately analyzed for their vfa content using a gas chromatography gc model

set at 150 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature and permeate solution concentration on vfa separation through vpmc separation recovery of vfas via vpmc system was assessed with 0 45 µm ptfe membrane emflon ptfe membrane pall co usa at 21 c 30 c and 38 c in duplicates fig 2 a synthetic feed solution of 6000 mg l acetic and 6000 mg l propionic 2000 mg l butyric 2000 mg l valeric and 1000 mg l caproic acids was used in the experiments the effect of permeate solution concentration 0 5 n and 1 0 n naoh on vfa separation efficiency was also assessed initial and final ph values of the synthetic feed solution in all the assays ranged between 2 81 0 03 and 3 36 0 16 respectively in the vpmc system it is essential to have feed side vfas in unionized volatile form as only the unionized species can pass through the microporous hydrophobic membrane therefore it is important to keep ph below the pka of vfas adjustment of ph was not necessary during the assays as the ph value of the feed side was below 4 0 at all times volume measurements at the feed and permeate sides of the membrane at the beginning and end of each assay revealed that there was no detectible mass transfer through the membrane via convective flow temperature and permeate solution concentration based assays revealed that the increase of permeate solution concentration from 0 5 n to 1 0 n resulted in decrease of vfa flux at 21 c for all individual vfas tested fig 2a and 2b however at operational temperatures of 30 c and 38 c increase of vfa flux was observed with increase of permeate solution concentration fig 2a and 2b increase of temperature from 21 c to 30 c did not significantly affect flux separation factor or recovery of individual vfas at permeate solution concentration of 0 5 n fig 2a 2c 2e whereas at permeate solution concentration of 1 0 n flux separation factor and recovery of all individual vfas increased in accordance to increasing temperature figs 2b 2d 2f vpmc systems transfer volatile species to permeate side until concentration or vapor pressure equilibrium on both sides of the membrane have been reached aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 yesil et al 2014 in order to enhance vfa separation through vpmc systems equilibrium conditions should be prevented by using alkaline permeate solution which spontaneously converts carboxylic acids to carboxylate causing constant driving force therefore perhaps observing similar mass fluxes at 21 c and 30 c when 0 5 n naoh was used as a permeate solution was due to mass transfer resistances resulting from the use of insufficient alkaline conditions at the permeate side which was compensated when 1 0 n naoh solution was used regardless of the permeate solution concentration acetic acid and propionic acid fluxes were the highest compared to that of other vfas at each assay figs 2a and 2b which was the result of high vapor pressure of these vfas in the feed compared to that of other acids fig 3 butyric valeric and caproic acid fluxes were slightly higher when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution instead of 0 5 n naoh solution fig 2a and 2b although vapor pressure of valeric acid in the feed was slightly higher compared to that of butyric acid their fluxes were comparable to each other fig 2a 2b 3 the highest fluxes obtained in the study for acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic were in g m2 h 18 16 0 21 19 32 0 24 6 81 0 01 6 56 0 08 5 27 0 00 when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution at 38 c fig 2b fluxes obtained in this study were the result of enabling constant concentration gradient of vfas on two sides of the membrane through the use of alkaline solution to quickly ionize the vfas at the permeate side in a study where non porous silicone membrane was used along with permeate solution of water butyric acid flux of 0 09 g m2 h was obtained with a very low operational cost and less chemical use outram and zhang 2018 the study by outram and zhang 2018 perhaps results in low vfa flux due to the use of non porous membranes which limited the mass transfer and the study proved that use of water at the permeate side of the membrane also results in limited vfa transfer as a result of limited driving force there are also other studies in the literature using electrodialysis as the driving force along with stacks of ptfe membranes to achieve pollutant free and efficient vfa recovery brown et al 2020 increase of permeate solution concentration from 0 5 n to 1 0 n resulted in increased separation factors for all individual vfas especially at 38 c figs 2a 2b 2c 2d increase of separation factor can be due to lower water vapor transfer through the membrane when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution caproic acid concentration in the feed was the lowest compared to that of other vfas however vapor pressure of caproic acid in the feed was quite comparable to butyric acid which had twice the concentration as much concentration as the caproic acid fig 3 as a result caproic acid flux was also quite similar to butyric and valeric acid when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution at 38 c fig 2b the highest separation factors for vfas were observed when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution at 38 c fig 2d the membrane s affinity to vfas were as follows caproic acid valeric acid butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid at 38 c and when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution fig 2d acetic acid is a polar molecule and it is completely miscible in water therefore observing low separation factor for acetic acid compared to other vfas could be due to its hydrophilicity which decreases membrane affinity to the acetic acid acetic acid and propionic acid fluxes observed at 38 c and 0 5 n naoh solution in this study were 1 3 1 6 fold higher compared to our preceding study aydin et al 2018 where synthetic vfa mixture of acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids 1250 mg l concentration each was used as a feed solution to determine vfa separation efficiency through 0 2 µm ptfe membrane sterlitech co ptfe laminated membrane filter usa at 38 c when 0 5 n naoh was used as a permeate solution increase of acetic acid and propionic acid fluxes in the current study can be due to feed acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations which were 4 8 fold higher than the study of aydin et al 2018 however although butyric valeric and caporic acid concentrations were similar in both systems higher fluxes and separation factors were observed by aydin et al 2018 which could be due to lower water vapor transfer through the membrane as a result of smaller pores and smaller air flow characteristics of the membrane 0 2 µm ptfe membrane sterlitech co compared to that of current study 0 45 µm ptfe membrane pall co in addition higher acetic and propionic acid fluxes in the current study may have limited the transfer of other acids through the membrane highest vfa recovery efficiencies were observed at 38 c and it appears that permeate solution concentration did not have significant effect on the recovery of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids fig 2e and 2f increase of permeate solution concentration from 0 5 n to 1 0 n resulted in significant increase in caproic acid recovery percentage fig 2e and 2f greater than 65 removal efficiency was observed for all the tested vfas and caproic acid removal exceeded 80 at 38 c when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution fig 2f in aydin et al 2018 where recovery of vfas from a synthetic solution was assessed through a vpmc system with ptfe membrane at 38 c and with 0 5 n naoh permeate solution recovery efficiencies of acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids were 54 64 69 72 and 74 respectively however when a toa impregnated membrane was used with the same setup and same operational conditions recovery efficiencies of acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids were 34 85 98 99 and 99 respectively aydin et al 2018 enhancement of vfa recovery to 99 through solvent impregnated hollow fiber membranes were also reported in other studies patil et al 2017 although the use of solvent impregnated membrane enhances vfa recovery it was not utilized in the current study due to possible risks of leakage and interference with the biochemical metabolism in the fermentation reactor 3 2 integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system in this part of the study a novel integrated vfa production and separation system was used to enhance vfa production from ofmsw and to determine the possibility of preventing inhibition in high load acidogenic fermenters unlike other vfa production and separation studies real ofmsw was used as a substrate in the fermentation system membrane assays conducted with synthetic vfa mixtures as a function of temperature and permeate solution concentration revealed that the best vfa separation efficiencies were obtained when 1 0 n naoh was used as a permeate solution at 38 c therefore the integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system was operated under these conditions two lbr systems control and test were operated for 53 days in order to determine the effect of vfa recovery on vfa production efficiency of the fermentation system the control reactor included only the lbr reactor with an effluent recycle whereas the test reactor was composed of an lbr reactor with effluent recycle that was semi continuously integrated to vpmc system the effluent of the vpmc system was recycled back to the lbr in the test reactor system fig 1b during the operation of vpmc of the integrated system as a result of rapid reaction between captured vfas and naoh ph of permeate solution decreased from 12 0 to 9 0 in order to provide constant alkaline ph at the permeate side of the membrane the permeate solution was replaced at four day intervals in the first six days of the lbr operation leachate was recycled two times a day once in the morning and once in the evening with a flow rate of 1 5 l cycle in both control and test lbrs the vpmc system was operated in a batch mode for six hours a day in the integrated system initial ph was 6 1 and 5 9 in control and test reactors respectively fig 4 a cumulative soluble cod for control and test reactors along with actual soluble cod profile in leachate were given in fig 4b and 4c respectively vfas which were separated through the vpmc were also included in the calculation of cumulative soluble cod in the test reactor sudden increase in soluble cod within the first 2 days of the incubation resulted in decrease of ph to 4 0 and 4 2 in control and test lbrs respectively fig 4a 4b 4c increasing ammonia concentration as a result of hydrolysis caused ph levels to rise to 5 0 which remained approximately at that level until the end of the incubation in both control and test lbrs fig 4a and 4d acetic acid lower than 5 0 g kg vs 1 25 g acetic acid l was the only vfa produced in the first six days of the operation and the concentration of acetic acid in both control and test reactors were similar to each other fig 5 a 5b and 5c considering that the main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vfa separation on vfa production efficiency during the fermentation observation of similar vfa production profiles in the control and test reactors compelled us to re examine the operational conditions of lbrs and the vpmc system perhaps the observation of similar vfa production profiles in control and test lbrs was due to inefficient vfa separation through the vpmc system considering that the maximum possible leachate amount from the lbrs was 1 5 l effluent recycle for two times a day 1 5 l cycle 3 0 l day resulted in slow leaching rates as a result of dense structure of the packed ofmsw which caused very limited leachate accumulation in cone bottomed leachate collection chamber of the lbrs low leachate accumulation in the test reactor interfered with the operation of vpmc system as required amount of leachate was not collected for the vpmc operation in addition short operation durations of vpmc during the first six days may also have resulted in inefficient vfa separation through the vpmc system fig 5d 5e and 5f therefore leachate was recycled only once a day only in the morning and the recycled leachate volume was decreased from 3 0 l day to 1 5 l day starting from the sixth day of the operation in addition operational time of the vpmc system was extended to 16 5 h in average operated overnight to increase the separation performance of the membrane system starting from the 6th day of the operation decrease of effluent recirculation in lbr along with increase of membrane operation time in the test reactor resulted in increased vfa production fig 5 after approximately the 9th day of the incubation acetic acid amount in the control and test reactors increased significantly to 39 6 g kg vs 11 3 g l and to 37 6 g kg vs 10 8 g l respectively fig 5a interestingly on the 10th day of the incubation increase of butyric acid concentration was also observed in both control and test lbrs fig 5c after the 10th day of the incubation acetic acid concentration remained steady in the control lbr then decrease of acetic acid concentration was observed after the 16th day of the incubation which occurred concomitant to increase in butyric acid concentration fig 5a and 5c considering that methane production was not observed in both control and test lbrs decrease of acetic acid along with increase of butyric acid concentration can only be explained through a pathway converting two moles of acetic and two moles of hydrogen to a mole of butyric acid dareioti et al 2014 bhat and barker 1947 production of butyric acid from acetic acid was also observed in the test lbr and it was also observed that increase of butyric acid concentration in the test lbr occurred more rapidly than that of the control lbr fig 5c as a result of extended vpmc operation acetic acid concentration decreased rapidly to 19 g kg vs in the test lbr and separated acetic acid accumulated in the permeate of vpmc fig 5a and 5d on 10th day of the incubation 10 8 g kg vs acetic acid was separated from the test lbr fig 5d as a result of both the vpmc operation and conversion of acetic acid to butyric acid approximately 50 decrease of acetic acid in the test lbr was observed compared to that of control lbr fig 5a 5c 5d it has been known that undissociated acetic acid cause inhibition on fermentation defreese et al 2010 therefore perhaps the low acetic acid concentration and thus low inhibition potential in the test reactor compared to that of control reactor can be the reason for fast rate of increase of butyric acid concentration in test lbr compared to that of control lbr fig 5a and 5d decrease of acetic acid concentration in the control lbr was observed on the 16th day of the incubation which resulted in increase of butyric acid concentration up to 20 days fig 5a on 20th day of the incubation acetic propionic and butyric acid production has stopped in the control lbr which was mainly due to cessation of the fermentation process fig 5a 5b and 5c butyric acid concentrations of 47 9 mmol l was reported to be critical concentration causing inhibition of fermentation process heuvel et al 1992 considering that the free butyric acid concentration in the control lbr was 18 g kg vs 58 4 mmol l cessation of fermentation was perhaps due to the high concentration of butyric acid in the control lbr fig 5c whereas in the test reactor decrease of acetic acid concentration after the 10th day of the incubation was not observed fig 5a considering that acetic acid in test reactor was separated by vpmc and some acetic acid was converted to butyric acid stable acetic acid concentration in the test lbr suggests a continued production within the reactor propionic acid production remained lower than 9 g kg vs 2 6 g l in both control and test lbr systems in the first 31 days of the incubation fig 5b as a result of limited concentration of propionic acid in the test lbr separation through vpmc was also limited fig 5e although vfa production ceased in the control reactor acetic propionic and butyric acid separation profiles revealed that vfa production did not cease in the test lbr until 31st day of the incubation figs 5d 5e 5f in order to investigate the reversibility of the inhibition of fermentation process leachates of control and test reactors were completely removed and replaced with tap water on the 31st day of the incubation which resulted in sudden increase of acetic propionic and butyric acid concentrations in the leachates of control and test lbrs fig 5a 5b and 5c sudden increase of vfas in the leachates of the lbrs was perhaps occurred as the addition of fresh tap water washed the accumulated vfas from the solid waste however after a sudden increase of vfa concentration upon the replacement of leachate with tap water vfa concentration in the control reactor did not increase any more suggesting a complete inhibition of the fermentation system with previously accumulated vfas figs 5a 5b and 5c increase of vfa concentrations in the permeate of the vpmc suggested that fermentation was not completely inhibited in the test lbr fig 5 cumulative soluble cod and actual soluble cod concentrations in the control and test lbrs revealed that after replacement of leachate with freshwater soluble cod concentrations in leachates of both reactors increased up to 42nd day of the incubation than did not increase any further fig 4b and 4c whereas ammonia concentration continued to slightly increase in the leachates of both control and test lbrs fig 4e comparison of total vfa amount in the control lbr and cumulative vfa in the integrated system including test lbr and vpmc revealed that higher vfa production was achieved in the integrated system compared to that of control lbr fig 6 and table 2 in our previous study where anaerobic fermentation of ofmsw via lbr was assessed at 30 c a total vfa production of 26 g kg sw 108 g kg vs was observed in the 31st day of the incubation which corresponds to 86 of the total vfa concentration on 31st day of the current study yesil et al 2014 leachate was not replaced during the study of yesil et al 2014 and the total vfa production of 27 3 g kg sw 114 g kg vs was observed at the end of incubation 72 days which was approximately 61 of the total vfas produced at the end of the incubation in the control reactor of current study fig 6 increase of vfa production in the control reactor of the current study compared to that of yesil et al 2014 suggests that the replacement of leachate with fresh water resulted in enhancement of vfa production in another research reported previously fermentation of ofmsw with lbr was investigated and leachate replacement was applied two times during 74 days of incubation increase of total vfa production as a result of leachate replacement was observed cavdar et al 2011 total vfa production in the integrated system lbr vpmc was 1 43 fold higher than the control lbr table 2 integration of vpmc system to the lbr resulted in 42 of enhancement in vfa production in the test lbr compared to that of control lbr table 2 approximately 40 of the total vfas produced in the test lbr reactor remained in the lbr whereas 60 was separated by the vpmc system vpmc exhibited recovery performances of 57 0 56 0 61 9 48 1 and 57 4 for acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids respectively synthetic vfa separation assays in this study revealed that the membrane affinity increased as the carbon number of the vfas increased and the highest affinity was observed for valeric and caproic acids fig 2e although concentration of valeric and caproic acids were very low in the test lbr above 40 of recovery efficiency was obtained for both of them vfa to soluble cod scod ratio is reported to be an important parameter to determine the degree of acidification of wastes bermúdez penabad et al 2017 hussain et al 2017 the vfa yield in the control and test reactors were 186 06 1 28 gcodvfa kg vsadded and 253 87 3 43 gcodvfa kg vsadded respectively observation of higher vfa yield in the integrated system revealed higher acidification in the test lbr reactor as a result of continuous separation of vfas through the vpmc system in a study where fermentation of food waste was investigated in lbr 247 gcodvfa kg vs added of vfa yield was obtained at ph 7 hussain et al 2017 acidogenic fermentation of cellulosic primary sludge resulted in vfa yields of 232 g codvfa kg vs and 521 g codvfa kg vs at acidic and weakly alkaline conditions respectively da ros et al 2020 another literature study investigating vfa production from a mixture of thickened waste activated sludge and ofmsw thorough continuously stirred tank reactors at 37 c revealed a vfa yields ranging from 0 6 to 0 74 g codvfa g vs 600 to 740 g codvfa kg vs at weakly alkaline conditions moretto et al 2019 in our study obtained vfa yield for control and test lbrs were within the range of vfa yields reported in the literature for lbr however interesting result of our study was that the separation of vfas through vpmc increased the vfa yield of the test lbr compared to that of control lbr table 2 this finding indicates that the enhancement of vfa production in the integrated system could be possible however it should be noted that long term lbr experiments were performed only once and the results can be interpreted better once the behaviors of both the control lbr and integrated system are examined through repeated experiments characterization of digested ofmsw and leachate as a result of 53 days of fermentation are given in table 3 ts and vs reduction in the control lbr was less than that of the test lbr suggesting more organic matter fermentation in the test lbr than in the control lbr table 1 and table 3 in addition approximately 27 of cod and 32 of cod were solubilized liquefied hydrolyzed in the control and test reactors respectively table 1 and table 3 approximately 18 19 of particulate n was solubilized and detected in the leachate of the control and test lbrs table 1 and 3 in addition hydrolysis of particulate p resulted in 33 35 tp in the leachate of control and test lbrs table 1 and 3 approximately 9 8 of cod was separated from leachate of the test lbr via vpmc in the form of vfas table 4 at the end of 53 days of operation 42 enhancement of vfa production was observed in the test lbr of the integrated system table 2 mass balance calculations revealed that closures greater than 88 for cod 72 for tkn and 82 for tp were achieved in control lbr and integrated lbr vpmc systems table 4 we believe that undetectable gas production and excessive sampling 5 7 resulted in observed shortages in mass balance calculations table 4 this study proposed the use of an integrated fermentation lbr and membrane separation vpmc system to increase the production and recovery of vfas from organic solid wastes enabling their possible utilization as marketable products considering appreciable market price and huge market volume of vfas within bio based industry economically competitive recovery process is required to make overall integrated process more sustainable and cost effective vfa separation via vpmc process requires acidic leachate thus external acid addition prior to vpmc might be required for ph levels greater than 5 5 in this study operation of integrated lbr vpmc system exhibited an approximate price of 0 1 us kg vfaseparated for hcl consumption to maintain acidic ph around 4 0 in the leachate alternatively vpmc process can also be operated at ph values of 5 0 5 5 as long as large membrane surface areas can be used to compensate for the high ph values in accordance to vfa amounts expected in full scale operations use of hollow fiber membranes or stacks of flat sheet membranes might be more practical to meet larger area requirement proposing a capital membrane cost of 0 4 3 1 us kg vfaseparated depending on the limitations and requirements of industrial scale lbr vpmc applications an economically feasible vfa recovery stage can be provided by optimizing costs related to acid addition and membrane setup in order to utilize recovered vfas collected permeate solution can be neutralized and then safely upgraded through several processes such as esterification and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha production microbial protein production or can be used as an external carbon source in wastewater treatment plants in our study continuous separation of vfas via vpmc resulted in vfa rich permeate solution with a ph value of 9 0 and vfa concentrations ranging from 4 to 13 g l nevertheless dilute vfa concentrations 32 g codvfa l and acidic ph requirement for most of the upgrading approaches are still bottlenecks and challenges in conversion of waste derived vfas into marketable products alloul et al 2018 another alternative to separation of vfas through vpmc would be the replacement of leachate with tap water yielding less concentrated but readily usable leachate stream which can then be used in various processes as listed above 4 conclusions an integrated lbr vpmc system was developed for the purpose of enhancing vfa production from ofmsw in an lbr along with vfa recovery through vpmc the key conclusions are 1 a semi permeable membrane with gas phase mass transfer to an alkaline permeate solution was successfully applied to selectively harvest vfas from fermentation broths of ofmsw leachate 2 testing with standard solutions suggested that 38 c temperature and use of 1 0 n naoh solution as an alkaline permeate solution were the optimal conditions for capturing vfas through the vpmc system 3 the maximum vfa flux achieved with acetic acid was 18 16 0 21 g m2 h at steady state with initial acetic acid concentration of 6000 mg l and feed ph values less than 4 0 4 these conditions were applied towards a first practical trial with the semi batch fermentation of ofmsw and compared to the same fermentation process without vfa stripping 5 from a practical evaluation in anaerobic leaching beds with ofmsw vfa stripping from the leachate resulted in a higher vfa yield by 42 and this outcome is interpreted to be a consequence of reducing a potential for production inhibition in semi batch fermentation declaration of competing interest

17189,anaerobic dry fermentation of food wastes can be utilized for the production of volatile fatty acids vfa however especially for high load fermentation systems accumulation of vfas may result in inhibition of fermentation process in this study separation of vfas from synthetic mixtures via a vapor permeation membrane contactor vpmc system with an air filled polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane was assessed at various temperatures and permeate solution concentrations in addition a pioneering integrated leach bed fermentation and membrane separation system was operated with undefined mixed culture for the purpose of enhanced vfa production along with its recovery hybrid system resulted in 42 enhancement in total vfa production and 60 of total vfas were recovered through the vpmc system the results of this study revealed that integrated system can be exploited as a means of increasing organic loading to fermentation systems and increasing the value of vfa production keywords anaerobic carboxylate platform fermentation membrane separation short chain fatty acids 1 introduction majority of the commodity chemicals are currently synthesized through fossil fuel based technologies however considering the concerns about climate change due to excessive use of fossil fuel resources scientific research interest has shifted from the improvement of existing fossil fuel based processes to the recovery of valuable chemicals from waste streams zacharof and lovitt 2013 agler et al 2011 da ros et al 2020 anaerobic digestion of various waste streams using undefined mixed microbial cultures can yield valuable products such as methane hydrogen and carboxylates short and medium chain volatile fatty acids vfas agler et al 2011 among all these valuable products fermentation of complex organic wastes to carboxylates also known as the carboxylate platform has gained considerable attention lately agler et al 2011 holtzapple et al 2015 holtzapple and granda 2009 fernandez dominguez et al 2020 atasoy et al 2020 basically through mixed culture fermentation short chain volatile fatty acids such as acetic ethanoic and propionic propanoic acids and medium chain volatile fatty acids such as butyric butanoic valeric pentanoic and caproic hexanoic acids are formed through the carboxylate platform holtzapple et al 2015 produced vfas through carboxylate platform may then be used as intermediate chemicals in the fields of food and beverage pharmaceutical and chemical industries zacharof and lovitt 2013 atasoy et al 2018 especially the utilization of vfas for microbial protein production has gained significant attention lately sakarika et al 2020 andersen et al 2014 however continuous vfa production via anaerobic fermentation of wastes can be difficult since undissociated vfas can easily penetrate through the cell membrane and inhibit microbial processes in anaerobic digestion cheng et al 2010 zoetemeyer et al 1982 silva et al 2013 vfa accumulation can also lower the local ph and suppress the intracellular enzyme activity thus deteriorating hydrolytic and acidogenic processes cheng et al 2010 zoetemeyer et al 1982 arora et al 2007 pind et al 2003 it has been reported that for systems with high vfa concentrations vfa concentration of 17 g cod l results in cessation of vfa production during fermentation of pretreated waste activated sludge at operational ph values of 6 0 to 6 6 pratt et al 2012 whereas siegert and banks 2005 suggests that vfa concentrations as low as 4 g l results in slight inhibition of glucose fermentation therefore it is essential to constantly remove vfas during anaerobic fermentation in order to optimize vfa production and to possibly recover vfas concentration gradient driven vapor permeation membrane contactors vpmc has been proven to successfully remove vfas from synthetic feeds and actual waste streams rodríguez et al 1997 aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 in vpmc systems two aqueous phases are separated from each other via a membrane to prevent dispersion of one phase into the other han et al 2005 albrecht et al 2005 vpmc systems are different from the microfiltration and nanofiltration processes as the system is not pressurized and the separation principle does not base on size exclusion aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 only gaseous species can pass through the membrane and there is no convective flow through the pores of microporous hydrophobic membranes aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 gaseous forms of vfas desorb from the acidic feed solution diffuse through the hydrophobic membrane pores and subsequently are absorbed by the alkaline permeate solution where vfas rapidly dissociate into their ionic forms consequently partial pressure of vfas or other volatile species of interest in the feed solution is always higher than in the permeate solution therefore a constant concentration gradient can be created across the membrane and back diffusion of vfas can be prevented tugtas 2014 han et al 2005 anaerobic fermenters can be classified based on total solids ts content of organic waste to be fermented as wet 10 ts semi dry 10 20 ts or dry 20 karthikeyan and visvanathan 2013 dry fermentation reactors can be operated with high organic loading therefore organic fractions of municipal solid wastes animal wastes or lignocellulosic biomass can be treated through dry fermentation digestion processes karthikeyan and visvanathan 2013 li et al 2011 although continuous systems have also been used for the fermentation of wastes with high ts values operational simplicity and minimum capital cost of batch systems make them favorable for the dry fermentation processes karthikeyan and visvanathan 2013 li et al 2011 leach bed reactors lbrs are a batch type systems and mainly used for dry fermentation of wastes lbrs do not require mixing solid and liquid separation occurs within the reactor and wetting of the solid waste is obtained through leachate recycle from the bottom to the top of the tank bayrakdar et al 2018 compared to other reactor types liquid volume within the lbr can be kept low resulting in leachate production with more concentrated vfa content which is preferred for obtaining higher yields through vfa chemical platform anaerobic fermentation of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes for the purpose of vfa production have been reported in the literature silva et al 2013 dogan and demirer 2009 cheah et al 2019 cavdar et al 2011 yesil et al 2014 recovery of produced vfas having two to six carbon atoms from an anaerobic fermenter is very important in terms of recovering valuable chemicals from organic rich wastes and preventing inhibition in high load anaerobic fermentation systems in addition continuous removal of vfas from fermentation systems may enhance the vfa production within the reactor integration of vpmc system to an anaerobic fermenter treating organic rich solid wastes sw would enable constant removal of vfas which then can increase the vfa yield and enable recovery of valuable commodity chemicals the objectives of this study were to a investigate vfa recovery from synthetic vfa mixtures using air filled polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes through vpmc system and b determine vfa production and separation efficiency in integrated fermentation and vpmc system treating organic fraction of municipal solid wastes ofmsw this is the first study investigating vfa production and separation through high solids dry fermentation of ofmsw through a pioneering integrated hybrid leach bed reactor fermentation and vpmc system 2 materials and methods 2 1 vapor permeation membrane contactor module the vapor permeation membrane contactor module aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 ortakci et al 2019 was made of two acrylic plates which were adjoined using stainless steel bolts fig 1 a the plates including liquid flow channels height 5 mm depth 3 mm each channel length 60 mm were separated by a flat sheet hydrophobic ptfe membrane pore size 0 45 µm emflon ptfe membrane pall co usa having a non woven polypropylene support fig 1a other specific information provided by the manufacturer are given in supporting information table si 1 the vpmc used in this study was designed as a laboratory scale single module system however stack configurations of membranes may be required at full scale applications to increase the recovery efficiencies as mentioned in a study by brown et al 2020 vfa separation through vpmc was first optimized through the use of synthetic vfa solutions the optimized operational conditions were then used for the operation of integrated system the ptfe membrane of vpmc system was in contact with an acidic feed solution synthetic vfa solution and an alkaline permeate solution 0 5 n or 1 0 n naoh solution on two sides of the contactor fig 1a the contactor was operated in counter current flow mode and the solutions were recycled at a flow rate of 50 l day using a dual head peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d uk fig 1a the feed and the permeate solutions were continuously mixed using a magnetic stirrer sbs ans 003 usa to quickly equilibrate the solutions before being recycled back into the contactor fig 1a composition of the synthetic vfa solution was decided according to the vfa concentrations observed in the leachate of an organic solid waste reported in a previous study cavdar et al 2011 accordingly vfa concentrations in the synthetic vfa solution were as follows 6000 mg l acetic acid merck germany 6000 mg l propionic acid merck germany 2000 mg l butyric acid merck germany 2000 mg l valeric acid riedel de haën germany and 1000 mg l caproic acid riedel de haën germany vfa separation efficiency of the vpmc system was optimized via six assays under different operational temperatures 21 c 30 c and 38 c and permeate solution concentrations 0 5 n and 1 0 n the experimental setup was placed in a temperature controlled cabinet wtw ts 606 g 2 i germany and temperature was kept constant at a desired value throughout the separation assays the feed side ph 4 and the permeate side ph 12 was not controlled during the separation assays operational conditions in which the highest vfa separation was achieved were selected to be used in separation of vfas from integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system 2 2 preparation of ofmsw mechanically and manually sorted municipal solid wastes msw were taken from istac co kemerburgaz compost facility istanbul turkey during winter and summer seasons of the year the msw was mainly composed of yard and raw vegetable and fruit wastes rather than cooked food scraps based on our previous experiences winter ofmsw had more porous structure compared to that of summer ofmsw therefore we decided to use a mixture of winter and summer wastes as a feed in our assays the collected municipal solid wastes in summer 20 kg and winter 20 kg were mixed roughly at equal weights the inorganic components in the pre sorted msw were further separated manually in the laboratory the remaining organic rich fraction of municipal solid waste 8 kg was then shredded to an average size of 2 3 mm using a 1000 watt food shredder and mixed thoroughly approximately 1 kg of the waste was collected from different parts of the prepared waste and used as samples for the characterization of raw ofmsw the remaining part of the ofmsw was stored at 4 c prior to use composition of the ofmsw prior to the fermentation assay is given in table 1 2 3 operation of integrated fermentation and vpmc system a laboratory scale lbr which was equipped with a 1 l headspace a 4 l solid waste compartment and a 2 l cone bottomed leachate collection system was selected for anaerobic fermentation of the ofmsw fig 1b solid waste compartment and leachate collection cone were separated by a stainless steel mesh having a pore size less than 1 mm plastic rings of 2 cm depth were placed on top of the stainless steel mesh to prevent clogging two leach bed reactors lbrs named control and test were used for the anaerobic fermentation of ofmsw in the control lbr main aim was to determine the amount of vfa that can be produced from anaerobic fermentation of ofmsw in the absence of vfa separation process while the test lbr was within the integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system where vfa separation was achieved via an vpmc system and the effect of vfa separation on total vfa production from ofmsw was investigated the vpmc was integrated to leachate recirculation line of the test lbr and the leachate was fed to the membrane contactor using a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d uk fig 1b a down flow filtration apparatus diameter 5 cm and height 6 cm was placed before the membrane contactor to avoid solid accumulation on the membrane surface fig 1b the filtration apparatus was a cylindrical acrylic vessel packed with shredded scouring sponge the sponge in the vessel acted as a coarse filter media that could allow leachate to pass through while blocking the passage of some particulate matters throughout the study the sponge in the filtration vessel was not replaced as it did not become completely fouled or clogged our previous experiences revealed that when leachate was directly send to vpmc without being filtered the ptfe membrane became completely clogged within a day whereas when the leachate was filtered through the filtration apparatus complete membrane clogging occurred in 4 7 days therefore it can be concluded that coarse filtration prior to vpmc process extended the duty cycle of the membrane 1 0 n naoh solution which has an expected theoretical vfa stripping capacity of 60 g l as acetic acid was used as a permeate solution to enable constant concentration gradient between the feed and permeate sides by quickly ionizing the transferred vfas during the operation of integrated lbr and vpmc system permeate solution was replaced with a new solution every time ph of the permeate solution decreased to 9 0 which resulted in replacement of the permeate solution at every 4 days of operation the retentate of the vpmc was recycled back to the test lbr fig 1b the gas produced as a result of anaerobic fermentation process in both control and test lbrs were collected in 2 l aluminum gas bags at the beginning of the study the control lbr and the test lbr were packed with 1 75 kg wet weight of ofmsw and filled with 1 5 l of tap water the lbrs were purged with n2 gas for 15 min to remove all the oxygen moreover a gas bag filled with n2 was connected to lbrs in order to maintain anaerobic conditions and to avoid vacuum throughout the study fig 1b both the control and the test lbrs were not inoculated at any time during the incubation the bacteria in the ofmsw was enough to initiate fermentation both reactors were operated for 53 days in order to enable constant wetting of the solid waste and thus sustain biodegredation leachate collected at the bottom of the lbrs were recycled to the top using a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d uk fig 1b our previous experiences revealed that continuous operation of laboratory scale lbrs is very difficult as less leachate accumulate at the bottom of lbrs resulting in uneven distribution of leachate over the top of solid waste due to low recycle flow rate uneven distribution of leachate decreases moisture content in some parts of the solid waste resulting in decrease of biodegradation efficiency in addition the progression of the biodegradation causes solid waste to become viscous resulting in decreased leaching which further decreases the recycled leachate amount cavdar et al 2011 yesil et al 2014 therefore in order to assure the collection of enough leachate for the operation of vpmc system the membrane contactor integrated to test lbr was operated in a semi continuous mode as explained in section 3 2 at the permeate phase of the membrane contactor 250 ml of 1 n naoh solution was used as the alkaline solution the leachate feed and the permeate solution on two separate sides of the membrane were continuously recycled at a flow rate of 50 l day using a two channel peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 du d united kingdom ph of the leachate was controlled between 4 5 5 0 using concentrated hcl throughout the operation of integrated test lbr vpmc system in total of 43 ml hcl was consumed to maintain ph at the mentioned levels at 31st day of the incubation leachates of both control and test lbrs were removed and replaced with a 1 5 l tap water integrated system was operated at 35 c by using a temperature controlled cabinet wtw ts 606 g 2 i germany 2 4 data analysis vfa flux jvfa or permeation rate through the membrane under pseudo stationary linear

initial feed side vapor pressures of the individual vfas were calculated using estimated henry s law constants at each temperature according to khan et al 1995 and feed side initial concentration of the individual vfas 2 5 analytical methods composition of ofmsw at the beginning and end of the experiment was determined in terms of total solids ts and volatile solids vs tkn tp and total cod according to the procedures described in standard methods apha 1998 ph of the leachate samples and the permeate solution was measured using eutech pcd 6500 ph conductivity meter liquid samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm nylon syringe filter membrane solutions co usa prior to soluble cod and nh3 n measurements which were conducted according to the procedures described in standard methods apha 1998 samples for vfa analysis were diluted and acidified with 1 w w phosphoric acid solution prepared samples were immediately analyzed for their vfa content using a gas chromatography gc model gc 2014atf shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with flame ionization detector and capillary gc column model trb ffap 30 m x 0 32 mm x 0 50 µm teknoroma sant cugat del velles spain gc was operated under the following conditions 80 c column temperature 260 c detector temperature total flow of carrier gas 57 3 ml min and purge flow 3 ml min carrier and make up gasses were helium and nitrogen flame gasses

equipped with a thermal conductivity detector separation of ch4 co2 and h2 was performed with a packed column restek ms 13 45 60 2 74 m in length 2 0 mm internal diameter id bellefonte usa helium and argon were used as the carrier gasses for both ch4 or co2 and h2 respectively under a pressure of 70 kpa the injector was maintained at 150 c the oven was set at 40 c and the detector temperature was set at 150 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature and permeate solution concentration on vfa separation through vpmc separation recovery of vfas via vpmc system was assessed with 0 45 µm ptfe membrane emflon ptfe membrane pall co usa at 21 c 30 c and 38 c in duplicates fig 2 a synthetic feed solution of 6000 mg l acetic and 6000 mg l propionic 2000 mg l butyric 2000 mg l valeric and 1000 mg l caproic acids was used in the experiments the effect of permeate solution concentration 0 5 n and 1 0 n naoh on vfa separation efficiency was also assessed initial and final ph values of the synthetic feed solution in all the assays ranged between 2 81 0 03 and 3 36 0 16 respectively in the vpmc system it is essential to have feed side vfas in unionized volatile form as only the unionized species can pass through the microporous hydrophobic membrane therefore it is important to keep ph below the pka of vfas adjustment of ph was not necessary during the assays as the ph value of the feed side was below 4 0 at all times volume measurements at the feed and permeate sides of the membrane at the beginning and end of each assay revealed that there was no detectible mass transfer through the membrane via convective flow temperature and permeate solution concentration based assays revealed that the increase of permeate solution concentration from 0 5 n to 1 0 n resulted in decrease of vfa flux at 21 c for all individual vfas tested fig 2a and 2b however at operational temperatures of 30 c and 38 c increase of vfa flux was observed with increase of permeate solution concentration fig 2a and 2b increase of temperature from 21 c to 30 c did not significantly affect flux separation factor or recovery of individual vfas at permeate solution concentration of 0 5 n fig 2a 2c 2e whereas at permeate solution concentration of 1 0 n flux separation factor and recovery of all individual vfas increased in accordance to increasing temperature figs 2b 2d 2f vpmc systems transfer volatile species to permeate side until concentration or vapor pressure equilibrium on both sides of the membrane have been reached aydin et al 2018 tugtas 2014 yesil et al 2014 in order to enhance vfa separation through vpmc systems equilibrium conditions should be prevented by using alkaline permeate solution which spontaneously converts carboxylic acids to carboxylate causing constant driving force therefore perhaps observing similar mass fluxes at 21 c and 30 c when 0 5 n naoh was used as a permeate solution was due to mass transfer resistances resulting from the use of insufficient alkaline conditions at the permeate side which was compensated when 1 0 n naoh solution was used regardless of the permeate solution concentration acetic acid and propionic acid fluxes were the highest compared to that of other vfas at each assay figs 2a and 2b which was the result of high vapor pressure of these vfas in the feed compared to that of other acids fig 3 butyric valeric and caproic acid fluxes were slightly higher when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution instead of 0 5 n naoh solution fig 2a and 2b although vapor pressure of valeric acid in the feed was slightly higher compared to that of butyric acid their fluxes were comparable to each other fig 2a 2b 3 the highest fluxes obtained in the study for acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic were in g m2 h 18 16 0 21 19 32 0 24 6 81 0 01 6 56 0 08 5 27 0 00 when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution at 38 c fig 2b fluxes obtained in this study were the result of enabling constant concentration gradient of vfas on two sides of the membrane through the use of alkaline solution to quickly ionize the vfas at the permeate side in a study where non porous silicone membrane was used along with permeate solution of water butyric acid flux of 0 09 g m2 h was obtained with a very low operational cost and less chemical use outram and zhang 2018 the study by outram and zhang 2018 perhaps results in low vfa flux due to the use of non porous membranes which limited the mass transfer and the study proved that use of water at the permeate side of the membrane also results in limited vfa transfer as a result of limited driving force there are also other studies in the literature using electrodialysis as the driving force along with stacks of ptfe membranes to achieve pollutant free and efficient vfa recovery brown et al 2020 increase of permeate solution concentration from 0 5 n to 1 0 n resulted in increased separation factors for all individual vfas especially at 38 c figs 2a 2b 2c 2d increase of separation factor can be due to lower water vapor transfer through the membrane when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution caproic acid concentration in the feed was the lowest compared to that of other vfas however vapor pressure of caproic acid in the feed was quite comparable to butyric acid which had twice the concentration as much concentration as the caproic acid fig 3 as a result caproic acid flux was also quite similar to butyric and valeric acid when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution at 38 c fig 2b the highest separation factors for vfas were observed when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution at 38 c fig 2d the membrane s affinity to vfas were as follows caproic acid valeric acid butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid at 38 c and when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution fig 2d acetic acid is a polar molecule and it is completely miscible in water therefore observing low separation factor for acetic acid compared to other vfas could be due to its hydrophilicity which decreases membrane affinity to the acetic acid acetic acid and propionic acid fluxes observed at 38 c and 0 5 n naoh solution in this study were 1 3 1 6 fold higher compared to our preceding study aydin et al 2018 where synthetic vfa mixture of acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids 1250 mg l concentration each was used as a feed solution to determine vfa separation efficiency through 0 2 µm ptfe membrane sterlitech co ptfe laminated membrane filter usa at 38 c when 0 5 n naoh was used as a permeate solution increase of acetic acid and propionic acid fluxes in the current study can be due to feed acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations which were 4 8 fold higher than the study of aydin et al 2018 however although butyric valeric and caporic acid concentrations were similar in both systems higher fluxes and separation factors were observed by aydin et al 2018 which could be due to lower water vapor transfer through the membrane as a result of smaller pores and smaller air flow characteristics of the membrane 0 2 µm ptfe membrane sterlitech co compared to that of current study 0 45 µm ptfe membrane pall co in addition higher acetic and propionic acid fluxes in the current study may have limited the transfer of other acids through the membrane highest vfa recovery efficiencies were observed at 38 c and it appears that permeate solution concentration did not have significant effect on the recovery of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids fig 2e and 2f increase of permeate solution concentration from 0 5 n to 1 0 n resulted in significant increase in caproic acid recovery percentage fig 2e and 2f greater than 65 removal efficiency was observed for all the tested vfas and caproic acid removal exceeded 80 at 38 c when 1 0 n naoh solution was used as a permeate solution fig 2f in aydin et al 2018 where recovery of vfas from a synthetic solution was assessed through a vpmc system with ptfe membrane at 38 c and with 0 5 n naoh permeate solution recovery efficiencies of acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids were 54 64 69 72 and 74 respectively however when a toa impregnated membrane was used with the same setup and same operational conditions recovery efficiencies of acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids were 34 85 98 99 and 99 respectively aydin et al 2018 enhancement of vfa recovery to 99 through solvent impregnated hollow fiber membranes were also reported in other studies patil et al 2017 although the use of solvent impregnated membrane enhances vfa recovery it was not utilized in the current study due to possible risks of leakage and interference with the biochemical metabolism in the fermentation reactor 3 2 integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system in this part of the study a novel integrated vfa production and separation system was used to enhance vfa production from ofmsw and to determine the possibility of preventing inhibition in high load acidogenic fermenters unlike other vfa production and separation studies real ofmsw was used as a substrate in the fermentation system membrane assays conducted with synthetic vfa mixtures as a function of temperature and permeate solution concentration revealed that the best vfa separation efficiencies were obtained when 1 0 n naoh was used as a permeate solution at 38 c therefore the integrated anaerobic fermentation and vpmc system was operated under these conditions two lbr systems control and test were operated for 53 days in order to determine the effect of vfa recovery on vfa production efficiency of the fermentation system the control reactor included only the lbr reactor with an effluent recycle whereas the test reactor was composed of an lbr reactor with effluent recycle that was semi continuously integrated to vpmc system the effluent of the vpmc system was recycled back to the lbr in the test reactor system fig 1b during the operation of vpmc of the integrated system as a result of rapid reaction between captured vfas and naoh ph of permeate solution decreased from 12 0 to 9 0 in order to provide constant alkaline ph at the permeate side of the membrane the permeate solution was replaced at four day intervals in the first six days of the lbr operation leachate was recycled two times a day once in the morning and once in the evening with a flow rate of 1 5 l cycle in both control and test lbrs the vpmc system was operated in a batch mode for six hours a day in the integrated system initial ph was 6 1 and 5 9 in control and test reactors respectively fig 4 a cumulative soluble cod for control and test reactors along with actual soluble cod profile in leachate were given in fig 4b and 4c respectively vfas which were separated through the vpmc were also included in the calculation of cumulative soluble cod in the test reactor sudden increase in soluble cod within the first 2 days of the incubation resulted in decrease of ph to 4 0 and 4 2 in control and test lbrs respectively fig 4a 4b 4c increasing ammonia concentration as a result of hydrolysis caused ph levels to rise to 5 0 which remained approximately at that level until the end of the incubation in both control and test lbrs fig 4a and 4d acetic acid lower than 5 0 g kg vs 1 25 g acetic acid l was the only vfa produced in the first six days of the operation and the concentration of acetic acid in both control and test reactors were similar to each other fig 5 a 5b and 5c considering that the main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vfa separation on vfa production efficiency during the fermentation observation of similar vfa production profiles in the control and test reactors compelled us to re examine the operational conditions of lbrs and the vpmc system perhaps the observation of similar vfa production profiles in control and test lbrs was due to inefficient vfa separation through the vpmc system considering that the maximum possible leachate amount from the lbrs was 1 5 l effluent recycle for two times a day 1 5 l cycle 3 0 l day resulted in slow leaching rates as a result of dense structure of the packed ofmsw which caused very limited leachate accumulation in cone bottomed leachate collection chamber of the lbrs low leachate accumulation in the test reactor interfered with the operation of vpmc system as required amount of leachate was not collected for the vpmc operation in addition short operation durations of vpmc during the first six days may also have resulted in inefficient vfa separation through the vpmc system fig 5d 5e and 5f therefore leachate was recycled only once a day only in the morning and the recycled leachate volume was decreased from 3 0 l day to 1 5 l day starting from the sixth day of the operation in addition operational time of the vpmc system was extended to 16 5 h in average operated overnight to increase the separation performance of the membrane system starting from the 6th day of the operation decrease of effluent recirculation in lbr along with increase of membrane operation time in the test reactor resulted in increased vfa production fig 5 after approximately the 9th day of the incubation acetic acid amount in the control and test reactors increased significantly to 39 6 g kg vs 11 3 g l and to 37 6 g kg vs 10 8 g l respectively fig 5a interestingly on the 10th day of the incubation increase of butyric acid concentration was also observed in both control and test lbrs fig 5c after the 10th day of the incubation acetic acid concentration remained steady in the control lbr then decrease of acetic acid concentration was observed after the 16th day of the incubation which occurred concomitant to increase in butyric acid concentration fig 5a and 5c considering that methane production was not observed in both control and test lbrs decrease of acetic acid along with increase of butyric acid concentration can only be explained through a pathway converting two moles of acetic and two moles of hydrogen to a mole of butyric acid dareioti et al 2014 bhat and barker 1947 production of butyric acid from acetic acid was also observed in the test lbr and it was also observed that increase of butyric acid concentration in the test lbr occurred more rapidly than that of the control lbr fig 5c as a result of extended vpmc operation acetic acid concentration decreased rapidly to 19 g kg vs in the test lbr and separated acetic acid accumulated in the permeate of vpmc fig 5a and 5d on 10th day of the incubation 10 8 g kg vs acetic acid was separated from the test lbr fig 5d as a result of both the vpmc operation and conversion of acetic acid to butyric acid approximately 50 decrease of acetic acid in the test lbr was observed compared to that of control lbr fig 5a 5c 5d it has been known that undissociated acetic acid cause inhibition on fermentation defreese et al 2010 therefore perhaps the low acetic acid concentration and thus low inhibition potential in the test reactor compared to that of control reactor can be the reason for fast rate of increase of butyric acid concentration in test lbr compared to that of control lbr fig 5a and 5d decrease of acetic acid concentration in the control lbr was observed on the 16th day of the incubation which resulted in increase of butyric acid concentration up to 20 days fig 5a on 20th day of the incubation acetic propionic and butyric acid production has stopped in the control lbr which was mainly due to cessation of the fermentation process fig 5a 5b and 5c butyric acid concentrations of 47 9 mmol l was reported to be critical concentration causing inhibition of fermentation process heuvel et al 1992 considering that the free butyric acid concentration in the control lbr was 18 g kg vs 58 4 mmol l cessation of fermentation was perhaps due to the high concentration of butyric acid in the control lbr fig 5c whereas in the test reactor decrease of acetic acid concentration after the 10th day of the incubation was not observed fig 5a considering that acetic acid in test reactor was separated by vpmc and some acetic acid was converted to butyric acid stable acetic acid concentration in the test lbr suggests a continued production within the reactor propionic acid production remained lower than 9 g kg vs 2 6 g l in both control and test lbr systems in the first 31 days of the incubation fig 5b as a result of limited concentration of propionic acid in the test lbr separation through vpmc was also limited fig 5e although vfa production ceased in the control reactor acetic propionic and butyric acid separation profiles revealed that vfa production did not cease in the test lbr until 31st day of the incubation figs 5d 5e 5f in order to investigate the reversibility of the inhibition of fermentation process leachates of control and test reactors were completely removed and replaced with tap water on the 31st day of the incubation which resulted in sudden increase of acetic propionic and butyric acid concentrations in the leachates of control and test lbrs fig 5a 5b and 5c sudden increase of vfas in the leachates of the lbrs was perhaps occurred as the addition of fresh tap water washed the accumulated vfas from the solid waste however after a sudden increase of vfa concentration upon the replacement of leachate with tap water vfa concentration in the control reactor did not increase any more suggesting a complete inhibition of the fermentation system with previously accumulated vfas figs 5a 5b and 5c increase of vfa concentrations in the permeate of the vpmc suggested that fermentation was not completely inhibited in the test lbr fig 5 cumulative soluble cod and actual soluble cod concentrations in the control and test lbrs revealed that after replacement of leachate with freshwater soluble cod concentrations in leachates of both reactors increased up to 42nd day of the incubation than did not increase any further fig 4b and 4c whereas ammonia concentration continued to slightly increase in the leachates of both control and test lbrs fig 4e comparison of total vfa amount in the control lbr and cumulative vfa in the integrated system including test lbr and vpmc revealed that higher vfa production was achieved in the integrated system compared to that of control lbr fig 6 and table 2 in our previous study where anaerobic fermentation of ofmsw via lbr was assessed at 30 c a total vfa production of 26 g kg sw 108 g kg vs was observed in the 31st day of the incubation which corresponds to 86 of the total vfa concentration on 31st day of the current study yesil et al 2014 leachate was not replaced during the study of yesil et al 2014 and the total vfa production of 27 3 g kg sw 114 g kg vs was observed at the end of incubation 72 days which was approximately 61 of the total vfas produced at the end of the incubation in the control reactor of current study fig 6 increase of vfa production in the control reactor of the current study compared to that of yesil et al 2014 suggests that the replacement of leachate with fresh water resulted in enhancement of vfa production in another research reported previously fermentation of ofmsw with lbr was investigated and leachate replacement was applied two times during 74 days of incubation increase of total vfa production as a result of leachate replacement was observed cavdar et al 2011 total vfa production in the integrated system lbr vpmc was 1 43 fold higher than the control lbr table 2 integration of vpmc system to the lbr resulted in 42 of enhancement in vfa production in the test lbr compared to that of control lbr table 2 approximately 40 of the total vfas produced in the test lbr reactor remained in the lbr whereas 60 was separated by the vpmc system vpmc exhibited recovery performances of 57 0 56 0 61 9 48 1 and 57 4 for acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids respectively synthetic vfa separation assays in this study revealed that the membrane affinity increased as the carbon number of the vfas increased and the highest affinity was observed for valeric and caproic acids fig 2e although concentration of valeric and caproic acids were very low in the test lbr above 40 of recovery efficiency was obtained for both of them vfa to soluble cod scod ratio is reported to be an important parameter to determine the degree of acidification of wastes bermúdez penabad et al 2017 hussain et al 2017 the vfa yield in the control and test reactors were 186 06 1 28 gcodvfa kg vsadded and 253 87 3 43 gcodvfa kg vsadded respectively observation of higher vfa yield in the integrated system revealed higher acidification in the test lbr reactor as a result of continuous separation of vfas through the vpmc system in a study where fermentation of food waste was investigated in lbr 247 gcodvfa kg vs added of vfa yield was obtained at ph 7 hussain et al 2017 acidogenic fermentation of cellulosic primary sludge resulted in vfa yields of 232 g codvfa kg vs and 521 g codvfa kg vs at acidic and weakly alkaline conditions respectively da ros et al 2020 another literature study investigating vfa production from a mixture of thickened waste activated sludge and ofmsw thorough continuously stirred tank reactors at 37 c revealed a vfa yields ranging from 0 6 to 0 74 g codvfa g vs 600 to 740 g codvfa kg vs at weakly alkaline conditions moretto et al 2019 in our study obtained vfa yield for control and test lbrs were within the range of vfa yields reported in the literature for lbr however interesting result of our study was that the separation of vfas through vpmc increased the vfa yield of the test lbr compared to that of control lbr table 2 this finding indicates that the enhancement of vfa production in the integrated system could be possible however it should be noted that long term lbr experiments were performed only once and the results can be interpreted better once the behaviors of both the control lbr and integrated system are examined through repeated experiments characterization of digested ofmsw and leachate as a result of 53 days of fermentation are given in table 3 ts and vs reduction in the control lbr was less than that of the test lbr suggesting more organic matter fermentation in the test lbr than in the control lbr table 1 and table 3 in addition approximately 27 of cod and 32 of cod were solubilized liquefied hydrolyzed in the control and test reactors respectively table 1 and table 3 approximately 18 19 of particulate n was solubilized and detected in the leachate of the control and test lbrs table 1 and 3 in addition hydrolysis of particulate p resulted in 33 35 tp in the leachate of control and test lbrs table 1 and 3 approximately 9 8 of cod was separated from leachate of the test lbr via vpmc in the form of vfas table 4 at the end of 53 days of operation 42 enhancement of vfa production was observed in the test lbr of the integrated system table 2 mass balance calculations revealed that closures greater than 88 for cod 72 for tkn and 82 for tp were achieved in control lbr and integrated lbr vpmc systems table 4 we believe that undetectable gas production and excessive sampling 5 7 resulted in observed shortages in mass balance calculations table 4 this study proposed the use of an integrated fermentation lbr and membrane separation vpmc system to increase the production and recovery of vfas from organic solid wastes enabling their possible utilization as marketable products considering appreciable market price and huge market volume of vfas within bio based industry economically competitive recovery process is required to make overall integrated process more sustainable and cost effective vfa separation via vpmc process requires acidic leachate thus external acid addition prior to vpmc might be required for ph levels greater than 5 5 in this study operation of integrated lbr vpmc system exhibited an approximate price of 0 1 us kg vfaseparated for hcl consumption to maintain acidic ph around 4 0 in the leachate alternatively vpmc process can also be operated at ph values of 5 0 5 5 as long as large membrane surface areas can be used to compensate for the high ph values in accordance to vfa amounts expected in full scale operations use of hollow fiber membranes or stacks of flat sheet membranes might be more practical to meet larger area requirement proposing a capital membrane cost of 0 4 3 1 us kg vfaseparated depending on the limitations and requirements of industrial scale lbr vpmc applications an economically feasible vfa recovery stage can be provided by optimizing costs related to acid addition and membrane setup in order to utilize recovered vfas collected permeate solution can be neutralized and then safely upgraded through several processes such as esterification and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha production microbial protein production or can be used as an external carbon source in wastewater treatment plants in our study continuous separation of vfas via vpmc resulted in vfa rich permeate solution with a ph value of 9 0 and vfa concentrations ranging from 4 to 13 g l nevertheless dilute vfa concentrations 32 g codvfa l and acidic ph requirement for most of the upgrading approaches are still bottlenecks and challenges in conversion of waste derived vfas into marketable products alloul et al 2018 another alternative to separation of vfas through vpmc would be the replacement of leachate with tap water yielding less concentrated but readily usable leachate stream which can then be used in various processes as listed above 4 conclusions an integrated lbr vpmc system was developed for the purpose of enhancing vfa production from ofmsw in an lbr along with vfa recovery through vpmc the key conclusions are 1 a semi permeable membrane with gas phase mass transfer to an alkaline permeate solution was successfully applied to selectively harvest vfas from fermentation broths of ofmsw leachate 2 testing with standard solutions suggested that 38 c temperature and use of 1 0 n naoh solution as an alkaline permeate solution were the optimal conditions for capturing vfas through the vpmc system 3 the maximum vfa flux achieved with acetic acid was 18 16 0 21 g m2 h at steady state with initial acetic acid concentration of 6000 mg l and feed ph values less than 4 0 4 these conditions were applied towards a first practical trial with the semi batch fermentation of ofmsw and compared to the same fermentation process without vfa stripping 5 from a practical evaluation in anaerobic leaching beds with ofmsw vfa stripping from the leachate resulted in a higher vfa yield by 42 and this outcome is interpreted to be a consequence of reducing a potential for production inhibition in semi batch fermentation declaration of competing interest
