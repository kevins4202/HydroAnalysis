3845,in this study we develop a daily flow duration curve model for ungauged intermittent subbasins of gauged rivers the long term mean streamflow of the river basin one of the central parts in the model is calculated with a regression model of annual precipitation and physical characteristics of the river basin e g drainage area basin relief topographical slope drainage density the input data of the model are normally accesible and this makes the model applicable to ungauged points within the river basin another central part of the model is the cease to flow point which makes the model significant for intermittent rivers the daily streamflow discharge recorded in gauging stations over the river basin is nondimensionalized by dividing each with their own long term mean and their collection is transformed to fit the normal probability distribution i e the normalized nondimensional daily streamflow data are used in the model the streamflow data are inverted back to the original distribution for any given exceedance percentage by incorporating the cease to flow point and are dimensionalized finally by using the empirically derived long term mean streamflow discharge the model is applied on hundreds of thousands station day daily streamflow data from three river basins in different geographical regions in turkey results of the case studies are found promising to propose the model as a good foundation for the daily flow duration curve at an ungauged intermittent subbasin of gauged rivers however it is noticeable that the model might have low performance in some particular gauging stations where the hydrological behavior deviates from the general characteristics of the river basin this can be overcome by developing empirical models better approaching the observed long term mean streamflow which is a key issue of the model keywords cease to flow point daily streamflow flow duration curve intermittent river ungauged basin 1 introduction flow duration curve fdc is a handy tool to determine the streamflow in a river with a certain time of exceedance it is a signature that characterizes the hydrological regime of the river basin viglione et al 2013 it also explains the flow variability because it is widely used in the determination of high flows i e floods as well as in the calculation of low flows fennessey and vogel 1990 at the lower extreme fdc can also be taken as a signature for the drought at the river basin sugiyama et al 2003 in a gauged river basin fdc is obtained by sorting the observed streamflow data from the largest to the smallest and plotting each against the corresponding exceedance percentages castellarin et al 2007 in case no data exist i e at an ungauged location empirical methods emerge to use for the fdc not only the point scale fdcs but also their regional extension are generated both being quite useful in the hydrological practice such as the urban storm water system design environmental flow allocation hydropower potential and water availability quimpo et al 1983 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 franchini and suppo 1996 castellarin et al 2004a baltas 2012 kim et al 2014 fdc related studies started as early as the first half of the 20th century saville and watson 1933 various approaches have been proposed in the literature for the fdcs castellarin et al 2004a for example smakhtin et al 1997 and ridolfi et al 2020 used the so called parametric and graphical approaches respectively statistical approaches consider basin characteristics such as the drainage area through the use of regression analysis singh 1971 singh et al 2001 wittenberg 1987 estimated fdc of the river basin based on parameters of the probability distribution function and basin characteristics cigizoglu 2000 introduced a probabilistic method atieh et al 2015 doulatyari et al 2015 and boscarello et al 2016 developed empirical and probabilistic fdc models with an emphasis on the seasonality in the streamflow yu and yang 1996 used the cluster analysis to obtain synthetic fdcs whose quantiles were estimated by the drainage area of the river basin yu et al 2002 found the polynomial approximation more successful than the area index method also analytical expressions are available muller et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 muller and thompson 2016 with increasing global water demand non perennial rivers have received an interest greater than before aksoy and bayazit 2000 aksoy 2003 flow is uninterrupted and continuous in a perennial stream while it is interrupted and intermittent otherwise an ephemeral river is affected directly by the rainfall as it mostly remains dry during rainless periods an intermittent river however flows most of the time it might get dry in rainless periods of the year in the absence of rainfall or when the groundwater level is not high enough to recharge the stream despite their increasing importance fdc of intermittent rivers have not been that popular excluding a limited number of studies for example in order to calculate the cease to flow point croker et al 2003 developed fdcs for gauged locations by using the total probability theorem haan 1977 and a log linear regression equation using the mean annual rainfall of the river basin the cease to flow point is the intermittency ratio of the river which corresponds to the percentage of number of days with no flow over the total number of days through the period of record shao et al 2009 post et al 2004 and costa et al 2014 combined the mean flow and basin characteristics together with the cease to flow point and the slope of fdc viola et al 2011 and rianna et al 2011 2013 suggested the use of regional models and stochastic indices respectively to identify fdc of intermittent rivers the use of fdcs depends on data availability they are applicable in gauged river basins and can be used up to an extent at quasi gauged basins hughes and smakhtin 1996 the fdc practice becomes harder when the river basin is fully ungauged sivapalan et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 a few example to mention are mohamoud 2008 ganora et al 2009 li et al 2010 atieh et al 2017 chouaib et al 2019 fouad and loaiciga 2020 and wolff and duarte 2021 who developed fdc models at ungauged sites using various approximations ranging from the nonparametric methods to the regression analysis on the other hand frequency analysis has been a common methodology in the identification of the best fit probability distribution function to obtain the fdc for example castellarin et al 2004b showed that the three parameter lognormal ln3 probability distribution function fitted the daily streamflow bozchaloei and vafakhah 2015 fitted various probability distribution functions to the streamflow data at nine probabilities of exceedance d 2 10 15 20 30 75 90 92 95 zero values in the records are treated by the total probability theorem coupled frequency analysis eris et al 2019 cavus and aksoy 2019 2020 aksoy et al 2021 in many cases the best fit probability distribution function is not able to mimic the whole fdc it can well fit its central part but it deviates at the upper and lower tails i e the observed and estimated values of high flows and low flows stay far from each other yue and wang 2004 mendicino and senatore 2013 papalexiou 2018 chilkoti et al 2019 costa et al 2020 this is because of different physical mechanisms behind the lower and upper extremes and the average character of the river basin eventually this is the reason why ghotbi et al 2020 suggested the baseflow separation technique to better simulate the fast and slow flow components of fdcs individually in this study we develop a daily fdc model for ungauged intermittent river subbasins of gauged rivers it is an improvement over the annual and monthly time scale fdc models of burgan 2019 and burgan and aksoy 2018 2020 we consider the daily time scale and take the intermittency into account case studies are based on hundreds of thousands station day streamflow data from three geographically different river basins in turkey the fdc model in this study is statistically basic yet it carries significant importance for ungauged intermittent river subbasins as the central parts of the model a particular attention was paid to the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow of the river basin for which the procedure of singh et al 2001 was followed in the following sections the fdc model is introduced together with the statistical tools and their step by step implementation physical variables of the regression equations performance metrics and criteria are then defined next the study area and data are explained after which results are discussed and conclusions are given at the end 2 the fdc model the model we propose in this study derives the fdc at ungauged locations in the basin of gauged rivers it uses the daily data from as many of streamflow gauging stations sgss as possible scattered homogenously over the river basin to ensure a good spatial representation it takes into account the precipitation data together with the physical characteristics of the river basin the model is based on simple tools i e it is a practical model for the hydrological community its implementation consists of a number of steps depicted in fig 1 and explained as follows the model starts with the nondimensionalization of the daily streamfow data at each sgs mean streamflow q ij of day j in year i is divided by q m the sgs specific long term mean streamflow as 1 q ij q ij q m i 1 2 n j 1 2 365 to get q ij the nondimensional daily streamflow time series the model presumes that the nondimensional daily streamflow data satisfy the normality which is checked by the χ 2 test at a given significance level in case of the non normality the nondimensional daily streamflow data are normalized by 2 w ij q ij θ i 1 2 n j 1 2 365 where w ij is the normalized nondimensional streamflow of day j in year i parameter θ of the transformation is determined by the trial and error fdc of an intermittent river crosses the horizontal axis at a given percentage of time of exceedance where streamflow is equal to zero this is called the cease to flow point τ in other words it is the complementary percentage of the intermittency ratio of the river which is the percentage of number of days with no flow over the total number of days through the period of record the cease to flow point depends on physical characteristics of the river basin and also precipitation therefore we propose a regression type empirical model in the form of 3 τ c 1 a b 1 p b 2 h b 3 s b 4 d b 5 which takes into account the drainage area of the river basin a annual precipitation p basin relief h topographical slope s and drainage density d as independent variables c 1 and b i i 1 5 in equation 3 are parameters of the model this is one of the central parts of the daily fdc model in this study the cease to flow point τ is needed to be rescaled as the normalization was applied on the non zero portion of the daily streamflow data by ignoring zero values in the streamflow record thus the exceedance percentage d is rescaled to d by 4 d 100 d τ now that the cease to flow point τ is rescaled normalized quantile corresponding to the exceedance percentage d w d is calculated as 5 w d μ w z d σ w where μ w and σ w are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized streamflow respectively and z d is the standard normal variable at the rescaled percentage d corresponding to the exceedance percentage d given that w d and θ are known the q quantile of exceedance percentage d q d is obtained by 6 q d w d 1 θ which is the inverse transformation of equation 2 another central part of the model is the long term annual mean streamflow discharge q m in this study it is calculated for each river basin by an empirical equation based on the drainage area in km2 annual precipitation in mm basin relief in m topographical slope of the river channel in percent and drainage density of the river basin in km km2 we propose a nonlinear form function as 7 q m c 2 a b 6 p b 7 h b 8 s b 9 d b 10 in which c 2 and b i i 6 10 are parameters among the independent variables in equation 7 the drainage area slope basin relief and drainage density are obtained from the digital elevation model dem of the river basin basin relief is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations and the drainage density is the ratio of the total length of the main channel and its tributaries to the basin area we used the freely available merit dem which gives precise results particularly in river basins small in size url 1 as the precipitation we used the annual mean value which is the areally averaged value calculated from the thiessen polygon of the existing meteorological network in and around the river basin once the long term annual mean streamflow discharge q m of the river basin is determined by the empirically derived function in equation 7 the dimensional q quantile of the exceedance percentage d q d can be calculated as 8 q d q m q d for any ungauged site within the river basin the model is based on the already known concepts two of which were paid particular attention the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow both determined empirically by multi variable log linear regression equations 3 and 7 respectively the fdc model is implemented through a number of steps detailed above all being straightforward using simple statistical tools and easily accesible data such as the precipitation and physical characteristics of the drainage area of the ungauged location the model is then expected to calculate streamflow corresponding to any exceedance percentage of time with an acceptable level of precision thus it is applicable for any ungauged location within a gauged river basin metrics in table 1 were used to check the performance of the model quantiles of d 1 2 5 10 20 30 50 70 80 90 95 98 99 were considered in calculating the performance metrics except for the biasfhv biasflv and sfdc for which only streamflow at 20 and 70 exceedance were used the performance metrics show how successful the model is in simulating the upper middle and lower parts of the observed fdc the decision is given based on the performance criteria in table 2 3 study area and data three river basins from different geographical regions in turkey were selected for the case studies meric in northwest gediz in west and ceyhan in south fig 2 the meric river basin flowing southerly discharges into the aegean sea in the northwest part of the country although they are comparable it is the smallest among the three river basins in size it has the second highest precipitation runoff runoff coefficient and yield table 3 the westerly flowing gediz river in the aegean region of turkey is the second in terms of its drainage area with the least amount of precipitation runoff and yield and the smallest runoff coefficient ceyhan river flowing southerly into the mediterranean sea in the south of the country is the largest in size with the highest precipitation runoff and runoff coefficient as well as the yield aksoy 2020 precipitation records were acquired from the general directorate of meteorology mgm of turkey monthly precipitation data are available for 89 meteorological stations fig 2 table 4 scattered within and around the river basins their observation period extends from 1960 to 2016 number of precipitation data reaches 39 696 station months in total this is a quite large amount of data to use for understanding the precipitation characteristics of the river basins streamflow records were obtained from the general directorate of state hydraulic works dsi of turkey from the three river basins 48 sgss were used in total table 4 observation period of sgss extends from 1954 to 2015 number of daily streamflow data reaches 406 610 in total this is a dataset large enough to use for understanding the characteristics of the daily fdc of a river basin we considered streamflow data with no anthropogenic effects i e when a human made reservoir exists at the upstream part of any sgs data before the reservoir has been in operation were considered three sgss were used for each river basin to validate the model while the rest were allocated for the calibration stage table 4 statistical characteristics were calculated from the streamflow data while physical characteristics from the dems and precipitation from the thiessen polygons of the meteorological network all presented in table 5 for the calibration and validation stages separately 4 results and discussion we applied the fdc model on the data set of the three river basins results are presented and discussed as follows in the first step of the model the daily streamflow data were nondimensionalized by using equation 1 i e the daily streamflow discharge was divided by the sgs specific long term mean streamflow in accordance with the model structure in fig 1 we lumped the dimensionless streamflow data from all gauging stations in the river basin a simple power transformation equation 2 was applied when the dataset does not conform normality zero flows were exempted from the normalization the normalization parameter θ was obtained by the trial and error table 6 we see that θ decreased when the intermittency ratio increased which indicates that it is site specific when we look at the meric river basin as an example we see that the lumped value of θ is 0 098 while its mean value calculated from 15 sgss is 0 068 and changing within the range 0 013 and 0 156 we found also that θ 0 05 for 5 gauging stations 0 05 θ 0 10 for 8 gauging stations and 0 1 θ for 2 gauging stations in the river basin however due to the lumped character of the methodology we adopt one single value for each river basin table 6 this choice was preferred as a lumped value will make the methodology much more practical when it is considered that it is proposed for sub basins with no hydrometric data the χ 2 test was applied on the transformed data to check the goodness of fit of the normal probability distribution confirming that the transformed w values fit the normal distribution at the 10 significance level the q q plots of the observed data and the theoretical quantiles show this visually for the three river basins fig 3 a very good fit is observed in the gediz and ceyhan river basins including the high and low extremes although the most fits the normal probability distribution the high flow part has a small deviation from the normal distribution in the meric river basin which can be connected to the streamflow with the high tendency to get dry in this particular river basin however it is seen that the central part of the data set fits quite well to the normal distribution while the lower and higher portions of the data deviate from the normality the lower and higher limits of the central part of the data sets are 2 5 z 2 5 2 0 z 3 5 2 5 z 3 5 for meric gediz and ceyhan river basins respectively where z is the standardized normal variable the probability that the flow takes a value beyond the lower and upper limits is quite small 1 24 for meric 2 30 for gediz and 0 64 for ceyhan which means that compared to the well fit central part the ill fit portion of the data set is significantly small this shows that the normalization was well satisfied now with the normalization was made the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional flows were calculated for each river basin as in table 6 the cease to flow point is one of the two central parts of the model for the selected sgss it changes from 50 to 100 we suggested a nonlinear multivariable regression model equation 3 in which physical characteristics of the river basin were used together with precipitation as the input variables it has a log linear form and is a function of the drainage area precipitation basin relief slope and drainage density 9 log τ l o g c 1 b 1 log a b 2 log p b 3 log h b 4 log s b 5 log d the cease to point varies considerably from one sgs to another it is therefore not straightforward to simulate the cease to point at once by using one single relation for the entire river basin shao et al 2009 thus a classification would be needed to divide sgss for which there is no strict rule sawicz et al 2011 following the literature we found that a classification based on the drainage area was feasible post 2004 for example sassu et al 2021 separated 36 catchments into two classes catchments with drainage area larger or smaller than 100 km2 in a similar way we divided sgss into three small medium and large subbasins based on the drainage area the classification was decided such that the sgss were shared evenly among the three classes for a proper statistical analysis in each class the class limits were dertermined as in table 7 in which and the parameters are also given for each river basin and each class also given in table 7 are the performance metrics of the models at the calibration and validation stages for each river basin results indicate a good similarity between the observed and estimated cease to flow points the largest deviation from the observation is 9 only the estimated cease to flow points obtained by using equation 9 are visualized in fig 4 the model is successful not only in low values of the cease to flow point but also in its high values i e it calculates the cease to flow point properly being a unique aspect of this study the cease to flow point is now readily available to use for the development of the daily fdc at any ungauged location within a gauged river basin it provides a better approximation compared to the cases existing in the literature with relative errors not being lower than 30 40 shao et al 2009 therefore we consider this an achievement over the existing literature the mean and standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional flows and the river basin specific regional parameters of the normal probability distribution are now known to calculate the nondimensional flow w d corresponding to any exceedance percentage d for any ungauged intermittent subbasin within the gauged basin note that the exceedance percentage d was rescaled by using equation 4 for each sgs the nondimensional flows corresponding to any quantile d w d in the range 0 100 can now be calculated after which we transform them back into their original distribution by equation 6 the nondimensional form streamflow sequences were dimensionalized by applying equation 8 the final regression equation of the long term mean streamflow was established in the log linear form as 10 log q m l o g c 2 b 6 log a b 7 log p b 8 log h b 9 log s b 10 log d for which parameters in table 8 were obtained a regression model becomes more effective with adding each of the significant variables while an insignificant variable will likely make it worse we applied several tests in selecting proper variables of the regression models in this sense for each river basin by calculating the t statistics and checking the significance level p 0 1 of each table 8 the test found a p h s and d significant for the meric river basin but s insignificant for the gediz river basin for the ceyhan river basin only a and h were found significant the multicollinearity was also checked for which the variance inflation factor vif was used in the ideal case vif 1 corresponding to the zero correlation between variables in the model helsel et al 2020 although no universal definition is applied vif not higher than 10 is commonly considered acceptable and the best case would be if it is lower than 5 thus vif values lower than 10 for meric and lower than 5 for gediz and ceyhan river basins show no multicollinearity between the significant variables in the regression models table 8 for the validation of the models the f test was used the significance levels were calculated as p 0 079 0 001 and 0 007 in meric gediz and ceyhan river basins respectively thus the log linear regression models were validated at the 10 significance level finally the durbin watson dw test was used to further evaluate the dependence i e the serial correlation of the residuals in the models durbin and watson 1950 it tests the null hypothesis that the residuals from an ordinary least squares regression are not autocorrelated against the alternative that the residuals follow an autoregressive process the dw statistics is very closely related to the serial correlation coefficient it has a range from zero to 4 and a value approaching 2 indicates no autocorrelation the dw statistics were calculated as 2 30 1 62 and 2 13 for the meric gediz and ceyhan river basins respectively indicating that the model are all not autocorrelated thus the long term mean streamflow models were validated for the three river basins performance of the models equation 10 was checked by using the determination coefficient r2 root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae table 8 results are slightly better in the calibration than the validation when rmse and mae are compared this can be connected to the low number of sgs used in the validation stage it is possible to state that the models provide long term mean streamflow for the three river basins at acceptable levels fig 5 i e the models are satisfactory streamflow at any exceedance percentage d q d can be calculated for any ungauged location in the gauged river basin by using the regression equations for the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow the three parameters in table 6 are only needed which are the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional daily streamflow time series of the river basin and the normalization parameter the fdc model was applied on 48 sgss from the meric gediz and ceyhan river basins sgss were divided between the calibration and validation stages the validation sgss are given in fig 6 in which fdcs of each year are plotted together with fdc of the entire streamflow record it is possible to visually check the similarity between the modelled and the observed fdcs in fig 6 and the performance metrics in table 9 confirm this only two gauging stations one in meric and another in gediz showed low performance in approaching the observation higher biasflv were calculated to indicate lower performance at e01a010 in the meric river basin and higher biasfhv at d05a039 in the gediz river basin this is thought to be because of the rapid decline at the former and the high cease to flow point at the latter however when the overall performance is considered rather than the performance at each single sgs one may conclude that the model is successful in the meric and gediz river basins ceyhan river basin shows considerably better performance sgss selected from the ceyhan river basin for the validation of the model have higher cease to flow points compared to the sgss selected from the meric and gediz river basins the cease to flow point is higher particularly at e20a016 in the ceyhan river basin because of its higher low flows this particular sgs does not have a tendency to get dry higher values than their observed counterparts were estimated for high discharges i e floods of this particular sgs whereas lower flows were calculated for low flows this brings the seasonality issue which cannot be avoided in a periodic time series such as the daily streamflow it is more pronounced when the intermittent streamflow data are considered which is the case in this study however the seasonality was not considered in the fdc model here in order to avoid the complexity in the model development and to make the model as simple as possible this simplicity in the model development has been achieved by concentrating on the empirical formulations of the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow thus the fdc model can be proposed as a practically applicable model yet it is important to emphasize that the model is open for further research in the future in this sense the model provides quite acceptable results and it is better for lower cease to flow points the long term mean streamflow is found better for sgss with smaller size of drainage area i e fdcs of small river basins were approached better by the model this comes from the empiricism of the approach which can be seen as the limitation of the model and be related to the range and volume of the existing data set used in the model development yet the model is a development for the hydrological science it is particularly useful for the practice in ungauged intermittent subbasins of gauged rivers because the model requires only the mean and the standard deviation of the nondimensionalized streamflow at the river basin scale in addition to the annual precipitation and physical characteristics of the ungauged location precipitation of an ungauged point can be obtained from the precipitation maps of the region while physical characteristics are easy to obtain by using gis tools therefore despite its limitations due to the empiricism it should be emphasized that the model is an important progress in hydrology to obtain the daily fdc at any ungauged point flowing intermittently within a gauged river basin 5 conclusions a daily flow duration curve model for ungauged intermittent subbasins of gauged rivers is developed in this study streamflow and precipitation data are used together with physical characteristics of the river basin the daily streamflow data of gauging stations in the river basin are nondimensionalized by dividing with their own long term average in the model it is first checked if the data fit the normal distribution if not the normalization procedure is applied on the daily streamflow data at the river basin scale i e the nondimensionalized daily streamflow data of the river basin are normalized by using one parameter for the entire river basin one central part of the model is the long term mean streamflow of the river basin it is linked to the drainage area annual precipitation basin relief topographical slope and drainage density through an empirical multivariable log linear regression equation a particular attention was also given to the cease to flow point in the daily fdcs of the intermittent streams for which a nonlinear regression equation is proposed using precipitation together with basin characteristics one single equation is found not satisfactory enough to represent the entire river basin therefeore sgss are divided between three classes large medium and small in terms of their size in drainage area for modelling the cease to flow point with the classified regression models results show quite good simulations approaching to the observed cease to flow points with minor deviations only the river basin scale average and standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional streamflow are needed to calculate the nondimensional flow quantiles of any exceedance probability the long term average basin scale streamflow estimated by the regression equation is used to convert the normalized nondimensional flow quantiles to their dimensional equivalents possessing their original probability distribution this is the advantage of the model which makes the study significant for the hydrological research and practice case study based on 407 340 station day streamflow data of 48 gauging stations in meric gediz and ceyhan river basins in turkey shows the applicability of the model which yielded successful results in replicating the recorded daily streamflow duration curves the best performance was obtained in meric among the three river basins and the least in ceyhan the river basin specific results might be linked to the intermittency ratio or the cease to flow of the river basins as meric and ceyhan river basins have the highest and the least intermittency ratios respectively the conclusion is that higher intermittency i e lower cease to flow point makes the model to perform better another conclusive observation is that the model generates better fdcs if the ungauged location is more similar to the river basin in terms of the hydrometeorological behaviour and morphological structure both the long term mean streamflow and the cease to flow point are determined by regression type empirical models better performance of the empirical models will increase the overall performance of the fdc model substantially for which future thoughts will always be needed credit authorship contribution statement halil ibrahim burgan conceptualization methodology software

3845,in this study we develop a daily flow duration curve model for ungauged intermittent subbasins of gauged rivers the long term mean streamflow of the river basin one of the central parts in the model is calculated with a regression model of annual precipitation and physical characteristics of the river basin e g drainage area basin relief topographical slope drainage density the input data of the model are normally accesible and this makes the model applicable to ungauged points within the river basin another central part of the model is the cease to flow point which makes the model significant for intermittent rivers the daily streamflow discharge recorded in gauging stations over the river basin is nondimensionalized by dividing each with their own long term mean and their collection is transformed to fit the normal probability distribution i e the normalized nondimensional daily streamflow data are used in the model the streamflow data are inverted back to the original distribution for any given exceedance percentage by incorporating the cease to flow point and are dimensionalized finally by using the empirically derived long term mean streamflow discharge the model is applied on hundreds of thousands station day daily streamflow data from three river basins in different geographical regions in turkey results of the case studies are found promising to propose the model as a good foundation for the daily flow duration curve at an ungauged intermittent subbasin of gauged rivers however it is noticeable that the model might have low performance in some particular gauging stations where the hydrological behavior deviates from the general characteristics of the river basin this can be overcome by developing empirical models better approaching the observed long term mean streamflow which is a key issue of the model keywords cease to flow point daily streamflow flow duration curve intermittent river ungauged basin 1 introduction flow duration curve fdc is a handy tool to determine the streamflow in a river with a certain time of exceedance it is a signature that characterizes the hydrological regime of the river basin viglione et al 2013 it also explains the flow variability because it is widely used in the determination of high flows i e floods as well as in the calculation of low flows fennessey and vogel 1990 at the lower extreme fdc can also be taken as a signature for the drought at the river basin sugiyama et al 2003 in a gauged river basin fdc is obtained by sorting the observed streamflow data from the largest to the smallest and plotting each against the corresponding exceedance percentages castellarin et al 2007 in case no data exist i e at an ungauged location empirical methods emerge to use for the fdc not only the point scale fdcs but also their regional extension are generated both being quite useful in the hydrological practice such as the urban storm water system design environmental flow allocation hydropower potential and water availability quimpo et al 1983 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 franchini and suppo 1996 castellarin et al 2004a baltas 2012 kim et al 2014 fdc related studies started as early as the first half of the 20th century saville and watson 1933 various approaches have been proposed in the literature for the fdcs castellarin et al 2004a for example smakhtin et al 1997 and ridolfi et al 2020 used the so called parametric and graphical approaches respectively statistical approaches consider basin characteristics such as the drainage area through the use of regression analysis singh 1971 singh et al 2001 wittenberg 1987 estimated fdc of the river basin based on parameters of the probability distribution function and basin characteristics cigizoglu 2000 introduced a probabilistic method atieh et al 2015 doulatyari et al 2015 and boscarello et al 2016 developed empirical and probabilistic fdc models with an emphasis on the seasonality in the streamflow yu and yang 1996 used the cluster analysis to obtain synthetic fdcs whose quantiles were estimated by the drainage area of the river basin yu et al 2002 found the polynomial approximation more successful than the area index method also analytical expressions are available muller et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 muller and thompson 2016 with increasing global water demand non perennial rivers have received an interest greater than before aksoy and bayazit 2000 aksoy 2003 flow is uninterrupted and continuous in a perennial stream while it is interrupted and intermittent otherwise an ephemeral river is affected directly by the rainfall as it mostly remains dry during rainless periods an intermittent river however flows most of the time it might get dry in rainless periods of the year in the absence of rainfall or when the groundwater level is not high enough to recharge the stream despite their increasing importance fdc of intermittent rivers have not been that popular excluding a limited number of studies for example in order to calculate the cease to flow point croker et al 2003 developed fdcs for gauged locations by using the total probability theorem haan 1977 and a log linear regression equation using the mean annual rainfall of the river basin the cease to flow point is the intermittency ratio of the river which corresponds to the percentage of number of days with no flow over the total number of days through the period of record shao et al 2009 post et al 2004 and costa et al 2014 combined the mean flow and basin characteristics together with the cease to flow point and the slope of fdc viola et al 2011 and rianna et al 2011 2013 suggested the use of regional models and stochastic indices respectively to identify fdc of intermittent rivers the use of fdcs depends on data availability they are applicable in gauged river basins and can be used up to an extent at quasi gauged basins hughes and smakhtin 1996 the fdc practice becomes harder when the river basin is fully ungauged sivapalan et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 a few example to mention are mohamoud 2008 ganora et al 2009 li et al 2010 atieh et al 2017 chouaib et al 2019 fouad and loaiciga 2020 and wolff and duarte 2021 who developed fdc models at ungauged sites using various approximations ranging from the nonparametric methods to the regression analysis on the other hand frequency analysis has been a common methodology in the identification of the best fit probability distribution function to obtain the fdc for example castellarin et al 2004b showed that the three parameter lognormal ln3 probability distribution function fitted the daily streamflow bozchaloei and vafakhah 2015 fitted various probability distribution functions to the streamflow data at nine probabilities of exceedance d 2 10 15 20 30 75 90 92 95 zero values in the records are treated by the total probability theorem coupled frequency analysis eris et al 2019 cavus and aksoy 2019 2020 aksoy et al 2021 in many cases the best fit probability distribution function is not able to mimic the whole fdc it can well fit its central part but it deviates at the upper and lower tails i e the observed and estimated values of high flows and low flows stay far from each other yue and wang 2004 mendicino and senatore 2013 papalexiou 2018 chilkoti et al 2019 costa et al 2020 this is because of different physical mechanisms behind the lower and upper extremes and the average character of the river basin eventually this is the reason why ghotbi et al 2020 suggested the baseflow separation technique to better simulate the fast and slow flow components of fdcs individually in this study we develop a daily fdc model for ungauged intermittent river subbasins of gauged rivers it is an improvement over the annual and monthly time scale fdc models of burgan 2019 and burgan and aksoy 2018 2020 we consider the daily time scale and take the intermittency into account case studies are based on hundreds of thousands station day streamflow data from three geographically different river basins in turkey the fdc model in this study is statistically basic yet it carries significant importance for ungauged intermittent river subbasins as the central parts of the model a particular attention was paid to the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow of the river basin for which the procedure of singh et al 2001 was followed in the following sections the fdc model is introduced together with the statistical tools and their step by step implementation physical variables of the regression equations performance metrics and criteria are then defined next the study area and data are explained after which results are discussed and conclusions are given at the end 2 the fdc model the model we propose in this study derives the fdc at ungauged locations in the basin of gauged rivers it uses the daily data from as many of streamflow gauging stations sgss as possible scattered homogenously over the river basin to ensure a good spatial representation it takes into account the precipitation data together with the physical characteristics of the river basin the model is based on simple tools i e it is a practical model for the hydrological community its implementation consists of a number of steps depicted in fig 1 and explained as follows the model starts with the nondimensionalization of the daily streamfow data at each sgs mean streamflow q ij of day j in year i is divided by q m the sgs specific long term mean streamflow as 1 q ij q ij q m i 1 2 n j 1 2 365 to get q ij the nondimensional daily streamflow time series the model presumes that the nondimensional daily streamflow data satisfy the normality which is checked by the χ 2 test at a given significance level in case of the non normality the nondimensional daily streamflow data are normalized by 2 w ij q ij θ i 1 2 n j 1 2 365 where w ij is the normalized nondimensional streamflow of day j in year i parameter θ of the transformation is determined by the trial and error fdc of an intermittent river crosses the horizontal axis at a given percentage of time of exceedance where streamflow is equal to zero this is called the cease to flow point τ in other words it is the complementary percentage of the intermittency ratio of the river which is the percentage of number of days with no flow over the total number of days through the period of record the cease to flow point depends on physical characteristics of the river basin and also precipitation therefore we propose a regression type empirical model in the form of 3 τ c 1 a b 1 p b 2 h b 3 s b 4 d b 5 which takes into account the drainage area of the river basin a annual precipitation p basin relief h topographical slope s and drainage density d as independent variables c 1 and b i i 1 5 in equation 3 are parameters of the model this is one of the central parts of the daily fdc model in this study the cease to flow point τ is needed to be rescaled as the normalization was applied on the non zero portion of the daily streamflow data by ignoring zero values in the streamflow record thus the exceedance percentage d is rescaled to d by 4 d 100 d τ now that the cease to flow point τ is rescaled normalized quantile corresponding to the exceedance percentage d w d is calculated as 5 w d μ w z d σ w where μ w and σ w are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized streamflow respectively and z d is the standard normal variable at the rescaled percentage d corresponding to the exceedance percentage d given that w d and θ are known the q quantile of exceedance percentage d q d is obtained by 6 q d w d 1 θ which is the inverse transformation of equation 2 another central part of the model is the long term annual mean streamflow discharge q m in this study it is calculated for each river basin by an empirical equation based on the drainage area in km2 annual precipitation in mm basin relief in m topographical slope of the river channel in percent and drainage density of the river basin in km km2 we propose a nonlinear form function as 7 q m c 2 a b 6 p b 7 h b 8 s b 9 d b 10 in which c 2 and b i i 6 10 are parameters among the independent variables in equation 7 the drainage area slope basin relief and drainage density are obtained from the digital elevation model dem of the river basin basin relief is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elevations and the drainage density is the ratio of the total length of the main channel and its tributaries to the basin area we used the freely available merit dem which gives precise results particularly in river basins small in size url 1 as the precipitation we used the annual mean value which is the areally averaged value calculated from the thiessen polygon of the existing meteorological network in and around the river basin once the long term annual mean streamflow discharge q m of the river basin is determined by the empirically derived function in equation 7 the dimensional q quantile of the exceedance percentage d q d can be calculated as 8 q d q m q d for any ungauged site within the river basin the model is based on the already known concepts two of which were paid particular attention the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow both determined empirically by multi variable log linear regression equations 3 and 7 respectively the fdc model is implemented through a number of steps detailed above all being straightforward using simple statistical tools and easily accesible data such as the precipitation and physical characteristics of the drainage area of the ungauged location the model is then expected to calculate streamflow corresponding to any exceedance percentage of time with an acceptable level of precision thus it is applicable for any ungauged location within a gauged river basin metrics in table 1 were used to check the performance of the model quantiles of d 1 2 5 10 20 30 50 70 80 90 95 98 99 were considered in calculating the performance metrics except for the biasfhv biasflv and sfdc for which only streamflow at 20 and 70 exceedance were used the performance metrics show how successful the model is in simulating the upper middle and lower parts of the observed fdc the decision is given based on the performance criteria in table 2 3 study area and data three river basins from different geographical regions in turkey were selected for the case studies meric in northwest gediz in west and ceyhan in south fig 2 the meric river basin flowing southerly discharges into the aegean sea in the northwest part of the country although they are comparable it is the smallest among the three river basins in size it has the second highest precipitation runoff runoff coefficient and yield table 3 the westerly flowing gediz river in the aegean region of turkey is the second in terms of its drainage area with the least amount of precipitation runoff and yield and the smallest runoff coefficient ceyhan river flowing southerly into the mediterranean sea in the south of the country is the largest in size with the highest precipitation runoff and runoff coefficient as well as the yield aksoy 2020 precipitation records were acquired from the general directorate of meteorology mgm of turkey monthly precipitation data are available for 89 meteorological stations fig 2 table 4 scattered within and around the river basins their observation period extends from 1960 to 2016 number of precipitation data reaches 39 696 station months in total this is a quite large amount of data to use for understanding the precipitation characteristics of the river basins streamflow records were obtained from the general directorate of state hydraulic works dsi of turkey from the three river basins 48 sgss were used in total table 4 observation period of sgss extends from 1954 to 2015 number of daily streamflow data reaches 406 610 in total this is a dataset large enough to use for understanding the characteristics of the daily fdc of a river basin we considered streamflow data with no anthropogenic effects i e when a human made reservoir exists at the upstream part of any sgs data before the reservoir has been in operation were considered three sgss were used for each river basin to validate the model while the rest were allocated for the calibration stage table 4 statistical characteristics were calculated from the streamflow data while physical characteristics from the dems and precipitation from the thiessen polygons of the meteorological network all presented in table 5 for the calibration and validation stages separately 4 results and discussion we applied the fdc model on the data set of the three river basins results are presented and discussed as follows in the first step of the model the daily streamflow data were nondimensionalized by using equation 1 i e the daily streamflow discharge was divided by the sgs specific long term mean streamflow in accordance with the model structure in fig 1 we lumped the dimensionless streamflow data from all gauging stations in the river basin a simple power transformation equation 2 was applied when the dataset does not conform normality zero flows were exempted from the normalization the normalization parameter θ was obtained by the trial and error table 6 we see that θ decreased when the intermittency ratio increased which indicates that it is site specific when we look at the meric river basin as an example we see that the lumped value of θ is 0 098 while its mean value calculated from 15 sgss is 0 068 and changing within the range 0 013 and 0 156 we found also that θ 0 05 for 5 gauging stations 0 05 θ 0 10 for 8 gauging stations and 0 1 θ for 2 gauging stations in the river basin however due to the lumped character of the methodology we adopt one single value for each river basin table 6 this choice was preferred as a lumped value will make the methodology much more practical when it is considered that it is proposed for sub basins with no hydrometric data the χ 2 test was applied on the transformed data to check the goodness of fit of the normal probability distribution confirming that the transformed w values fit the normal distribution at the 10 significance level the q q plots of the observed data and the theoretical quantiles show this visually for the three river basins fig 3 a very good fit is observed in the gediz and ceyhan river basins including the high and low extremes although the most fits the normal probability distribution the high flow part has a small deviation from the normal distribution in the meric river basin which can be connected to the streamflow with the high tendency to get dry in this particular river basin however it is seen that the central part of the data set fits quite well to the normal distribution while the lower and higher portions of the data deviate from the normality the lower and higher limits of the central part of the data sets are 2 5 z 2 5 2 0 z 3 5 2 5 z 3 5 for meric gediz and ceyhan river basins respectively where z is the standardized normal variable the probability that the flow takes a value beyond the lower and upper limits is quite small 1 24 for meric 2 30 for gediz and 0 64 for ceyhan which means that compared to the well fit central part the ill fit portion of the data set is significantly small this shows that the normalization was well satisfied now with the normalization was made the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional flows were calculated for each river basin as in table 6 the cease to flow point is one of the two central parts of the model for the selected sgss it changes from 50 to 100 we suggested a nonlinear multivariable regression model equation 3 in which physical characteristics of the river basin were used together with precipitation as the input variables it has a log linear form and is a function of the drainage area precipitation basin relief slope and drainage density 9 log τ l o g c 1 b 1 log a b 2 log p b 3 log h b 4 log s b 5 log d the cease to point varies considerably from one sgs to another it is therefore not straightforward to simulate the cease to point at once by using one single relation for the entire river basin shao et al 2009 thus a classification would be needed to divide sgss for which there is no strict rule sawicz et al 2011 following the literature we found that a classification based on the drainage area was feasible post 2004 for example sassu et al 2021 separated 36 catchments into two classes catchments with drainage area larger or smaller than 100 km2 in a similar way we divided sgss into three small medium and large subbasins based on the drainage area the classification was decided such that the sgss were shared evenly among the three classes for a proper statistical analysis in each class the class limits were dertermined as in table 7 in which and the parameters are also given for each river basin and each class also given in table 7 are the performance metrics of the models at the calibration and validation stages for each river basin results indicate a good similarity between the observed and estimated cease to flow points the largest deviation from the observation is 9 only the estimated cease to flow points obtained by using equation 9 are visualized in fig 4 the model is successful not only in low values of the cease to flow point but also in its high values i e it calculates the cease to flow point properly being a unique aspect of this study the cease to flow point is now readily available to use for the development of the daily fdc at any ungauged location within a gauged river basin it provides a better approximation compared to the cases existing in the literature with relative errors not being lower than 30 40 shao et al 2009 therefore we consider this an achievement over the existing literature the mean and standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional flows and the river basin specific regional parameters of the normal probability distribution are now known to calculate the nondimensional flow w d corresponding to any exceedance percentage d for any ungauged intermittent subbasin within the gauged basin note that the exceedance percentage d was rescaled by using equation 4 for each sgs the nondimensional flows corresponding to any quantile d w d in the range 0 100 can now be calculated after which we transform them back into their original distribution by equation 6 the nondimensional form streamflow sequences were dimensionalized by applying equation 8 the final regression equation of the long term mean streamflow was established in the log linear form as 10 log q m l o g c 2 b 6 log a b 7 log p b 8 log h b 9 log s b 10 log d for which parameters in table 8 were obtained a regression model becomes more effective with adding each of the significant variables while an insignificant variable will likely make it worse we applied several tests in selecting proper variables of the regression models in this sense for each river basin by calculating the t statistics and checking the significance level p 0 1 of each table 8 the test found a p h s and d significant for the meric river basin but s insignificant for the gediz river basin for the ceyhan river basin only a and h were found significant the multicollinearity was also checked for which the variance inflation factor vif was used in the ideal case vif 1 corresponding to the zero correlation between variables in the model helsel et al 2020 although no universal definition is applied vif not higher than 10 is commonly considered acceptable and the best case would be if it is lower than 5 thus vif values lower than 10 for meric and lower than 5 for gediz and ceyhan river basins show no multicollinearity between the significant variables in the regression models table 8 for the validation of the models the f test was used the significance levels were calculated as p 0 079 0 001 and 0 007 in meric gediz and ceyhan river basins respectively thus the log linear regression models were validated at the 10 significance level finally the durbin watson dw test was used to further evaluate the dependence i e the serial correlation of the residuals in the models durbin and watson 1950 it tests the null hypothesis that the residuals from an ordinary least squares regression are not autocorrelated against the alternative that the residuals follow an autoregressive process the dw statistics is very closely related to the serial correlation coefficient it has a range from zero to 4 and a value approaching 2 indicates no autocorrelation the dw statistics were calculated as 2 30 1 62 and 2 13 for the meric gediz and ceyhan river basins respectively indicating that the model are all not autocorrelated thus the long term mean streamflow models were validated for the three river basins performance of the models equation 10 was checked by using the determination coefficient r2 root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae table 8 results are slightly better in the calibration than the validation when rmse and mae are compared this can be connected to the low number of sgs used in the validation stage it is possible to state that the models provide long term mean streamflow for the three river basins at acceptable levels fig 5 i e the models are satisfactory streamflow at any exceedance percentage d q d can be calculated for any ungauged location in the gauged river basin by using the regression equations for the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow the three parameters in table 6 are only needed which are the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional daily streamflow time series of the river basin and the normalization parameter the fdc model was applied on 48 sgss from the meric gediz and ceyhan river basins sgss were divided between the calibration and validation stages the validation sgss are given in fig 6 in which fdcs of each year are plotted together with fdc of the entire streamflow record it is possible to visually check the similarity between the modelled and the observed fdcs in fig 6 and the performance metrics in table 9 confirm this only two gauging stations one in meric and another in gediz showed low performance in approaching the observation higher biasflv were calculated to indicate lower performance at e01a010 in the meric river basin and higher biasfhv at d05a039 in the gediz river basin this is thought to be because of the rapid decline at the former and the high cease to flow point at the latter however when the overall performance is considered rather than the performance at each single sgs one may conclude that the model is successful in the meric and gediz river basins ceyhan river basin shows considerably better performance sgss selected from the ceyhan river basin for the validation of the model have higher cease to flow points compared to the sgss selected from the meric and gediz river basins the cease to flow point is higher particularly at e20a016 in the ceyhan river basin because of its higher low flows this particular sgs does not have a tendency to get dry higher values than their observed counterparts were estimated for high discharges i e floods of this particular sgs whereas lower flows were calculated for low flows this brings the seasonality issue which cannot be avoided in a periodic time series such as the daily streamflow it is more pronounced when the intermittent streamflow data are considered which is the case in this study however the seasonality was not considered in the fdc model here in order to avoid the complexity in the model development and to make the model as simple as possible this simplicity in the model development has been achieved by concentrating on the empirical formulations of the cease to flow point and the long term mean streamflow thus the fdc model can be proposed as a practically applicable model yet it is important to emphasize that the model is open for further research in the future in this sense the model provides quite acceptable results and it is better for lower cease to flow points the long term mean streamflow is found better for sgss with smaller size of drainage area i e fdcs of small river basins were approached better by the model this comes from the empiricism of the approach which can be seen as the limitation of the model and be related to the range and volume of the existing data set used in the model development yet the model is a development for the hydrological science it is particularly useful for the practice in ungauged intermittent subbasins of gauged rivers because the model requires only the mean and the standard deviation of the nondimensionalized streamflow at the river basin scale in addition to the annual precipitation and physical characteristics of the ungauged location precipitation of an ungauged point can be obtained from the precipitation maps of the region while physical characteristics are easy to obtain by using gis tools therefore despite its limitations due to the empiricism it should be emphasized that the model is an important progress in hydrology to obtain the daily fdc at any ungauged point flowing intermittently within a gauged river basin 5 conclusions a daily flow duration curve model for ungauged intermittent subbasins of gauged rivers is developed in this study streamflow and precipitation data are used together with physical characteristics of the river basin the daily streamflow data of gauging stations in the river basin are nondimensionalized by dividing with their own long term average in the model it is first checked if the data fit the normal distribution if not the normalization procedure is applied on the daily streamflow data at the river basin scale i e the nondimensionalized daily streamflow data of the river basin are normalized by using one parameter for the entire river basin one central part of the model is the long term mean streamflow of the river basin it is linked to the drainage area annual precipitation basin relief topographical slope and drainage density through an empirical multivariable log linear regression equation a particular attention was also given to the cease to flow point in the daily fdcs of the intermittent streams for which a nonlinear regression equation is proposed using precipitation together with basin characteristics one single equation is found not satisfactory enough to represent the entire river basin therefeore sgss are divided between three classes large medium and small in terms of their size in drainage area for modelling the cease to flow point with the classified regression models results show quite good simulations approaching to the observed cease to flow points with minor deviations only the river basin scale average and standard deviation of the normalized nondimensional streamflow are needed to calculate the nondimensional flow quantiles of any exceedance probability the long term average basin scale streamflow estimated by the regression equation is used to convert the normalized nondimensional flow quantiles to their dimensional equivalents possessing their original probability distribution this is the advantage of the model which makes the study significant for the hydrological research and practice case study based on 407 340 station day streamflow data of 48 gauging stations in meric gediz and ceyhan river basins in turkey shows the applicability of the model which yielded successful results in replicating the recorded daily streamflow duration curves the best performance was obtained in meric among the three river basins and the least in ceyhan the river basin specific results might be linked to the intermittency ratio or the cease to flow of the river basins as meric and ceyhan river basins have the highest and the least intermittency ratios respectively the conclusion is that higher intermittency i e lower cease to flow point makes the model to perform better another conclusive observation is that the model generates better fdcs if the ungauged location is more similar to the river basin in terms of the hydrometeorological behaviour and morphological structure both the long term mean streamflow and the cease to flow point are determined by regression type empirical models better performance of the empirical models will increase the overall performance of the fdc model substantially for which future thoughts will always be needed credit authorship contribution statement halil ibrahim burgan conceptualization methodology software

3846,insights into seismic precursors have been obtained in the last decades however a detailed understanding of hydrogeochemical anomalies prior to earthquakes still remains the aim of many research teams worldwide in order to investigate the earthquake groundwater relationship between 2018 and 2020 we performed sampling surveys coupled with continuous multiparametric monitoring in grassano spring fed by the matese aquifer central southern apennines italy hydrogeochemical changes were observed before the onset and during the 2019 benevento seismic sequence including dissolved co2 increase ph lowering and anomalies in major ions i e ca2 na hco3 that later recovered to their typical concentrations we suggest that variations in groundwater geochemistry were induced by dilatative preparatory phases of earthquakes typical of the extensional setting this condition allowed the deep co2 upwelling along tectonic discontinuities as testified by the cext carbon from external sources behaviour detected in grassano groundwater during the 2019 year despite the small intermediate magnitude of the mainshock results highlight and confirm the occurrence of a potential pre seismic

most of the interpretations agree in attributing hydrogeochemical anomalies to groundwater mixing between different aquifers driven by crustal dilation prior to seismic events tsunogai and wakita 1995 claesson et al 2004 doglioni et al 2014 skelton et al 2014 andrén et al 2016 in order to deepen understanding of the groundwater earthquake relationship related geochemical models have been also developed wästeby et al 2014 boschetti et al 2019 despite these scientific efforts the knowledge about hydrogeochemical behaviour related to the seismic cycle need more observations to carry out a statistical analysis aimed at identifying a common denominator in particular the three main questions that are searching for answers are when where and how the next earthquakes will occur to achieve this objective several study cases are necessary to build up appropriate geochemical models naturally associated with different geo tectonic contexts this goal can be reached only through the increase of observations that can help to provide useful constraints on models wang and manga 2021 towards this direction since 2014 a multiparametric monitoring network consisting of two monitoring sites i e

geochemical model additionally we tried to achieve these purposes even for small intermediate earthquake magnitudes mw 5 we reported new hydrogeochemical changes induced by the 2019 benevento seismic swarm main earthquake mw 3 9 recorded in the matese node i e grassano spring in detail we measured variations in ph co2 electrical conductivity and some major elements before and in conjunction with

extensional tectonics is still ongoing and it is currently strongly seismogenic along the axial region of the apennines whereas compressive kinematics is active in the adriatic front consistently with the regional stress field galli et al 2008 the main domain is represented by the meso cenozoic carbonate units formed by limestone dolomitic limestone and dolomitic series of carbonate platform facies the wide carbonate ridges of central southern apennines can store huge volumes of groundwater acting as the main aquifer systems their hydrogeological complexity is essentially defined by the high transmissivity due to fracturing and locally karstification generally groundwater is drained by large discharge springs with steady flow rate at the boundaries of the aquifers where carbonate rocks are in contact with low permeability deposits aquicludes or aquitards such as pre and syn orogenic basinal and flysch clayey series allocca et al 2014 in detail the wide karst area of the matese massif about 1500 km2 crops out in the median sector of the apennine chain with elevations up to 2050 m fiorillo and pagnozzi 2015 rufino et al 2021 the main lithological units are the late triassic miocene carbonate sequences i e limestones and dolostone which reach thickness ranging between 2500 and 3000 m and are heavily fractured and faulted fiorillo and guadagno 2010 silverii 2016 from a seismological point of view this area is considered one of the most active sectors of the apennines characterized by the presence of two main fault systems one within the core of the massif i e fault system of matese gallo letino lakes mglf and the aquae iuliae normal fault aif and a second one at its western side i e the ailano piedimonte matese normal faults aipmf boncio et al 2016 the basal groundwater flowpath of the matese aquifer is constrained by tectonic discontinuities as well as geometric relationships between stratigraphical units celico and petrella 2008 fiorillo et al 2019 rufino et al 2021 along the northern and eastern sectors the matese massif is tectonically joined by a thrust fault to low permeability argillaceous complexes and flysch sequences petrella and celico 2009 instead along the southern and western sectors it is bounded by normal faults and covered by recent quaternary deposits of the volturno river plain the matese massif is characterized by many endorheic areas located at high elevations whose formation is associated with the upper pliocene pleistocene tectonic activity these areas play a crucial role in recharge processes particularly the lago matese polje represents the main recharge zone of the aquifer occupying an area of 45 km2 between 1000 and 2050 m a s l fiorillo and pagnozzi 2015 grassano telese springs are fed by the eastern sector of the matese aquifer which is hydraulically connected by buried karst terrains and outcropping karst reliefs as mt monaco mt acero and montepugliano fig 1 montepugliano relief is the discharge zone of a wide portion of the matese aquifer where a deep and wide groundwater circulation locally converge providing a general upwelling flow driven by conduits and fracture networks fiorillo et al 2019 indeed among the three main spring groups grassano telese springs located at the southern slope of montepugliano relief represent the main discharge zone of the aquifer and the lowest elevation outflows 54 m a s l leone et al 2019 these springs are characterized by both cold calcium bicarbonate waters grassano spring and hypothermal sulphurous and co2 rich ones telese spring corniello and de riso 1986 fiorillo et al 2019 grassano spring consists of different outlets with a mean annual discharge of 4 5 m3 s while the average discharge of telese spring is about 1 m3 s corniello et al 2021 besides the isotopic signature of these springs reveals the same catchment area therefore mineralization occurs in the final part of the groundwater flowpath where uprising of deep gases co2 and h2s occurs along the faults of montepugliano relief corniello et al 2021 3 material and methods in this study we analysed hydrogeochemical gas geochemical isotopic and seismic data in order to investigate earthquake induced effects on groundwater between february 2018 to september 2020 we performed twenty sampling campaigns at grassano spring lat 41 225040 long 14 514426 altitude 54 m to look into groundwater hydrogeochemistry additionally we carried out sampling at telese spring lat 41 223350 long 14 525977 altitude 57 m and specifically in june 2020 we executed a sampling survey addressed to collect data useful for the calculation of the groundwater carbon mass balance e g major ions chemical physical parameter and isotope composition of co2 in detail chemical physical parameters were measured on site through the multiparametric probe wtw multi 3420 temperature resolution 0 1 c ph resolution 0 001 and electrical conductivity ec standard analytical methods were applied to characterize the chemical composition bridgewater et al 2017 for the determination of major anions and cations elements groundwater samples filtered in situ through a 0 45 μm filter were collected into polyethylene bottles firstly they were kept at low temperature in ice filled fridge boxes to avoid alterations of water components and then they were analyzed by ion chromatography at the geochemistry laboratory of the department of earth sciences at sapienza university of rome specifically chromatographs dionex ics 5000 and dionex ics 1100 were used to determine the anionic content f cl so4 2 and no3 and the cationic one ca2 mg2 na and k respectively as testified by the cation anion balance checked on each sample the analytical error associated with these instruments was less than 5 alkalinity was measured on site by titration with 0 05 n hcl solution and methyl orange as indicator data of major ions since february 13th 2018 to january 8th 2020 were also published in franchini et al 2021 we performed continuous monitoring by installing two multiparametric probes hl4 and mini co2 the hydrolab hl4 multiparameter probe measured continuously and simultaneously temperature ph and electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen the device was equipped with integrated data recording capability measurements of parameters were automatically repeated and stored every 15 min since july 19th 2018 to october 29th 2020 the mini co2 submersible sensor produced by pro oceanus systems inc was installed on may 24th 2019 for the continuous monitoring of dissolved co2 concentrations the gas was stripped from the water through a gas permeable membrane and subsequently sent to the non dispersive infrared detector ndir with pco2 ranges from 0 to 10 the instrument provided the versatility needed by allowing the continuous acquisition of carbon dioxide concentrations and repeating measurements every 15 min unfortunately the firmware of the probe was damaged by a power surge on december 10th 2019 therefore the sensor stopped acquiring data moreover recorded data can be monitored and downloaded in real time by an online system of data acquisition developed by digimatic s r l https webvision digimatic it furthermore thermodynamic calculations were carried out by using phreeqc interactive software for windows version 3 precisely the prheeqc dat thermodynamic dataset parkhurst and appelo 2013 sample water conditions of t ph major ions and alkalinity were used as input data to calculate the molality concentrations of the water content in detail the total molality of ca mg so4 and tdic mol kg h2o was used for the calculation of ccarb and cext parameters in the following carbon mass balances chiodini et al 2000 tdic ccarb cext 1 ccarb ca mg so4 2 cext ctdic ccarb cinf cdeep 3 tdic includes the total dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwater whose origin is ascribable to the presence of different sources of carbon hence it corresponds to the sum of these components see eq 1 ccarb is the carbon derived from the water rock interaction of groundwater with carbonate aquifers thus the eq 2 considers the dissolution of calcite and dolomite and also the presence of anhydrite and or gypsum cext is the carbon derived from external sources indeed it is expressed by the sum of two parameters see eq 3 where cinf is the carbon from atmospheric and biogenic co2 i e the infiltrating waters and cdeep is deep co2 from metamorphic mantle or magma sources chiodini et al 2000 chiodini et al 2004 the δ13c isotope composition of deep co2 of grassano spring was from barbieri et al 2020 while the one of telese spring was obtained in this study in detail it was analysed by using a thermo scientific delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer the δ13c co2 value is in terms of δ units expressed as v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite international standard with analytical error of 0 15 analytical devices were provided by the national institute of geophysics and volcanology ingv palermo italy finally we selected all earthquakes 370 that occurred in the same period of the hydrogeochemical monitoring within a radial distance of 30 km from telese terme lat 41 216729 long 14 526261 this area was selected according to the strain radius epicentral distance relationship proposed by dobrovolsky et al 1979 seismic data come from the database run by national seismic network available on the website http terremoti ingv it the amount of energy released e was estimated from the earthquake magnitude mw through the magnitude energy relationship see eq 4 gutenberg 1956 log e 1 5 m w 11 8 4 results and discussion collected data at grassano spring refer both to continuous and discrete sampling and are represented by chemical physical parameters major ions and dissolved co2 we also considered seismic data all discrete measurements are reported in the table s1 in this section we present and discuss only the data that we considered relevant with respect to the aim of this work table 1 displays the maximum average and minimum values of all main parameters recorded during 2018 2020 monitoring the hydrogeochemical facies of grassano spring is shown in the piper diagram fig 2 a by clear calcium bicarbonate facies with minimal variations during the study period to better understand the geochemical features of the analysed groundwater we considered data published in a previous study di luccio et al 2018 grassano groundwater are located between two end members represented by the shallow system and the hydrothermal one depicted as the blue ellipse and the red one respectively in fig 2b this observation agrees with the results of a recent research corniello et al 2021 which points out the mixing between shallow regional flowpath coming from matese carbonate aquifer fig 1 and the deep mineralized and gas rich groundwater upwelling along faults e g telese spring fig 1 fig 3 shows parameters having a potential correlation with seismic activity in detail we displayed the whole time series both discrete and continuous of co2 ph electrical conductivity and calcium ca2 sodium na and alkalinity hco3 concentrations other measured parameters i e temperature and ions did not show any potential evidence of relationship with seismicity and for this reason based on the main purpose of this work they are not discussed but they are reported in the table s1 stream discharge of the spring was not recorded in this study fig 3b displays co2 time series recorded from may 24th 2019 to december 10th 2019 which was characterized by several lacks of data due to electrical interruption besides it is noteworthy that such time series is shorter than other continuous data because the probe was installed in may 2019 and it turned off in december 2019 owing to sensor damage the average value was 6 4 in the first period since june to september 2019 the co2 values recorded a general increase from 6 0 to 6 8 later the trend was approximately steady around 6 7 evident co2 spikes are clearly discernible and are attributable to instrumental noises fig 3c includes continuous ph time series recorded from july 19th 2018 to october 29th 2020 with missing data from march 2020 to june 2020 in addition discrete ph measurements recorded during our campaign surveys were reported with circles during five surveys we had some problems with ph sensor of the portable wtw multi 3420 probe therefore for these cases we recalculated ph value through the arithmetic mean of daily continuous values provided by the hl4 probe direct and recalculated data were displayed with cyan and green circles respectively fig 3c both continuous and discrete average values were about equal to 7 0 the time series were quite steady within a minimum value of 6 8 and a maximum one of 7 3 during the monitoring period despite this limited range of variation 0 5 a notable decrease was recorded since august 2018 to october 2018 about 0 25 followed by 2 months of instrumental noises owing to some problems of the setting station on field since june 7th 2019 to september 10th 2019 the series was firstly characterized by a sharp decrease equal to 0 3 and a subsequent clear increase of 0 2 fig 3d contains the electrical conductivity time series both discrete and continuous with the same interval and inconsistences of ph series e g setting of the station and data lack again recorded spikes in the signal were attributable to instrumental noises continuous and discrete average values were 905 µs cm and 901 µs cm respectively the time series values were quite steady around the mean however a visible increase of about 45 µs cm was detected since november 20th 2019 to january 9th 2020 finally time series of ca2 na and hco3 consisting of the surveys performed between february 2018 and september 2020 are plotted in fig 3e 3f and 3 g the average values of the analysed major ions mg l were 174 5 16 6 and 658 respectively table 1 statistical distribution of ions concentrations was analysed through box and whiskers plots fig 4 the box separated into two parts by the median represents the interquartile range first and third quartiles the whiskers are limited by the interquartile range iqr with a factor equal to 1 5 this analysis revealed that all three ions were characterized by anomalous values dots in fig 4 of concentrations ppm with respect to the whole distribution recorded in the three years monitoring since outliers exceed the whiskers only in the surveys performed on november 19th 2019 and on january 8th 2020 they and associated changes in electrical conductivity ph values and dissolved co2 did not represent seasonal and or natural hydrogeochemical variations during the monitoring period three main seismic sequences see location in fig 1 and time series in fig 3a were clearly recognized among the typical background seismicity that characterized this sector of the apennines milano et al 2006 the first one was represented by 72 seismic events occurred since august 31st 2018 to september 16th 2018 about 15 km far from grassano spring the maximum earthquake had mw 2 8 the second and the third seismic sequences occurred in the same area about 25 km far from the monitoring site near san leucio del sannio village the first of these two sequences started on november 21st 2019 and ended on december 17th 2019 it included 87 seismic events and the maximum earthquake magnitude was equal to 3 9 recorded on december 16th 2019 the same area was struck by a second and smaller swarm in march 2020 composed by 54 seismic events maximum earthquake magnitude mw 2 6 the calculation of the cumulated energy shown with the green line in fig 3a highlighted the strongest energy release in conjunction with the second seismic swarm fig 5 displays the time chart with the temporal sequence of significant detected variations changes in ph electrical conductivity and major ions concentrations are supposed to be related to the previously observed co2 increase in the aquifer system to sum up the co2 increase would induce a sudden ph decrease that was followed by a mild increase in conjunction with the ph recovery to the previous values e g values of may 2019 it was recorded an electrical conductivity increase coupled with anomalous high values of ca2 na and hco3 concentrations exactly two days before the onset of the seismic sequence and about one month before the main seismic event i e the mw 3 9 san leucio del sannio earthquake occurred on december 16th 2019 however discrete sampling did not allow to recognise exactly the moment in which concentrations of these ions started to increase anyway this process was attributed to the reaction of the hosting aquifer system the so called buffering effect langmuir 1997 drever 2005 in order to re equilibrate the original chemical conditions after being hit by a co2 increase the aquifer system naturally reacts through the following equations eq 5 6 co2 aq h2o aq h2co3 h hco3 induce ph decreasing 5 dissolved hco3 groundwater h released h2co3 aq ph buffer 6 in detail the addition of co2 to karst fractured carbonate aquifer dissolved both the carbonate fraction ca2 and hco3 and weathered the silica one of the reservoir rocks minissale 2004 clark 2015 due to the buffering effect of the carbonate bicarbonate co3 2 hco3 pair the ph stabilizes when co2 is dissolved or exsolved amonte et al 2021 indeed an ion exchange process could have involved the na ions adsorbed onto clay minerals in fact cations have different tendencies to be adsorbed or desorbed their tendency for adsorption in natural waters is as follows strongly adsorbed ca2 mg2 k na weakly adsorbed which means that sodium ions are much more likely to be desorbed from surfaces and then to be ejected and transferred into groundwater rajmohan and elango 2004 manahan 2017 chen et al 2021 alternatively such increase in na concentrations could be just explained as deep fluid upwelling in fact high sodium concentration is certain feature of deeply originated fluids in deep reservoir in crust similar geochemical changes in groundwater were also recognized in other studies bourg and loch 1995 malakootian and nouri 2010 barberio et al 2017 paudel et al 2018 for instance the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence which occurred about 80 km far from the studied monitoring site caused the co2 inflow in the shallow regional aquifer and consequently the ph variation with consequent trace element mobilization i e as v cr fe barberio et al 2017 in addition the geochemical modelling conducted by boschetti et al 2019 confirmed that the variation in the co2 fugacity can change the adsorption desorption process of some elements in the rock aquifer in the present study we suppose that a similar geochemical process could be inferred at grassano spring indeed grassano spring is characterized by the presence of high dissolved co2 concentration whose source is attributable to crustal deep degassing di luccio et al 2018 hence following previous studies frondini et al 2019 barbieri et al 2020 a calculation of the carbon mass balance has been carried out to define the cext component useful to quantify and distinguish the carbon related to the deep source from the biogenic cinf and carbonate ccarb ones fig 6 a shows the cext value versus the δ13cext isotopic composition of grassano spring yellow circle resulting between infiltrating waters blue ellipse and the co2 rich springs red rectangle of the matese aquifer however it is clear that the grassano groundwater is closer to the deep end member which corresponds to our sampling of telese spring performed in june 2020 red circle moreover this evidence suggests the mixing between co2 rich deep groundwater such as telese spring and grassano spring that could be enhanced by dilatative preparatory phases of earthquakes typical of the extensional setting sibson 2000 doglioni et al 2014 indeed the δ13cext isotopic ratio of grassano spring is heavier compared to that of other carbonate springs of the matese aquifer data taken from di luccio et al 2018 showing an endogenous signature barbieri et al 2020 the contribution of deep co2 confirms the influence and the mixing with a deep circulation system widely hidden by the large contribution to the discharge of the shallow carbonate circulation system the calculation of the carbon mass balance of groundwater samples allows to obtain the cext time series shown in fig 6b in detail we recorded a progressive increase of cext through the entire 2019 year that reached the maximum value at the end of the seismic sequence precisely in the survey performed in january 2020 the cext values of the last three surveys were among the minima measurements of the monitoring period also ph continuous electrical conductivity major ions concentration recovered their preseismic values consistently with our interpretation of geochemical processes we speculate that the increase of cext value during 2019 was due to deep pre seismic geological processes i e variation in dilation that allowed the upwelling of the deep co2 flux along tectonic discontinuities through this multiparametric approach it is possible to provide a description of a complex geochemical process that potentially induced the hydrogeochemical changes in ca2 na and hco3 just a few days before the onset of the seismic sequence apart from furnishing a potential hydrogeochemical model it is also necessary to take a step forward to identify possible geo structural mechanism that could induce the recorded geochemical responses it is noteworthy that fluids have an active role in decreasing fault strength thereby they can influence fault mechanics and the cyclic activation fluids can also act passively e g tullis et al 1996 wannamaker et al 2002 doglioni et al 2014 being squeezed by pressure gradients and transported depending on rock permeability salazar et a 2002 their migration whatever the origin is e g meteoric crustal or mantle derived is influenced by variation in the state of the stress for example as consequence of dilatancy and fluid diffusion mechanism fluids are rapidly redistributed in the crust sibson et al 1975 besides also fluid discharges of opposite sign i e negative and positive during the coseismic phase have been documented along thrust and normal faults respectively muir wood and king 1993 also changes in hydrogeochemical content of groundwater may be expected because earthquake induced groundwater flow is effective in transporting solutes and seismic events may open new passageways to connect fluids from different reservoirs and thus facilitating such exchange wang and manga 2021 most variations in geochemical composition are consistent with the model of earthquake enhanced groundwater transport through basin wide or local enhanced permeability wang et al 2013 wang and manga 2021 it may breach hydrologic barriers e g aquitards connecting otherwise isolated aquifers or other fluid sources and then causing fluid source switching and or mixing wang and manga 2021 studies of these processes can represent another step to improve the comprehension both about natural transport processes and earthquake induced hydrogeochemical responses despite data concerning hydrogeochemical changes are less abundant than those regarding changes in groundwater level and discharge through the years they allowed to get useful information to constrain models of hydrogeological processes induced by seismicity wang and manga 2021 according to a recent global analysis tamburello et al 2018 there is a positive spatial correlation between co2 degassing and extensional tectonic regimes that would play a key role in creating pathways for the uprising deep fluids and connecting the deep portion of crust to the earth surface thus normal faults strike slip faults and areas with high structural damage represent the most suitable scenario for co2 uprising lamberti et al 2019 a widely accepted geo structural model is based on the concept of stick slip fault behaviour in the upper crust and on the presence of a stable sliding fault in the middle lower crust doglioni et al 2015 petricca et al 2015 the development of fault zone fracturing together with hanging wall dilation and initial collapse in the preseismic phase produce high fluid pressure e g co2 and consequently migration of fluids from the high pressure zone to the low pressure one doglioni et al 2014 during the 2019 benevento seismic swarm the seismicity delineated the existence of a subvertical wnw ese striking fault plane between 7 and 18 km depth the estimated focal mechanism highlighted a right lateral strike slip kinematics of the fault structure which accommodates differential extensional deformation and represents a potential source of mw 5 damaging earthquakes ciaccio et al 2021 in this context presumably in the preseismic preparatory phase the deep fluids uprising in shallow regional aquifers could be enhanced due to the generation of high pore pressure along fault plane and fractures cardello and mancktelow 2015 barberio et al 2021 findings like those reported in our work are relevant because they confirmed in similar geological and tectonic setting a common geochemical process able to cause the same pattern of hydrogeochemical anomalies in fact we argue that the recorded geochemical responses were induced by a similar geochemical process that caused the anomalies prior to the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence main earthquake mw 6 5 chiaraluce et al 2017 the proposed tectonic model reconstructed for the two different study areas is the same too implications derived from our study can be applied to cases in other countries and in other geological contexts for example variations in groundwater hydrogeochemical content were also observed before and during volcanic activity in iceland and in tenerife island as consequence of pulses of fluid injection from volcanic and or hydrothermal system barbieri et al 2021 amonte et al 2021 5 conclusion in this study hydrogeochemical monitoring both discrete and continuous of chemical physical parameters major ions and dissolved co2 was performed in grassano spring central southern italy with the aim of identifying in groundwater potential precursors of nearby earthquakes we conclude that anomalous concentrations of ca2 na and hco3 were recorded in one sample before and in another one after the 2019 benevento seismic sequence main earthquake on december 16th 2019 mw 3 9 san leucio del sannio changes in groundwater chemical content are attributable to the progressive increase of deep co2 in the aquifer system which temporarily lowered ph and enhanced the solubility of the above mentioned major ions the deep pre seismic dilatational processes are supposed to be responsible for enhancing the influx and ascent of co2 in the regional carbonate aquifer in fact the increase of co2 in the studied aquifer and spring started before the related seismic sequence the geochemical process that occurred in grassano groundwater prior to the seismic sequence was similar to that defined for the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence despite the seismicity during our monitoring period was characterized by small intermediate magnitude the obtained results shed light on the possibility of having pre seismic hydrogeochemical signals in springs and groundwater also for small intermediate earthquake magnitude at least in the areas where deep fluids contribution to groundwater is evident this study highlights also the crucial role of the multiparametric approach to expand the knowledge about the relationship between the geochemical process in groundwater and seismic activity however also other parameters as for example discharge rates as well as the groundwater level are needed to clarify some hydrogeological aspects the setup of a standardized and diffuse monitoring network of groundwater like that of this study would produce significant and useful information towards the solving of the three main questions when where and how the release of seismic energy will occur credit authorship contribution statement

3846,insights into seismic precursors have been obtained in the last decades however a detailed understanding of hydrogeochemical anomalies prior to earthquakes still remains the aim of many research teams worldwide in order to investigate the earthquake groundwater relationship between 2018 and 2020 we performed sampling surveys coupled with continuous multiparametric monitoring in grassano spring fed by the matese aquifer central southern apennines italy hydrogeochemical changes were observed before the onset and during the 2019 benevento seismic sequence including dissolved co2 increase ph lowering and anomalies in major ions i e ca2 na hco3 that later recovered to their typical concentrations we suggest that variations in groundwater geochemistry were induced by dilatative preparatory phases of earthquakes typical of the extensional setting this condition allowed the deep co2 upwelling along tectonic discontinuities as testified by the cext carbon from external sources behaviour detected in grassano groundwater during the 2019 year despite the small intermediate magnitude of the mainshock results highlight and confirm the occurrence of a potential pre seismic geochemical process in the fractured carbonate aquifers similar to the one proposed in literature for the stronger 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence keywords hydrogeochemistry earthquakes hydrosensitivity carbon dioxide groundwater mixing deep fluids 1 introduction detecting earthquake precursors is one of the most compelling challenges in earth sciences groundwater changes induced by seismic activity have been widely documented all over the world wakita 1975 muir wood and king 1993 elkhoury et al 2006 manga and wang 2015 many studies shed light on the variation of crustal fluids behaviour after the occurrence of seismic events however in the last decades attempts to identify preseismic anomalies have been carried out too wakita et al 1980 igarashi et al 1995 salazar et al 2002 ingebritsen and manga 2014 chen et al 2015 in detail changes in spring discharge petitta et al 2018 mastrorillo et al 2020 groundwater level kim et al 2019 hwang et al 2020 lan et al 2021 geochemical content kim et al 2020 nakagawa et al 2020 isotope composition skelton et al 2014 onda et al 2018 hosono et al 2020 dissolved and free gases pérez et al 2006 sano et al 2016 kawabata et al 2020 have been recognized several study cases are from china japan italy iceland and korea where the set up of hydrogeochemical networks has been already established or is currently in progress shi et al 2013 orihara et al 2014 andrén et al 2016 barberio et al 2017 de luca et al 2018 skelton et al 2019 li et al 2019 hosono and masaki 2020 martinelli et al 2021 barbieri et al 2021 lee et al 2021 most of the interpretations agree in attributing hydrogeochemical anomalies to groundwater mixing between different aquifers driven by crustal dilation prior to seismic events tsunogai and wakita 1995 claesson et al 2004 doglioni et al 2014 skelton et al 2014 andrén et al 2016 in order to deepen understanding of the groundwater earthquake relationship related geochemical models have been also developed wästeby et al 2014 boschetti et al 2019 despite these scientific efforts the knowledge about hydrogeochemical behaviour related to the seismic cycle need more observations to carry out a statistical analysis aimed at identifying a common denominator in particular the three main questions that are searching for answers are when where and how the next earthquakes will occur to achieve this objective several study cases are necessary to build up appropriate geochemical models naturally associated with different geo tectonic contexts this goal can be reached only through the increase of observations that can help to provide useful constraints on models wang and manga 2021 towards this direction since 2014 a multiparametric monitoring network consisting of two monitoring sites i e sulmona and matese areas has been developed in central italy by our research group with the main aim of identifying preseismic signals in groundwater barberio et al 2017 boschetti et al 2019 barbieri et al 2020 barberio et al 2020 franchini et al 2021 coppola et al 2021 this study had two main objectives identifying hydrogeochemical changes related to seismicity and putting them in a conceptual geochemical model additionally we tried to achieve these purposes even for small intermediate earthquake magnitudes mw 5 we reported new hydrogeochemical changes induced by the 2019 benevento seismic swarm main earthquake mw 3 9 recorded in the matese node i e grassano spring in detail we measured variations in ph co2 electrical conductivity and some major elements before and in conjunction with the onset of the seismic swarm the temporal sequence of hydrogeochemical recorded changes allows us to recognize the potential geochemical mechanism that triggered anomalies as discussed about the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence main earthquake mw 6 5 boschetti et al 2019 this relationship is surprising and constitutes a novelty since most of the research on this topic detected geochemical changes only for mainshock stronger than 5 inan et al 2012 skelton et al 2014 we are confident that findings can help geoscientist to better understand the hydrogeochemical responses of shallow aquifer system to deep fluid injection in different geological context e g both seismic and volcanic areas amonte et al 2021 barbieri et al 2021 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the central southern apennines fold and thrust belt developed during neogene and quaternary times doglioni et al 1996 the orogenesis is related to the w dipping subduction of the apulian lithosphere whose slab retreat caused the progressive eastward migration of the foreland flexure thrust fronts and of the extensional back arc tectonics doglioni 1991 cardello et al 2021 the chain is characterized by ne verging thrust faults which dissected the tectonic edifice into several thick tectonic sheets since the late miocene the post orogenic crustal extension has affected the apennines from west to east forming half graben intramountain basins controlled by high angle w dipping normal faults and mostly filled by pliocene quaternary continental deposits cavinato and celles 1999 at present times the extensional tectonics is still ongoing and it is currently strongly seismogenic along the axial region of the apennines whereas compressive kinematics is active in the adriatic front consistently with the regional stress field galli et al 2008 the main domain is represented by the meso cenozoic carbonate units formed by limestone dolomitic limestone and dolomitic series of carbonate platform facies the wide carbonate ridges of central southern apennines can store huge volumes of groundwater acting as the main aquifer systems their hydrogeological complexity is essentially defined by the high transmissivity due to fracturing and locally karstification generally groundwater is drained by large discharge springs with steady flow rate at the boundaries of the aquifers where carbonate rocks are in contact with low permeability deposits aquicludes or aquitards such as pre and syn orogenic basinal and flysch clayey series allocca et al 2014 in detail the wide karst area of the matese massif about 1500 km2 crops out in the median sector of the apennine chain with elevations up to 2050 m fiorillo and pagnozzi 2015 rufino et al 2021 the main lithological units are the late triassic miocene carbonate sequences i e limestones and dolostone which reach thickness ranging between 2500 and 3000 m and are heavily fractured and faulted fiorillo and guadagno 2010 silverii 2016 from a seismological point of view this area is considered one of the most active sectors of the apennines characterized by the presence of two main fault systems one within the core of the massif i e fault system of matese gallo letino lakes mglf and the aquae iuliae normal fault aif and a second one at its western side i e the ailano piedimonte matese normal faults aipmf boncio et al 2016 the basal groundwater flowpath of the matese aquifer is constrained by tectonic discontinuities as well as geometric relationships between stratigraphical units celico and petrella 2008 fiorillo et al 2019 rufino et al 2021 along the northern and eastern sectors the matese massif is tectonically joined by a thrust fault to low permeability argillaceous complexes and flysch sequences petrella and celico 2009 instead along the southern and western sectors it is bounded by normal faults and covered by recent quaternary deposits of the volturno river plain the matese massif is characterized by many endorheic areas located at high elevations whose formation is associated with the upper pliocene pleistocene tectonic activity these areas play a crucial role in recharge processes particularly the lago matese polje represents the main recharge zone of the aquifer occupying an area of 45 km2 between 1000 and 2050 m a s l fiorillo and pagnozzi 2015 grassano telese springs are fed by the eastern sector of the matese aquifer which is hydraulically connected by buried karst terrains and outcropping karst reliefs as mt monaco mt acero and montepugliano fig 1 montepugliano relief is the discharge zone of a wide portion of the matese aquifer where a deep and wide groundwater circulation locally converge providing a general upwelling flow driven by conduits and fracture networks fiorillo et al 2019 indeed among the three main spring groups grassano telese springs located at the southern slope of montepugliano relief represent the main discharge zone of the aquifer and the lowest elevation outflows 54 m a s l leone et al 2019 these springs are characterized by both cold calcium bicarbonate waters grassano spring and hypothermal sulphurous and co2 rich ones telese spring corniello and de riso 1986 fiorillo et al 2019 grassano spring consists of different outlets with a mean annual discharge of 4 5 m3 s while the average discharge of telese spring is about 1 m3 s corniello et al 2021 besides the isotopic signature of these springs reveals the same catchment area therefore mineralization occurs in the final part of the groundwater flowpath where uprising of deep gases co2 and h2s occurs along the faults of montepugliano relief corniello et al 2021 3 material and methods in this study we analysed hydrogeochemical gas geochemical isotopic and seismic data in order to investigate earthquake induced effects on groundwater between february 2018 to september 2020 we performed twenty sampling campaigns at grassano spring lat 41 225040 long 14 514426 altitude 54 m to look into groundwater hydrogeochemistry additionally we carried out sampling at telese spring lat 41 223350 long 14 525977 altitude 57 m and specifically in june 2020 we executed a sampling survey addressed to collect data useful for the calculation of the groundwater carbon mass balance e g major ions chemical physical parameter and isotope composition of co2 in detail chemical physical parameters were measured on site through the multiparametric probe wtw multi 3420 temperature resolution 0 1 c ph resolution 0 001 and electrical conductivity ec standard analytical methods were applied to characterize the chemical composition bridgewater et al 2017 for the determination of major anions and cations elements groundwater samples filtered in situ through a 0 45 μm filter were collected into polyethylene bottles firstly they were kept at low temperature in ice filled fridge boxes to avoid alterations of water components and then they were analyzed by ion chromatography at the geochemistry laboratory of the department of earth sciences at sapienza university of rome specifically chromatographs dionex ics 5000 and dionex ics 1100 were used to determine the anionic content f cl so4 2 and no3 and the cationic one ca2 mg2 na and k respectively as testified by the cation anion balance checked on each sample the analytical error associated with these instruments was less than 5 alkalinity was measured on site by titration with 0 05 n hcl solution and methyl orange as indicator data of major ions since february 13th 2018 to january 8th 2020 were also published in franchini et al 2021 we performed continuous monitoring by installing two multiparametric probes hl4 and mini co2 the hydrolab hl4 multiparameter probe measured continuously and simultaneously temperature ph and electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen the device was equipped with integrated data recording capability measurements of parameters were automatically repeated and stored every 15 min since july 19th 2018 to october 29th 2020 the mini co2 submersible sensor produced by pro oceanus systems inc was installed on may 24th 2019 for the continuous monitoring of dissolved co2 concentrations the gas was stripped from the water through a gas permeable membrane and subsequently sent to the non dispersive infrared detector ndir with pco2 ranges from 0 to 10 the instrument provided the versatility needed by allowing the continuous acquisition of carbon dioxide concentrations and repeating measurements every 15 min unfortunately the firmware of the probe was damaged by a power surge on december 10th 2019 therefore the sensor stopped acquiring data moreover recorded data can be monitored and downloaded in real time by an online system of data acquisition developed by digimatic s r l https webvision digimatic it furthermore thermodynamic calculations were carried out by using phreeqc interactive software for windows version 3 precisely the prheeqc dat thermodynamic dataset parkhurst and appelo 2013 sample water conditions of t ph major ions and alkalinity were used as input data to calculate the molality concentrations of the water content in detail the total molality of ca mg so4 and tdic mol kg h2o was used for the calculation of ccarb and cext parameters in the following carbon mass balances chiodini et al 2000 tdic ccarb cext 1 ccarb ca mg so4 2 cext ctdic ccarb cinf cdeep 3 tdic includes the total dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwater whose origin is ascribable to the presence of different sources of carbon hence it corresponds to the sum of these components see eq 1 ccarb is the carbon derived from the water rock interaction of groundwater with carbonate aquifers thus the eq 2 considers the dissolution of calcite and dolomite and also the presence of anhydrite and or gypsum cext is the carbon derived from external sources indeed it is expressed by the sum of two parameters see eq 3 where cinf is the carbon from atmospheric and biogenic co2 i e the infiltrating waters and cdeep is deep co2 from metamorphic mantle or magma sources chiodini et al 2000 chiodini et al 2004 the δ13c isotope composition of deep co2 of grassano spring was from barbieri et al 2020 while the one of telese spring was obtained in this study in detail it was analysed by using a thermo scientific delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer the δ13c co2 value is in terms of δ units expressed as v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite international standard with analytical error of 0 15 analytical devices were provided by the national institute of geophysics and volcanology ingv palermo italy finally we selected all earthquakes 370 that occurred in the same period of the hydrogeochemical monitoring within a radial distance of 30 km from telese terme lat 41 216729 long 14 526261 this area was selected according to the strain radius epicentral distance relationship proposed by dobrovolsky et al 1979 seismic data come from the database run by national seismic network available on the website http terremoti ingv it the amount of energy released e was estimated from the earthquake magnitude mw through the magnitude energy relationship see eq 4 gutenberg 1956 log e 1 5 m w 11 8 4 results and discussion collected data at grassano spring refer both to continuous and discrete sampling and are represented by chemical physical parameters major ions and dissolved co2 we also considered seismic data all discrete measurements are reported in the table s1 in this section we present and discuss only the data that we considered relevant with respect to the aim of this work table 1 displays the maximum average and minimum values of all main parameters recorded during 2018 2020 monitoring the hydrogeochemical facies of grassano spring is shown in the piper diagram fig 2 a by clear calcium bicarbonate facies with minimal variations during the study period to better understand the geochemical features of the analysed groundwater we considered data published in a previous study di luccio et al 2018 grassano groundwater are located between two end members represented by the shallow system and the hydrothermal one depicted as the blue ellipse and the red one respectively in fig 2b this observation agrees with the results of a recent research corniello et al 2021 which points out the mixing between shallow regional flowpath coming from matese carbonate aquifer fig 1 and the deep mineralized and gas rich groundwater upwelling along faults e g telese spring fig 1 fig 3 shows parameters having a potential correlation with seismic activity in detail we displayed the whole time series both discrete and continuous of co2 ph electrical conductivity and calcium ca2 sodium na and alkalinity hco3 concentrations other measured parameters i e temperature and ions did not show any potential evidence of relationship with seismicity and for this reason based on the main purpose of this work they are not discussed but they are reported in the table s1 stream discharge of the spring was not recorded in this study fig 3b displays co2 time series recorded from may 24th 2019 to december 10th 2019 which was characterized by several lacks of data due to electrical interruption besides it is noteworthy that such time series is shorter than other continuous data because the probe was installed in may 2019 and it turned off in december 2019 owing to sensor damage the average value was 6 4 in the first period since june to september 2019 the co2 values recorded a general increase from 6 0 to 6 8 later the trend was approximately steady around 6 7 evident co2 spikes are clearly discernible and are attributable to instrumental noises fig 3c includes continuous ph time series recorded from july 19th 2018 to october 29th 2020 with missing data from march 2020 to june 2020 in addition discrete ph measurements recorded during our campaign surveys were reported with circles during five surveys we had some problems with ph sensor of the portable wtw multi 3420 probe therefore for these cases we recalculated ph value through the arithmetic mean of daily continuous values provided by the hl4 probe direct and recalculated data were displayed with cyan and green circles respectively fig 3c both continuous and discrete average values were about equal to 7 0 the time series were quite steady within a minimum value of 6 8 and a maximum one of 7 3 during the monitoring period despite this limited range of variation 0 5 a notable decrease was recorded since august 2018 to october 2018 about 0 25 followed by 2 months of instrumental noises owing to some problems of the setting station on field since june 7th 2019 to september 10th 2019 the series was firstly characterized by a sharp decrease equal to 0 3 and a subsequent clear increase of 0 2 fig 3d contains the electrical conductivity time series both discrete and continuous with the same interval and inconsistences of ph series e g setting of the station and data lack again recorded spikes in the signal were attributable to instrumental noises continuous and discrete average values were 905 µs cm and 901 µs cm respectively the time series values were quite steady around the mean however a visible increase of about 45 µs cm was detected since november 20th 2019 to january 9th 2020 finally time series of ca2 na and hco3 consisting of the surveys performed between february 2018 and september 2020 are plotted in fig 3e 3f and 3 g the average values of the analysed major ions mg l were 174 5 16 6 and 658 respectively table 1 statistical distribution of ions concentrations was analysed through box and whiskers plots fig 4 the box separated into two parts by the median represents the interquartile range first and third quartiles the whiskers are limited by the interquartile range iqr with a factor equal to 1 5 this analysis revealed that all three ions were characterized by anomalous values dots in fig 4 of concentrations ppm with respect to the whole distribution recorded in the three years monitoring since outliers exceed the whiskers only in the surveys performed on november 19th 2019 and on january 8th 2020 they and associated changes in electrical conductivity ph values and dissolved co2 did not represent seasonal and or natural hydrogeochemical variations during the monitoring period three main seismic sequences see location in fig 1 and time series in fig 3a were clearly recognized among the typical background seismicity that characterized this sector of the apennines milano et al 2006 the first one was represented by 72 seismic events occurred since august 31st 2018 to september 16th 2018 about 15 km far from grassano spring the maximum earthquake had mw 2 8 the second and the third seismic sequences occurred in the same area about 25 km far from the monitoring site near san leucio del sannio village the first of these two sequences started on november 21st 2019 and ended on december 17th 2019 it included 87 seismic events and the maximum earthquake magnitude was equal to 3 9 recorded on december 16th 2019 the same area was struck by a second and smaller swarm in march 2020 composed by 54 seismic events maximum earthquake magnitude mw 2 6 the calculation of the cumulated energy shown with the green line in fig 3a highlighted the strongest energy release in conjunction with the second seismic swarm fig 5 displays the time chart with the temporal sequence of significant detected variations changes in ph electrical conductivity and major ions concentrations are supposed to be related to the previously observed co2 increase in the aquifer system to sum up the co2 increase would induce a sudden ph decrease that was followed by a mild increase in conjunction with the ph recovery to the previous values e g values of may 2019 it was recorded an electrical conductivity increase coupled with anomalous high values of ca2 na and hco3 concentrations exactly two days before the onset of the seismic sequence and about one month before the main seismic event i e the mw 3 9 san leucio del sannio earthquake occurred on december 16th 2019 however discrete sampling did not allow to recognise exactly the moment in which concentrations of these ions started to increase anyway this process was attributed to the reaction of the hosting aquifer system the so called buffering effect langmuir 1997 drever 2005 in order to re equilibrate the original chemical conditions after being hit by a co2 increase the aquifer system naturally reacts through the following equations eq 5 6 co2 aq h2o aq h2co3 h hco3 induce ph decreasing 5 dissolved hco3 groundwater h released h2co3 aq ph buffer 6 in detail the addition of co2 to karst fractured carbonate aquifer dissolved both the carbonate fraction ca2 and hco3 and weathered the silica one of the reservoir rocks minissale 2004 clark 2015 due to the buffering effect of the carbonate bicarbonate co3 2 hco3 pair the ph stabilizes when co2 is dissolved or exsolved amonte et al 2021 indeed an ion exchange process could have involved the na ions adsorbed onto clay minerals in fact cations have different tendencies to be adsorbed or desorbed their tendency for adsorption in natural waters is as follows strongly adsorbed ca2 mg2 k na weakly adsorbed which means that sodium ions are much more likely to be desorbed from surfaces and then to be ejected and transferred into groundwater rajmohan and elango 2004 manahan 2017 chen et al 2021 alternatively such increase in na concentrations could be just explained as deep fluid upwelling in fact high sodium concentration is certain feature of deeply originated fluids in deep reservoir in crust similar geochemical changes in groundwater were also recognized in other studies bourg and loch 1995 malakootian and nouri 2010 barberio et al 2017 paudel et al 2018 for instance the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence which occurred about 80 km far from the studied monitoring site caused the co2 inflow in the shallow regional aquifer and consequently the ph variation with consequent trace element mobilization i e as v cr fe barberio et al 2017 in addition the geochemical modelling conducted by boschetti et al 2019 confirmed that the variation in the co2 fugacity can change the adsorption desorption process of some elements in the rock aquifer in the present study we suppose that a similar geochemical process could be inferred at grassano spring indeed grassano spring is characterized by the presence of high dissolved co2 concentration whose source is attributable to crustal deep degassing di luccio et al 2018 hence following previous studies frondini et al 2019 barbieri et al 2020 a calculation of the carbon mass balance has been carried out to define the cext component useful to quantify and distinguish the carbon related to the deep source from the biogenic cinf and carbonate ccarb ones fig 6 a shows the cext value versus the δ13cext isotopic composition of grassano spring yellow circle resulting between infiltrating waters blue ellipse and the co2 rich springs red rectangle of the matese aquifer however it is clear that the grassano groundwater is closer to the deep end member which corresponds to our sampling of telese spring performed in june 2020 red circle moreover this evidence suggests the mixing between co2 rich deep groundwater such as telese spring and grassano spring that could be enhanced by dilatative preparatory phases of earthquakes typical of the extensional setting sibson 2000 doglioni et al 2014 indeed the δ13cext isotopic ratio of grassano spring is heavier compared to that of other carbonate springs of the matese aquifer data taken from di luccio et al 2018 showing an endogenous signature barbieri et al 2020 the contribution of deep co2 confirms the influence and the mixing with a deep circulation system widely hidden by the large contribution to the discharge of the shallow carbonate circulation system the calculation of the carbon mass balance of groundwater samples allows to obtain the cext time series shown in fig 6b in detail we recorded a progressive increase of cext through the entire 2019 year that reached the maximum value at the end of the seismic sequence precisely in the survey performed in january 2020 the cext values of the last three surveys were among the minima measurements of the monitoring period also ph continuous electrical conductivity major ions concentration recovered their preseismic values consistently with our interpretation of geochemical processes we speculate that the increase of cext value during 2019 was due to deep pre seismic geological processes i e variation in dilation that allowed the upwelling of the deep co2 flux along tectonic discontinuities through this multiparametric approach it is possible to provide a description of a complex geochemical process that potentially induced the hydrogeochemical changes in ca2 na and hco3 just a few days before the onset of the seismic sequence apart from furnishing a potential hydrogeochemical model it is also necessary to take a step forward to identify possible geo structural mechanism that could induce the recorded geochemical responses it is noteworthy that fluids have an active role in decreasing fault strength thereby they can influence fault mechanics and the cyclic activation fluids can also act passively e g tullis et al 1996 wannamaker et al 2002 doglioni et al 2014 being squeezed by pressure gradients and transported depending on rock permeability salazar et a 2002 their migration whatever the origin is e g meteoric crustal or mantle derived is influenced by variation in the state of the stress for example as consequence of dilatancy and fluid diffusion mechanism fluids are rapidly redistributed in the crust sibson et al 1975 besides also fluid discharges of opposite sign i e negative and positive during the coseismic phase have been documented along thrust and normal faults respectively muir wood and king 1993 also changes in hydrogeochemical content of groundwater may be expected because earthquake induced groundwater flow is effective in transporting solutes and seismic events may open new passageways to connect fluids from different reservoirs and thus facilitating such exchange wang and manga 2021 most variations in geochemical composition are consistent with the model of earthquake enhanced groundwater transport through basin wide or local enhanced permeability wang et al 2013 wang and manga 2021 it may breach hydrologic barriers e g aquitards connecting otherwise isolated aquifers or other fluid sources and then causing fluid source switching and or mixing wang and manga 2021 studies of these processes can represent another step to improve the comprehension both about natural transport processes and earthquake induced hydrogeochemical responses despite data concerning hydrogeochemical changes are less abundant than those regarding changes in groundwater level and discharge through the years they allowed to get useful information to constrain models of hydrogeological processes induced by seismicity wang and manga 2021 according to a recent global analysis tamburello et al 2018 there is a positive spatial correlation between co2 degassing and extensional tectonic regimes that would play a key role in creating pathways for the uprising deep fluids and connecting the deep portion of crust to the earth surface thus normal faults strike slip faults and areas with high structural damage represent the most suitable scenario for co2 uprising lamberti et al 2019 a widely accepted geo structural model is based on the concept of stick slip fault behaviour in the upper crust and on the presence of a stable sliding fault in the middle lower crust doglioni et al 2015 petricca et al 2015 the development of fault zone fracturing together with hanging wall dilation and initial collapse in the preseismic phase produce high fluid pressure e g co2 and consequently migration of fluids from the high pressure zone to the low pressure one doglioni et al 2014 during the 2019 benevento seismic swarm the seismicity delineated the existence of a subvertical wnw ese striking fault plane between 7 and 18 km depth the estimated focal mechanism highlighted a right lateral strike slip kinematics of the fault structure which accommodates differential extensional deformation and represents a potential source of mw 5 damaging earthquakes ciaccio et al 2021 in this context presumably in the preseismic preparatory phase the deep fluids uprising in shallow regional aquifers could be enhanced due to the generation of high pore pressure along fault plane and fractures cardello and mancktelow 2015 barberio et al 2021 findings like those reported in our work are relevant because they confirmed in similar geological and tectonic setting a common geochemical process able to cause the same pattern of hydrogeochemical anomalies in fact we argue that the recorded geochemical responses were induced by a similar geochemical process that caused the anomalies prior to the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence main earthquake mw 6 5 chiaraluce et al 2017 the proposed tectonic model reconstructed for the two different study areas is the same too implications derived from our study can be applied to cases in other countries and in other geological contexts for example variations in groundwater hydrogeochemical content were also observed before and during volcanic activity in iceland and in tenerife island as consequence of pulses of fluid injection from volcanic and or hydrothermal system barbieri et al 2021 amonte et al 2021 5 conclusion in this study hydrogeochemical monitoring both discrete and continuous of chemical physical parameters major ions and dissolved co2 was performed in grassano spring central southern italy with the aim of identifying in groundwater potential precursors of nearby earthquakes we conclude that anomalous concentrations of ca2 na and hco3 were recorded in one sample before and in another one after the 2019 benevento seismic sequence main earthquake on december 16th 2019 mw 3 9 san leucio del sannio changes in groundwater chemical content are attributable to the progressive increase of deep co2 in the aquifer system which temporarily lowered ph and enhanced the solubility of the above mentioned major ions the deep pre seismic dilatational processes are supposed to be responsible for enhancing the influx and ascent of co2 in the regional carbonate aquifer in fact the increase of co2 in the studied aquifer and spring started before the related seismic sequence the geochemical process that occurred in grassano groundwater prior to the seismic sequence was similar to that defined for the 2016 2017 amatrice norcia seismic sequence despite the seismicity during our monitoring period was characterized by small intermediate magnitude the obtained results shed light on the possibility of having pre seismic hydrogeochemical signals in springs and groundwater also for small intermediate earthquake magnitude at least in the areas where deep fluids contribution to groundwater is evident this study highlights also the crucial role of the multiparametric approach to expand the knowledge about the relationship between the geochemical process in groundwater and seismic activity however also other parameters as for example discharge rates as well as the groundwater level are needed to clarify some hydrogeological aspects the setup of a standardized and diffuse monitoring network of groundwater like that of this study would produce significant and useful information towards the solving of the three main questions when where and how the release of seismic energy will occur credit authorship contribution statement

3847,the large number of lakes little influenced by humans on the tibetan plateau form a natural laboratory for exploring cryosphere hydrosphere atmosphere processes under global warming the water levels of these alpine lakes respond directly to water balance but are mainly known only on the interannual scale seasonal variations are still poorly described due to limited gauge measurements here the seasonal trends and cycles of lake level changes on the tibetan plateau were examined using altimetry data from icesat 132 available lakes cryosat 2 244 lakes sentinel 3a 125 lakes sentinel 3b 120 lakes and icesat 2 356 lakes bias between altimetry data sets was removed and a validation against in situ lake level measurements from qinghai lake between 2003 and 2020 revealed a good performance r

between 2010 and 2020 but seasonal trends were again similar in this period 0 21 0 25 m yr declining water levels for lakes around nam co were identified with a mean negative rate of 0 09 0 02 m yr furthermore during 2016 2020 an accelerated lake level rise was found with a mean rate of 0 43 0 05 m yr 0 47 0 53 m yr in four seasons lake levels in the southern tp are shown to have increased during 2016 2019 a reversal of the pre 2016 observations of declining levels the seasonal cycles of lake level variations show that the majority of lakes have a peak water level in august september followed by october november the features of the peaks vary distinctly in different climate regions with the timing of the peak occurring gradually later as one moves from southwest to northeast the seasonal cycles of water level and terrestrial water storage from grace data are highly consistent the spatial pattern of lake level changes during the seasonal period of rising lake levels also matches precipitation variations well as does lake volume change with terrestrial water storage budget the study reveals the tremendous potential of multi sensor altimetry data for detecting seasonal features of lake level variation which is a great asset for understanding earth s water dynamics and balance keywords seasonal lake level radar and laser altimetry cryosat 2 sentinel 3 icesat 2 tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has the densest distribution of natural lakes in china with 1400 alpine lakes 1 km2 which have a total area of 5 104 km2 fig 1 ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2019d due to their significant expansion and the fact that in contrast to lakes and water bodies in many other regions of the world they are subject to few direct human influences pekel et al 2016 these lakes are now a hotspot for research into changes in the hydrological cycle and climate at regional and global scales the development of multi spectral optical remote sensing mapping wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019c and satellite altimetry data crétaux et al 2011 jiang et al 2017a li et al 2019 song et al 2013 has led to great improvements in understanding the variations of these plateau lakes in recent years for some small lakes on the tp interannual variations of lake extent as far back as the 1960s can be determined by using historical topographic maps and landsat images wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019c lake water surface elevation can be observed by gauge measurement li et al 2007 satellite altimetry data crétaux and birkett 2006 and by combining srtm and landsat data pan et al 2013 yang et al 2017 however lake level gauging stations are very rare in the tp data have only been available for qinghai lake since the 1950s li et al 2007 and for nam co since 2005 only the qinghai lake data can be used for comparison or validation with satellite altimetry data since the data from other lakes consists of relative water level fluctuations rather than absolute elevation with a referencing system given these limitations direct mapping of tp water level changes must depend mainly on satellite altimetry data lake level changes have been monitored since 1992 using radar altimetry data such as that from the topex poseidon jason and envisat missions crétaux et al 2011 however the number of lakes on the tp for which there is data from these early systems is limited to 25 since 2003 the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat laser altimetry data which has a footprint size of 70 m in diameter spaced at 172 m along track has been available zwally et al 2002b this data includes absolute lake surface elevation with a high level of accuracy 10 cm in the ice free season zhang et al 2011 unfortunately icesat was decommissioned in 2010 and only provided water level data between 2003 and 2009 with the usual data collection periods being february march may june and october november despite there being only seven years of icesat data available they have been used to examine the trends of water level changes for approximately 70 lakes with a 500 m modis water mask being used to extract icesat footprints during 2003 2009 a period of rapidly rising lake levels zhang et al 2011 cryosat 2 a european space agency esa environmental research satellite was launched in 2010 it provides water level observations for the period following the icesat data and covers a greater number of lakes jiang et al 2017a jiang et al 2020a sentinel 3 a two satellite mission developed by the esa as part of the copernicus programme launched in 2016 and further enriched water level retrieval possibilities with denser sampling over lake surfaces and a smaller footprint more recently icesat 2 launched in 2018 has enabled lake level elevation measurements to be made with an unprecedented accuracy and precision 17 m diameter footprint with an interval of 0 7 m markus et al 2017 doubling the number of water level observations of lakes on the tp relative to the original icesat mission zhang et al 2019b previous studies of interannual variations of lake level over the tp have mainly used altimetry data from individual satellites with combined altimetric data sets only being used for large lakes crétaux et al 2011 jiang et al 2017a li et al 2019 song et al 2013 seasonal lake level variations have been examined using in situ water level measurements but only for a very limited number of lakes 5 lei et al 2017 by combining multi mission satellite altimetry data such as those from icesat icesat 2 cryosat 2 sentinel 3a sentinel 3b lake level changes for more than 100 lakes can be determined fig 1 more importantly by using recent satellite altimetry data with a short repeat subcycle the seasonal characteristics of lake level changes can be examined which has not previously been possible the purpose of this work is 1 to examine seasonal trends of lake level changes by combining multi mission satellite altimetry data 2 to identify the unique features of lake level changes in three different periods 2003 2020 2010 2020 and 2016 2020 3 to detect differences in the seasonal cycles of lake level variations in different climate regions 4 to link lake seasonal cycles with local climate variations and terrestrial water storage this study should help to provide a better understanding of changes in the spatial temporal patterns of lakes on the tp in response to recent climate and cryosphere dynamics 2 data and methods 2 1 icesat and icesat 2 laser altimetry data the glas instrument aboard the icesat satellite was designed to measure ice sheet and land elevations vegetation canopy height height profiles of cloud and aerosol and sea ice thickness zwally et al 2002a icesat data have been widely used for monitoring inland lake and river levels with a vertical accuracy of a few centimeters bhang et al 2007 the icesat derived glah14 release 34 lake surface elevation data referenced to the wgs84 ellipsoid and egm2008 geoid for the tp between 2003 and 2009 were obtained from zhang et al 2019b and have been processed for geodetic surveying atmospheric correction and outlier removal landsat mapped lake boundaries 30 m pixel size were used to select icesat footprints for a total of 132 lakes on the tp zhang et al 2019b the icesat 2 satellite carrying the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas was launched in september 2018 as the successor to icesat atlas consists of a multibeam micropulse low energy high resolution photon counting laser altimeter with three pairs of beams left central and right jasinski et al 2020 each pair of lasers is spaced about 90 m apart and consists of a strong beam 175 mj and a weak beam 45 mj with a footprint of about 17 m per beam pan et al 2013 the cross track distance between each pair of laser beams is about 3 km atlas transmits pulses to the ground at a frequency of 10 khz which allows it to make observations approximately every 70 cm khanal et al 2021 here we utilized the latest icesat 2 atl13 v3 product covering the period october 2018 to october 2020 which was obtained from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data atl13 jasinski et al 2020 the atl13 product is a data set specifically designed for inland water bodies including lakes reservoirs bays and estuaries and consists of a series of parameters such as latitude and longitude significant wave height swh subsurface backscatter attenuation coefficient wave height and geoid value the processing flow of the icesat 2 data is shown in fig 2 first lake boundaries derived from landsat images in 2018 zhang et al 2019c were used to determine which icesat 2 footprints intersect the lake in question for each footprint the orthometric height wgs84 and egm2008 is then extracted as the lake water surface elevation it should be noted that in the results of an experiment for qinghai lake the lake level obtained from orthometric height without swh was in better agreement with in situ lake level measurements than the values obtained by subtracting the swh from the orthometric height fig s1 second a 1 5 normalized median absolute deviation nmad method is used to remove outliers due to the influence of photon noise and scattering from the nearshore area fig 3 a höhle and höhle 2009 third benefiting from the high sensitivity of the photon counting radar and the 532 nm wavelength that can penetrate water bodies atlas detects depths of up to 40 m in clean water behrangi et al 2017 therefore the data in the upper layers are true lake level values fig 3b here the footprint intersecting the lake is taken as a segment for each 0 1 latitude with the data for each segment being sorted separately each percentile from 1st to 99th was tested and based on a comparison with in situ lake level data the 62nd percentile was determined to be the optimum choice r 2 0 90 and rmse 0 07 fig 3c d therefore data greater than the 62nd percentile within each 0 1 latitude segment along the track were averaged to give the lake level 1248 lakes on the tp have an icesat 2 orbit number greater than or equal to 1 including many lakes which are passed only once there are 356 lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 6 and 86 lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 12 2 2 cryosat 2 radar altimetry data cryosat 2 which carries the synthetic aperture interferometric radar altimeter siral operating in ku band aims to monitor variations in marine ice cover and continental ice sheets wingham et al 2006 siral operates in one of three different measurement modes depending on the geographical pattern mask low resolution mode lrm synthetic aperture mode sar and synthetic aperture interferometric mode sarin jiang et al 2017b in the tp siral operates in sarin mode to monitor mountain glaciers and lakes use of the sarin mode means that cryosat 2 is able to provide more reliable water level data for lakes surrounded by complex topography kleinherenbrink et al 2014 cryosat 2 has a repeat period of 369 days and a 30 day subcycle labroue et al 2012 here the level 1b baseline d data product obtained between july 2010 and july 2020 in sarin mode was used this product contains waveforms with 1024 bins bouzinac 2019 to extract water levels the waveforms are retracked using the narrow primary peak threshold nppt retracker jain et al 2015 different thresholds ranging from 10 to 100 at a 10 step were tested and the 80 threshold was found to give the best performance lake level with respect to the earth gravitational model of the 2008 geoid egm2008 h can be calculated using eqn 1 1 h h alt h range r geo r r n geoid where halt is the satellite altitude hrange is the distance between the altimeter and the lake surface rr is the retracker correction and rgeo represents geophysical corrections for various effects including the ionosphere wet and dry troposphere solid earth tide ocean loading tide and pole tide ngeoid is the geoid height referenced to the wgs84 ellipsoid after a series of corrections the 1 5 nmad method was used to remove outliers and then calculate the along track mean of cryosat 2 fig 3e there are 399 lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 1 however we mainly selected lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 10 although we did also include a small number of lakes with the number of passes less than 10 when appropriate for examining interannual trends based on time series based on these criteria cryosat 2 data were available for a total of 244 lakes 2 3 sentinel 3a and sentinal 3b radar altimetry data sentinel 3 is composed of two identical polar orbiting satellites sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b which were launched in february 2016 and april 2018 respectively jiang et al 2020b both are equipped with a dual frequency ku and c band synthetic aperture radar altimeter sral which is mainly used for determining ocean surface level wave height wind speed sea ice tide land ice and water body level compared with the 1 64 km along orbit resolution in low resolution mode lrm the 300 m resolution in synthetic aperture radar sar mode has a greater potential for lake level measurements kittel et al 2020 the sral altimeter operates in full sar mode from 60 n to 60 s making sentinel 3 the first satellite altimetry mission to provide near global coverage in sar mode kittel et al 2020 based on a priori surface elevation information dem sral operating in open loop mode sets its range window appropriately in time to control the echo acquisition phase jiang et al 2020b compared to cryosat 2 and saral altika in closed loop mode sral is less affected by sudden changes in terrain jiang et al 2019 level 2 data from sentinel 3a for the period march 2016 and july 2020 and from sentinel 3b for may 2018 to november 2020 were obtained from esa and used to retrieve the elevation of lake water surfaces on the tp the processing flow for the sentinel 3a 3b data is similar to that for the cryosat 2 data fig 2 all the corrections given in eqn 1 except the retracker correction are included in the sentinel 3a 3b products additional geophysical corrections are included for inverse barometer sea state bias and high frequency fluctuations wang 2019 as with the cryosat 2 data a 1 5 nmad filter was used to remove elevation outliers fig 3f g and the along track mean value was then calculated 2 4 bias removal although the icesat and cryosat 2 data have been unified under the same reference it is still necessary to remove systematic elevation differences due to the influence of equipment altitude inclination and orbit used by each satellite at present the most commonly used method to remove this systematic offset between different satellite data is to compare the mean water level difference for an overlap period li et al 2019 however since there is no overlap period between icesat 2003 2009 and cryosat 2 2010 2020 we instead calculated the lake area change rate ra the lake level change rate rl from 2003 to 2009 and the area change ca from 2009 to 2010 the lake level change from 2009 to 2010 was then calculated as rl ra ca despite the uncertainties inherent in this approach the estimated lake level values suggest that any errors are manageable 2 5 validation of altimetry data for measuring lake level to evaluate the performance of the method for deriving lake levels from the five altimetry satellites in situ gauge data from qinghai lake 36 35 16 0 n 100 29 28 4 e see fig 1 for location for the period 2003 to 2019 were obtained from the bureau of hydrology and water resources of qinghai province as shown in fig 4 the lake levels derived from the qinghai lake satellite data are strongly correlated with the in situ measurements with high r 2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 98 fig 4 compared to the other satellites icesat 2 and cryosat 2 have the smallest errors rmse 0 07 and 0 08 respectively of the order of a few centimeters the small differences between the five satellite data sets may be due to differences in the number of tracks of altimetry data overall all the altimetry satellites are able to monitor lake level changes with a high degree of accuracy 2 6 detecting seasonal lake level variations while the annual trend in lake level variations was calculated from all data in each year during a time period the seasonal trend was estimated from the data from several specified months of each year over a time period for example the spring trend was derived from the march to may data from each year the seasonal variations of 184 tp lakes were analyzed using four satellite altimetry data sets sentinel 3a sentinel 3b cryosat 2 icesat 2 the sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 data covered the four years from 2016 to 2019 inclusive while the sentinel 3b and icesat 2 data only covered 2019 and 2020 as both of these systems only launched in 2018 due to the low temporal resolution of cryosat 2 and icesat 2 only data for which the number of orbits was greater than 6 in a year and which had a clear seasonal pattern were used sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b have the same altimeter senor sral and temporal resolution 27 days and the complementarity between their orbits means the lakes can be observed at a higher frequency for detecting the seasonal variation of lakes the most important parameter is the satellite revisit cycle over a lake we determined the following priority order of data choice sentinel 3a sentinel 3b 25 lakes sentinel 3a 75 lakes sentinel 3b 71 lakes icesat 2 9 lakes cryosat 2 4 lakes 2 7 auxiliary data lake boundaries determined from landsat tm etm oli data zhang et al 2019b were used to extract elevation footprints and combined with altimetry data to estimate lake volume changes water levels of five lakes provided by hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr hydroweb were used to verify whether the difference between the icesat and cryosat 2 data had been removed monthly temperature and precipitation data from nam co 30 46 44 n 90 59 31 e 4730 m a s l and damxung weather station 30 29 n 91 06 e 4200 m and annual precipitation data from lhasa 29 40 n 90 08 e 3649 m gongga 29 18 n 90 59 e 3555 m and nyêmo weather stations 29 26 n 90 10 e 3809 m for 2001 2018 were also used to explain specific water level variations in addition terrestrial water storage tws changes from grace the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite yi et al 2016 were compared with the calculated seasonal lake storage changes comparison with grace data in the inner tp has shown that the global precipitation climatology project gpcp precipitation product describes the seasonal cycle better than other products behrangi et al 2017 monthly 0 5 0 5 resolution gpcp precipitation product https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gpcpmon 3 1 summary was used for the comparison with the magnitude of seasonal lake level variations 2 8 estimates of seasonal lake volume change seasonal lake water volume changes in the endorheic basin were estimated by using eqn 2 wang et al 2016 2 v change i 1 m h 2 i h 1 i a i j n b j i 1 m a i where h 1 and h 2 are the lake levels in may and september respectively a is the area of lakes with surface level data 120 lakes and b is the area of all lakes in 2019 extracted from landsat data 1921 lakes v change is seasonal lake water volume change may sep in the endorheic basin 3 results 3 1 seasonal trends of lake level variations during 2003 2020 based on icesat and cryosat 2 during 2003 2020 icesat 2003 2009 data were available for 132 lakes and cryosat 2 2010 2020 data for 268 lakes taking into account the availability of the two types of data for the same lake and setting a minimum track number of 18 70 lakes were selected for an examination of changes in water level during 2003 2020 considering icesat mainly operated in february march 42 lakes may june 37 lakes and october november 39 lakes the annual changes in lake level in different seasons were also surveyed the data start in 2003 2005 and end in 2017 2020 the systematic bias between the icesat and cryosat 2 data was removed by calculating the water level change from 2009 to 2010 fig s2 the overall trend water level trend of all lakes weighted by area of lake level change for these 70 lakes from 2003 to 2020 was 0 20 0 01 m yr fig 5 a a total of 61 lakes showed an increasing trend in lake level with a mean rate of 0 24 0 01 m yr spanning a range of 0 01 to 0 77 m yr of which 90 55 lakes were statistically significant p 0 05 the remaining 9 lakes had an overall decreasing trend with a mean rate of 0 05 0 01 m yr varying from 0 25 to 0 004 m yr out of which 4 lakes were statistically significant p 0 05 the overall seasonal interannual variation in lake level for all lakes showed similar trends with a rate of 0 19 0 01 m yr in february march 0 18 0 01 m yr in may june and 0 20 0 01 m yr in october november however these average values disguise the fact that the trends for some lakes were different with a decrease in one season but an increase in other seasons this variability is the reason that the rates of lake level changes are not statistically significant for example nam co had an interannual trend of 0 00 0 01 m yr but 0 01 0 01 m yr in february march 0 01 0 01 m yr in may june and 0 01 0 02 m yr in october november the overall spatial pattern of lake level variations between 2003 and 2020 was one of rising lake levels for the central northern lakes but declining levels for some southern lakes the seasonal trends exhibited similar patterns especially in february march the trends of lake level changes in october november were further examined in the four subregions fig s3 for the northeastern tp lake levels in general had an increasing trend with a mean rate of 0 19 0 01 m yr between 2003 and 2020 qinghai lake the largest saltwater lake in china is located in this region and had a rising rate of 0 17 0 001 m yr in the northern tp the lake levels increased faster with a mean rate of 0 40 0 01 m yr the mean lake level showed a robust increase from 2003 to 2012 followed by a slowing in 2012 2015 and then a rapid increase after 2015 in the central tp the lakes had a mean rate of increase of 0 13 0 02 m yr which is much smaller than the rates observed in the northern and northeastern regions large fluctuations of lake level changes were observed with a slight rising in 2003 2014 a rapid decline in 2015 2017 and a further increase in the last two years in the southern tp lake levels declined rapidly at a mean rate of 0 12 0 04 m yr and with rates of 0 05 0 01 m yr for paiku co and 0 25 0 01 m yr for yamzhuo yumco it is important to note that the water levels of paiku co and yamzhuo yumco started to rise after 2016 the increase in lake levels declines as one moves from north to south with northern lake levels increasing by 6 33 m and northeastern lake levels by 3 35 m but with the levels of the central lakes increasing by only 2 90 m and the southern lake levels decreasing by about 0 76 m 3 2 seasonal trends of lake level variations during 2010 2020 based on cryosat 2 the high spatial coverage of cryosat 2 data allowed seasonal trends to be examined in addition to the analysis of interannual variations in lake levels between 2010 and 2020 out of 244 lakes with available data 154 have a significant p 0 05 annual trend while 67 lakes with a significant trend in spring 59 in summer 61 in autumn and 78 in winter overall the spatially heterogeneous patterns of lake level changes in each season spring to winter were similar to the pattern for all seasons fig 6 the mean rate of lake level change during 2010 2020 was also similar for each season with values of 0 21 0 03 in spring 0 25 0 03 in summer 0 23 0 03 in autumn and 0 24 0 03 in winter and 0 22 0 02 m yr for all seasons combined the levels of the northern lakes were increasing at a faster rate than the southern lakes in particular we found that the lakes around nam co had declining trends of water level to further investigate this finding the changes in lake area in 2010 2019 were surveyed and the trends in lake level and area were found to be clearly consistent fig s4 lake levels in the region rose from 2010 to 2012 2013 followed by a decline until 2018 and then a slight recovery in the last two years 3 3 seasonal trends of lake level variations during 2016 2020 based on cryosat 2 and sentinel 3a lake level changes between 2016 and 2020 for a total of 291 lakes were monitored using sentinel 3a 125 lakes and cryosat 2 166 lakes when both sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 data were available for the same lake we used the sentinel 3a data because of its higher temporal resolution lake level changes during 2016 2020 for 187 lakes at the significance level p 0 05 were selected fig 7 some southern lakes which had falling levels during the long term observations 2003 2020 had rising levels during this period this change can be faintly seen in the icesat and cryosat 2 data fig s3d but was more clearly revealed in the most recent observations fig 7e the water levels of lakes located in the inner tp rose faster a mean rate of 0 47 m yr than the levels of lakes in the other basins a mean rate of 0 27 m yr fig s5 the lake level rise accelerated during 2016 2020 with a mean rate of 0 52 0 05 m yr in march may 0 53 0 05 m yr in june august 0 54 0 05 m yr in september november and 0 47 0 05 m yr in december february the mean rate for all seasons was 0 43 0 05 m yr six large lakes 1000 km2 each showed dramatic increases in water level 0 41 0 02 to 1 07 0 03 m yr with the exception of nam co 0 03 0 02 m yr fig s6 zhari namco had a water level increase of 4 59 m during the four year period icesat data from 2003 to 2009 zhang et al 2011 and cryosat 2 data for 2010 2015 jiang et al 2017a show declining levels for the southern lakes however during 2016 2020 these lakes had increasing levels with a mean rate of 0 09 0 04 m yr fig 7e 3 4 seasonal cycles of lake level variations the intraannual lake level variations of 184 lakes in five subregions have been described seasonal lake variations across the tp exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity fig 8 the characteristics of lake level seasonal cycles in each subregion fig 9 fig s7 s11 can be summarized as northwestern subregion nw this region contains five lakes and all peaked in august september fig 8 the seasonal cycle shows that lake levels declined in april may rose suddenly from may to august and peaked in august september before falling rapidly from september to february of the following year fig 9 northern subregion n most of the lakes in this region 76 lakes 84 reached their peaks in august november while some lakes usually peaked in august september others did not do so until late november december the seasonal cycle indicates that the lake levels rose continuously from may to august and remained high throughout august january before dropping in february central subregion c the majority of lakes in this region reached their peaks in august september the seasonal cycle shows that the lake levels had a slight fluctuation in march may and smoothly increased from may to september before decreasing drastically from september to february southern subregion s most lakes in this region peaked in august september the seasonal cycle shows that the lake levels rose in march may but declined in june they then rose continuously from june to august before falling with some slight fluctuations until february northeastern subregion ne the seasonal peaks in this region were similar to those of the lakes in the northern n region occurring late compared to other regions in october december the seasonal cycle was smooth with an increase from may to october and then a gradual decline from october to february the majority of lakes had a peak in august 26 or september 30 with these figures dominated by lakes in the northern and central regions the next most frequent months for peaking were october 14 and november 15 the features of the time series of lake level variations the timing of their peaks and their seasonal cycles were distinctly different in the five subregions as one moves from southwest to northeast the timing of the peak lake levels was gradually delayed with lakes in the southern and central regions mainly peaking in early august september and then declining rapidly some of the lakes in the northern and northeastern regions peaked later in november december with high water levels sustained for longer a few lakes located in the northwestern plateau exhibited a variable seasonal cycle especially in spring from south to north 33 n lake levels reached their peaks later and from west to east lake levels reached their peaks in a wider range of months 4 discussion 4 1 differences of lake level trends in three time periods lake level changes in three different time periods have been examined for the period 2003 2020 lake level changes for 70 lakes were derived from icesat and cryosat 2 altimetry data although previous studies have examined lake level changes over the tp for the early 21st century jiang et al 2017a kleinherenbrink et al 2015 li et al 2019 here the seasonal trends are further examined a mean rate of 0 2 m yr between 2003 and 2020 was revealed for three seasons and the existence of spatial differences was revealed with a robust rising for the northern lakes little trend for the central lakes and a declining trend for the southern lakes the interannual variations of lake levels derived from cryosat 2 data from 2010 2020 have been described by jiang et al 2020a but here the seasonal trends were further revealed with remarkable spatial differences such as the declining water level around nam co being scrutinized the lowest water levels in these lakes occurred in 2018 2 to 3 years after the low water levels which occurred in response to the strong el niño event in 2015 2016 jiang et al 2020a lei et al 2019 the 2018 low levels were probably due to the low precipitation in 2017 2018 being insufficient to provide recovery from the excessive el niño induced decline in water levels fig s12 the sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 combination has previously been used to quantify the trends of lake level changes across china chen and liao 2020 here during the most recent years 2016 2020 we detected a reversal of the previously observed lake level decrease for the southern lakes which can be mainly attributed to increased precipitation after 2015 fig 7f a comparison of the differences in lake level changes during three periods were further illustrated by classifying water supply types fig 10 the rising rates of lake level during the period 2016 2020 were generally higher than the rates in the periods 2003 2020 and 2010 2020 this is the case for both endorheic and exorheic lakes in addition both for basins with glacier melt water and those without the lake level rise in 2016 2020 was greater relative to other periods the differences in lake level changes could be due to the reduction in precipitation associated with the strong 2015 2016 el niño and increased precipitation after that event lei et al 2019 4 2 seasonal cycle of lake level variations to date few studies have investigated seasonal cycles of lake level variations over the tp this situation is mainly due to the lack of in situ data and the low temporal resolution and orbital density of satellite altimetry data lei et al 2017 studied the seasonal variation of water levels over the tp but used in situ measurements from only 5 lakes to represent the spatial differences of seasonal cycles for a large area of the tp icesat altimetry data are undoubtedly important for understanding the general characteristics of seasonal lake level changes song et al 2014 and the launch of the sentinel 3a sentinel 3b and icesat 2 altimetry satellites has led to more observations enabling a much better depiction of the seasonal processes and spatial patterns of lake level the differences between lake seasonal cycles in the five subregions may be due to cryosphere melting and different atmospheric circulation types the indian monsoon westerlies and east asian monsoon fig 9 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2013 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b for the lake level changes in the nw region runoff is dominated by the snowmelt contribution 70 khanal et al 2021 which increases in march april and then decreases precipitation decreases in march may kraaijenbrink et al 2021 liu et al so the huge decline in lake level in may in the nw region relative to the other regions could be due to the decreased snowmelt the high lake levels in august september followed by a decline may be associated with the seasonal feature of glacier meltwater runoff armstrong et al 2019 for lakes in the s region the water level peak in may and decline in june could be related to the seasonal characteristics of snowmelt in the brahmaputra river and ganges river basins liu et al 2021 the seasonal peak august october in lake level in the different subregions except for the northwestern region is delayed relative to the period of high precipitation july august fig 9 khanal et al 2021 but this may just reflect the fact that it takes time for the precipitation over the basin to reach the lakes the long lived peaks august november for the northern region can be ascribed to the enhanced precipitation associated with large scale atmospheric cycles yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a in general snowmelt and ice phenology determine the peak in april may while the peak in august october is influenced by precipitation or in the case of the northwestern lakes by glacier meltwater 4 3 changes in lake level and volume and grace derived mass in the inner tp most of the lakes in the inner tp an endorheic basin are closed lakes which are less influenced by outflowing rivers and tributaries and are natural testing grounds for studying the relationship between water volume and mass changes the seasonal variations of lake level and mass in the inner tp are illustrated in fig 11 it should be noted that only lake level data from 2019 were used here because in that year data from sentinel 3a sentinel 3b cryosat 2 and icesat 2 are all available meaning that the data cover more lakes thus making the results more reliable fig 11 shows that lake levels started to rise in may reached a peak in august september and then declined gradually the mass began to increase in april and increased continuously until august followed by a decrease which is consistent with precipitation time series behrangi et al 2017 the water level change occurs a month later than the mass change which could be due to the slower effect of sub surface flow connected with groundwater recharges overall the seasonal cycles of water level and mass are consistent we linked the changes in lake level volume seasonal precipitation and tws from grace data during may september the period of rising water level to create a quantitative perspective fig 12 we found that the spatial pattern of lake level changes matched the precipitation variations well for example the central southern lakes show large increases in level during may september correlating well with the spatial pattern of precipitation at that time in addition the lake volume change consistently matches the grace based tws variation although the match is not as good as with the precipitation data due to the coarse spatial resolution of grace data a quantitative analysis showed that the lakes in the inner tp had a water volume increase equivalent to 13 36 gt from may to september of 2019 while the tws mass gain from grace data was 16 gt the magnitudes of the lake water storage and grace derived mass increase are similar suggesting that lake volume change dominates the mass change in the inner tp a previous study has shown that increased lake water storage mainly drives the mass change of the inner tp as a whole zhang et al 2013 but this study reveals further detail at the seasonal scale 5 conclusions in this study multi sensor altimetry data icesat icesat 2 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3a sentinel 3b are used to explore seasonal variations of lake levels on the tp the mean annual trend of water level changes for 70 lakes between 2003 and 2020 was 0 20 0 01 m yr similar trends are found when the data are separated by seasons 0 19 0 01 m yr in february march 0 18 0 01 m yr in may june 0 20 0 01 m yr in october november the seasonal trends are further observed for more lakes 244 lakes during 2010 2020 using cryosat 2 data in this case a mean rate of 0 22 0 02 m yr was found for all seasons with similar trends for the separate seasons slightly higher than for the entire period 2003 2020 the decline of water level for lakes around nam co is identified clearly with a mean rate of 0 09 0 02 m yr an accelerated lake level increase is found during the period 2016 2020 using sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 data for 291 lakes in this case the mean rate of lake level change was 0 43 0 05 m yr with a slightly higher rate 0 54 0 05 m yr in autumn the southern lakes show a lake level increase of 0 09 0 04 m yr between 2016 and 2020 a reversal of the usually observed declining lake levels in this region the seasonal cycles of 184 lakes derived from sentinel 3a 3b cryosat 2 and icesat 2 data exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity the majority of the lakes peak in level in august and september followed by october and november the timing of the peak level increases gradually from the southwest to the northeast the differences in the seasonal cycles may be associated with cryosphere melting and atmospheric circulations the seasonal cycle of lake level variations is consistent with tws from grace data the magnitude of the seasonal lake level increase agrees well with gpcp precipitation data while lake volume shows good agreement with the grace based tws estimate this study

3847,the large number of lakes little influenced by humans on the tibetan plateau form a natural laboratory for exploring cryosphere hydrosphere atmosphere processes under global warming the water levels of these alpine lakes respond directly to water balance but are mainly known only on the interannual scale seasonal variations are still poorly described due to limited gauge measurements here the seasonal trends and cycles of lake level changes on the tibetan plateau were examined using altimetry data from icesat 132 available lakes cryosat 2 244 lakes sentinel 3a 125 lakes sentinel 3b 120 lakes and icesat 2 356 lakes bias between altimetry data sets was removed and a validation against in situ lake level measurements from qinghai lake between 2003 and 2020 revealed a good performance r 2 0 80 rmse 0 12 m the mean annual trend of lake level between 2003 and 2020 is 0 20 0 01 m yr with similar rates 0 18 0 20 m yr in three different seasons the rate was slightly greater 0 22 0 02 m yr between 2010 and 2020 but seasonal trends were again similar in this period 0 21 0 25 m yr declining water levels for lakes around nam co were identified with a mean negative rate of 0 09 0 02 m yr furthermore during 2016 2020 an accelerated lake level rise was found with a mean rate of 0 43 0 05 m yr 0 47 0 53 m yr in four seasons lake levels in the southern tp are shown to have increased during 2016 2019 a reversal of the pre 2016 observations of declining levels the seasonal cycles of lake level variations show that the majority of lakes have a peak water level in august september followed by october november the features of the peaks vary distinctly in different climate regions with the timing of the peak occurring gradually later as one moves from southwest to northeast the seasonal cycles of water level and terrestrial water storage from grace data are highly consistent the spatial pattern of lake level changes during the seasonal period of rising lake levels also matches precipitation variations well as does lake volume change with terrestrial water storage budget the study reveals the tremendous potential of multi sensor altimetry data for detecting seasonal features of lake level variation which is a great asset for understanding earth s water dynamics and balance keywords seasonal lake level radar and laser altimetry cryosat 2 sentinel 3 icesat 2 tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has the densest distribution of natural lakes in china with 1400 alpine lakes 1 km2 which have a total area of 5 104 km2 fig 1 ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2019d due to their significant expansion and the fact that in contrast to lakes and water bodies in many other regions of the world they are subject to few direct human influences pekel et al 2016 these lakes are now a hotspot for research into changes in the hydrological cycle and climate at regional and global scales the development of multi spectral optical remote sensing mapping wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019c and satellite altimetry data crétaux et al 2011 jiang et al 2017a li et al 2019 song et al 2013 has led to great improvements in understanding the variations of these plateau lakes in recent years for some small lakes on the tp interannual variations of lake extent as far back as the 1960s can be determined by using historical topographic maps and landsat images wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019c lake water surface elevation can be observed by gauge measurement li et al 2007 satellite altimetry data crétaux and birkett 2006 and by combining srtm and landsat data pan et al 2013 yang et al 2017 however lake level gauging stations are very rare in the tp data have only been available for qinghai lake since the 1950s li et al 2007 and for nam co since 2005 only the qinghai lake data can be used for comparison or validation with satellite altimetry data since the data from other lakes consists of relative water level fluctuations rather than absolute elevation with a referencing system given these limitations direct mapping of tp water level changes must depend mainly on satellite altimetry data lake level changes have been monitored since 1992 using radar altimetry data such as that from the topex poseidon jason and envisat missions crétaux et al 2011 however the number of lakes on the tp for which there is data from these early systems is limited to 25 since 2003 the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat laser altimetry data which has a footprint size of 70 m in diameter spaced at 172 m along track has been available zwally et al 2002b this data includes absolute lake surface elevation with a high level of accuracy 10 cm in the ice free season zhang et al 2011 unfortunately icesat was decommissioned in 2010 and only provided water level data between 2003 and 2009 with the usual data collection periods being february march may june and october november despite there being only seven years of icesat data available they have been used to examine the trends of water level changes for approximately 70 lakes with a 500 m modis water mask being used to extract icesat footprints during 2003 2009 a period of rapidly rising lake levels zhang et al 2011 cryosat 2 a european space agency esa environmental research satellite was launched in 2010 it provides water level observations for the period following the icesat data and covers a greater number of lakes jiang et al 2017a jiang et al 2020a sentinel 3 a two satellite mission developed by the esa as part of the copernicus programme launched in 2016 and further enriched water level retrieval possibilities with denser sampling over lake surfaces and a smaller footprint more recently icesat 2 launched in 2018 has enabled lake level elevation measurements to be made with an unprecedented accuracy and precision 17 m diameter footprint with an interval of 0 7 m markus et al 2017 doubling the number of water level observations of lakes on the tp relative to the original icesat mission zhang et al 2019b previous studies of interannual variations of lake level over the tp have mainly used altimetry data from individual satellites with combined altimetric data sets only being used for large lakes crétaux et al 2011 jiang et al 2017a li et al 2019 song et al 2013 seasonal lake level variations have been examined using in situ water level measurements but only for a very limited number of lakes 5 lei et al 2017 by combining multi mission satellite altimetry data such as those from icesat icesat 2 cryosat 2 sentinel 3a sentinel 3b lake level changes for more than 100 lakes can be determined fig 1 more importantly by using recent satellite altimetry data with a short repeat subcycle the seasonal characteristics of lake level changes can be examined which has not previously been possible the purpose of this work is 1 to examine seasonal trends of lake level changes by combining multi mission satellite altimetry data 2 to identify the unique features of lake level changes in three different periods 2003 2020 2010 2020 and 2016 2020 3 to detect differences in the seasonal cycles of lake level variations in different climate regions 4 to link lake seasonal cycles with local climate variations and terrestrial water storage this study should help to provide a better understanding of changes in the spatial temporal patterns of lakes on the tp in response to recent climate and cryosphere dynamics 2 data and methods 2 1 icesat and icesat 2 laser altimetry data the glas instrument aboard the icesat satellite was designed to measure ice sheet and land elevations vegetation canopy height height profiles of cloud and aerosol and sea ice thickness zwally et al 2002a icesat data have been widely used for monitoring inland lake and river levels with a vertical accuracy of a few centimeters bhang et al 2007 the icesat derived glah14 release 34 lake surface elevation data referenced to the wgs84 ellipsoid and egm2008 geoid for the tp between 2003 and 2009 were obtained from zhang et al 2019b and have been processed for geodetic surveying atmospheric correction and outlier removal landsat mapped lake boundaries 30 m pixel size were used to select icesat footprints for a total of 132 lakes on the tp zhang et al 2019b the icesat 2 satellite carrying the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas was launched in september 2018 as the successor to icesat atlas consists of a multibeam micropulse low energy high resolution photon counting laser altimeter with three pairs of beams left central and right jasinski et al 2020 each pair of lasers is spaced about 90 m apart and consists of a strong beam 175 mj and a weak beam 45 mj with a footprint of about 17 m per beam pan et al 2013 the cross track distance between each pair of laser beams is about 3 km atlas transmits pulses to the ground at a frequency of 10 khz which allows it to make observations approximately every 70 cm khanal et al 2021 here we utilized the latest icesat 2 atl13 v3 product covering the period october 2018 to october 2020 which was obtained from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data atl13 jasinski et al 2020 the atl13 product is a data set specifically designed for inland water bodies including lakes reservoirs bays and estuaries and consists of a series of parameters such as latitude and longitude significant wave height swh subsurface backscatter attenuation coefficient wave height and geoid value the processing flow of the icesat 2 data is shown in fig 2 first lake boundaries derived from landsat images in 2018 zhang et al 2019c were used to determine which icesat 2 footprints intersect the lake in question for each footprint the orthometric height wgs84 and egm2008 is then extracted as the lake water surface elevation it should be noted that in the results of an experiment for qinghai lake the lake level obtained from orthometric height without swh was in better agreement with in situ lake level measurements than the values obtained by subtracting the swh from the orthometric height fig s1 second a 1 5 normalized median absolute deviation nmad method is used to remove outliers due to the influence of photon noise and scattering from the nearshore area fig 3 a höhle and höhle 2009 third benefiting from the high sensitivity of the photon counting radar and the 532 nm wavelength that can penetrate water bodies atlas detects depths of up to 40 m in clean water behrangi et al 2017 therefore the data in the upper layers are true lake level values fig 3b here the footprint intersecting the lake is taken as a segment for each 0 1 latitude with the data for each segment being sorted separately each percentile from 1st to 99th was tested and based on a comparison with in situ lake level data the 62nd percentile was determined to be the optimum choice r 2 0 90 and rmse 0 07 fig 3c d therefore data greater than the 62nd percentile within each 0 1 latitude segment along the track were averaged to give the lake level 1248 lakes on the tp have an icesat 2 orbit number greater than or equal to 1 including many lakes which are passed only once there are 356 lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 6 and 86 lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 12 2 2 cryosat 2 radar altimetry data cryosat 2 which carries the synthetic aperture interferometric radar altimeter siral operating in ku band aims to monitor variations in marine ice cover and continental ice sheets wingham et al 2006 siral operates in one of three different measurement modes depending on the geographical pattern mask low resolution mode lrm synthetic aperture mode sar and synthetic aperture interferometric mode sarin jiang et al 2017b in the tp siral operates in sarin mode to monitor mountain glaciers and lakes use of the sarin mode means that cryosat 2 is able to provide more reliable water level data for lakes surrounded by complex topography kleinherenbrink et al 2014 cryosat 2 has a repeat period of 369 days and a 30 day subcycle labroue et al 2012 here the level 1b baseline d data product obtained between july 2010 and july 2020 in sarin mode was used this product contains waveforms with 1024 bins bouzinac 2019 to extract water levels the waveforms are retracked using the narrow primary peak threshold nppt retracker jain et al 2015 different thresholds ranging from 10 to 100 at a 10 step were tested and the 80 threshold was found to give the best performance lake level with respect to the earth gravitational model of the 2008 geoid egm2008 h can be calculated using eqn 1 1 h h alt h range r geo r r n geoid where halt is the satellite altitude hrange is the distance between the altimeter and the lake surface rr is the retracker correction and rgeo represents geophysical corrections for various effects including the ionosphere wet and dry troposphere solid earth tide ocean loading tide and pole tide ngeoid is the geoid height referenced to the wgs84 ellipsoid after a series of corrections the 1 5 nmad method was used to remove outliers and then calculate the along track mean of cryosat 2 fig 3e there are 399 lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 1 however we mainly selected lakes with the number of passes greater than or equal to 10 although we did also include a small number of lakes with the number of passes less than 10 when appropriate for examining interannual trends based on time series based on these criteria cryosat 2 data were available for a total of 244 lakes 2 3 sentinel 3a and sentinal 3b radar altimetry data sentinel 3 is composed of two identical polar orbiting satellites sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b which were launched in february 2016 and april 2018 respectively jiang et al 2020b both are equipped with a dual frequency ku and c band synthetic aperture radar altimeter sral which is mainly used for determining ocean surface level wave height wind speed sea ice tide land ice and water body level compared with the 1 64 km along orbit resolution in low resolution mode lrm the 300 m resolution in synthetic aperture radar sar mode has a greater potential for lake level measurements kittel et al 2020 the sral altimeter operates in full sar mode from 60 n to 60 s making sentinel 3 the first satellite altimetry mission to provide near global coverage in sar mode kittel et al 2020 based on a priori surface elevation information dem sral operating in open loop mode sets its range window appropriately in time to control the echo acquisition phase jiang et al 2020b compared to cryosat 2 and saral altika in closed loop mode sral is less affected by sudden changes in terrain jiang et al 2019 level 2 data from sentinel 3a for the period march 2016 and july 2020 and from sentinel 3b for may 2018 to november 2020 were obtained from esa and used to retrieve the elevation of lake water surfaces on the tp the processing flow for the sentinel 3a 3b data is similar to that for the cryosat 2 data fig 2 all the corrections given in eqn 1 except the retracker correction are included in the sentinel 3a 3b products additional geophysical corrections are included for inverse barometer sea state bias and high frequency fluctuations wang 2019 as with the cryosat 2 data a 1 5 nmad filter was used to remove elevation outliers fig 3f g and the along track mean value was then calculated 2 4 bias removal although the icesat and cryosat 2 data have been unified under the same reference it is still necessary to remove systematic elevation differences due to the influence of equipment altitude inclination and orbit used by each satellite at present the most commonly used method to remove this systematic offset between different satellite data is to compare the mean water level difference for an overlap period li et al 2019 however since there is no overlap period between icesat 2003 2009 and cryosat 2 2010 2020 we instead calculated the lake area change rate ra the lake level change rate rl from 2003 to 2009 and the area change ca from 2009 to 2010 the lake level change from 2009 to 2010 was then calculated as rl ra ca despite the uncertainties inherent in this approach the estimated lake level values suggest that any errors are manageable 2 5 validation of altimetry data for measuring lake level to evaluate the performance of the method for deriving lake levels from the five altimetry satellites in situ gauge data from qinghai lake 36 35 16 0 n 100 29 28 4 e see fig 1 for location for the period 2003 to 2019 were obtained from the bureau of hydrology and water resources of qinghai province as shown in fig 4 the lake levels derived from the qinghai lake satellite data are strongly correlated with the in situ measurements with high r 2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 98 fig 4 compared to the other satellites icesat 2 and cryosat 2 have the smallest errors rmse 0 07 and 0 08 respectively of the order of a few centimeters the small differences between the five satellite data sets may be due to differences in the number of tracks of altimetry data overall all the altimetry satellites are able to monitor lake level changes with a high degree of accuracy 2 6 detecting seasonal lake level variations while the annual trend in lake level variations was calculated from all data in each year during a time period the seasonal trend was estimated from the data from several specified months of each year over a time period for example the spring trend was derived from the march to may data from each year the seasonal variations of 184 tp lakes were analyzed using four satellite altimetry data sets sentinel 3a sentinel 3b cryosat 2 icesat 2 the sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 data covered the four years from 2016 to 2019 inclusive while the sentinel 3b and icesat 2 data only covered 2019 and 2020 as both of these systems only launched in 2018 due to the low temporal resolution of cryosat 2 and icesat 2 only data for which the number of orbits was greater than 6 in a year and which had a clear seasonal pattern were used sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b have the same altimeter senor sral and temporal resolution 27 days and the complementarity between their orbits means the lakes can be observed at a higher frequency for detecting the seasonal variation of lakes the most important parameter is the satellite revisit cycle over a lake we determined the following priority order of data choice sentinel 3a sentinel 3b 25 lakes sentinel 3a 75 lakes sentinel 3b 71 lakes icesat 2 9 lakes cryosat 2 4 lakes 2 7 auxiliary data lake boundaries determined from landsat tm etm oli data zhang et al 2019b were used to extract elevation footprints and combined with altimetry data to estimate lake volume changes water levels of five lakes provided by hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr hydroweb were used to verify whether the difference between the icesat and cryosat 2 data had been removed monthly temperature and precipitation data from nam co 30 46 44 n 90 59 31 e 4730 m a s l and damxung weather station 30 29 n 91 06 e 4200 m and annual precipitation data from lhasa 29 40 n 90 08 e 3649 m gongga 29 18 n 90 59 e 3555 m and nyêmo weather stations 29 26 n 90 10 e 3809 m for 2001 2018 were also used to explain specific water level variations in addition terrestrial water storage tws changes from grace the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite yi et al 2016 were compared with the calculated seasonal lake storage changes comparison with grace data in the inner tp has shown that the global precipitation climatology project gpcp precipitation product describes the seasonal cycle better than other products behrangi et al 2017 monthly 0 5 0 5 resolution gpcp precipitation product https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gpcpmon 3 1 summary was used for the comparison with the magnitude of seasonal lake level variations 2 8 estimates of seasonal lake volume change seasonal lake water volume changes in the endorheic basin were estimated by using eqn 2 wang et al 2016 2 v change i 1 m h 2 i h 1 i a i j n b j i 1 m a i where h 1 and h 2 are the lake levels in may and september respectively a is the area of lakes with surface level data 120 lakes and b is the area of all lakes in 2019 extracted from landsat data 1921 lakes v change is seasonal lake water volume change may sep in the endorheic basin 3 results 3 1 seasonal trends of lake level variations during 2003 2020 based on icesat and cryosat 2 during 2003 2020 icesat 2003 2009 data were available for 132 lakes and cryosat 2 2010 2020 data for 268 lakes taking into account the availability of the two types of data for the same lake and setting a minimum track number of 18 70 lakes were selected for an examination of changes in water level during 2003 2020 considering icesat mainly operated in february march 42 lakes may june 37 lakes and october november 39 lakes the annual changes in lake level in different seasons were also surveyed the data start in 2003 2005 and end in 2017 2020 the systematic bias between the icesat and cryosat 2 data was removed by calculating the water level change from 2009 to 2010 fig s2 the overall trend water level trend of all lakes weighted by area of lake level change for these 70 lakes from 2003 to 2020 was 0 20 0 01 m yr fig 5 a a total of 61 lakes showed an increasing trend in lake level with a mean rate of 0 24 0 01 m yr spanning a range of 0 01 to 0 77 m yr of which 90 55 lakes were statistically significant p 0 05 the remaining 9 lakes had an overall decreasing trend with a mean rate of 0 05 0 01 m yr varying from 0 25 to 0 004 m yr out of which 4 lakes were statistically significant p 0 05 the overall seasonal interannual variation in lake level for all lakes showed similar trends with a rate of 0 19 0 01 m yr in february march 0 18 0 01 m yr in may june and 0 20 0 01 m yr in october november however these average values disguise the fact that the trends for some lakes were different with a decrease in one season but an increase in other seasons this variability is the reason that the rates of lake level changes are not statistically significant for example nam co had an interannual trend of 0 00 0 01 m yr but 0 01 0 01 m yr in february march 0 01 0 01 m yr in may june and 0 01 0 02 m yr in october november the overall spatial pattern of lake level variations between 2003 and 2020 was one of rising lake levels for the central northern lakes but declining levels for some southern lakes the seasonal trends exhibited similar patterns especially in february march the trends of lake level changes in october november were further examined in the four subregions fig s3 for the northeastern tp lake levels in general had an increasing trend with a mean rate of 0 19 0 01 m yr between 2003 and 2020 qinghai lake the largest saltwater lake in china is located in this region and had a rising rate of 0 17 0 001 m yr in the northern tp the lake levels increased faster with a mean rate of 0 40 0 01 m yr the mean lake level showed a robust increase from 2003 to 2012 followed by a slowing in 2012 2015 and then a rapid increase after 2015 in the central tp the lakes had a mean rate of increase of 0 13 0 02 m yr which is much smaller than the rates observed in the northern and northeastern regions large fluctuations of lake level changes were observed with a slight rising in 2003 2014 a rapid decline in 2015 2017 and a further increase in the last two years in the southern tp lake levels declined rapidly at a mean rate of 0 12 0 04 m yr and with rates of 0 05 0 01 m yr for paiku co and 0 25 0 01 m yr for yamzhuo yumco it is important to note that the water levels of paiku co and yamzhuo yumco started to rise after 2016 the increase in lake levels declines as one moves from north to south with northern lake levels increasing by 6 33 m and northeastern lake levels by 3 35 m but with the levels of the central lakes increasing by only 2 90 m and the southern lake levels decreasing by about 0 76 m 3 2 seasonal trends of lake level variations during 2010 2020 based on cryosat 2 the high spatial coverage of cryosat 2 data allowed seasonal trends to be examined in addition to the analysis of interannual variations in lake levels between 2010 and 2020 out of 244 lakes with available data 154 have a significant p 0 05 annual trend while 67 lakes with a significant trend in spring 59 in summer 61 in autumn and 78 in winter overall the spatially heterogeneous patterns of lake level changes in each season spring to winter were similar to the pattern for all seasons fig 6 the mean rate of lake level change during 2010 2020 was also similar for each season with values of 0 21 0 03 in spring 0 25 0 03 in summer 0 23 0 03 in autumn and 0 24 0 03 in winter and 0 22 0 02 m yr for all seasons combined the levels of the northern lakes were increasing at a faster rate than the southern lakes in particular we found that the lakes around nam co had declining trends of water level to further investigate this finding the changes in lake area in 2010 2019 were surveyed and the trends in lake level and area were found to be clearly consistent fig s4 lake levels in the region rose from 2010 to 2012 2013 followed by a decline until 2018 and then a slight recovery in the last two years 3 3 seasonal trends of lake level variations during 2016 2020 based on cryosat 2 and sentinel 3a lake level changes between 2016 and 2020 for a total of 291 lakes were monitored using sentinel 3a 125 lakes and cryosat 2 166 lakes when both sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 data were available for the same lake we used the sentinel 3a data because of its higher temporal resolution lake level changes during 2016 2020 for 187 lakes at the significance level p 0 05 were selected fig 7 some southern lakes which had falling levels during the long term observations 2003 2020 had rising levels during this period this change can be faintly seen in the icesat and cryosat 2 data fig s3d but was more clearly revealed in the most recent observations fig 7e the water levels of lakes located in the inner tp rose faster a mean rate of 0 47 m yr than the levels of lakes in the other basins a mean rate of 0 27 m yr fig s5 the lake level rise accelerated during 2016 2020 with a mean rate of 0 52 0 05 m yr in march may 0 53 0 05 m yr in june august 0 54 0 05 m yr in september november and 0 47 0 05 m yr in december february the mean rate for all seasons was 0 43 0 05 m yr six large lakes 1000 km2 each showed dramatic increases in water level 0 41 0 02 to 1 07 0 03 m yr with the exception of nam co 0 03 0 02 m yr fig s6 zhari namco had a water level increase of 4 59 m during the four year period icesat data from 2003 to 2009 zhang et al 2011 and cryosat 2 data for 2010 2015 jiang et al 2017a show declining levels for the southern lakes however during 2016 2020 these lakes had increasing levels with a mean rate of 0 09 0 04 m yr fig 7e 3 4 seasonal cycles of lake level variations the intraannual lake level variations of 184 lakes in five subregions have been described seasonal lake variations across the tp exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity fig 8 the characteristics of lake level seasonal cycles in each subregion fig 9 fig s7 s11 can be summarized as northwestern subregion nw this region contains five lakes and all peaked in august september fig 8 the seasonal cycle shows that lake levels declined in april may rose suddenly from may to august and peaked in august september before falling rapidly from september to february of the following year fig 9 northern subregion n most of the lakes in this region 76 lakes 84 reached their peaks in august november while some lakes usually peaked in august september others did not do so until late november december the seasonal cycle indicates that the lake levels rose continuously from may to august and remained high throughout august january before dropping in february central subregion c the majority of lakes in this region reached their peaks in august september the seasonal cycle shows that the lake levels had a slight fluctuation in march may and smoothly increased from may to september before decreasing drastically from september to february southern subregion s most lakes in this region peaked in august september the seasonal cycle shows that the lake levels rose in march may but declined in june they then rose continuously from june to august before falling with some slight fluctuations until february northeastern subregion ne the seasonal peaks in this region were similar to those of the lakes in the northern n region occurring late compared to other regions in october december the seasonal cycle was smooth with an increase from may to october and then a gradual decline from october to february the majority of lakes had a peak in august 26 or september 30 with these figures dominated by lakes in the northern and central regions the next most frequent months for peaking were october 14 and november 15 the features of the time series of lake level variations the timing of their peaks and their seasonal cycles were distinctly different in the five subregions as one moves from southwest to northeast the timing of the peak lake levels was gradually delayed with lakes in the southern and central regions mainly peaking in early august september and then declining rapidly some of the lakes in the northern and northeastern regions peaked later in november december with high water levels sustained for longer a few lakes located in the northwestern plateau exhibited a variable seasonal cycle especially in spring from south to north 33 n lake levels reached their peaks later and from west to east lake levels reached their peaks in a wider range of months 4 discussion 4 1 differences of lake level trends in three time periods lake level changes in three different time periods have been examined for the period 2003 2020 lake level changes for 70 lakes were derived from icesat and cryosat 2 altimetry data although previous studies have examined lake level changes over the tp for the early 21st century jiang et al 2017a kleinherenbrink et al 2015 li et al 2019 here the seasonal trends are further examined a mean rate of 0 2 m yr between 2003 and 2020 was revealed for three seasons and the existence of spatial differences was revealed with a robust rising for the northern lakes little trend for the central lakes and a declining trend for the southern lakes the interannual variations of lake levels derived from cryosat 2 data from 2010 2020 have been described by jiang et al 2020a but here the seasonal trends were further revealed with remarkable spatial differences such as the declining water level around nam co being scrutinized the lowest water levels in these lakes occurred in 2018 2 to 3 years after the low water levels which occurred in response to the strong el niño event in 2015 2016 jiang et al 2020a lei et al 2019 the 2018 low levels were probably due to the low precipitation in 2017 2018 being insufficient to provide recovery from the excessive el niño induced decline in water levels fig s12 the sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 combination has previously been used to quantify the trends of lake level changes across china chen and liao 2020 here during the most recent years 2016 2020 we detected a reversal of the previously observed lake level decrease for the southern lakes which can be mainly attributed to increased precipitation after 2015 fig 7f a comparison of the differences in lake level changes during three periods were further illustrated by classifying water supply types fig 10 the rising rates of lake level during the period 2016 2020 were generally higher than the rates in the periods 2003 2020 and 2010 2020 this is the case for both endorheic and exorheic lakes in addition both for basins with glacier melt water and those without the lake level rise in 2016 2020 was greater relative to other periods the differences in lake level changes could be due to the reduction in precipitation associated with the strong 2015 2016 el niño and increased precipitation after that event lei et al 2019 4 2 seasonal cycle of lake level variations to date few studies have investigated seasonal cycles of lake level variations over the tp this situation is mainly due to the lack of in situ data and the low temporal resolution and orbital density of satellite altimetry data lei et al 2017 studied the seasonal variation of water levels over the tp but used in situ measurements from only 5 lakes to represent the spatial differences of seasonal cycles for a large area of the tp icesat altimetry data are undoubtedly important for understanding the general characteristics of seasonal lake level changes song et al 2014 and the launch of the sentinel 3a sentinel 3b and icesat 2 altimetry satellites has led to more observations enabling a much better depiction of the seasonal processes and spatial patterns of lake level the differences between lake seasonal cycles in the five subregions may be due to cryosphere melting and different atmospheric circulation types the indian monsoon westerlies and east asian monsoon fig 9 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2013 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b for the lake level changes in the nw region runoff is dominated by the snowmelt contribution 70 khanal et al 2021 which increases in march april and then decreases precipitation decreases in march may kraaijenbrink et al 2021 liu et al so the huge decline in lake level in may in the nw region relative to the other regions could be due to the decreased snowmelt the high lake levels in august september followed by a decline may be associated with the seasonal feature of glacier meltwater runoff armstrong et al 2019 for lakes in the s region the water level peak in may and decline in june could be related to the seasonal characteristics of snowmelt in the brahmaputra river and ganges river basins liu et al 2021 the seasonal peak august october in lake level in the different subregions except for the northwestern region is delayed relative to the period of high precipitation july august fig 9 khanal et al 2021 but this may just reflect the fact that it takes time for the precipitation over the basin to reach the lakes the long lived peaks august november for the northern region can be ascribed to the enhanced precipitation associated with large scale atmospheric cycles yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a in general snowmelt and ice phenology determine the peak in april may while the peak in august october is influenced by precipitation or in the case of the northwestern lakes by glacier meltwater 4 3 changes in lake level and volume and grace derived mass in the inner tp most of the lakes in the inner tp an endorheic basin are closed lakes which are less influenced by outflowing rivers and tributaries and are natural testing grounds for studying the relationship between water volume and mass changes the seasonal variations of lake level and mass in the inner tp are illustrated in fig 11 it should be noted that only lake level data from 2019 were used here because in that year data from sentinel 3a sentinel 3b cryosat 2 and icesat 2 are all available meaning that the data cover more lakes thus making the results more reliable fig 11 shows that lake levels started to rise in may reached a peak in august september and then declined gradually the mass began to increase in april and increased continuously until august followed by a decrease which is consistent with precipitation time series behrangi et al 2017 the water level change occurs a month later than the mass change which could be due to the slower effect of sub surface flow connected with groundwater recharges overall the seasonal cycles of water level and mass are consistent we linked the changes in lake level volume seasonal precipitation and tws from grace data during may september the period of rising water level to create a quantitative perspective fig 12 we found that the spatial pattern of lake level changes matched the precipitation variations well for example the central southern lakes show large increases in level during may september correlating well with the spatial pattern of precipitation at that time in addition the lake volume change consistently matches the grace based tws variation although the match is not as good as with the precipitation data due to the coarse spatial resolution of grace data a quantitative analysis showed that the lakes in the inner tp had a water volume increase equivalent to 13 36 gt from may to september of 2019 while the tws mass gain from grace data was 16 gt the magnitudes of the lake water storage and grace derived mass increase are similar suggesting that lake volume change dominates the mass change in the inner tp a previous study has shown that increased lake water storage mainly drives the mass change of the inner tp as a whole zhang et al 2013 but this study reveals further detail at the seasonal scale 5 conclusions in this study multi sensor altimetry data icesat icesat 2 cryosat 2 and sentinel 3a sentinel 3b are used to explore seasonal variations of lake levels on the tp the mean annual trend of water level changes for 70 lakes between 2003 and 2020 was 0 20 0 01 m yr similar trends are found when the data are separated by seasons 0 19 0 01 m yr in february march 0 18 0 01 m yr in may june 0 20 0 01 m yr in october november the seasonal trends are further observed for more lakes 244 lakes during 2010 2020 using cryosat 2 data in this case a mean rate of 0 22 0 02 m yr was found for all seasons with similar trends for the separate seasons slightly higher than for the entire period 2003 2020 the decline of water level for lakes around nam co is identified clearly with a mean rate of 0 09 0 02 m yr an accelerated lake level increase is found during the period 2016 2020 using sentinel 3a and cryosat 2 data for 291 lakes in this case the mean rate of lake level change was 0 43 0 05 m yr with a slightly higher rate 0 54 0 05 m yr in autumn the southern lakes show a lake level increase of 0 09 0 04 m yr between 2016 and 2020 a reversal of the usually observed declining lake levels in this region the seasonal cycles of 184 lakes derived from sentinel 3a 3b cryosat 2 and icesat 2 data exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity the majority of the lakes peak in level in august and september followed by october and november the timing of the peak level increases gradually from the southwest to the northeast the differences in the seasonal cycles may be associated with cryosphere melting and atmospheric circulations the seasonal cycle of lake level variations is consistent with tws from grace data the magnitude of the seasonal lake level increase agrees well with gpcp precipitation data while lake volume shows good agreement with the grace based tws estimate this study demonstrates the tremendous potential of multi mission satellite altimetry data to describe seasonal features of lake level changes in remote and inaccessible regions 6 data availability the icesat 2

3848,with global warming glacial collapse chain disasters have frequently occurred in high mountain areas in particular the ice avalanche glacial debris flow landslide barrier lake flood burst chain disaster caused the most serious consequences different from the general landslide dam consisted of rocks and soils the landslide dam initiated by ice avalanches contains a considerable amount of ice the appearance of ice will influence the overall performance of the landslide dam by melting which may cause differential settlements local weak zones a more porous structure and a lower erosion resistance of the landslide dam such changes in the erodibility and geometry of the landslide dam will further affect the dam overtopping and flood routing process which have not been investigated yet and urgently require further study therefore in this study a preliminary study of the effects of different ice fractions of the landslide dam is conducted which mainly involves changes in the dam erodibility the dam geometry the overtopping development the final breach size the process of downstream flood routing etc results show that with the increasing amount of ice melting the coefficient of soil erodibility and the soil void ratio increase significantly implying a more erodible dam material and a looser dam structure the melting of ice can also induce obvious dam settlement which further results in an earlier dam burst and a shorter rescue time with the increasing initial ice amount in the landslide dam the overtopping process develops more rapidly the breach expands greater both horizontally and vertically the subsequent flood becomes larger and the peak arrival time comes earlier keywords ice avalanche landslide landslide dam ice soil accumulation barrier lake dam breaching flood routing 1 introduction landslides can be triggered by rainfalls earthquakes snowmelt freeze thaw cycles which frequently occur in mountainous areas iverson 2000 laimer 2017 tong et al 2018 balzano et al 2019 serey et al 2019 a large landslide dam can be formed by a landslide with any initiations which often leads to a more serious consequence to people and infrastructures than the landslide itself by inundating upstream and potentially flooding downstream areas groeber 1916 burt and allison 2010 penna et al 2013 in the past decades massive glaciers are retreating in alpine regions by global warming and glacier related hazards have been rising both in scale and frequency the glacial melting has been identified as one of the main triggers of landslide activity in high mountain areas which changes precipitation patterns by supplying plentiful meltwater saturates depositions on hillsides and increases the hydrostatic pressure of the slope leading to a reduction of slope strength and a higher occurrence of the slope instability korup and tweed 2007 ren et al 2020 the glacier retreat and permafrost degradation have also provided abundant sources of poorly consolidated and unvegetated sediments for landslides especially for the sediments accumulated on the edge of a glacier which tends to become unstable as the glacier recedes richardson and reynolds 2000 hu et al 2019 once a landslide occurs in the high mountainous region covered by glaciers a mass of rocks soils and ice will slide together along the slope which may eventually accumulate in the river and form a landslide dam with rock soil ice mixtures except for the ice from the landslide source area additional ice can be scraped and gathered from ice rich permafrost ice soil sediments and ice crystals along the entrainment process many landslide dams have been found to contain considerable amounts of ice by field investigations such as the 2000 yigong landslide dam 2018 baige landslide dam etc e g plafker and ericksen 1978 shang et al 2003 huggel et al 2005 delaney and evans 2008 bretwood et al 2018 walter et al 2020 fig 1 shows three landslides occurred at the xiaoma gully anemaqen in 2004 2007 and 2016 respectively all of which were induced by ice avalanches the anemaqen is located in the southeast of qinghai province china which has an average altitude of 5000 6000 m and is covered with eternal snow the largest and most serious ice avalanches occurred in feb 2004 which triggered a huge glacial debris flow from an elevation of 5900 m the fan shaped glacial debris flow finally rushed into the qinglonggou and formed a landslide dam consisted of ice 70 80 rock debris and rich frozen soil yin 2007 notably differential settlement of the landslide dam was found 3 8 months later and the maximum subsidence could even reach 11 1 m zhang et al 2019a such significant settlement is considered to be caused by ice melting and the landslide dam finally burst in july 2005 recently a catastrophic mass flow occurred at chamoli indian himalaya on 7 feb 2021 which was triggered by a massive rock and ice avalanche it caused over 200 people dead or missing and severely damaged two hydropower projects by geodetic analysis and glacier thickness inversions it was found that the collapsed mass comprised about 80 rock and 20 glacier ice by volume respectively shugar et al 2021 the physical and mechanical properties of the landslide dam containing ice are different from that purely composed of rocks and soils the melting of ice may decrease soil strength by saturating reduce erodibility of the dam material and form a more porous dam structure significantly differential settlement can also be caused by ice melting leading to a sudden and instantaneity dam burst such unexpected dam failures may result in a shorter rescue time and pose greater threats to the downstream residents evans et al 2021 shugar et al 2021 presently most of the research on the landslide dam only focused on the dam material composed of rocks and soils which studied the formation and stability of the dam with different initiation mechanisms e g begam et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b chen et al 2020b fan et al 2020b shen et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 simulations of the subsequent flood routing have been also conducted based on the results of dam break with rock soil accumulations however research on the landslide dam containing ice has not been carried out yet the appearance of ice in a landslide dam may introduce more complicated mechanisms of overtopping and flood routing which are of great importance to be investigated therefore in this study effects of different amounts of ice fractions on dam overtopping and flood routing process are carefully investigated which includes changes in the dam erodibility the dam geometry the breach development the final breach size the breach duration and the process of downstream flood routing etc the outcome of this research will advance our understanding of overtopping and flood routing process for the landslide dam containing ice and provide scientific evidence for risk assessment and disaster control of glacial collapse chain hazards 2 spatial variability of landslide dam materials a landslide dam is the result of a landslide of any form whose runout and interaction with local topography allows its deposits to form a barrier that can hold back water above the normal water level fan et al 2020a different types of landslides significantly affect the composition geometry and longevity of the landslide dam for example landslide dams formed by pyroclastic density currents normally composed of mixtures of fine clasts which are highly erodible and susceptible to a quick burst after formation however landslide dams originated by rock avalanches or rock falls after short travel paths are usually composed of large boulders and blocks which have high erosion resistance and can maintain stable for long periods once a landslide dam is formed it may lead to serious consequences making the assessment of landslide dam stability crucial the stability of landslide dams is closely related to the composition and geotechnical properties of the dam material as shown in table1 the material properties of landslide dams vary significantly along the dam height due to different internal structures induced by different formation mechanisms such as void ratio gradation friction angle cohesion etc according to the dam composition and the sedimentological structure landslide dams can be generally classified into three types fan et al 2017 fan et al 2020a type ⅰ landslide dams formed by debris flows or avalanches with long transport paths which have no obvious structural characteristics and are composed of loose debris with high erosion sensitivity type ⅱ landslide dams consist of large boulders and blocks by rock avalanches or rock falls which have an internal structure of large blocks at the top and highly fragmented debris below type iii landslide dams originated from deep seated rock slides which have a two layered internal structure formed by intact strata at the base and fragmented rocks and debris on top it can be found that material characteristics differ greatly for different types of landslide dams and even for a certain landslide dam the material properties vary obviously along the dam height thus it is essential to consider the spatial variability of material properties of a landslide dam when assessing the dam stability and predicting the dam breach process 3 landslide dam materials containing ice previous research on the composition characteristics of landslide dams only focused on rock soil accumulations which ignored the possibility of the existence of ice however recently more glacier related debris flows landslides icefalls and ice avalanches are likely to occur as mountain glaciers continue to shrink and alpine permafrost thaws due to atmospheric warming korup and tweed 2007 huggel et al 2012 fischer et al 2013 wu et al 2019 sattar et al 2021 large quantities of poorly consolidated and unvegetated sediments are exposed by glacier retreat which are easily mobilized together with bulks of ice by precipitation and tectonic activities and deposited in rivers to form landslide dams of rock soil ice mixtures in this study glacier related landslides and debris flows worldwide are collected as shown in table 2 most of which are found to further form landslide dams and block rivers with large runoff posing great threats to downstream residents and infrastructures though large quantities of ice derived from glacier avalanches and icefalls may be disintegrated broken up and melted during a long distance traveling process there are still considerable amounts of ice left in landslide dams it can be found that the volumetric ice content of the landslide dam can even up to 95 and 70 80 corresponding to the karmadon landslide dam and the animaqin landslide dam respectively except for the ice from the source of glacier regions additional ice contents can be gathered from frozen soils ice soil sediments and ice crystals along the entrainment process the appearance of ice can play an important role in the breach time and breach mechanism of a landslide dam table 3 illustrates some possible scenarios of the dam breaching process that may be influenced by ice in the first scenario the ice can be broken into small pieces after a long traveling distance and is loosely distributed within the dam thus relatively uniform dam settlement can be induced by gradually ice melting and results in an earlier overtopping of the landslide dam in the second scenario large ice blocks may exist in the landslide dam deposits by icefalls and ice avalanches which can induce significant dam subsidence more rapidly in the third scenario ice appears in a wide size range and local cavitation may be caused by a quicker thaw of smaller ice blocks which may cause weak zones inside the dam and lead to internal erosion or local instability of the landslide dam meanwhile the melting time of ice of different sizes differs obviously which can result in the differential settlement of a landslide dam in the fourth scenario ice particles are non uniformly distributed within the dam after highly fragmentation the melting of ice may promote the possibility of passage connection inside the dam which makes the dam more susceptible to internal erosion therefore it can be found that once ice exists in a landslide dam significant settlement and local internal erosion may be induced by ice melting resulting in an earlier overtopping or a sudden failure of the dam which should be seriously considered for making an appropriate plan of warning and evacuation of downstream residents in this study the 2018 gyalha landslide dam is taken as an example to investigate effects of ice on the dam overtopping and flood routing process the gyalha landslide occurred on 17 october 2018 which was located near the gyalha village in the sedongpu basin southeastern tibet of china it dammed the main cause of the yarlung tsangpo and caused a landslide barrier lake dam breach outburst flooding disaster chain tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 based on the benchmark of the gyalha landslide dam different volumetric ice contents in the dam deposit are assumed in this study and effects of ice fractions on the dam breach and outburst flood are investigated 4 characteristics of the gyalha landslide dam 4 1 the dam composition at about 5 00 am on 17 october 2018 a landslide occurred near the gyalha village in the sedongpu basin the sedongpu basin 29 47 7 20 94 55 24 is located at about 55 km to the east of nyingchi city on the left bank of yarlung tsangpo under the south slope of the gyalha peri peak 7294 m which is under the jurisdiction of milin county the sedongpu basin is in the plateau temperate sub humid monsoon climate zone the temperature of the study area has shown a gradually rising tendency with a ratio of 0 321 10a sun and su 2020 the highest average temperature is 15 2 which appears in the flood season from june to september liu et al 2019 the temperature rising in the sedongpu basin has directly led to an acceleration of glacial retreat and a more frequent occurrence of ice avalanche hazards jia et al 2019 in 1977 the sedongpu basin was covered by integrated glaciers with a total area of 34 47 km2 tong et al 2018 however the overall areas of temperate glaciers decreased significantly to 18 8 km2 by 2018 with a severe retreat rate of 45 46 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 with a sharp rising of ice melting lines temperate glaciers became fragmented and more large ice fissures and cracks appear on the glacier surface leading to instability of ice bodies wu et al 2019 particularly for the sedongpu basin with 12 well developed branches of glaciers are highly susceptible to occur glacier debris flows when subjected to intensive rainfalls snowmelt and earthquakes hu et al 2019 the 2018 gyalha landslide dam is caused by the collapse of a branch of glaciers in the sedongpu basin with a volume of approximately 20 million m3 tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the colluvium of massive ice traveled with soils and rocks which marched about 8 km into the yarlung tsangpo and formed the landslide dam 4 2 geological characteristics of the gyalha landslide the sedongpu basin has a special steep gentle relatively steep terrain tong et al 2018 substantial loose deposits accumulated in the middle flat part of the basin liu et al 2019 rocks in the basin are fragmented and unstable due to strong tectonic stress and high uplift and exfoliation rate of the himalaya orogenic belt hu et al 2019 thus sliding of depositions and collapse of unstable rocks are prone to occur due to additional water infiltration by ice melting rainfall and freeze thaw weathering the gyalha landslide is believed to be triggered by an ice avalanche tong et al 2018 hu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 and the landslide dam is composed of loose gravel soils with noticeable ice content the gyalha landslide dam is about 40 60 million m3 in volume 2 3 km in length 310 620 m in width and 70 90 m in height the bottom and the crest elevation of the dam are about 2758 m and 2837 m respectively geotechnical properties of a landslide dam material play an important role in the initiation and development of dam breaching however timely field survey is hard to conduct due to difficult access to remote mountainous areas material properties of other similar landslide dams are usually referred for rapid dam breaching prediction in this study the gyalha landslide material is benchmarked against the 2000 yigong landslide material and the 2008 tangjiashan landslide material the yigong landslide occurred in 2000 was similarly triggered by an ice avalanche and traveled a long distance of about 8 km which eventually blocked the yigong tsangpo the secondary tributary of the yarlung tsangpo and formed a landslide dam 48 km northeast of the gyalha landslide dam rock fragmented during the high speed and long distance sliding process leading to depositions of loosely fine debris with a high erodibility which can be used as a reference for materials in the upper part of the gyalha landslide dam since landslide dams usually perform a structural characteristic of upper fine particles and lower coarse particles e g cui et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 fan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b fan et al 2020a the 2008 tangjiashan landslide material is used as a benchmark for the lower part of the gyalha landslide dam material the tangjiashan landslide was triggered by a rock avalanche with a short travel distance of about 380 m forming a landslide dam of incompletely disintegrated rocks with a relatively low erodibility cui et al 2009 hu et al 2009 detailed information of materials of the two benchmark landslide dams are shown in fig 2 chang 2012 hu et al 2015 kang et al 2016 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2017 with references to the yigong and the tangjiashan landslide materials the materials of the gyalha landslide dam can be divided into four layers from the top to bottom loose sand gravel soils 0 9 m gravel soils with little crushed gravels 9 17 m strongly weathered rocks with crushed gravels 17 60 m and cataclastic rocks 60 79 m 4 3 hydrological characteristics of the gyalha barrier lake after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam the water level behind rose rapidly with an inflow rate of 2200 m3 s jin 2019 until 7 00 am on 19 october the water level rose by 75 m high with an approximately huge lake capacity of 550 million m3 xinhuanet 2018b xinhuanet 2018a the backwater was 26 km long which submerged the access of the gyalha village and threatened farther villages upstream chen et al 2020 the relation between the lake surface elevation and the lake capacity can be referred to fig 3 at 13 30 on 19 october the gyalha landslide dam naturally overtopped with an estimated maximum outburst flow of 32000 m3 s jia et al 2019 the flood front arrived in medog county 8 h later at 21 30 which is 168 km downstream of the dam site according to records of the dexing hydrological station in medog county the measured peak discharge and water level rise were 23 400 m3 s and 19 76 m respectively at 23 40 on 19 october the water level eventually returned to normal level at 16 00 on 20 october the formation of the gyalha landslide dam posed a great threat to the safety of people and property 20 000 people were affected either by upstream inundation or downstream flooding chen et al 2020a 5 effects of ice on dam erodibility 5 1 the erodibility of landslide dam materials the erosion process of a landslide dam due to overtopping is mostly controlled by the erodibility of the landslide deposits chang and zhang 2010 overtopping of a landslide dam is an interactive process between water flow and the landslide deposits a shear stress equation is widely employed to estimate soil erosion rate hanson and simon 2001 zhang et al 2019b 1 e k d τ τ c where e is the soil erosion rate kd is the coefficient of erodibility τ is the shear stress at the soil water interface and τc is the critical shear stress at the initiation of soil erosion the critical shear stress τc reflects how easy erosion of the soil can be initiated while the coefficient of erodibility kd represents how fast the soil can be eroded two empirical equations for estimating kd and τc based on widely graded landslide deposits are proposed chang and zhang 2010 2 k d 20075 e 4 77 c u 0 76 3 τ c 6 8 pi 1 68 p 1 73 e 0 97 where e is the void ratio cu is the coefficient of uniformity pi is the plasticity index and p is the fines content 0 063 mm equation 3 is only suitable for deposits composed of significant fines contents 10 when the fines content is smaller than 10 another formula is recommended annandale 2006 4 τ c 2 3 g d 50 ρ s ρ w tan ϕ where g is the gravitational acceleration ρs is the mass density of soil ρw is the mass density of water φ is the friction angle and d50 is the mean particle size as mentioned above in the section of 4 2 the distributions of kd and τc along the depth of the upper part i e the first two soil layers from the dam crest of the gyalha landslide dam can be referred to the materials of the yigong landslide dam while the lower part that was not fully disintegrated can be referred to the tangjiashan landslide dam for the gyalha landslide dam the ratio of rock and soil is about 8 2 reported by liu et al 2019 which is in a range of 6 4 7 3 found by cai et al 2019 the observed grain size distributions of the gyalha landslide dam are in the range of the benchmark yigong landslide materials with the known bulk density 1 845 g cm3 specific gravity 2 718 and friction angle 37 of the benchmark yigong landslide dam hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016b the kd and τc along the depth of the gyalha landslide dam can be obtained by using eq 1 to 4 fig 4 5 2 the erodibility of dam materials with ice from table 2 it can be found that the volumetric ice content of some ice containing debris flows varies greatly from 5 to 95 in this study the volumetric ice content that remains in the landslide dam deposit after sliding is adopted as 5 10 15 and 20 respectively the gyalha landslide was induced by an ice avalanche which marched a long distance of 8 km rocks soils and ices were supposed to be highly broken and well mixed after such a long distance sliding depositing in the yarlung tsangpo relatively uniform which is similar to the first scenario proposed in this paper table 3 after disintegration and melting during a long traveling process the typical sizes of the remained ice in the landslide deposition range from 5 to 20 mm schneider et al 2011 yang et al 2015 which is adopted as the size range of ice particles in this paper moreover landslides are normally originated from alpine regions of high altitudes and deposited in river channels of relatively lower altitudes the elevation difference between the source and the deposition zone of the gyalha landslide is about 3200 m with a thermal gradient of about 0 6 100 m the temperature difference can be large as about 19 2 thus with such a significant temperature rising in this study the ice in the gyalha landslide is assumed to completely melt before the dam overtopping consequently material properties of the gyalha landslide dam will change in response to the ice melt such as the median particle size d50 the coefficient of uniformity cu and the void ratio e void ratio has been proved to be the key factor determining the erodibility of dam materials based on sensitivity analysis shi et al 2015 after ice melting the decrease of ice volume equals to the increase of pore volume thus the void ratio e can be obtained as 5 e v void v soil v void v ice v soil v ice e 0 v soil n v soil v soil n v soil e 0 n 1 n where e0 is the initial void ratio e0 vvoid vsoil vvoid vsoil are the initial void volume and the initial soil volume v void v soil are the void volume and soil volume after ice melting n is the volumetric ice content which corresponds to 5 10 15 and 20 in this study detailed changes in soil properties after melting of different volumetric ice contents are summarized in table 4 as shown in table 4 the void ratio increases obviously after ice melting the larger amount of ice melts the larger increase of void ratio is when the ice content is as large as 20 the corresponding void ratio of the top layer can even reach 1 29 increased by 55 4 compared to the benchmark void ratio of 0 83 after ice melting a looser and more porous structure may be formed indicating that the landslide dam may be more susceptible to erosion changes of kd and τc along the depth of the gyalha landslide dam are shown in table 4 and fig 4 generally it can be found that the coefficient of soil erodibility kd significantly increases with increasing ice melt with 20 of ice melts the kd of the first layer of the landslide dam can even increase by an order of magnitude from 2592 benchmark to 25862 indicating a dramatic increase of soil erodibility however changes of soil critical erosive shear stress τc are not that obvious due to less dependence on the void ratio 6 effects of ice melt on the landslide dam geometry the melt of ice in soil can induce significant settlement and lead to instability of the earthen structure the degree of thaw settlement of soils can be quantified by the thaw settlement coefficient ao which is defined as the ratio of the settlement induced by ice melt to the initial height thaw settlement of soils induced by ice melting is significantly affected by factors such as the soil type dry density water content etc lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019c table 5 shows thaw settlement coefficients of some typical soil types with various water contents liu et al 2015 cao et al 2020 according to previous surveys e g scott et al 2005 zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2015 cao et al 2020 the initial water content of w0 17 5 is adopted for the gyalha landslide dam in this study the water content w after ice melting can be estimated as 6 w m water m soil m water m ice m soil m ice w 0 m soil ρ ice v ice m soil ρ ice v ice where mwater msoil are the initial water mass and soil mass respectively m water m soil are the water mass and soil mass after ice melting respectively mice is the ice mass vice is the ice volume w0 is the initial moisture content which is constant as 17 5 ρice is the density of the ice which is constant as 917 kg m3 the material properties vary greatly along the landslide dam height where large and integrated rocks are usually deposited at the bottom but fine soils are loosely accumulated at the dam top in this study the gyalha landslide dam is divided into four layers by considering the spatial variability of dam materials from table 2 it can be found that even for a certain soil layer the soil type varies thus the weighted thaw settlement coefficient ɑ is introduced to reasonably assess the thaw settlement induced by different proportions of rock soil mixtures table 6 shows the weighted thaw settlement coefficient ɑ of each soil layer of the gyalha landslide dam according to grain size distributions the bottom layer which is mainly composed of the bedrock is not included due to its minimal thawing settlement jin 2018 thus the total thaw settlement δh and the total thaw settlement coefficient ɑtotal of the landslide dam can be obtained by eqs 7 and 8 7 δ h a 1 h 1 a 2 h 2 a 3 h 3 8 a total δ h h a 1 h 1 a 2 h 2 a 3 h 3 h 1 h 2 h 3 as shown in table 7 the total thaw settlement of the gyalha landslide dam increases significantly with the increasing ice content the maximum thaw settlement can reach 6 02 m with an initial volumetric ice content of 20 and the minimum thaw settlement is 1 75 m corresponds to an ice content of 5 ice melting can directly lead to a reduction of dam height with a considerable dam settlement and a quicker rising of the upstream impoundment the landslide dam may be overtopped earlier and unexpected which shortens the rescue time and may cause catastrophic consequences 7 modeling of barrier lake bursting and flood routing process a physically based breach model daba chang and zhang 2010 and hec ras program developed by usace are integrated to simulate the dam breaching and the subsequent flood routing process respectively the input parameters for dam breach and flood routing of the gyalha landslide dam with different ice volumetric contents are shown in table 8 7 1 daba breaching model the water soil interaction in daba is simulated by erosion and shallow water flow theory the model has some advantages compared with other models e g dambrk breach beed 1 the variations in soil erodibility with depth can be taken into account 2 the steepening process of the landslide dam can be considered and 3 the final size of the breach does not need to be assumed the daba model has been employed to successfully simulate the dam breach of the tangjiashan xiaogangjian and baige landslide dams resulting in good agreements with observations chang and zhang 2010 fan et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b the entire breach process can be divided into the initiation phase and the breach development phase by a signal of sharp increase of flow rate the two phases correspond to different enlargement stages of the dam cross section and the longitudinal section respectively as shown in fig 5 a on the cross section fig 5b in the first stage erosion occurs downward and sideward until the bank slopes reach a critical value αc which can be determined by a slope stability analysis and during this process the width of breach top keeps constant then in stage ii the breach expands both in width and depth sharply while keeping the bank slope angles as αc this process involves a rapid cutting and expansion of the breach size which will be stopped when the flow meets low erodibility soil layers or bedrocks at the channel bed or the banksides then in stage iii either the horizontal erosion continues when the erosive stress caused by flow is insufficient to cause vertical erosion or undercutting develops when the horizontal erosion is stopped by low erodible bank slopes on the longitudinal section fig 5c in stage i the water flow cuts the toe of the downstream slope until it reaches a limit angle of βf then the downstream slope erodes sharply while maintaining the slope angle constant at βf this process continues until the downstream slope eventually meets the upstream slope then the breach process comes to stage iii the breach of the downstream slope develops dramatically with a sharp decrease of the dam crest elevation and a rapid increase of the outflow rate in this study the inflow rate of 2222 m3 s is adopted as an input parameter of the daba model which is calculated from the rise of the upstream water level of about 8 106 m3 h jin 2019 7 2 hec ras flood routing model the hec ras computational procedure for unsteady flow is based on the one dimensional saint venant equations for the conservation of mass and momentum sholtes and doyle 2011 lei et al 2019 9 q x a t 0 10 q t q 2 a x g a h x s 0 s f 0 where q is the flow rate x is the distance along the channel bed a is the cross sectional area t is time g is the gravitational acceleration h is the flow depth s0 is the bed slope and sf is the friction slope which can be calculated by using chezy and manning s formulas as 11 s f q 2 n 2 r 4 3 a 2 where n is manning s coefficient of the roughness of the cross section and r is the hydraulic radius of the cross section for mountain streams with steep banks if the riverbed is primarily covered with cobbles and large boulders but no vegetation the manning s n value ranges from 0 04 to 0 07 in this study the n value for the channel bed is adopted as 0 06 for riverbanks the n value is assumed to be 0 12 which is in the range of the recommended n values for the riverbanks with medium intensity of vegetation and constructed materials usace 2016 the length of the study river reach is 460 km from the gyalha landslide dam site to the downstream pasighat village fig 6 the study river reach is divided into two sections according to the changeable terrain with large elevation differences in the first river reach the water elevation changes from 2742 m to 1800 m with a river length of 110 km and a large water level drop of 8 6 m km therefore cross sections in this reach are densely set at a small interval of 0 05 km in the second river reach the elevation changes from 1800 m to 150 m with a river length of 370 km corresponding to a smaller water level drop of 4 5 m km thus cross sections are set at a relatively larger interval of 1 km finally a total of 2570 cross sections are determined along the river reach 8 effects of ice melting on the dam breach process in this study the gyalha landslide dam material with different ice fractions is studied to investigate effects of ice on dam breach and flood routing process a detailed analysis of breach time peak flow peak arrival time breach development etc is conducted which is crucial for risk assessment and emergency rescue 8 1 peak flow and peak arrival time after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam the water level of the barrier lake increased at a speed of 0 6 1 0 m h xinhuanet 2018b and the gyalha landslide dam overtopped naturally at 13 30 on 19 october 2018 however if a significantly initial ice amount in the dam deposit is considered the dam overtopping will occur earlier due to a decrease of dam height induced by thawing settlement the rising speed of the barrier lake is adopted as the average rate of water level increase by 0 8 m h the reduction of landslide dam height due to ice melting is 1 75 m vice 5 2 71 m vice 10 3 53 m vice 15 and 6 02 m vice 20 corresponding to an earlier natural overtopping time of 11 20 am 10 10 am 9 10 am and 6 00 am respectively it can be found that the thawing settlement has a great influence on the dam s naturally overtopping time the melting of a small ice content of 5 can cause the dam to burst about 2 2 h earlier when the ice content increases as large as 20 the dam breach time can even be brought forward 7 5 h earlier which significantly accelerates the initiation of dam overtopping such sudden and unexpected dam breaks significantly shorten the rescue time posing a great threat to the downstream residents the hydrographs at the dam site considering the dam material with different ice fractions by using the daba model are shown in fig 7 it can be found that the simulated peak discharge and peak arrival time are 31 685 m3 s and 23 51 for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam which is in good correspondence with the observed peak flow of 32000 m3 s and the observed arrival time of 23 40 on 19 october the difference in the peak flow rate is only 2 25 and the time difference is only 11 min however the peak flow rate at the dam site performs a remarkable increasing trend with increasing initial ice content in the dam composition when the ice content is as small as 5 the corresponding peak flow rate only slightly increases from 32 000 m3 s to 36 813 m3 s whereas the exaggerated peak flow of 86 182 m3 s occurs with a large ice content of 20 which is almost three times larger than the benchmark this dramatically large outburst flow caused by ice melting nearly catches up to the overtopping flow of the yigong landslide dam in 2000 which is 94 013 m3 s and believed to be the largest flood in the recent 100 years delaney and evans 2015 wang et al 2016b 8 2 breach development table 9 presents the breaching process of the gyalha landslide dam with different ice fractions it can be found that the total breach time for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam is 25 h with an initiation duration of about 3 8 h and a development duration of about 21 2 h when there is a small ice content of 5 the time for the whole breach progression only reduces slightly to 23 3 h with an initiation time of 1 8 h and a development time of 21 5 h respectively nevertheless when the ice amount in the dam increases largely to 20 the whole breach process is significantly shortened to 8 3 h which is only about 1 4 of the breach duration for the condition of the benchmark with such a great ice amount the initiation process only takes 0 4 h and the breach size expands rapidly and transits to the development phase quickly the reason for the quicker overtopping process of the landslide dam with ice components is because that the ice changes the erodibility of the landslide dam significantly as shown in table 4 and fig 4 with the increasing amount of ice the soil coefficient of erodibility kd increases whereas the soil critical erosive shear stress τc decreases leading to an easier initiation of dam break and a quicker overtopping process the increase of soil erodibility is particularly large for the top soil layer with 5 of ice content the kd increases about 1 86 times larger than the benchmark and when the ice content reaches 20 the kd is even tenfold greater additionally the melting of ice also causes an absolute increase of the void ratio of the landslide dam which results in loosely formed high erodible dam materials and leads to a faster breach process the geometry of the final breach size with different amounts of ice components in the landslide dam is shown in fig 8 the breach size becomes larger and expands in both horizontal and vertical directions with increasing ice contents for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam the top width and bottom width of the final breach are 280 5 m and 137 6 m respectively however the final breach size develops greater for the dam with 20 of ice which enlarges approximately 1 6 times and 2 3 times in the final top and bottom widths respectively in the vertical direction the breach process develops to about 90 of the initial dam height in all the conditions which is consistent with the finding that a breach typically develops to a depth of 50 to 100 of the total dam height walder and o connor 1997 the erodibility of dam materials decreases with dam depth which leads to more erosion in the lateral direction and results in a relatively slight breach depth but a large top and bottom width peng and zhang 2011 9 characteristics of the flood routing affected by ice melting the flood resulting from overtopping may cause catastrophic consequences for downstream residents in this study three major towns i e dexing tuting and pasighat in downstream of the gyalha landslide dam site are selected to analyze the flood routing characteristics fig 6 fig 9 illustrates the attenuation of the peak discharge along the river it obviously shows that both the peak flow rate and the corresponding arrival time are significantly affected by ice with increasing ice amount in the dam the subsequent flood induced by overtopping becomes larger and the peak arrival time comes earlier for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam the peak flow rate decreases from 36 793 m3 s to 11 032 m3 s from the dam site to the downstream pasighat by 19 11 october 20 whereas when the deposition of the landslide dam has the maximum ice fraction of vice 20 the flood attenuation is larger and quicker which decreases sharply from 86 182 m3 s to 12 277 m3 s from the dam site to the pasighat by 04 51 october 20 about 12 5 h in advance than the benchmark fig 10 intuitively illustrates the flood routing process of the landslide dam with different fractions of ice it can be found that at the same location along the river reach the peak flow rate increases with the increasing initial ice content and the corresponding arrival time comes earlier with the flood routing process along the 460 km river reach the peak discharge attenuates more sharply when the landslide dam contains a larger ice fraction when the landslide dam has the maximum ice content of 20 the flood peak decreases by 86 from the dam site to the pasighat with a transfer time of about 21 5 h for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam the peak flood reduces by 70 and the flooding process lasts for about 24 h the induced flood by overtopping is obviously larger when the landslide dam contains a significantly initial ice fraction and the corresponding flood peak arrival time comes earlier however the total duration of the flood routing is only slightly shortened with the increasing ice amount 10 conclusions with global warming a large number of glacier detachments and ice rock avalanches occurred more frequently worldwide with a detached volume of ice and rocks ranging from a few up 106 m3 to 100 106 m3 such cryospheric hazards may further induce chain disasters of glacial debris flow landslide barrier lake flood burst posing a great threat to people and infrastructures in alpine regions however most of the current studies have been carried out on the causes and mechanisms of large scale glacier detachments the dynamic behavior of the mass flow of ice rock mixtures and the relations between climate change and glacier activities there is a lack of study on the overtopping and flood routing process of landslide dams caused by glacier related hazards which may contain considerable amounts of ice such landslide dams will behave differently from that composed of pure earth materials whose performance needs to be urgently studied and becomes a new problem in hazard assessment in cold mountainous areas in this paper the effects of different ice amounts on landslide dam overtopping and flood routing process are studied for the first time in response to the ice melt the erodibility and geometry of the landslide dam will change accordingly the soil coefficient of erodibility kd and void ratio e increases significantly with increasing ice melt whereas the critical soil erosive shear stress τc decreases slightly which indicates a more erodible dam material in addition the ice melt can also induce a great settlement thus leading to a reduction of the dam height with a quick rising of the upstream impoundment the landslide dam will be overtopped earlier and the rescue time will be shortened once the landslide dam breaches it can be found that the overtopping process develops more rapidly with a larger initial ice amount and the breach size expands greater both horizontally and vertically along the river reach the flood induced by overtopping becomes larger and the peak arrival time comes earlier with the increasing initial ice amount the attenuation of flood is quicker and larger when the initial ice amount in the landslide dam is significant this study aims to draw attention to the landslide dam containing ice which is the secondary disaster induced by glacial related hazards and can be found worldwide with the increasing temperature a preliminary investigation is conducted in this study based on some simplified assumptions for instance the ice melt is more likely to cause differential settlements of dams rather than the uniform settlement that is simulated in this study and such uneven settlements or local deformations need to be further investigated in the future field investigations and physical modeling experiments also need to be conducted which can provide accurate data of dam materials and give new insights into the failure mechanism of landslide dams containing ice credit authorship contribution statement chen chen conceptualization methodology funding acquisition

3848,with global warming glacial collapse chain disasters have frequently occurred in high mountain areas in particular the ice avalanche glacial debris flow landslide barrier lake flood burst chain disaster caused the most serious consequences different from the general landslide dam consisted of rocks and soils the landslide dam initiated by ice avalanches contains a considerable amount of ice the appearance of ice will influence the overall performance of the landslide dam by melting which may cause differential settlements local weak zones a more porous structure and a lower erosion resistance of the landslide dam such changes in the erodibility and geometry of the landslide dam will further affect the dam overtopping and flood routing process which have not been investigated yet and urgently require further study therefore in this study a preliminary study of the effects of different ice fractions of the landslide dam is conducted which mainly involves changes in the dam erodibility the dam geometry the overtopping development the final breach size the process of downstream flood routing etc results show that with the increasing amount of ice melting the coefficient of soil erodibility and the soil void ratio increase significantly implying a more erodible dam material and a looser dam structure the melting of ice can also induce obvious dam settlement which further results in an earlier dam burst and a shorter rescue time with the increasing initial ice amount in the landslide dam the overtopping process develops more rapidly the breach expands greater both horizontally and vertically the subsequent flood becomes larger and the peak arrival time comes earlier keywords ice avalanche landslide landslide dam ice soil accumulation barrier lake dam breaching flood routing 1 introduction landslides can be triggered by rainfalls earthquakes snowmelt freeze thaw cycles which frequently occur in mountainous areas iverson 2000 laimer 2017 tong et al 2018 balzano et al 2019 serey et al 2019 a large landslide dam can be formed by a landslide with any initiations which often leads to a more serious consequence to people and infrastructures than the landslide itself by inundating upstream and potentially flooding downstream areas groeber 1916 burt and allison 2010 penna et al 2013 in the past decades massive glaciers are retreating in alpine regions by global warming and glacier related hazards have been rising both in scale and frequency the glacial melting has been identified as one of the main triggers of landslide activity in high mountain areas which changes precipitation patterns by supplying plentiful meltwater saturates depositions on hillsides and increases the hydrostatic pressure of the slope leading to a reduction of slope strength and a higher occurrence of the slope instability korup and tweed 2007 ren et al 2020 the glacier retreat and permafrost degradation have also provided abundant sources of poorly consolidated and unvegetated sediments for landslides especially for the sediments accumulated on the edge of a glacier which tends to become unstable as the glacier recedes richardson and reynolds 2000 hu et al 2019 once a landslide occurs in the high mountainous region covered by glaciers a mass of rocks soils and ice will slide together along the slope which may eventually accumulate in the river and form a landslide dam with rock soil ice mixtures except for the ice from the landslide source area additional ice can be scraped and gathered from ice rich permafrost ice soil sediments and ice crystals along the entrainment process many landslide dams have been found to contain considerable amounts of ice by field investigations such as the 2000 yigong landslide dam 2018 baige landslide dam etc e g plafker and ericksen 1978 shang et al 2003 huggel et al 2005 delaney and evans 2008 bretwood et al 2018 walter et al 2020 fig 1 shows three landslides occurred at the xiaoma gully anemaqen in 2004 2007 and 2016 respectively all of which were induced by ice avalanches the anemaqen is located in the southeast of qinghai province china which has an average altitude of 5000 6000 m and is covered with eternal snow the largest and most serious ice avalanches occurred in feb 2004 which triggered a huge glacial debris flow from an elevation of 5900 m the fan shaped glacial debris flow finally rushed into the qinglonggou and formed a landslide dam consisted of ice 70 80 rock debris and rich frozen soil yin 2007 notably differential settlement of the landslide dam was found 3 8 months later and the maximum subsidence could even reach 11 1 m zhang et al 2019a such significant settlement is considered to be caused by ice melting and the landslide dam finally burst in july 2005 recently a catastrophic mass flow occurred at chamoli indian himalaya on 7 feb 2021 which was triggered by a massive rock and ice avalanche it caused over 200 people dead or missing and severely damaged two hydropower projects by geodetic analysis and glacier thickness inversions it was found that the collapsed mass comprised about 80 rock and 20 glacier ice by volume respectively shugar et al 2021 the physical and mechanical properties of the landslide dam containing ice are different from that purely composed of rocks and soils the melting of ice may decrease soil strength by saturating reduce erodibility of the dam material and form a more porous dam structure significantly differential settlement can also be caused by ice melting leading to a sudden and instantaneity dam burst such unexpected dam failures may result in a shorter rescue time and pose greater threats to the downstream residents evans et al 2021 shugar et al 2021 presently most of the research on the landslide dam only focused on the dam material composed of rocks and soils which studied the formation and stability of the dam with different initiation mechanisms e g begam et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b chen et al 2020b fan et al 2020b shen et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 simulations of the subsequent flood routing have been also conducted based on the results of dam break with rock soil accumulations however research on the landslide dam containing ice has not been carried out yet the appearance of ice in a landslide dam may introduce more complicated mechanisms of overtopping and flood routing which are of great importance to be investigated therefore in this study effects of different amounts of ice fractions on dam overtopping and flood routing process are carefully investigated which includes changes in the dam erodibility the dam geometry the breach development the final breach size the breach duration and the process of downstream flood routing etc the outcome of this research will advance our understanding of overtopping and flood routing process for the landslide dam containing ice and provide scientific evidence for risk assessment and disaster control of glacial collapse chain hazards 2 spatial variability of landslide dam materials a landslide dam is the result of a landslide of any form whose runout and interaction with local topography allows its deposits to form a barrier that can hold back water above the normal water level fan et al 2020a different types of landslides significantly affect the composition geometry and longevity of the landslide dam for example landslide dams formed by pyroclastic density currents normally composed of mixtures of fine clasts which are highly erodible and susceptible to a quick burst after formation however landslide dams originated by rock avalanches or rock falls after short travel paths are usually composed of large boulders and blocks which have high erosion resistance and can maintain stable for long periods once a landslide dam is formed it may lead to serious consequences making the assessment of landslide dam stability crucial the stability of landslide dams is closely related to the composition and geotechnical properties of the dam material as shown in table1 the material properties of landslide dams vary significantly along the dam height due to different internal structures induced by different formation mechanisms such as void ratio gradation friction angle cohesion etc according to the dam composition and the sedimentological structure landslide dams can be generally classified into three types fan et al 2017 fan et al 2020a type ⅰ landslide dams formed by debris flows or avalanches with long transport paths which have no obvious structural characteristics and are composed of loose debris with high erosion sensitivity type ⅱ landslide dams consist of large boulders and blocks by rock avalanches or rock falls which have an internal structure of large blocks at the top and highly fragmented debris below type iii landslide dams originated from deep seated rock slides which have a two layered internal structure formed by intact strata at the base and fragmented rocks and debris on top it can be found that material characteristics differ greatly for different types of landslide dams and even for a certain landslide dam the material properties vary obviously along the dam height thus it is essential to consider the spatial variability of material properties of a landslide dam when assessing the dam stability and predicting the dam breach process 3 landslide dam materials containing ice previous research on the composition characteristics of landslide dams only focused on rock soil accumulations which ignored the possibility of the existence of ice however recently more glacier related debris flows landslides icefalls and ice avalanches are likely to occur as mountain glaciers continue to shrink and alpine permafrost thaws due to atmospheric warming korup and tweed 2007 huggel et al 2012 fischer et al 2013 wu et al 2019 sattar et al 2021 large quantities of poorly consolidated and unvegetated sediments are exposed by glacier retreat which are easily mobilized together with bulks of ice by precipitation and tectonic activities and deposited in rivers to form landslide dams of rock soil ice mixtures in this study glacier related landslides and debris flows worldwide are collected as shown in table 2 most of which are found to further form landslide dams and block rivers with large runoff posing great threats to downstream residents and infrastructures though large quantities of ice derived from glacier avalanches and icefalls may be disintegrated broken up and melted during a long distance traveling process there are still considerable amounts of ice left in landslide dams it can be found that the volumetric ice content of the landslide dam can even up to 95 and 70 80 corresponding to the karmadon landslide dam and the animaqin landslide dam respectively except for the ice from the source of glacier regions additional ice contents can be gathered from frozen soils ice soil sediments and ice crystals along the entrainment process the appearance of ice can play an important role in the breach time and breach mechanism of a landslide dam table 3 illustrates some possible scenarios of the dam breaching process that may be influenced by ice in the first scenario the ice can be broken into small pieces after a long traveling distance and is loosely distributed within the dam thus relatively uniform dam settlement can be induced by gradually ice melting and results in an earlier overtopping of the landslide dam in the second scenario large ice blocks may exist in the landslide dam deposits by icefalls and ice avalanches which can induce significant dam subsidence more rapidly in the third scenario ice appears in a wide size range and local cavitation may be caused by a quicker thaw of smaller ice blocks which may cause weak zones inside the dam and lead to internal erosion or local instability of the landslide dam meanwhile the melting time of ice of different sizes differs obviously which can result in the differential settlement of a landslide dam in the fourth scenario ice particles are non uniformly distributed within the dam after highly fragmentation the melting of ice may promote the possibility of passage connection inside the dam which makes the dam more susceptible to internal erosion therefore it can be found that once ice exists in a landslide dam significant settlement and local internal erosion may be induced by ice melting resulting in an earlier overtopping or a sudden failure of the dam which should be seriously considered for making an appropriate plan of warning and evacuation of downstream residents in this study the 2018 gyalha landslide dam is taken as an example to investigate effects of ice on the dam overtopping and flood routing process the gyalha landslide occurred on 17 october 2018 which was located near the gyalha village in the sedongpu basin southeastern tibet of china it dammed the main cause of the yarlung tsangpo and caused a landslide barrier lake dam breach outburst flooding disaster chain tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 based on the benchmark of the gyalha landslide dam different volumetric ice contents in the dam deposit are assumed in this study and effects of ice fractions on the dam breach and outburst flood are investigated 4 characteristics of the gyalha landslide dam 4 1 the dam composition at about 5 00 am on 17 october 2018 a landslide occurred near the gyalha village in the sedongpu basin the sedongpu basin 29 47 7 20 94 55 24 is located at about 55 km to the east of nyingchi city on the left bank of yarlung tsangpo under the south slope of the gyalha peri peak 7294 m which is under the jurisdiction of milin county the sedongpu basin is in the plateau temperate sub humid monsoon climate zone the temperature of the study area has shown a gradually rising tendency with a ratio of 0 321 10a sun and su 2020 the highest average temperature is 15 2 which appears in the flood season from june to september liu et al 2019 the temperature rising in the sedongpu basin has directly led to an acceleration of glacial retreat and a more frequent occurrence of ice avalanche hazards jia et al 2019 in 1977 the sedongpu basin was covered by integrated glaciers with a total area of 34 47 km2 tong et al 2018 however the overall areas of temperate glaciers decreased significantly to 18 8 km2 by 2018 with a severe retreat rate of 45 46 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 with a sharp rising of ice melting lines temperate glaciers became fragmented and more large ice fissures and cracks appear on the glacier surface leading to instability of ice bodies wu et al 2019 particularly for the sedongpu basin with 12 well developed branches of glaciers are highly susceptible to occur glacier debris flows when subjected to intensive rainfalls snowmelt and earthquakes hu et al 2019 the 2018 gyalha landslide dam is caused by the collapse of a branch of glaciers in the sedongpu basin with a volume of approximately 20 million m3 tong et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the colluvium of massive ice traveled with soils and rocks which marched about 8 km into the yarlung tsangpo and formed the landslide dam 4 2 geological characteristics of the gyalha landslide the sedongpu basin has a special steep gentle relatively steep terrain tong et al 2018 substantial loose deposits accumulated in the middle flat part of the basin liu et al 2019 rocks in the basin are fragmented and unstable due to strong tectonic stress and high uplift and exfoliation rate of the himalaya orogenic belt hu et al 2019 thus sliding of depositions and collapse of unstable rocks are prone to occur due to additional water infiltration by ice melting rainfall and freeze thaw weathering the gyalha landslide is believed to be triggered by an ice avalanche tong et al 2018 hu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 and the landslide dam is composed of loose gravel soils with noticeable ice content the gyalha landslide dam is about 40 60 million m3 in volume 2 3 km in length 310 620 m in width and 70 90 m in height the bottom and the crest elevation of the dam are about 2758 m and 2837 m respectively geotechnical properties of a landslide dam material play an important role in the initiation and development of dam breaching however timely field survey is hard to conduct due to difficult access to remote mountainous areas material properties of other similar landslide dams are usually referred for rapid dam breaching prediction in this study the gyalha landslide material is benchmarked against the 2000 yigong landslide material and the 2008 tangjiashan landslide material the yigong landslide occurred in 2000 was similarly triggered by an ice avalanche and traveled a long distance of about 8 km which eventually blocked the yigong tsangpo the secondary tributary of the yarlung tsangpo and formed a landslide dam 48 km northeast of the gyalha landslide dam rock fragmented during the high speed and long distance sliding process leading to depositions of loosely fine debris with a high erodibility which can be used as a reference for materials in the upper part of the gyalha landslide dam since landslide dams usually perform a structural characteristic of upper fine particles and lower coarse particles e g cui et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 fan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b fan et al 2020a the 2008 tangjiashan landslide material is used as a benchmark for the lower part of the gyalha landslide dam material the tangjiashan landslide was triggered by a rock avalanche with a short travel distance of about 380 m forming a landslide dam of incompletely disintegrated rocks with a relatively low erodibility cui et al 2009 hu et al 2009 detailed information of materials of the two benchmark landslide dams are shown in fig 2 chang 2012 hu et al 2015 kang et al 2016 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2017 with references to the yigong and the tangjiashan landslide materials the materials of the gyalha landslide dam can be divided into four layers from the top to bottom loose sand gravel soils 0 9 m gravel soils with little crushed gravels 9 17 m strongly weathered rocks with crushed gravels 17 60 m and cataclastic rocks 60 79 m 4 3 hydrological characteristics of the gyalha barrier lake after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam the water level behind rose rapidly with an inflow rate of 2200 m3 s jin 2019 until 7 00 am on 19 october the water level rose by 75 m high with an approximately huge lake capacity of 550 million m3 xinhuanet 2018b xinhuanet 2018a the backwater was 26 km long which submerged the access of the gyalha village and threatened farther villages upstream chen et al 2020 the relation between the lake surface elevation and the lake capacity can be referred to fig 3 at 13 30 on 19 october the gyalha landslide dam naturally overtopped with an estimated maximum outburst flow of 32000 m3 s jia et al 2019 the flood front arrived in medog county 8 h later at 21 30 which is 168 km downstream of the dam site according to records of the dexing hydrological station in medog county the measured peak discharge and water level rise were 23 400 m3 s and 19 76 m respectively at 23 40 on 19 october the water level eventually returned to normal level at 16 00 on 20 october the formation of the gyalha landslide dam posed a great threat to the safety of people and property 20 000 people were affected either by upstream inundation or downstream flooding chen et al 2020a 5 effects of ice on dam erodibility 5 1 the erodibility of landslide dam materials the erosion process of a landslide dam due to overtopping is mostly controlled by the erodibility of the landslide deposits chang and zhang 2010 overtopping of a landslide dam is an interactive process between water flow and the landslide deposits a shear stress equation is widely employed to estimate soil erosion rate hanson and simon 2001 zhang et al 2019b 1 e k d τ τ c where e is the soil erosion rate kd is the coefficient of erodibility τ is the shear stress at the soil water interface and τc is the critical shear stress at the initiation of soil erosion the critical shear stress τc reflects how easy erosion of the soil can be initiated while the coefficient of erodibility kd represents how fast the soil can be eroded two empirical equations for estimating kd and τc based on widely graded landslide deposits are proposed chang and zhang 2010 2 k d 20075 e 4 77 c u 0 76 3 τ c 6 8 pi 1 68 p 1 73 e 0 97 where e is the void ratio cu is the coefficient of uniformity pi is the plasticity index and p is the fines content 0 063 mm equation 3 is only suitable for deposits composed of significant fines contents 10 when the fines content is smaller than 10 another formula is recommended annandale 2006 4 τ c 2 3 g d 50 ρ s ρ w tan ϕ where g is the gravitational acceleration ρs is the mass density of soil ρw is the mass density of water φ is the friction angle and d50 is the mean particle size as mentioned above in the section of 4 2 the distributions of kd and τc along the depth of the upper part i e the first two soil layers from the dam crest of the gyalha landslide dam can be referred to the materials of the yigong landslide dam while the lower part that was not fully disintegrated can be referred to the tangjiashan landslide dam for the gyalha landslide dam the ratio of rock and soil is about 8 2 reported by liu et al 2019 which is in a range of 6 4 7 3 found by cai et al 2019 the observed grain size distributions of the gyalha landslide dam are in the range of the benchmark yigong landslide materials with the known bulk density 1 845 g cm3 specific gravity 2 718 and friction angle 37 of the benchmark yigong landslide dam hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016b the kd and τc along the depth of the gyalha landslide dam can be obtained by using eq 1 to 4 fig 4 5 2 the erodibility of dam materials with ice from table 2 it can be found that the volumetric ice content of some ice containing debris flows varies greatly from 5 to 95 in this study the volumetric ice content that remains in the landslide dam deposit after sliding is adopted as 5 10 15 and 20 respectively the gyalha landslide was induced by an ice avalanche which marched a long distance of 8 km rocks soils and ices were supposed to be highly broken and well mixed after such a long distance sliding depositing in the yarlung tsangpo relatively uniform which is similar to the first scenario proposed in this paper table 3 after disintegration and melting during a long traveling process the typical sizes of the remained ice in the landslide deposition range from 5 to 20 mm schneider et al 2011 yang et al 2015 which is adopted as the size range of ice particles in this paper moreover landslides are normally originated from alpine regions of high altitudes and deposited in river channels of relatively lower altitudes the elevation difference between the source and the deposition zone of the gyalha landslide is about 3200 m with a thermal gradient of about 0 6 100 m the temperature difference can be large as about 19 2 thus with such a significant temperature rising in this study the ice in the gyalha landslide is assumed to completely melt before the dam overtopping consequently material properties of the gyalha landslide dam will change in response to the ice melt such as the median particle size d50 the coefficient of uniformity cu and the void ratio e void ratio has been proved to be the key factor determining the erodibility of dam materials based on sensitivity analysis shi et al 2015 after ice melting the decrease of ice volume equals to the increase of pore volume thus the void ratio e can be obtained as 5 e v void v soil v void v ice v soil v ice e 0 v soil n v soil v soil n v soil e 0 n 1 n where e0 is the initial void ratio e0 vvoid vsoil vvoid vsoil are the initial void volume and the initial soil volume v void v soil are the void volume and soil volume after ice melting n is the volumetric ice content which corresponds to 5 10 15 and 20 in this study detailed changes in soil properties after melting of different volumetric ice contents are summarized in table 4 as shown in table 4 the void ratio increases obviously after ice melting the larger amount of ice melts the larger increase of void ratio is when the ice content is as large as 20 the corresponding void ratio of the top layer can even reach 1 29 increased by 55 4 compared to the benchmark void ratio of 0 83 after ice melting a looser and more porous structure may be formed indicating that the landslide dam may be more susceptible to erosion changes of kd and τc along the depth of the gyalha landslide dam are shown in table 4 and fig 4 generally it can be found that the coefficient of soil erodibility kd significantly increases with increasing ice melt with 20 of ice melts the kd of the first layer of the landslide dam can even increase by an order of magnitude from 2592 benchmark to 25862 indicating a dramatic increase of soil erodibility however changes of soil critical erosive shear stress τc are not that obvious due to less dependence on the void ratio 6 effects of ice melt on the landslide dam geometry the melt of ice in soil can induce significant settlement and lead to instability of the earthen structure the degree of thaw settlement of soils can be quantified by the thaw settlement coefficient ao which is defined as the ratio of the settlement induced by ice melt to the initial height thaw settlement of soils induced by ice melting is significantly affected by factors such as the soil type dry density water content etc lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019c table 5 shows thaw settlement coefficients of some typical soil types with various water contents liu et al 2015 cao et al 2020 according to previous surveys e g scott et al 2005 zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2015 cao et al 2020 the initial water content of w0 17 5 is adopted for the gyalha landslide dam in this study the water content w after ice melting can be estimated as 6 w m water m soil m water m ice m soil m ice w 0 m soil ρ ice v ice m soil ρ ice v ice where mwater msoil are the initial water mass and soil mass respectively m water m soil are the water mass and soil mass after ice melting respectively mice is the ice mass vice is the ice volume w0 is the initial moisture content which is constant as 17 5 ρice is the density of the ice which is constant as 917 kg m3 the material properties vary greatly along the landslide dam height where large and integrated rocks are usually deposited at the bottom but fine soils are loosely accumulated at the dam top in this study the gyalha landslide dam is divided into four layers by considering the spatial variability of dam materials from table 2 it can be found that even for a certain soil layer the soil type varies thus the weighted thaw settlement coefficient ɑ is introduced to reasonably assess the thaw settlement induced by different proportions of rock soil mixtures table 6 shows the weighted thaw settlement coefficient ɑ of each soil layer of the gyalha landslide dam according to grain size distributions the bottom layer which is mainly composed of the bedrock is not included due to its minimal thawing settlement jin 2018 thus the total thaw settlement δh and the total thaw settlement coefficient ɑtotal of the landslide dam can be obtained by eqs 7 and 8 7 δ h a 1 h 1 a 2 h 2 a 3 h 3 8 a total δ h h a 1 h 1 a 2 h 2 a 3 h 3 h 1 h 2 h 3 as shown in table 7 the total thaw settlement of the gyalha landslide dam increases significantly with the increasing ice content the maximum thaw settlement can reach 6 02 m with an initial volumetric ice content of 20 and the minimum thaw settlement is 1 75 m corresponds to an ice content of 5 ice melting can directly lead to a reduction of dam height with a considerable dam settlement and a quicker rising of the upstream impoundment the landslide dam may be overtopped earlier and unexpected which shortens the rescue time and may cause catastrophic consequences 7 modeling of barrier lake bursting and flood routing process a physically based breach model daba chang and zhang 2010 and hec ras program developed by usace are integrated to simulate the dam breaching and the subsequent flood routing process respectively the input parameters for dam breach and flood routing of the gyalha landslide dam with different ice volumetric contents are shown in table 8 7 1 daba breaching model the water soil interaction in daba is simulated by erosion and shallow water flow theory the model has some advantages compared with other models e g dambrk breach beed 1 the variations in soil erodibility with depth can be taken into account 2 the steepening process of the landslide dam can be considered and 3 the final size of the breach does not need to be assumed the daba model has been employed to successfully simulate the dam breach of the tangjiashan xiaogangjian and baige landslide dams resulting in good agreements with observations chang and zhang 2010 fan et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b the entire breach process can be divided into the initiation phase and the breach development phase by a signal of sharp increase of flow rate the two phases correspond to different enlargement stages of the dam cross section and the longitudinal section respectively as shown in fig 5 a on the cross section fig 5b in the first stage erosion occurs downward and sideward until the bank slopes reach a critical value αc which can be determined by a slope stability analysis and during this process the width of breach top keeps constant then in stage ii the breach expands both in width and depth sharply while keeping the bank slope angles as αc this process involves a rapid cutting and expansion of the breach size which will be stopped when the flow meets low erodibility soil layers or bedrocks at the channel bed or the banksides then in stage iii either the horizontal erosion continues when the erosive stress caused by flow is insufficient to cause vertical erosion or undercutting develops when the horizontal erosion is stopped by low erodible bank slopes on the longitudinal section fig 5c in stage i the water flow cuts the toe of the downstream slope until it reaches a limit angle of βf then the downstream slope erodes sharply while maintaining the slope angle constant at βf this process continues until the downstream slope eventually meets the upstream slope then the breach process comes to stage iii the breach of the downstream slope develops dramatically with a sharp decrease of the dam crest elevation and a rapid increase of the outflow rate in this study the inflow rate of 2222 m3 s is adopted as an input parameter of the daba model which is calculated from the rise of the upstream water level of about 8 106 m3 h jin 2019 7 2 hec ras flood routing model the hec ras computational procedure for unsteady flow is based on the one dimensional saint venant equations for the conservation of mass and momentum sholtes and doyle 2011 lei et al 2019 9 q x a t 0 10 q t q 2 a x g a h x s 0 s f 0 where q is the flow rate x is the distance along the channel bed a is the cross sectional area t is time g is the gravitational acceleration h is the flow depth s0 is the bed slope and sf is the friction slope which can be calculated by using chezy and manning s formulas as 11 s f q 2 n 2 r 4 3 a 2 where n is manning s coefficient of the roughness of the cross section and r is the hydraulic radius of the cross section for mountain streams with steep banks if the riverbed is primarily covered with cobbles and large boulders but no vegetation the manning s n value ranges from 0 04 to 0 07 in this study the n value for the channel bed is adopted as 0 06 for riverbanks the n value is assumed to be 0 12 which is in the range of the recommended n values for the riverbanks with medium intensity of vegetation and constructed materials usace 2016 the length of the study river reach is 460 km from the gyalha landslide dam site to the downstream pasighat village fig 6 the study river reach is divided into two sections according to the changeable terrain with large elevation differences in the first river reach the water elevation changes from 2742 m to 1800 m with a river length of 110 km and a large water level drop of 8 6 m km therefore cross sections in this reach are densely set at a small interval of 0 05 km in the second river reach the elevation changes from 1800 m to 150 m with a river length of 370 km corresponding to a smaller water level drop of 4 5 m km thus cross sections are set at a relatively larger interval of 1 km finally a total of 2570 cross sections are determined along the river reach 8 effects of ice melting on the dam breach process in this study the gyalha landslide dam material with different ice fractions is studied to investigate effects of ice on dam breach and flood routing process a detailed analysis of breach time peak flow peak arrival time breach development etc is conducted which is crucial for risk assessment and emergency rescue 8 1 peak flow and peak arrival time after the formation of the gyalha landslide dam the water level of the barrier lake increased at a speed of 0 6 1 0 m h xinhuanet 2018b and the gyalha landslide dam overtopped naturally at 13 30 on 19 october 2018 however if a significantly initial ice amount in the dam deposit is considered the dam overtopping will occur earlier due to a decrease of dam height induced by thawing settlement the rising speed of the barrier lake is adopted as the average rate of water level increase by 0 8 m h the reduction of landslide dam height due to ice melting is 1 75 m vice 5 2 71 m vice 10 3 53 m vice 15 and 6 02 m vice 20 corresponding to an earlier natural overtopping time of 11 20 am 10 10 am 9 10 am and 6 00 am respectively it can be found that the thawing settlement has a great influence on the dam s naturally overtopping time the melting of a small ice content of 5 can cause the dam to burst about 2 2 h earlier when the ice content increases as large as 20 the dam breach time can even be brought forward 7 5 h earlier which significantly accelerates the initiation of dam overtopping such sudden and unexpected dam breaks significantly shorten the rescue time posing a great threat to the downstream residents the hydrographs at the dam site considering the dam material with different ice fractions by using the daba model are shown in fig 7 it can be found that the simulated peak discharge and peak arrival time are 31 685 m3 s and 23 51 for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam which is in good correspondence with the observed peak flow of 32000 m3 s and the observed arrival time of 23 40 on 19 october the difference in the peak flow rate is only 2 25 and the time difference is only 11 min however the peak flow rate at the dam site performs a remarkable increasing trend with increasing initial ice content in the dam composition when the ice content is as small as 5 the corresponding peak flow rate only slightly increases from 32 000 m3 s to 36 813 m3 s whereas the exaggerated peak flow of 86 182 m3 s occurs with a large ice content of 20 which is almost three times larger than the benchmark this dramatically large outburst flow caused by ice melting nearly catches up to the overtopping flow of the yigong landslide dam in 2000 which is 94 013 m3 s and believed to be the largest flood in the recent 100 years delaney and evans 2015 wang et al 2016b 8 2 breach development table 9 presents the breaching process of the gyalha landslide dam with different ice fractions it can be found that the total breach time for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam is 25 h with an initiation duration of about 3 8 h and a development duration of about 21 2 h when there is a small ice content of 5 the time for the whole breach progression only reduces slightly to 23 3 h with an initiation time of 1 8 h and a development time of 21 5 h respectively nevertheless when the ice amount in the dam increases largely to 20 the whole breach process is significantly shortened to 8 3 h which is only about 1 4 of the breach duration for the condition of the benchmark with such a great ice amount the initiation process only takes 0 4 h and the breach size expands rapidly and transits to the development phase quickly the reason for the quicker overtopping process of the landslide dam with ice components is because that the ice changes the erodibility of the landslide dam significantly as shown in table 4 and fig 4 with the increasing amount of ice the soil coefficient of erodibility kd increases whereas the soil critical erosive shear stress τc decreases leading to an easier initiation of dam break and a quicker overtopping process the increase of soil erodibility is particularly large for the top soil layer with 5 of ice content the kd increases about 1 86 times larger than the benchmark and when the ice content reaches 20 the kd is even tenfold greater additionally the melting of ice also causes an absolute increase of the void ratio of the landslide dam which results in loosely formed high erodible dam materials and leads to a faster breach process the geometry of the final breach size with different amounts of ice components in the landslide dam is shown in fig 8 the breach size becomes larger and expands in both horizontal and vertical directions with increasing ice contents for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam the top width and bottom width of the final breach are 280 5 m and 137 6 m respectively however the final breach size develops greater for the dam with 20 of ice which enlarges approximately 1 6 times and 2 3 times in the final top and bottom widths respectively in the vertical direction the breach process develops to about 90 of the initial dam height in all the conditions which is consistent with the finding that a breach typically develops to a depth of 50 to 100 of the total dam height walder and o connor 1997 the erodibility of dam materials decreases with dam depth which leads to more erosion in the lateral direction and results in a relatively slight breach depth but a large top and bottom width peng and zhang 2011 9 characteristics of the flood routing affected by ice melting the flood resulting from overtopping may cause catastrophic consequences for downstream residents in this study three major towns i e dexing tuting and pasighat in downstream of the gyalha landslide dam site are selected to analyze the flood routing characteristics fig 6 fig 9 illustrates the attenuation of the peak discharge along the river it obviously shows that both the peak flow rate and the corresponding arrival time are significantly affected by ice with increasing ice amount in the dam the subsequent flood induced by overtopping becomes larger and the peak arrival time comes earlier for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam the peak flow rate decreases from 36 793 m3 s to 11 032 m3 s from the dam site to the downstream pasighat by 19 11 october 20 whereas when the deposition of the landslide dam has the maximum ice fraction of vice 20 the flood attenuation is larger and quicker which decreases sharply from 86 182 m3 s to 12 277 m3 s from the dam site to the pasighat by 04 51 october 20 about 12 5 h in advance than the benchmark fig 10 intuitively illustrates the flood routing process of the landslide dam with different fractions of ice it can be found that at the same location along the river reach the peak flow rate increases with the increasing initial ice content and the corresponding arrival time comes earlier with the flood routing process along the 460 km river reach the peak discharge attenuates more sharply when the landslide dam contains a larger ice fraction when the landslide dam has the maximum ice content of 20 the flood peak decreases by 86 from the dam site to the pasighat with a transfer time of about 21 5 h for the benchmark gyalha landslide dam the peak flood reduces by 70 and the flooding process lasts for about 24 h the induced flood by overtopping is obviously larger when the landslide dam contains a significantly initial ice fraction and the corresponding flood peak arrival time comes earlier however the total duration of the flood routing is only slightly shortened with the increasing ice amount 10 conclusions with global warming a large number of glacier detachments and ice rock avalanches occurred more frequently worldwide with a detached volume of ice and rocks ranging from a few up 106 m3 to 100 106 m3 such cryospheric hazards may further induce chain disasters of glacial debris flow landslide barrier lake flood burst posing a great threat to people and infrastructures in alpine regions however most of the current studies have been carried out on the causes and mechanisms of large scale glacier detachments the dynamic behavior of the mass flow of ice rock mixtures and the relations between climate change and glacier activities there is a lack of study on the overtopping and flood routing process of landslide dams caused by glacier related hazards which may contain considerable amounts of ice such landslide dams will behave differently from that composed of pure earth materials whose performance needs to be urgently studied and becomes a new problem in hazard assessment in cold mountainous areas in this paper the effects of different ice amounts on landslide dam overtopping and flood routing process are studied for the first time in response to the ice melt the erodibility and geometry of the landslide dam will change accordingly the soil coefficient of erodibility kd and void ratio e increases significantly with increasing ice melt whereas the critical soil erosive shear stress τc decreases slightly which indicates a more erodible dam material in addition the ice melt can also induce a great settlement thus leading to a reduction of the dam height with a quick rising of the upstream impoundment the landslide dam will be overtopped earlier and the rescue time will be shortened once the landslide dam breaches it can be found that the overtopping process develops more rapidly with a larger initial ice amount and the breach size expands greater both horizontally and vertically along the river reach the flood induced by overtopping becomes larger and the peak arrival time comes earlier with the increasing initial ice amount the attenuation of flood is quicker and larger when the initial ice amount in the landslide dam is significant this study aims to draw attention to the landslide dam containing ice which is the secondary disaster induced by glacial related hazards and can be found worldwide with the increasing temperature a preliminary investigation is conducted in this study based on some simplified assumptions for instance the ice melt is more likely to cause differential settlements of dams rather than the uniform settlement that is simulated in this study and such uneven settlements or local deformations need to be further investigated in the future field investigations and physical modeling experiments also need to be conducted which can provide accurate data of dam materials and give new insights into the failure mechanism of landslide dams containing ice credit authorship contribution statement chen chen conceptualization methodology funding acquisition

temperature stratification is frequently observed and lasts threatening the local water environment and is a concern he et al 2019a b yang et al 2019 the formation duration and intensity of the

evolution with particle swarm optimization a depso ahmadianfar et al 2021 and feasible search space multiobjective particle swarm optimization fss mopso bai et al 2019 through multiple iterations the individuals are optimized to improve the multiple objectives of reservoirs and basins including hydropower generation flood detention navigation water supply aquatic spawning downstream lake water level and sediment different objectives are balanced and the individuals evolve a set of optimal solutions that is the pareto frontier can be achieved and the trade off relationships among multiple objectives are analyzed because temperature stratification is closely related to the water level and outflow rate it can be further regulated by reservoir optimization operations however existing reservoir optimization operations mainly focus on for example hydropower generation flood control water supply and navigation and the thermal stratification of the reservoir area has not been considered in the flood season the reservoir is accustomed to releasing water quickly to the low limit water level in case of rare flood risk for most large chinese reservoirs after building giant cascade reservoirs the reservoir capacities detain the inflow and a multiobjective utilization of large inflow is imperative in addition to flood control especially for the early and late flood seasons when the basin flow tends to be moderately large li et al 2020a b ma et al 2020 the thermal regime should be synthetically considered as well as flood control and hydropower generation in the reservoir optimization operation hence considering the early flood season efs of large xiluodu reservoir xld as a study case this study aims to conduct reservoir optimization operations while considering weakening the temperature stratification in addition to hydropower generation and flood control to improve their integrated benefits and efficiently utilize the large inflow event this study comprises four parts in section 2 the study site multiobjective optimization model and hydro temperature numerical model are described in section 3 the evolution solutions of the optimization

southwest china fig 1 the yearly average water depth exceeded 150 m and the maximum depth was more than 220 m there are 18 turbines in the hydropower station of the xld and the maximum outflow rate of the turbines was 7450 m3 s the maximum output is 1 386 107 kw and the guaranteed output of the reservoir is 3 795 106 kw table 1 the function of the reservoir mainly includes hydropower generation and downstream flood detention because of the large water depth temperature stratification frequently occurs and lasts in spring and summer from its first water impoundment in 2013 long lasting temperature stratification goes against environmental improvement and has become a crucial environmental problem xie et al 2016 the efs is in june and the water level should be reduced from 566 june 1

value that is the ts at the end of the efs can therefore be calculated to rank the individuals 2 2 2 objective functions the reservoir operation considers three crucial objectives of xld in the efs flood control hydropower generation and temperature structure of the reservoir area their functions are as follows 1 minimizing the peak rate of outflow to decrease the downstream flood risk this

to focus on temperature stratification this study s third objective is to minimize the ts at the end of the efs that is on day 30 of the efs the temperature profile 35 km upstream of the xld dam section s2 in fig 1 was extracted from a 2 d hydro temperature numerical simulation ce qual w2 section 2 3 a widely used parameter schmidt ts st was used to measure this objective he et al 2017 he et al 2019a b a 0 value of st represents homogeneous water with no vertical stratification and the larger the st value the stronger the vertical temperature stratification 3 o 3 min ts min s t 30 e s t g

this study limited the absolute daily change in tail water level to 4 5 m d because the tail water level is related to the outflow rate the absolute daily change in outflow rate is accordingly limited 6 4 5 z t a i l t z t a i l t 1 4 5 where ztailt is the tail water level at the end of the tth day m in the multiobjective optimization operation evolution if the absolute daily change in tail water

exceeds the allowed maximum or minimum outflow rate after individual evolution the outflow rate is set as the allowed maximum or minimum outflow rate and the outflow rates of other days are adjusted using the same multiple method to guarantee the water balance because the outflow tends not to exceed the safety discharge of downstream xld in the efs the flooding duration constraint is not considered in this study 5 hydropower generation capacity 8 p min p t p max where pmin 3 795 106 kw and pmax 1 386 107 kw are the allowed minimum and maximum hydropower station outputs respectively 6 relationship between water level and reservoir volume a positive relationship exists between the water level and the reservoir volume fig 4 a 7 relationship between tail water level and outflow rate the tail water level downstream of the xld dam is directly affected by the water level of the downstream xiangjiaba reservoir fig 4 b in the simulation period the water level of the downstream xiangjiaba reservoir was set according to its reservoir operation schemes 2 4 2 d hydro temperature numerical model of xld 2 4 1 model description the laterally averaged 2 d ce qual w2 http www ce pdx edu w2 was applied to set up a hydro temperature model covering the main reservoir area of the xld fig 1 ce qual w2 is practical for elongated deep river and reservoir basins cole and wells 2015 and has been validated in the cascade reservoirs in for example the farmington river basin yearsley et al 2019 north santiam river buccola et al 2016 the three gorges reservoir lian et al 2014 and sanbanxi reservoir he et al 2017 he et al 2019a b hydrodynamic and water temperature modules were used in this study ce qual w2 uses the laterally averaged equations of fluid motion derived from three dimensional equations the w2 turbulence closure algorithm was used and the water air heat exchange was calculated term by term the basic equations are shown in appendix a 2 the model grid of the xld is divided into 69 longitudinal segments with lengths of 110 8500 m according to the measured bathymetric data and the grid near the dam was encrypted each segment was divided into 70 vertical layers with a 4 m thickness the daily values of inflow rate outflow rate inflow temperature air temperature wind speed and direction solar radiation precipitation rate evaporation rate and cloud cover are set at the upstream downstream and meteorological boundaries the outputs of the numerical simulation include the calculated water level and temperature profile at all longitudinal segments and the outflow temperature of the xld based on the temperature profile ts can be calculated as the third single objective value in nsga ii to evaluate temperature stratification 2 4 2 model calibration the important parameters including the manning coefficient longitudinal eddy viscosity and longitudinal eddy diffusivity were calibrated using a simple variable method that is successively changing the aforementioned three parameters in the model calibration the hydrological and meteorological measurements from january 2015 to december 2017 were set at the boundary and the calculation results of the reservoir water level temperature profile at sections s1 s2 s3 and outflow temperature are compared with the measurements the mean absolute error mae and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were used to quantify the goodness of fit of the numerical model 9 mae 1 n i 1 n x i obs x i cal 10 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n y i obs y i cal 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where n is the number of observations x i obs is the observation x i cal is the calculation and x mean is the mean of the observations the manning coefficient longitudinal eddy viscosity and longitudinal eddy diffusivity were first set by referring to the downstream three gorges reservoir near sanbanxi reservoir and some other large reservoirs cole and wells 2015 he et al 2017 he et al 2019a b zouabi aloui et al 2015 and they were gradually adjusted to improve the goodness of fit the manning coefficients are set as 0 025 0 026 0 05 the longitudinal eddy viscosity is set as 0 2 0 4 2 2 5 10 11 20 25 100 and the longitudinal eddy diffusivity is set as 0 0 1 2 2 2 5 respectively the setting resolutions of the three parameters were refined according to the calibration results the manning coefficient of 0 0345 longitudinal eddy viscosity of 1 and longitudinal eddy diffusivity of 0 4 can obtain a preferred goodness of fit the calculation of the water level conforms to the measurements for the temperature profile the mae values for s1 s2 and s3 were 0 65 0 37 and 0 38 respectively and the rsr values are 0 27 0 28 and 026 the mae and rsr values of the outflow temperature are 0 50 and 0 20 respectively fig 5 generally the model calibration results are satisfactory for emulating the reservoir hydrodynamic and water temperature and the model can be used to conduct further simulations 2 4 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the effects of the parameters on the model results for the baseline the manning coefficient longitudinal eddy viscosity and longitudinal eddy diffusivity are set as 0 0345 1 and 0 4 respectively the calibration results show that the model is sensitive to the manning coefficient and longitudinal eddy viscosity and is not sensitive to the longitudinal eddy diffusivity table 2 2 5 model scenarios three scenarios are included in this study the first scenario a0 is based on the historical average inflow rate from june 1 to july 1 and two larger inflow scenarios of 15 increase a1 and 30 increase a2 are considered fig 6 the initial conditions were set as the measured water level and thermal regime on june 1 2017 and the thermal regime at the end of the efs july 1 was extracted to estimate the influences of reservoir operation 3 results 3 1 effectiveness of the nsga ii and mopso through a multi iteration calculation of reservoir operation using algorithms nsga ii and mopso the three objectives can be improved by changing the operation schemes taking the normal year as a case for the nsga ii algorithm pro can be decreased from 7366 35 to 4387 45 m3 s 40 44 thg can be increased from 47 42 108 to 52 15 108 kw h 9 97 and ts can be reduced from 15448 27 to 14627 01 j m2 5 32 fig 7 and table 3 for the mopso algorithm the minimum pro maximum thg and minimum ts are 4790 69 m3 s 51 38 108 kw h and 14855 73 j m2 respectively in this case the optimization performance of nsga ii is slightly better than that of mopso the convergence rate of nsga ii is faster than that of mopso because the three objectives are contradictory and the selection of the personal best and global best can only achieve one objective which may influence the search efficiency of multiobjective optimization in further research a revised mopso including the a depso ahmadianfar et al 2021 and fss mopso bai et al 2019 should be adopted to improve the search efficiency hence the optimization results of nsga ii are mainly used to analyze the relationships between the three objectives and pareto frontiers in later sections of this paper 3 2 multiobjective operation results of normal year a0 by performing multi iteration evolution the best single objective individuals for the three objectives can be obtained in view of the best single objective individuals the minimum pro individual tends to uniformly release water and the temporal slope of the outflow rate tsor is 1 35 m3 s d nsga ii algorithm the maximum thg individual tends to release water late to store water elevate the water level fig 8 and increase the hydraulic head and thg the tsor is 113 8 m3 s d and the average water level is 562 4 m by contrast the minimum ts individual tends to release water early reduce the water level fig 8 increase the vertical water exchange and mixing and decrease temperature stratification the tsor is 74 0 m3 s d and the average water level is 549 1 m the pareto optimization solutions are evolved considering the three objectives and contractions exist between increasing thg and decreasing ts thg and ts are significantly positively related to the tsor fig 9 the linear correlation coefficient between thg and tsor reaches 0 97 and the linear correlation coefficient between thg and tsor is 0 70 as tsor increases the amount of water released late increases and the average water level during the efs is elevated to increase the thg and ts and vice versa thg has a significant positive linear correlation with ts and its linear coefficient is 0 82 in addition a temporally uniform outflow rate 1 35 m3 s d for the minimum pro individual can decrease the maximum outflow rate and is favorable for decreasing downstream flood risk 3 3 effects of inflow rate as the inflow rate increases the outflow rate increases increasing thg and pro table 3 for the thermal profile larger inflow and outflow rates effectively increase the vertical water exchange and mixing weaken the stratification and decrease the ts as the inflow discharge increases by 15 a1 and 30 a2 ts can be decreased to 14162 86 3 2 and 13233 54 9 5 j m2 respectively and thg can be increased to 64 24 23 2 and 76 59 46 5 108 kw h from the baseline a0 thg was more sensitive to the inflow rate than ts individuals generally have lower tss in the pareto frontiers under a larger inflow rate fig 10 for the nsga ii algorithm the tsor of minimum ts individual decreases and is 74 0 82 6 and 112 5 m3 s d respectively for the a0 a1 and a2 scenarios fig 11 a moreover the larger the inflow rate the greater the intensity of the linear relationship between thg and ts as the inflow discharge increases by 15 a1 and 30 a2 the linear correlation coefficients between thg and ts are 0 85 and 0 93 respectively this phenomenon occurs because as the inflow rate increases the variation range of thg and ts widens making the linear relationship more obvious under a larger inflow rate the temperature stratification can be significantly weakened at the end of the efs fig 11 b under a larger inflow and outflow rate in a wet year more water in the lower layers can be influenced by the water flow and vertical water exchange increases as the inflow rate increases by 30 the bottom of the thermocline layer can be reduced from the 70 meter water depth to the 90 meter water depth the water in the lower layers can be substantially influenced by the warm inflow and the water temperature near the 80 meter water depth is significantly increased fig 11 b 4 discussion the pareto frontiers are useful for reservoir operation and multiple objectives can be weighted for different hydrological years contractions exist between decreasing pro increasing thg and decreasing ts in wet years inflows are large thg increases and ts decreases compared with those of the normal year decreasing pro is the primary objective for xld and an even outflow is desired in normal and dry years increasing thg and decreasing ts can be prioritized the results show a strong linear relationship between thg and ts in the pareto frontiers for a normal year ts can be decreased by 305 j m2 at a rate of 1 108 kw h thg for xld which can support the multiobjective operations for the basin administration the proposed method of combining multiobjective optimization operation and the hydro temperature model is practical for other reservoirs this study shows that a low operating water level can weaken thermal stratification which is consistent with the findings of johnson et al 2004 simulations and observations have shown that artificial large outflow events can substantially increase vertical water exchange and mixing and decrease temperature stratification in the rapel reservoir carpentier et al 2017 ibarra et al 2015 and ye reservoir liu et al 2011 besides xld moreover reservoir operation and large flow utilization that consider ecology have been conducted in the three gorges reservoir where artificial tides have been created to decrease the tributary algae bloom yang et al 2013 and improve downstream fish spawning ma et al 2020 hence reservoir optimization operation that considers regulating the temperature stratification of the reservoir area should be practiced especially for large reservoir cascades in the early or late flood season when basin flood risk is low 5 conclusions the thermal regime substantially affects the water environment of the reservoir area and is influenced by the operation scheme of the reservoir this study first developed a multiobjective optimization operation model that considers weakening the temperature stratification by coupling the 2 d hydro temperature model ce qual w2 the nsga ii and mopso are used to solve the multiobjective optimization operation model and the pareto optimal solutions consider three objectives hydropower generation flood detention and temperature stratification this paper demonstrated the following 1 for xld under normal inflow scenarios the maximum thg individual tends to release water late to store water tsor 74 0 m3 s d increase the average water level 562 4 m and thg the situation is contrary for the minimum ts individual whose tsor is 113 8 m3 s d and the average water level is 549 1 m a temporally uniform outflow rate helps reduce the maximum outflow rate and favors flood control 2 through changing the operation mode thg in the pareto frontiers can be increased from 47 42 108 to 52 15 108 kw h 9 97 ts can be reduced from 15448 27 to 14627 01 j m2 5 32 and pro can be decreased from 7366 35 m3 s to 4387 45 m3 s 40 44 3 as the inflow rate increases the outflow rate increases increasing thg and decreasing pro and the temperature stratification is further weakened to decrease ts tsor is 74 0 82 6 and 112 5 m3 s d respectively for the minimum ts individuals of normal 15 and 30 inflow scenarios 4 in normal and dry years increasing thg and decreasing ts can be paid more attention besides flood control in the pareto frontiers for a normal year ts can be decreased by 305 j m2 at a rate of 1 108 kw h thg for xld which can support the multiobjective operations for basin administration the variation pattern of thermal stratification is the same as that in the literature and the reservoir optimization operation considering regulating the temperature stratification in this study is practical for other large reservoirs the large outflow should be used in a multiobjective manner in addition to flood control additional large cascade reservoirs are being built thus that reservoir operation management considers the water environment and ecology will continue credit authorship contribution statement

3849,temperature stratification increases the thermal stability ts of the reservoir area decreasing the vertical water exchange and going against the water environment improvement it is affected by the reservoir operation scheme and should be considered with multiple objectives hence considering the early flood season of xiluodu reservoir as a case this study built a multiobjective optimization model of temperature stratification by coupling the hydro temperature model ce qual w2 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii and multiobjective particle swarm algorithm were used to solve the multiobjective optimization model and the pareto frontiers were evolved by reducing the peak rate of outflow pro increasing total hydropower generation thg and decreasing ts this paper shows that 1 the maximum thg individual tends to release water late to increase the water level and hydraulic head which is opposite for the minimum ts individual a temporally uniform outflow favors a decrease in pro 2 in the pareto frontiers thg can be increased from 47 42 108 to 52 15 108 kw h 9 97 and ts can be reduced from 15448 27 to 14627 01 j m2 5 32 3 when the inflow rate increases the temperature stratification is further weakened and the minimum ts is reduced from 14627 01 to 13233 54 j m2 for large cascade reservoirs with low flood risk in the early or late flood season their thg and thermal regime can be improved under a moderate outflow and should be considered for the administrations keywords reservoir optimization operation thermal stratification xiluodu reservoir ce qual w2 early flood season 1 introduction reservoir impoundment creates large and deep water bodies with wide water areas and slow flow velocities and vertical temperature stratification frequently occurs in spring and summer due to warm inflow and solar radiation niemeyer et al 2018 duka et al 2021 temperature stratification reduces vertical water exchange and mixing and increases thermal stability ts detention time and water age of the reservoir area compared with homogeneous water saber et al 2018 zouabi aloui et al 2015 xie et al 2016 strong temperature stratification in the reservoir tends to decrease vertical water exchange increase hypolimnetic hypoxia and increase nitrogen and phosphate nutrient enrichment he et al 2019a b huang et al 2014 weak temperature stratification is desired to improve the water environment and ecology of the reservoir area large an deep cascade reservoirs have been built in china especially in the middle and upper yangtze river and yellow rivers significant temperature stratification is frequently observed and lasts threatening the local water environment and is a concern he et al 2019a b yang et al 2019 the formation duration and intensity of the temperature stratification are closely related to the hydrometeorological conditions and operation schemes of the reservoir a low inflow rate high inflow temperature and air temperature low wind speed and strong solar radiation help form intensify and lengthen the temperature stratification and increase ts huang et al 2014 råman vinnå et al 2018 saber et al 2018 yang et al 2019 likewise the artificial reservoir operation scheme including the change pattern of the outflow rate and water level plays a vital role in temperature stratification buccola et al 2016 johnson et al 2004 yearsley et al 2019 a high water level with a large water depth tends to decrease the water and heat exchange between the surface and the bottom layers promote vertical temperature stratification and increase the ts wang et al 2013 a large outflow rate helps increase the vertical water exchange and mixing and the temperature stratification can be substantially reduced huang et al 2014 ibarra et al 2015 liu et al 2011 yang et al 2013 reservoir optimization operation is practical for improving multiobjective comprehensive benefits and has been conducted for many reservoirs multiobjective evolutionary

individuals are optimized to improve the multiple objectives of reservoirs and basins including hydropower generation flood detention navigation water supply aquatic spawning downstream lake water level and sediment different objectives are balanced and the individuals evolve a set of optimal solutions that is the pareto frontier can be achieved and the trade off relationships among multiple objectives are analyzed because temperature stratification is closely related to the water level and outflow rate it can be further regulated by reservoir optimization operations however existing reservoir optimization operations mainly focus on for example hydropower generation flood control water supply and navigation and the thermal stratification of the reservoir area has not been considered in the flood season the reservoir is accustomed to releasing water quickly to the low limit water level in case of rare flood risk for most large chinese reservoirs after building giant cascade reservoirs the reservoir capacities detain the inflow and a multiobjective utilization of large inflow is imperative in addition to flood control especially for the early and late flood seasons when the basin flow tends to be moderately large li et al 2020a b ma et al 2020 the thermal regime should be synthetically considered as well as flood control and hydropower generation in the reservoir optimization operation hence considering the early flood season efs of large xiluodu reservoir xld as a study case this study aims to conduct reservoir optimization operations while considering weakening the temperature stratification in addition to hydropower generation and flood control to improve their integrated benefits and efficiently utilize the large inflow event this study comprises four parts in section 2 the study site multiobjective optimization model and hydro temperature numerical model are described in section 3 the evolution solutions of the optimization

southwest china fig 1 the yearly average water depth exceeded 150 m and the maximum depth was more than 220 m there are 18 turbines in the hydropower station of the xld and the maximum outflow rate of the turbines was 7450 m3 s the maximum output is 1 386 107 kw and the guaranteed output of the reservoir is 3 795 106 kw table 1 the function of the reservoir mainly includes hydropower generation and downstream flood detention because of the large water depth temperature stratification frequently occurs and lasts in spring and summer from its first water impoundment in 2013 long lasting temperature stratification goes against environmental improvement and has become a crucial environmental problem xie et al 2016 the efs is in june and the water level should be reduced from 566 june 1 to 560 m july 1 the average inflow during the efs is moderate 4100 m3 s and the reservoir operation should simultaneously consider decreasing the temperature stratification flood detention and

operation model the reservoir operation schemes evolved by the optimization operation model are input to the 2 d model and the thermal profile can be numerically simulated the third single objective value that is the ts at the end of the efs can therefore be calculated to rank the individuals 2 2 2 objective functions the reservoir operation considers three crucial objectives of xld in the efs flood control hydropower generation and temperature structure of the reservoir area their functions are as follows 1 minimizing the peak rate of outflow to decrease the downstream flood risk this study s first objective is to minimize the peak rate of outflow pro during the efs chen et al 2020 a small pro presents a lower flood risk of the downstream channel of xld 1 o 1 min pro min max ω qou

large thg presents a higher economic benefit from xld 2 o 2 max thg max t 1 30 qou t t h t k t δ t h t z t z t down z t s z t e 2 z t down where o 2 is the object function 2 qoutt is the outflow rate

to focus on temperature stratification this study s third objective is to minimize the ts at the end of the efs that is on day 30 of the efs the temperature profile 35 km upstream of the xld dam section s2 in fig 1 was extracted from a 2 d hydro temperature numerical simulation ce qual w2 section 2 3 a widely used parameter schmidt ts st was used to measure this objective he et al 2017 he et al 2019a b a 0 value of st represents homogeneous water with no vertical stratification and the larger the st value the stronger the vertical temperature stratification 3 o 3 min ts min s t 30 e s t g

levels respectively zini 566 m and zfil 560 m are the initial and final water levels of the efs respectively 3 daily changes in tail water level to satisfy the requirement of downstream navigation this study limited the absolute daily change in tail water level to 4 5 m d because the tail water level is related to the outflow rate the absolute daily change in outflow rate is accordingly limited 6 4 5 z t a i l t z t a i l t 1 4 5 where ztailt is the tail water level at the end of the tth day m in the multiobjective optimization operation evolution if the absolute daily change in tail water level exceeds 4 5 m d the corresponding outflow rates are transformed and approached using the same multiple method to make the absolute daily change in tail water level equal to 4 5 m d 4 outflow rate 7 qout t min q o u t t qout t max q o u t t min q o u t t q o u t t max where qoutt min and qoutt max are the allowed minimum and maximum outflow rates of xld respectively m3 s and qoutt min and qoutt max are the allowed minimum and maximum outflow rates of the hydropower station respectively m3 s in the multiobjective optimization operation evolution when the outflow rate of a certain day exceeds the allowed maximum or minimum outflow rate after individual evolution the outflow rate is set as the allowed maximum or minimum outflow rate and the outflow rates of other days are adjusted using the same multiple method to guarantee the water balance because the outflow tends not to exceed the safety discharge of downstream xld in the efs the flooding duration constraint is not considered in this study 5 hydropower generation capacity 8 p min p t p max where pmin 3 795 106 kw and pmax 1 386 107 kw are the allowed minimum and maximum hydropower station outputs respectively 6 relationship between water level and reservoir volume a positive relationship exists between the water level and the reservoir volume fig 4 a 7 relationship between tail water level and outflow rate the tail water level downstream of the xld dam is directly affected by the water level of the downstream xiangjiaba reservoir fig 4 b in the simulation period the water level of the downstream xiangjiaba reservoir was set according to its reservoir operation schemes 2 4 2 d hydro temperature numerical model of xld 2 4 1 model description the laterally averaged 2 d ce qual w2 http www ce pdx edu w2 was applied to set up a hydro temperature model covering the main reservoir area of the xld fig 1 ce qual w2 is practical for elongated deep river and reservoir basins cole and wells 2015 and has been validated in the cascade reservoirs in for example the farmington river basin yearsley et al 2019 north santiam river buccola et al 2016 the three gorges reservoir lian et al 2014 and sanbanxi reservoir he et al 2017 he et al 2019a b hydrodynamic and water temperature modules were used in this study ce qual w2 uses the laterally averaged equations of fluid motion derived from three dimensional equations the w2 turbulence closure algorithm was used and the water air heat exchange was calculated term by term the basic equations are shown in appendix a 2 the model grid of the xld is divided into 69 longitudinal segments with lengths of 110 8500 m according to the measured bathymetric data and the grid near the dam was encrypted each segment was divided into 70 vertical layers with a 4 m thickness the daily values of inflow rate outflow rate inflow temperature air temperature wind speed and direction solar radiation precipitation rate evaporation rate and cloud cover are set at the upstream downstream and meteorological boundaries the outputs of the numerical simulation include the calculated water level and temperature profile at all longitudinal segments and the outflow temperature of the xld based on the temperature profile ts can be calculated as the third single objective value in nsga ii to evaluate temperature stratification 2 4 2 model calibration the important parameters including the manning coefficient longitudinal eddy viscosity and longitudinal eddy diffusivity were calibrated using a simple variable method that is successively changing the aforementioned three parameters in the model calibration the hydrological and meteorological measurements from january 2015 to december 2017 were set at the boundary and the calculation results of the reservoir water level temperature profile at sections s1 s2 s3 and outflow temperature are compared with the measurements the mean absolute error mae and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were used to quantify the goodness of fit of the numerical model 9 mae 1 n i 1 n x i obs x i cal 10 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n y i obs y i cal 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where n is the number of observations x i obs is the observation x i cal is the calculation and x mean is the mean of the observations the manning coefficient longitudinal eddy viscosity and longitudinal eddy diffusivity were first set by referring to the downstream three gorges reservoir near sanbanxi reservoir and some other large reservoirs cole and wells 2015 he et al 2017 he et al 2019a b zouabi aloui et al 2015 and they were gradually adjusted to improve the goodness of fit the manning coefficients are set as 0 025 0 026 0 05 the longitudinal eddy viscosity is set as 0 2 0 4 2 2 5 10 11 20 25 100 and the longitudinal eddy diffusivity is set as 0 0 1 2 2 2 5 respectively the setting resolutions of the three parameters were refined according to the calibration results the manning coefficient of 0 0345 longitudinal eddy viscosity of 1 and longitudinal eddy diffusivity of 0 4 can obtain a preferred goodness of fit the calculation of the water level conforms to the measurements for the temperature profile the mae values for s1 s2 and s3 were 0 65 0 37 and 0 38 respectively and the rsr values are 0 27 0 28 and 026 the mae and rsr values of the outflow temperature are 0 50 and 0 20 respectively fig 5 generally the model calibration results are satisfactory for emulating the reservoir hydrodynamic and water temperature and the model can be used to conduct further simulations 2 4 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the effects of the parameters on the model results for the baseline the manning coefficient longitudinal eddy viscosity and longitudinal eddy diffusivity are set as 0 0345 1 and 0 4 respectively the calibration results show that the model is sensitive to the manning coefficient and longitudinal eddy viscosity and is not sensitive to the longitudinal eddy diffusivity table 2 2 5 model scenarios three scenarios are included in this study the first scenario a0 is based on the historical average inflow rate from june 1 to july 1 and two larger inflow scenarios of 15 increase a1 and 30 increase a2 are considered fig 6 the initial conditions were set as the measured water level and thermal regime on june 1 2017 and the thermal regime at the end of the efs july 1 was extracted to estimate the influences of reservoir operation 3 results 3 1 effectiveness of the nsga ii and mopso through a multi iteration calculation of reservoir operation using algorithms nsga ii and mopso the three objectives can be improved by changing the operation schemes taking the normal year as a case for the nsga ii algorithm pro can be decreased from 7366 35 to 4387 45 m3 s 40 44 thg can be increased from 47 42 108 to 52 15 108 kw h 9 97 and ts can be reduced from 15448 27 to 14627 01 j m2 5 32 fig 7 and table 3 for the mopso algorithm the minimum pro maximum thg and minimum ts are 4790 69 m3 s 51 38 108 kw h and 14855 73 j m2 respectively in this case the optimization performance of nsga ii is slightly better than that of mopso the convergence rate of nsga ii is faster than that of mopso because the three objectives are contradictory and the selection of the personal best and global best can only achieve one objective which may influence the search efficiency of multiobjective optimization in further research a revised mopso including the a depso ahmadianfar et al 2021 and fss mopso bai et al 2019 should be adopted to improve the search efficiency hence the optimization results of nsga ii are mainly used to analyze the relationships between the three objectives and pareto frontiers in later sections of this paper 3 2 multiobjective operation results of normal year a0 by performing multi iteration evolution the best single objective individuals for the three objectives can be obtained in view of the best single objective individuals the minimum pro individual tends to uniformly release water and the temporal slope of the outflow rate tsor is 1 35 m3 s d nsga ii algorithm the maximum thg individual tends to release water late to store water elevate the water level fig 8 and increase the hydraulic head and thg the tsor is 113 8 m3 s d and the average water level is 562 4 m by contrast the minimum ts individual tends to release water early reduce the water level fig 8 increase the vertical water exchange and mixing and decrease temperature stratification the tsor is 74 0 m3 s d and the average water level is 549 1 m the pareto optimization solutions are evolved considering the three objectives and contractions exist between increasing thg and decreasing ts thg and ts are significantly positively related to the tsor fig 9 the linear correlation coefficient between thg and tsor reaches 0 97 and the linear correlation coefficient between thg and tsor is 0 70 as tsor increases the amount of water released late increases and the average water level during the efs is elevated to increase the thg and ts and vice versa thg has a significant positive linear correlation with ts and its linear coefficient is 0 82 in addition a temporally uniform outflow rate 1 35 m3 s d for the minimum pro individual can decrease the maximum outflow rate and is favorable for decreasing downstream flood risk 3 3 effects of inflow rate as the inflow rate increases the outflow rate increases increasing thg and pro table 3 for the thermal profile larger inflow and outflow rates effectively increase the vertical water exchange and mixing weaken the stratification and decrease the ts as the inflow discharge increases by 15 a1 and 30 a2 ts can be decreased to 14162 86 3 2 and 13233 54 9 5 j m2 respectively and thg can be increased to 64 24 23 2 and 76 59 46 5 108 kw h from the baseline a0 thg was more sensitive to the inflow rate than ts individuals generally have lower tss in the pareto frontiers under a larger inflow rate fig 10 for the nsga ii algorithm the tsor of minimum ts individual decreases and is 74 0 82 6 and 112 5 m3 s d respectively for the a0 a1 and a2 scenarios fig 11 a moreover the larger the inflow rate the greater the intensity of the linear relationship between thg and ts as the inflow discharge increases by 15 a1 and 30 a2 the linear correlation coefficients between thg and ts are 0 85 and 0 93 respectively this phenomenon occurs because as the inflow rate increases the variation range of thg and ts widens making the linear relationship more obvious under a larger inflow rate the temperature stratification can be significantly weakened at the end of the efs fig 11 b under a larger inflow and outflow rate in a wet year more water in the lower layers can be influenced by the water flow and vertical water exchange increases as the inflow rate increases by 30 the bottom of the thermocline layer can be reduced from the 70 meter water depth to the 90 meter water depth the water in the lower layers can be substantially influenced by the warm inflow and the water temperature near the 80 meter water depth is significantly increased fig 11 b 4 discussion the pareto frontiers are useful for reservoir operation and multiple objectives can be weighted for different hydrological years contractions exist between decreasing pro increasing thg and decreasing ts in wet years inflows are large thg increases and ts decreases compared with those of the normal year decreasing pro is the primary objective for xld and an even outflow is desired in normal and dry years increasing thg and decreasing ts can be prioritized the results show a strong linear relationship between thg and ts in the pareto frontiers for a normal year ts can be decreased by 305 j m2 at a rate of 1 108 kw h thg for xld which can support the multiobjective operations for the basin administration the proposed method of combining multiobjective optimization operation and the hydro temperature model is practical for other reservoirs this study shows that a low operating water level can weaken thermal stratification which is consistent with the findings of johnson et al 2004 simulations and observations have shown that artificial large outflow events can substantially increase vertical water exchange and mixing and decrease temperature stratification in the rapel reservoir carpentier et al 2017 ibarra et al 2015 and ye reservoir liu et al 2011 besides xld moreover reservoir operation and large flow utilization that consider ecology have been conducted in the three gorges reservoir where artificial tides have been created to decrease the tributary algae bloom yang et al 2013 and improve downstream fish spawning ma et al 2020 hence reservoir optimization operation that considers regulating the temperature stratification of the reservoir area should be practiced especially for large reservoir cascades in the early or late flood season when basin flood risk is low 5 conclusions the thermal regime substantially affects the water environment of the reservoir area and is influenced by the operation scheme of the reservoir this study first developed a multiobjective optimization operation model that considers weakening the temperature stratification by coupling the 2 d hydro temperature model ce qual w2 the nsga ii and mopso are used to solve the multiobjective optimization operation model and the pareto optimal solutions consider three objectives hydropower generation flood detention and temperature stratification this paper demonstrated the following 1 for xld under normal inflow scenarios the maximum thg individual tends to release water late to store water tsor 74 0 m3 s d increase the average water level 562 4 m and thg the situation is contrary for the minimum ts individual whose tsor is 113 8 m3 s d and the average water level is 549 1 m a temporally uniform outflow rate helps reduce the maximum outflow rate and favors flood control 2 through changing the operation mode thg in the pareto frontiers can be increased from 47 42 108 to 52 15 108 kw h 9 97 ts can be reduced from 15448 27 to 14627 01 j m2 5 32 and pro can be decreased from 7366 35 m3 s to 4387 45 m3 s 40 44 3 as the inflow rate increases the outflow rate increases increasing thg and decreasing pro and the temperature stratification is further weakened to decrease ts tsor is 74 0 82 6 and 112 5 m3 s d respectively for the minimum ts individuals of normal 15 and 30 inflow scenarios 4 in normal and dry years increasing thg and decreasing ts can be paid more attention besides flood control in the pareto frontiers for a normal year ts can be decreased by 305 j m2 at a rate of 1 108 kw h thg for xld which can support the multiobjective operations for basin administration the variation pattern of thermal stratification is the same as that in the literature and the reservoir optimization operation considering regulating the temperature stratification in this study is practical for other large reservoirs the large outflow should be used in a multiobjective manner in addition to flood control additional large cascade reservoirs are being built thus that reservoir operation management considers the water environment and ecology will continue credit authorship contribution statement
