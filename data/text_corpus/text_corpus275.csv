1375,injection of microparticulate and nanoparticulate zero valent iron has become a regularly used method for groundwater remediation because of subsurface inhomogeneities however it is complicated to predict the zvi transport in the subsurface meaning that tools capable of determining its distribution after injection are highly useful here we have developed a new direct push based technique which combines fluorescent and visible imaging for detection of sulfidized nanoparticulate zero valent iron s nzvi in the subsurface laboratory experiments show that the redox sensitive fluorophore riboflavin is rapidly reduced by s nzvi within 200 s because the reduced riboflavin losses its green fluorescence it can be used as s nzvi sensitive indicator secondly s nzvi is black and tints light coloured sediment to a degree that allows detection in images for quartz sand 70 mg kg of s nzvi can be detected by visible imaging based on these results a new direct push probe dye oip was designed based on geoprobe s optical image profiler oip which was equipped with a fluorophore injection port below the oip unit the injectant consisted of the redox active riboflavin mixed with the redox inactive fluorophore rhodamine wt which fluoresces red and was used to verify that the mixture was indeed injected and detectable small scale experiments show that the fluorescence of this mixture in s nzvi amended sand changes within 150 s from green with a hue of 50 to red with a hue of 30 when imaged with dye oip tests of the dye oip after a s nzvi injection in a 1 m3 sized tank show that the tool could detect s nzvi via fluorescence and visible imaging when s nzvi concentration was 0 2 mg per g dry sediment thus these novel methods should be able to detect s nzvi in the subsurface without relying on infrastructure such as wells based on our results the dye oip could be further improved to make it suitable for regular use in the field keywords contamination redox indicator fluorescent tracer zero valent iron detection vitamin b2 monitoring 1 introduction in situ remediation of contaminated sites using zero valent iron zvi has become increasingly popular because zvi is able to react with a wide range of pollutants e g cao et al 1999 fjordbøge et al 2013 gillham and o hannesin 1994 kanel et al 2005 microparticulate and nanoparticulate zvi can be delivered to the subsurface via injection e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 nunez garcia et al 2020 although nanoparticulate zvi is toxic the environmental benefits of the treatment often surpass the risks induced semerád and cajthaml 2016 however the subsurface is highly heterogeneous meaning that transport often occurs preferentially along high permeable layers during injection e g flores orozco et al 2015 he et al 2010 nunez garcia et al 2020 and that accurate prediction of zvi transport becomes almost impossible hence it is important to verify the distribution of zvi in the subsurface following injection to ensure efficient contaminant remediation nearly all methods for determination of zvi distribution rely on retrieval of water and or soil samples which requires installation of monitoring wells and or core extraction sampled zvi has been identified and characterized using scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy mössbauer spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy e g kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 however these techniques are impractical for fast routine measurements in the field because they require special instrumentation and complex sample preparation shi et al 2015 the presence of zvi particles makes water samples blackish meaning that the material can be recognized visually and detected spectrophotometrically e g johnson et al 2013 additionally zvi in groundwater can be recognized by changes in dissolved oxygen concentration oxidation reduction potential orp and or ph e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 luna et al 2015 wei et al 2010 this is because the oxidation of zvi consumes dissolved oxygen and under anaerobic condition protons zvi in water samples can also be traced indirectly by the dissolved ions from salts used in the zvi synthesis unless the solid was separated from the supernatant prior to injection e g kocur et al 2014 or by conservative tracers such as br if co injected with the zvi e g he et al 2010 as an alternative the observed degradation of contaminants has been related to the successful emplacement of zvi in the target zone e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 luna et al 2015 wei et al 2010 however the absence of contaminants can also result from displacement of the groundwater by the contaminant free injectant and or enhanced microbial degradation because microbes utilize hydrogen released during zvi oxidation by water johnson et al 2013 another common way to confirm the presence of zvi relies on determination of the total fe concentration in water samples e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 because the total fe concentration also includes oxidized particulates and dissolved species an increase in total fe concentration can be related to the zvi injection but it does not allow quantifying the zvi concentration itself because zvi reduces protons to hydrogen gas the amount of released hydrogen gas from preserved samples has regularly been used to quantify the zvi concentration e g kocur et al 2014 luna et al 2015 however water characteristics such as dissolved tracers and salts do not specifically track the zvi mobility measurements of geochemical parameters can confirm indirectly that the field site is impacted by the injected zvi but they do not readily delineate the location of injected zvi kocur et al 2019 various geophysical methods have been used for monitoring zvi injections magnetic susceptibility of soil cores has been measured to determine the distribution of microscale zvi e g köber et al 2014 luna et al 2015 and in an injection experiment magnetic susceptibility sensors were installed in the subsurface at different depths and distances to directly determine the radius of influence of an injection velimirovic et al 2014 complex electrical conductivity imaging has been applied to trace spatiotemporally injected microscale zvi at field scale flores orozco et al 2015 with this method the delivery of zvi to the target zone as well as off zvi target movement by preferential transport could be delineated however the method requires sample retrieval from the subsurface for interpretation of the geophysical data for a more comprehensive discussion about zvi detection methods we refer to kocur et al 2019 and shi et al 2015 in conclusion determination of zvi in the subsurface requires expensive coring for soil sample extraction installation of monitoring wells groundwater sampling and or for installation of detection systems secondly most methods measure zvi indirectly and so allow only limited insights into zvi distribution as a novel alternative to orp measurements laboratory experiments with redox sensitive indicator dyes have shown promising results for detecting zvi the method relies on the detection of compounds which after reaction with zvi change colour i e absorbance spectrum the colour change of indigo 5 5 disulfonate for example has been used for the specific detection and quantification of zvi fan et al 2015 and it has also been noted that resazurin changed colour from purple to pink as a result of reduction by zvi tratnyek et al 2001 in comparison to standard electrodes for orp measurements redox active indicators have the advantage that they can be designed for specific redox reactions in addition the measurement of the dye redox state via ultraviolet visible light uv vis spectrophotometry is fairly simple finally one can avoid erroneous orp measurements which occurs when zvi attaches to the standard orp electrode and causes abnormally low redox potentials shi et al 2015 consequently shi et al 2015 highlights the use of indicator dyes as a promising alternative to common orp measurements although it has not been implemented to detect injected s nzvi yet in this study we have developed a new direct push technique dye oip based on geoprobe s optical image profiler oip and tested its capabilities for in situ detection of sulfidized nanoparticulate zero valent iron s nzvi injected into sand either directly through visual imaging or indirectly through quantification of fluorescence from a redox sensitive fluorophore which is injected during probe penetration the dye oip consists of an injection port for delivery of indicator fluorophores which is situated below a camera and two light sources for visual imaging and fluorescence quantification s nzvi was chosen because recent studies have shown that the material possesses several advantages over bare nanosized zvi treatment of zvi with sulphide increases both its redox reactivity with a range of compounds e g butler and hayes 2001 mangayayam et al 2019b as well as its longevity because the reduction of water to hydrogen gas is suppressed e g fan et al 2016 mangayayam et al 2019b up to 12 fold higher tce removal efficiency was observed when s nzvi was used instead of untreated nzvi brumovský et al 2020 furthermore a field study has successfully demonstrate that s nzvi is able to effectively reduce and immobilize cr vi brumovský et al 2021 to test the probe capabilities we have studied a the sorption and reduction kinetics of riboflavin and rhodamine wt in the presence of s nzvi b the detectability of fluorescence from riboflavin and rhodamine wt with the oip before and during redox reaction with s nzvi c the influence of s nzvi on soil colour in the oip images and d the detection of s nzvi injected in a tank with the dye oip 2 dye oip design and experimental strategy the novel dye oip was designed by kejr engineering inc geoprobe systems salina kansas usa based on our requirements the prototype consists of two main components an injection port that can deliver the fluorophores to the subsurface during probe penetration and further up the probe the oip unit a detection system that can induce fluorescence and quantify its colour and intensity fig 1 the oip unit is identical to that used in recent studies mccall et al 2018 reischer et al 2020b it features a high intensity light emitting diode led which produces uv light at a wavelength of 275 nm to induce fluorescence additionally a second led emits a broad spectrum visible light for imaging of the subsurface the light is emitted through a sapphire window and illuminates the adjacent soil and fluids backscattered light or induced fluorescence is detected with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor the oip unit can run automatically using either uv light or visible light for illumination additionally a pair of images can be captured manually using both light sources i e two images are captured at the same depth with uv light and visible light these images are called henceforth manual images the fluorophore mixture is injected with geoprobe s screened injection port part of their hydraulic profiling tool which was placed 13 cm below the oip unit fig 1 the injection port has an inner diameter of 0 8 cm with a mesh size of the screen of 0 25 mm and can be connected to a peristaltic pump via a tube to enable injection at small flow rates with this probe configuration fluorophores can be injected during probe advancement into the subsurface to react with the surrounding soil matrix when the oip unit later passes the region with the injected fluorophore it can induce and record fluorescence further details about the oip are available in mccall et al 2018 and reischer et al 2020b finally the probe is equipped with an ec dipole array located at the tip of the probe fig 1 which allows the assessment of pore fluid conductivity under certain conditions mccall et al 2017 vienken et al 2017 as candidates for fluorophores we selected riboflavin and rhodamine wt riboflavin vitamin b2 is a natural non toxic fluorophore with a high fluorescent quantum yield that can be produced at low cost zähringer 2014 oxidized riboflavin exists in cationic neutral and anionic form the neutral oxidized riboflavin has the highest fluorescence quantum yield 0 26 and emits green light peak emission at 516 nm when excited with uv light chen et al 2014 drössler et al 2002 because speciation and optical properties of riboflavin are ph dependent maximum fluorescence occurs between a ph of 4 and 8 the acceptance of two electrons and two protons leads to complete reduction of neutral riboflavin eq 1 which does not fluoresce 1 riboflavin ox h 2 e 2 h riboflavin red h 3 modified from bae and lee 2014 it has already been shown that nanoscale zvi can reduce riboflavin rapidly bae and lee 2014 hence riboflavin was considered as well suited turn off redox indicator to ascertain that lack of observed green fluorescence from riboflavin would not simply be caused by insufficient fluorophore injection or a malfunctioning detection system an additional redox inactive fluorophore rhodamine wt was co injected with riboflavin via the geoprobe s injection port rhodamine wt fluoresces red making it distinguishable from riboflavin and its behaviour is well known from hydrological studies flury and wai 2003 rhodamine wt exits in two different isomers with one isomer being more prone to retardation shiau et al 1993 and fluorescence is less ph sensitive independent of the isomer käss et al 1998 during probe advancement both fluorophores are injected simultaneously via the injection port thus if riboflavin is reduced green fluorescence would decrease and the red fluorescence of rhodamine wt would dominate the signal observed by the passing oip unit for use with the dye oip the fluorophores must meet four criteria 1 the redox indicator must react fast so that its fluorescence has substantially decreased upon passage of the oip unit at reasonable penetration rates our first objective was thus to expose riboflavin to s nzvi with and without carboxymethyl cellulose cmc and use uv vis spectrophotometry to assess its reduction rate cmc is typically used for stabilizing nzvi which enhances the mobility in the subsurface he et al 2007 li et al 2015 2 the redox reaction of the indicator fluorophore must be much faster with s nzvi than with other electron donors present so that the signal is specific to the injected reactant hence our second objective was to determine if riboflavin is readily reduced by magnetite fe ii fe iii 2o4 magnetite was chosen because it is an abundant natural mineral with mobile electrons in the crystal lattice that can be reversibly oxidized and reduced by microbes byrne et al 2015 kündig and steven hargrove 1969 hence magnetite could potentially reduce riboflavin 3 the fluorescence of the less reactive fluorophore must not decrease substantially before passage of the oip unit this might for example occur as a result of sorption to s nzvi and sediment which could quench fluorescence our third objective thus focused on the long term fate of rhodamine wt upon exposure to s nzvi for this changes in rhodamine wt concentration and absorbance pattern were studied with uv vis spectrophotometry over several days 4 the fluorophores must be detectable and distinguishable with the oip in our fourth objective we therefore examined the detectability of riboflavin and rhodamine wt by imaging fluorophore solutions of different concentrations and conducting time resolved imaging of the fluorescence of a riboflavin and rhodamine wt mixture exposed to s nzvi containing sand in earlier studies the potential of direct push based soil colour imaging was highlighted for detection of geochemical changes in the subsurface one study for example has correlated organic carbon content with observed soil colour hausmann et al 2017 and in another study soil colour was interpreted to vary with changes in water saturation and redox conditions reischer et al 2020b hence a fifth objective was to study the influence of s nzvi concentrations in sand on the colour in visible images to test if visible imaging can be used as a complementary method for s nzvi detection finally the capabilities of the dye oip for detection of s nzvi in sediments were tested after injecting 20 g of the material in a 1 m3 sized tank with water saturated sand 3 materials and methods unless noted all laboratory work was conducted in an anaerobic chamber coylab filled with 98 nitrogen and 2 hydrogen 3 1 synthesis of s nzvi and magnetite for experiments to study interaction between fluorophore and solids we synthesized s nzvi and magnetite s nzvi was synthesized via co precipitation based on the recipe in mangayayam et al 2019b with and without carboxymethyl cellulose cmc during the nzvi synthesis step to produce two different types of s nzvi unstabilised s nzvi and presynthesis stabilized s nzvi briefly 35 8 ml of 0 5 m fecl2 solution fecl2 4h2o 99 purity acros organics was mixed with 14 3 ml deoxygenated deionized water do di water resistivity 18 mω cm milliq and 21 5 ml deoxygenated ethanol 96 for presynthesis stabilisation with cmc the fecl2 was replaced with feso4 feso4 7h2o 99 sigma aldrich and 0 107 g of cmc mw 250 000 ds 1 2 sigma aldrich were added to the feso4 ethanol mixture to give 1 g l cmc afterwards 35 8 ml do di water with 2 g dissolved nabh4 sigma aldrich 99 was titrated into the reaction vessels after 15 min the synthesized nanoparticulate zvi were magnetically separated from the supernatant and resuspended in 0 2 m acetate buffer ph 5 6 followed by the addition of 4 2 ml 1 m na2s sigma aldrich 98 the nanoparticulate zvi reacted with na2s for 3 h to produce s nzvi in an agitated crimp sealed bottle outside of the anaerobic chamber the unstabilised s nzvi was washed with do di water and resuspended in do di water to give 10 g l s nzvi the presynthesis stabilized s nzvi was dried and when required for experiments 5 mg were resuspended in 5 ml do di water the suspension was then sonicated for 15 min to produce also with cmc poststabilised s nzvi for some experiments the unstabilised s nzvi was exposed to a cmc solution as the poststabilisation process varied between different experiments the poststabilisation procedure is described in detail in the relevant sections table s1 for testing if other reduced soil constituents readily react with riboflavin we synthesized nanoscale magnetite fe ii fe iii 2o4 the synthesis was based on a modified common recipe jayapaul et al 2011 first 432 5 mg fecl3 6h2o merck 99 and 222 4 mg feso4 7h2o were dissolved in 14 6 ml do di water afterwards 5 4 ml ammonium solution applichem 25 was poured into the reaction vessel the suspension was stirred for 10 min at 1200 rpm after which the magnetite was separated from the supernatant with a magnet washed and resuspended in 10 ml do di water to give 19 g l magnetite characterization of the cmc free unstabilised s nzvi and magnetite with synchrotron x ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis showed that the atomic structures of the materials conform to those expected from the recipes although the s nzvi may contain a very small amount of green rust details given in si text s1 3 2 interaction of fluorophores with s nzvi and magnetite initial experiments to study the interaction of fluorophores with unstabilized s nzvi poststabilised s nzvi and magnetite were conducted using uv vis spectrophotometry a cuvette holder connected to the uv vis spectrophotometer oceanoptics sts uv miniature spectrometer and to the light source avantes avalight dh s bal was placed on top of a magnetic stirrer to record changes in the absorbance spectra during reaction the spectrometer recorded a spectrum every 5 s over the wavelength range from 180 to 670 nm first do di water was transferred to a plastic macro uv cuvette which was continuously stirred and then a volume of 0 035 ml unstabilized s nzvi or 0 020 ml magnetite suspension was added to give final concentrations of 0 1 g l the s nzvi and magnetite suspensions were sonicated for 15 min prior to addition afterwards 2 54 ml riboflavin solution 52 mg l sigma aldrich 98 were added for the experiments with poststabilised s nzvi a 0 7 ml deoxygenated cmc solution 5 g l mw 250 000 ds 1 2 sigma aldrich was added before transferring the solids to determine if rhodamine wt can be used as an inert fluorophore we studied its interaction with s nzvi in these experiments vials were first added do di water or a mixture of do di water and deoxygenated cmc solution 0 05 ml of deoxygenated rhodamine wt stock solution 2500 mg l 25 fluorophore sensient was then added and a volume of s nzvi suspension was transferred to give final concentrations of 1 g l s nzvi and 5 mg l rhodamine wt s nzvi was used either unstabilized or was postsynthesis stabilized with 1 g l cmc which was added to the vials the s nzvi stock solution was sonicated for 15 min prior use and control vials were prepared without s nzvi after preparation the vials were wrapped in aluminium foil to avoid photolytic decomposition and then shaken at 190 rpm after various time intervals a 1 2 ml sample was extracted from the vials for determination of absorbance the sample was centrifuged to separate solid and solution and 0 9 ml supernatant were transferred into a plastic micro uv cuvette the absorbance spectrum was measured to quantify changes to the fluorophore s absorption profile 3 3 detectability of s nzvi and fluorophores with the oip unit to assess the detectability of riboflavin and rhodamine wt with the oip experiments were conducted with water saturated sand solutions with different fluorophore concentrations were prepared under aerobic conditions and 1 4 ml of the fluorophore mixtures was filled into quartz cuvettes afterwards the cuvettes were filled completely with fine sand dansand a s d50 0 194 mm and sealed with a lid this sand is very similar to that used in related studies reischer et al 2020a because s nzvi is black it might tint sediments sufficiently for detection with the oip s visible imaging to better understand the sensitivity of the oip we imaged samples having sand of different grain size and with variable s nzvi concentration using visible light to prepare the samples a stock solution of unstabilised s nzvi was diluted with do di water to obtain suspensions with s nzvi concentrations from 0 25 to 2 5 g l the suspensions were then transferred to 4 ml plastic cuvettes and sands with different size dansand a s d50 0 586 mm 0 194 mm and 0 121 mm fig s5 were added to the suspensions the cuvettes were then shaken and left to settle for 12 h finally they were closed with a lid and sealed with paraffin wax to minimize s nzvi oxidation during measurement outside the anaerobic chamber for oip measurement the cuvette was put in a black cuvette holder with a single opening held in direct contact with the sapphire window of the oip to exclude ambient light fig s6 for samples with s nzvi 3 or 4 sections of the cuvettes were measured images were obtained using visible light source s nzvi containing sand and uv light source samples with rhodamine wt and riboflavin the performance of the probe was regularly checked by measuring reference materials with known fluorescence diesel fuel creosote motor oil a non fluorescent black reference and a colour card optical target after use the quartz cuvettes were rinsed with chlorine isopropyl alcohol and trice with deionized water for reuse finally we studied the real time evolution of fluorescence in a mixed fluorophore solution with riboflavin and rhodamine wt in contact with s nzvi containing sand in these experiments we injected small volumes of fluorophore solution into a cuvette filled with water sand and s nzvi the evolution was then recorded with the oip in preparation a cuvette was first filled with a s nzvi suspension final concentration 1 g l the s nzvi stock solutions were sonicated for 15 min prior to use we used three different types of s nzvi unstabilized prestabilized and poststabilized s nzvi to form postsynthesis stabilized s nzvi a cmc solution was added to the unstabilized s nzvi in the cuvette and the mix was shaken for 1 h final cmc concentration was 5 g l the cuvette was then filled entirely with a fine sand d50 0 194 mm and sealed with parafilm and paraffin wax to minimize oxidation after transfer from the anaerobic chamber for the measurement the cuvette was put on the sapphire window the exterior sides were covered with a black glove and wrapped in aluminium foil to exclude ambient light and the entire setup was fixed on the sapphire window with tape fig s6 100 to 140 μl of fluorophore solution was then injected in the cuvette with a syringe the fluorophore solution contained 100 mg l riboflavin and 10 mg l of rhodamine wt which had been buffered at ph 7 4 with 0 1 m hepes to have optimal quantum yield for riboflavin for the post synthesis cmc stabilized s nzvi the injected fluorophore solution contained the same cmc concentration as the injected slurry to study the influence of a lower viscosity on mixing images were recorded approximately every 2 s to determine the evolution of the fluorescence and assess riboflavin reduction rate by s nzvi containing sand 3 4 testing of the dye oip during tank experiment to test the dye oip prototype in controlled conditions resembling those in the field we conducted imaging of sand after injection of s nzvi in a tank detailed descriptions of the experiment and the results are given in reischer et al 2020a briefly 40 l of postsynthesis cmc stabilized s nzvi suspension 0 5 g l s nzvi 5 g l cmc was injected in a 1 m3 sized container filled with fine sand d50 0 179 mm the injection was conducted using a centrally placed well made of high density polyethylene with 50 mm outer diameter and 10 cm vertical screen length slot width 0 3 mm the fine sand was separated from the well screen by a gravel pack with grains sizes from 0 4 to 0 8 mm the results from the tank experiment indicated the presence of a mobile and a retained s nzvi fraction the mobile fraction was transported radially from the well to distances 20 cm whereas the retained fraction was deposited mainly in the fine sand just adjacent to the gravel pack after the s nzvi injection we conducted five logs with the dye oip at various positions the dye oip was manually and slowly advanced into the sand with the sapphire window oriented towards the injection well during probe penetration a fluorophore solution containing 50 mg l riboflavin 5 mg l rhodamine wt and 0 05 m hepes ph adjusted at 7 4 using naoh was injected via the injection port at a rate between 0 5 and 1 ml min using a peristaltic pump ismatech ipc images were recorded automatically and additional still images were taken manually 3 5 image processing for assessment of fluorescence and sediment colour the 8bit jpg images captured with the oip were processed as described in reischer et al 2020b each image was mean filtered pixel radius of 2 to remove noise then the size of the image was cropped to a smaller region of interest roi to exclude artefacts such as the shadow from the sapphire window at the edges of the image to reduce the amount of data and ease data comparison the individual images were averaged i e afterwards each pixel of the image had the same value after this step the primary colours where extracted using red r green g and blue b of the rgb colour scheme and hue h saturation s and value v of the hsv colour scheme following the 8bit logic of the raw image each primary colour could have a value between 0 and 255 4 results and discussion determination of the distribution of injected material in the subsurface is complicated to examine the performance of the dye oip direct push probe for detection of s nzvi we have conducted a range of experiments at variable scale and complexity 4 1 spectral evolution of riboflavin and rhodamine wt upon interaction with s nzvi and magnetite optimally a reactive fluorophore should react fast and specifically with s nzvi hence we investigated the reduction rates of riboflavin by s nzvi to determine if we can expect the reaction to be so fast that changes in fluoresence can be observed during penetration of the probe to gauge if riboflavin is readily reduced by naturally occurring minerals experiments were also performed with magnetite fig 2 shows the absorption spectra recorded for riboflavin after different reaction times with poststabilized s nzvi and magnetite the spectrum recorded immediately after addition of the riboflavin solution to the s nzvi suspension time 0 s is characterized by peaks at wavelengths of 267 375 and 445 nm and a nearly constant absorbance of 0 35 between 525 and 670 nm fig 2a this spectrum is consistent with that expected for neutral oxidized riboflavin bae and lee 2014 drössler et al 2002 with time the peak intensity at 375 and 445 nm decreased an additional peak appeared at 297 nm and the initial peak at 267 nm shifted to shorter wavelengths these changes agree with those published for complete reduction of the riboflavin bae and lee 2014 ghisla et al 1974 simultaneous with changes in the absorption spectra the yellow colouring of the liquid disappeared similar results were obtained in experiments with unstabilised s nzvi data not shown when riboflavin was exposed to magnetite peak positions were identical to those expected for neutral oxidized riboflavin and no changes in the absorbance spectra were observed over 5 min fig 2b thus we conclude that s nzvi is capable of rapid reduction of riboflavin whereas magnetite is not the lack of riboflavin reduction by magnetite suggests that riboflavin does not react quickly with natural fe2 bearing oxides of the soil but more studies would be needed to confirm this to quantify the reduction rates of the riboflavin upon exposure to s nzvi the intensity of the peak at 445 nm was plotted as a function of time fig 3 a pseudo first order reaction was fitted to this data trend to derive the rate constant k obs abs 2 a t a 0 exp k obs abs t y here a t represents the absorbance at time t a 0 the initial absorbance t time and y the absorbance of reduced riboflavin at 445 nm a 0 y and k obs abs were adjusted to minimize the mean square error mse under the tested conditions the reduction of riboflavin by s nzvi is fast complete within 200 s and follows a pseudo first order reaction quite well the presence of cmc has no significant influence on the reduction kinetics i e the derived rate constants are similar table 1 these results suggest that riboflavin most likely can be used as a fluorescent turn off probe with the dye oip contrary to the observations for riboflavin the relative intensities of peaks for rhodamine wt did not change significantly after exposure to s nzvi example spectra shown for experiment with poststabilised s nzvi fig 4a this suggests that rhodamine wt in solution has remained intact i e unreduced clearly the absolute intensities of the peaks decrease with time indicating that the fluorophore concentration decreases possibly because of uptake by the s nzvi or its corrosion products fig 4b shows the decrease in absorbance at a wavelength of 558 nm as a function of time when rhodamine wt was exposed to unstabilised and poststabilised s nzvi the decrease in signal was much slower than for riboflavin when 5 g l cmc was added for postsynthesis stabilisation perhaps because cmc competes with sorption sites on the surface of s nzvi or corrosion products or because cmc influences corrosion rates thus the results indicate that the fluorescence from rhodamine wt would only decrease marginally between injection and imaging with the oip if cmc is present in conclusion the substance could function as an indicator for successful injection and fluorophore detection 4 2 detectability of the fluorophores with the oip to assess the detectability of rhodamine wt and riboflavin in sediment with the dye oip we recorded fluorescence images of the fluorophores in fine sand at various concentrations with the oip in the images riboflavin very clearly emits green light with a hue of 70 at concentrations between 20 and 60 mg l fig 5a the brightness of the colour increases markedly at a concentration of 20 mg l and reaches maximum values of 100 at 40 mg l fig 5b for rhodamine wt images are clearly orange at higher concentration the average hue of the fluorescence is 21 at concentrations from 2 5 to 60 mg l similar to that reported in reischer et al 2020b brightness increases markedly with concentration reaching a maximum value of 200 at 40 mg l the results show that rhodamine wt and riboflavin can be clearly detected with the oip in fine sand when excited with uv light but with variable detection limit the oip is more sensitive to the presence of rhodamine wt with a detection limit of 2 5 mg l based on brightness whereas riboflavin features a detection limit of 20 mg l 4 3 real time detection of the riboflavin reduction with the oip to test how the fluorescence from a combination of rhodamine wt and riboflavin in sand is influenced by s nzvi we injected small volumes of a fluorophore mixture into cuvettes filled with water saturated sand some of the cuvettes contained s nzvi at fixed concentrations whereas others were s nzvi free we then imaged the fluorescence as a function of time with the oip example images in fig 6 from the images movies were compiled to illustrate the results examples supplementary video 1 to 16 in the absence of s nzvi the derived hue was nearly constant meaning that fluorescence did not change significantly with time fig 6a supplementary video 1 4 in the presence of s nzvi hue decreased substantially with time approaching that of rhodamine wt and the colour of the images became reddish fig 6b d supplementary video 5 16 to quantify colour change as a function of time k obs hue was derived by fitting the data using eq 2 with a0 representing the initial hue at the hue at a certain time t time and y the average hue of rhodamine wt 21 between 5 and 60 mg l fig 5a the fastest rate was observed for the prestabilized s nzvi followed by unstabilised s nzvi and poststabilized s nzvi the slowest rate was observed for the s nzvi free control one reason for the different results might be that the rate of hue change depends on s nzvi type for example it has been reported that presynthesis stabilisation of nanoparticulate zvi produces smaller particles that are more reactive in redox reaction he et al 2007 eljamal et al 2020 which might explain why the fastest rate was observed for the presynthesis cmc stabilized s nzvi for the test with postsynthesis stabilized s nzvi the cmc added to the fluorophore solution would have increased solution viscosity which might have decreased the degree of mixing with the s nzvi suspension if so reactions would have been slower compared to the tests with unstabilized s nzvi compared to the k obs abs derived from the uv vis study for unstabilised s nzvi and poststabilized s nzvi no added sand table 1 the k obs hue derived from these injection experiments with sand fig 6 are smaller meaning that the reaction is slower in the sediment matrix than in the constantly stirred suspension this is not surprising given that diffusion would be expected to play a larger role in static non stirred systems regardless of the cause the slower change in fluorescence in sediments needs to be considered when selecting the rates of probe advancement into the subsurface so that sufficient time exists for reduction of the fluorophore between injection and imaging the half life calculated for the reduction of riboflavin by various s nzvi types using eq 2 were between 59 and 200 s based on this half life and the 13 cm distance between injection port and sapphire window penetration rates from 0 04 to 0 13 m min should assure that detectable hue changes have occurred when the oip unit passes a decrease in the value for hue of 15 the reduction rate of redox indicators are expected to increases with zvi mass tratnyek et al 2001 thus a higher penetration rate might allow detection of s nzvi if it is more abundant than the 1 g l as used here in summary our results show that riboflavin reduction by s nzvi in a sand led to a detectable colour change from green to red in images when a riboflavin rhodamine wt mixture was injected this indicates that the dye oip system will allow detection of s nzvi in sediments 4 4 laboratory tests of s nzvi detection in sediments by imaging colour to investigate if changes in sediment colour from addition of black s nzvi can be detected mixtures of sand and s nzvi were imaged in cuvettes using the oip and illumination with visible light fig 7 shows the results for s nzvi concentrations ranging from 0 25 2 5 g l corresponding to 0 to 0 6 mg g sand which encompass the concentrations used in injected slurries e g kocur et al 2014 and those that are likely to occur in the sediment upon retention of particles regular photographs show that samples with s nzvi were greyish to black clearly different in colour from the light brown sand fig 7c the raw images captured with the oip for samples with s nzvi are also greyish consistent with colouring of the sediment fig 7b in images of the coarsest sand aggregates of black particles can be recognized fig 7c shows the average hue and saturation in the images the pure sands have values 45 for hue and 94 138 for saturation fig 7a in the presence of s nzvi the values for saturation decrease with a concomitant increase in hue these results indicate that imaging of colour might also allow delineation of the emplacement of black particles after injection provided sediments have light colour 4 5 dye oip testing after s nzvi injection in 1 m3 tank our small scale laboratory experiments substantiate that s nzvi can be detected in the subsurface through imaging of fluorescence from an injected riboflavin rhodamine wt mixture and through imaging of soil colour if sediments are lightly coloured however the experiments mainly test the performance of the dye oip detection system and they do not take into account complications that could arise during realistic probe use such as those caused by probe penetration to determine if the dye oip is capable of detecting s nzvi in sediments when used in a regular fashion several logs were obtained in sand after an injection experiment results reported in reischer et al 2020a in the experiment 40 l of 0 5 g l s nzvi slurry postsynthesis stabilized with 5 g l cmc had been injected from a central well into a 1 m3 sized tank filled with fine grained sand d50 0 179 mm the injected s nzvi was dispersed in a spherical manner around the screen meaning that s nzvi was also found at shallower and deeper depth than that of the screen fig 8 consistent with this ec of logs increases at a depth of 20 to 30 cm and remain elevated to a depth of 80 to 90 cm fig s7 approximately 70 of the s nzvi was retained within a radius of 10 cm and most of it in the fine sand adjacent to the gravel pack surrounding the well screen here fe concentrations reached 1 mg g dry sediment with increasing radial distance the fe concentration decreased steeply so that samples 2 cm from the gravel pack had concentrations of 0 2 mg g thus high concentrations of s nzvi occurred only in a very narrow region of sand 5 5 8 cm from the well centre five dye oip logs were recorded within 20 cm of the well the position of the entry points at the surface is given in fig s7 and fig 8 indicates the penetration paths of the logs when projected radially these paths were identified based on the location for marks from the probe recorded during excavation the penetration path for log 1 is inclined so that distance from the well increases with depth fig 9 shows the fluorescence recorded in the images as a function of depth as well as the average hue and the red green ratio derived from image processing in addition the average soil colour and hue derived from the visible images are shown the images of fluorescence and the obtained hue can be categorised in three overall types type a with green images and hue values similar to the 53 determined for the unreacted fluorophore mixture in the laboratory experiments fig 6 e g log 1 and log 2 in fig 9 type b with black images and a hue that is higher than expected for the fluorophore solution e g log 4 at a depth of 10 cm and log 5 at a depth of 45 cm type c with images that are brownish or reddish and with values for hue lower than the unreacted mixture 53 and closer to that expected for rhodamine wt 21 as examples such images occur in log 3 at 56 cm depth and in log 4 at depths of 35 60 cm concomitant with decrease in hue the red green ratio increases when illumination occurred with visible light grey images in general correspond in depth to fluorescence images of type b and type c type c images for example are either brownish with hue of 25 50 or grey with a hue of up to 145 in the bench top laboratory experiments the hue of the fluorophore mixture changed towards that of rhodamine wt as riboflavin was reduced by s nzvi this pattern corresponds to the observation in type c images with a hue between 52 and 21 the experiments also showed that hue in visible images increase when s nzvi is present with hue values 50 being indicative of the presence of s nzvi based on these two criteria we detected s nzvi in logs 3 4 and 5 below a depth of approximately 30 40 cm these are the logs closest to the well at the level of the screen with a few exceptions this corresponds to detection of s nzvi in regions where soil sampling indicates that fe concentration exceed 0 2 mg g clearly these results are very promising however variations occur in the detection that require detailed scrutiny visible images from log 3 to 5 indicate the presence of s nzvi from a depth of 30 to 45 cm but do not provide information about s nzvi located deeper most likely this discrepancy was caused by the penetration into the gravel pack which contained 100 μg g fe fig 8c interestingly images recorded with uv light below 45 cm indicate the presence of s nzvi for logs 3 5 suggesting that fluorescent imaging is sensitive to lower s nzvi concentration than visible imaging conversely fluorescence was not detected when penetrating regions where visible images were clearly grey and where sampling indicated high fe concentration type b images several aspects of the logging could explain this lack of fluorescence firstly s nzvi could have become smeared on the sapphire window however it is unlikely that such smearing would have effectively blocked the entire window and the visible images reveal greyness not the complete blackness expected for s nzvi secondly the fluorophore injection port could have been blocked by particles originating from the sand or by the s nzvi itself if s nzvi was particularly prone to cause blocking this could explain a lack of detectable fluorescence at the levels with high s nzvi concentration if this was the case it could probably be remediated by using a pump capable of producing higher pressure thirdly our earlier study showed that the detected fluorescence for a given fluorophore concentration depended on the pore size of the sediment with decreasing detection at smaller pore size reischer et al 2020b this behaviour was attributed to less fluorophore molecules being present between sapphire window and pore wall a similar argument might be put forward for turbid solutions where particles or aggregates would also limit the penetration length of light such turbid solution might be caused by the hammering of the dye oip which could have suspended s nzvi particles thus if the s nzvi injection significantly lowered pore size or the probe penetration led to highly turbid pore fluids detected fluorescence would decrease such effect would presumably be most pronounced where the s nzvi concentration were highest we note that the dark rims occurring as relicts of the logging fig s9 suggests that the penetration itself leads to higher s nzvi concentration just next to the probe this would be comparable with the known contaminant accumulation at the probe surface during penetration which results in overestimation of concentrations interstate technology and regulatory council 2019 thus we find it plausible that high s nzvi concentration could have decreased the detectability of the fluorescence given that the lack of detection in this case reflect that the number of fluorescent molecules were too few in the imaged volume it is likely that a higher fluorophore concentration in the injected solution could remedy the complication however this comes at a cost if riboflavin reduction rates are limited by the s nzvi concentration increased fluorophore concentration would require higher s nzvi abundance for an equivalent relative decrease in the fluorescence of riboflavin within the same time span thus sensitivity might be lost alternatively the light intensity for inducing fluorescence could be increased the exposure time to the camera sensor extended or another fluorophore could be used with a higher fluorescence quantum yield it would also be preferable to advance the probe statically instead of hammering to avoid turbidity the degree of riboflavin reduction depends partly on the time available for reaction thus variation in penetration rates could also have influenced the results for the intervals where s nzvi was detected via changes in fluorescence images the penetration rates were similar to or lower than the ones indicated to be operational by the laboratory experiments fig s7 thus this might set an upper limit on how quick penetration can occur for our probe which features 13 cm distance between injection port and oip for a next generation probe a larger distance would most likely be beneficial in conclusion our results demonstrate that visual and fluorescence imaging can be used to detect injected s nzvi but that the dye oip can be developed further in nature soil colour varies which might complicate the detection of s nzvi by colour alone hence the combination of visible and fluorescence images with a reactive dye would probably be required for identification of s nzvi in the subsurface interestingly the differences in sensitivity of fluorescent and visible imaging towards s nzvi detection might allow a semi quantitative assessment of the reactant concentration generally more studies are needed to investigate dye oip detection of nzvi and the other types of s nzvi that exists garcia et al 2021 fresh nzvi might also be detected because it is also black johnson et al 2013 and reduces riboflavin rapidly though reaction rates can be affected by presence of contaminants bae and lee 2014 nzvi oxidiation is accompanied by colour change johnson et al 2013 and it loses its reactivity rapidly mangayayam et al 2019a as a consequence nzvi might only be detectable by the dye oip immediately after injection when the injected particles are fresh other reactants such as permanganate could potentially be detected simply by visible imaging because of its intensive colour a fluorescent turn on indicator has recently be developed for permanganate detection which potentially could be used with the dye oip shi et al 2019 finally the remediation agent could be labelled with a fluorophore to enable detection this has been demonstrated earlier with layer double hydroxides and the oip and so complications arising from the fluorophore injection could be avoided in this case dietmann et al 2020 the possibility for detection of contaminants via reactive fluorophores has already been demonstrated using a similar direct push probe dye lif einarson et al 2018 horst et al 2018 5 conclusion and outlook our laboratory experiments show that that riboflavin rapidly lost its fluorescence as it became reduced by s nzvi whereas rhodamine wt retained much of its fluorescence when cmc was present in addition tests of visible imaging of sand with s nzvi shows that this lightly coloured sediment becomes detectably tinted at s nzvi concentration above 0 25 g l we have combined these two methods for s nzvi detection via fluorescence and visible imaging in a new novel direct push technique dye oip during the penetration of the tool a mixture of riboflavin and rhodamine wt is injected near the tip of the tool and visible and fluorescence images are captured further up the tool after the fluorophores have had time to interact with the sediment logging with the dye oip after an injection experiment in a 1 m3 tank indicates that the probe detected s nzvi when concentrations exceeded 0 2 mg g dry sediment it is likely that improvements of the methods the probe and the acquisition software can improve detection limit compared to other methods for determining s nzvi distribution the dye oip does not require the installation of a well or core extraction and can be flexibly and dynamically placed as results are obtained these features could make the dye oip an important advancement for in situ treatment where delineation of the treated volume is notoriously complicated to assess rhodamine wt is toxic to freshwater life at elevated concentrations however a recent study indicates that the compound should not pose a risk at concentrations of below 0 9 mg l skjolding et al 2021 the dye oip method is based on injections of very small volumes 8 ml per meter of log at typical penetration rates at concentrations of about 5 mg l thus lowering of the rhodamine wt to concentrations so low that no risk is expected requires mixing of the injected solution with a trivial 35 ml of groundwater hence it is highly unlikely that the rhodamine wt injection have adverse effects on the biosphere should rhodamine wt never the less be considered problematic

1375,injection of microparticulate and nanoparticulate zero valent iron has become a regularly used method for groundwater remediation because of subsurface inhomogeneities however it is complicated to predict the zvi transport in the subsurface meaning that tools capable of determining its distribution after injection are highly useful here we have developed a new direct push based technique which combines fluorescent and visible imaging for detection of sulfidized nanoparticulate zero valent iron s nzvi in the subsurface laboratory experiments show that the redox sensitive fluorophore riboflavin is rapidly reduced by s nzvi within 200 s because the reduced riboflavin losses its green fluorescence it can be used as s nzvi sensitive indicator secondly s nzvi is black and tints light coloured sediment to a degree that allows detection in images for quartz sand 70 mg kg of s nzvi can be detected by visible imaging based on these results a new direct push probe dye oip was designed based on geoprobe s optical image profiler oip which was equipped with a fluorophore injection port below the oip unit the injectant consisted of the redox active riboflavin mixed with the redox inactive fluorophore rhodamine wt which fluoresces red and was used to verify that the mixture was indeed injected and detectable small scale experiments show that the fluorescence of this mixture in s nzvi amended sand changes within 150 s from green with a hue of 50 to red with a hue of 30 when imaged with dye oip tests of the dye oip after a s nzvi injection in a 1 m3 sized tank show that the tool could detect s nzvi via fluorescence and visible imaging when s nzvi concentration was 0 2 mg per g dry sediment thus these novel methods should be able to detect s nzvi in the subsurface without relying on infrastructure such as wells based on our results the dye oip could be further improved to make it suitable for regular use in the field keywords contamination redox indicator fluorescent tracer zero valent iron detection vitamin b2 monitoring 1 introduction in situ remediation of contaminated sites using zero valent iron zvi has become increasingly popular because zvi is able to react with a wide range of pollutants e g cao et al 1999 fjordbøge et al 2013 gillham and o hannesin 1994 kanel et al 2005 microparticulate and nanoparticulate zvi can be delivered to the subsurface via injection e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 nunez garcia et al 2020 although nanoparticulate zvi is toxic the environmental benefits of the treatment often surpass the risks induced semerád and cajthaml 2016 however the subsurface is highly heterogeneous meaning that transport often occurs preferentially along high permeable layers during injection e g flores orozco et al 2015 he et al 2010 nunez garcia et al 2020 and that accurate prediction of zvi transport becomes almost impossible hence it is important to verify the distribution of zvi in the subsurface following injection to ensure efficient contaminant remediation nearly all methods for determination of zvi distribution rely on retrieval of water and or soil samples which requires installation of monitoring wells and or core extraction sampled zvi has been identified and characterized using scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy mössbauer spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy e g kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 however these techniques are impractical for fast routine measurements in the field because they require special instrumentation and complex sample preparation shi et al 2015 the presence of zvi particles makes water samples blackish meaning that the material can be recognized visually and detected spectrophotometrically e g johnson et al 2013 additionally zvi in groundwater can be recognized by changes in dissolved oxygen concentration oxidation reduction potential orp and or ph e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 luna et al 2015 wei et al 2010 this is because the oxidation of zvi consumes dissolved oxygen and under anaerobic condition protons zvi in water samples can also be traced indirectly by the dissolved ions from salts used in the zvi synthesis unless the solid was separated from the supernatant prior to injection e g kocur et al 2014 or by conservative tracers such as br if co injected with the zvi e g he et al 2010 as an alternative the observed degradation of contaminants has been related to the successful emplacement of zvi in the target zone e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 luna et al 2015 wei et al 2010 however the absence of contaminants can also result from displacement of the groundwater by the contaminant free injectant and or enhanced microbial degradation because microbes utilize hydrogen released during zvi oxidation by water johnson et al 2013 another common way to confirm the presence of zvi relies on determination of the total fe concentration in water samples e g elliott and zhang 2001 he et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 because the total fe concentration also includes oxidized particulates and dissolved species an increase in total fe concentration can be related to the zvi injection but it does not allow quantifying the zvi concentration itself because zvi reduces protons to hydrogen gas the amount of released hydrogen gas from preserved samples has regularly been used to quantify the zvi concentration e g kocur et al 2014 luna et al 2015 however water characteristics such as dissolved tracers and salts do not specifically track the zvi mobility measurements of geochemical parameters can confirm indirectly that the field site is impacted by the injected zvi but they do not readily delineate the location of injected zvi kocur et al 2019 various geophysical methods have been used for monitoring zvi injections magnetic susceptibility of soil cores has been measured to determine the distribution of microscale zvi e g köber et al 2014 luna et al 2015 and in an injection experiment magnetic susceptibility sensors were installed in the subsurface at different depths and distances to directly determine the radius of influence of an injection velimirovic et al 2014 complex electrical conductivity imaging has been applied to trace spatiotemporally injected microscale zvi at field scale flores orozco et al 2015 with this method the delivery of zvi to the target zone as well as off zvi target movement by preferential transport could be delineated however the method requires sample retrieval from the subsurface for interpretation of the geophysical data for a more comprehensive discussion about zvi detection methods we refer to kocur et al 2019 and shi et al 2015 in conclusion determination of zvi in the subsurface requires expensive coring for soil sample extraction installation of monitoring wells groundwater sampling and or for installation of detection systems secondly most methods measure zvi indirectly and so allow only limited insights into zvi distribution as a novel alternative to orp measurements laboratory experiments with redox sensitive indicator dyes have shown promising results for detecting zvi the method relies on the detection of compounds which after reaction with zvi change colour i e absorbance spectrum the colour change of indigo 5 5 disulfonate for example has been used for the specific detection and quantification of zvi fan et al 2015 and it has also been noted that resazurin changed colour from purple to pink as a result of reduction by zvi tratnyek et al 2001 in comparison to standard electrodes for orp measurements redox active indicators have the advantage that they can be designed for specific redox reactions in addition the measurement of the dye redox state via ultraviolet visible light uv vis spectrophotometry is fairly simple finally one can avoid erroneous orp measurements which occurs when zvi attaches to the standard orp electrode and causes abnormally low redox potentials shi et al 2015 consequently shi et al 2015 highlights the use of indicator dyes as a promising alternative to common orp measurements although it has not been implemented to detect injected s nzvi yet in this study we have developed a new direct push technique dye oip based on geoprobe s optical image profiler oip and tested its capabilities for in situ detection of sulfidized nanoparticulate zero valent iron s nzvi injected into sand either directly through visual imaging or indirectly through quantification of fluorescence from a redox sensitive fluorophore which is injected during probe penetration the dye oip consists of an injection port for delivery of indicator fluorophores which is situated below a camera and two light sources for visual imaging and fluorescence quantification s nzvi was chosen because recent studies have shown that the material possesses several advantages over bare nanosized zvi treatment of zvi with sulphide increases both its redox reactivity with a range of compounds e g butler and hayes 2001 mangayayam et al 2019b as well as its longevity because the reduction of water to hydrogen gas is suppressed e g fan et al 2016 mangayayam et al 2019b up to 12 fold higher tce removal efficiency was observed when s nzvi was used instead of untreated nzvi brumovský et al 2020 furthermore a field study has successfully demonstrate that s nzvi is able to effectively reduce and immobilize cr vi brumovský et al 2021 to test the probe capabilities we have studied a the sorption and reduction kinetics of riboflavin and rhodamine wt in the presence of s nzvi b the detectability of fluorescence from riboflavin and rhodamine wt with the oip before and during redox reaction with s nzvi c the influence of s nzvi on soil colour in the oip images and d the detection of s nzvi injected in a tank with the dye oip 2 dye oip design and experimental strategy the novel dye oip was designed by kejr engineering inc geoprobe systems salina kansas usa based on our requirements the prototype consists of two main components an injection port that can deliver the fluorophores to the subsurface during probe penetration and further up the probe the oip unit a detection system that can induce fluorescence and quantify its colour and intensity fig 1 the oip unit is identical to that used in recent studies mccall et al 2018 reischer et al 2020b it features a high intensity light emitting diode led which produces uv light at a wavelength of 275 nm to induce fluorescence additionally a second led emits a broad spectrum visible light for imaging of the subsurface the light is emitted through a sapphire window and illuminates the adjacent soil and fluids backscattered light or induced fluorescence is detected with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor the oip unit can run automatically using either uv light or visible light for illumination additionally a pair of images can be captured manually using both light sources i e two images are captured at the same depth with uv light and visible light these images are called henceforth manual images the fluorophore mixture is injected with geoprobe s screened injection port part of their hydraulic profiling tool which was placed 13 cm below the oip unit fig 1 the injection port has an inner diameter of 0 8 cm with a mesh size of the screen of 0 25 mm and can be connected to a peristaltic pump via a tube to enable injection at small flow rates with this probe configuration fluorophores can be injected during probe advancement into the subsurface to react with the surrounding soil matrix when the oip unit later passes the region with the injected fluorophore it can induce and record fluorescence further details about the oip are available in mccall et al 2018 and reischer et al 2020b finally the probe is equipped with an ec dipole array located at the tip of the probe fig 1 which allows the assessment of pore fluid conductivity under certain conditions mccall et al 2017 vienken et al 2017 as candidates for fluorophores we selected riboflavin and rhodamine wt riboflavin vitamin b2 is a natural non toxic fluorophore with a high fluorescent quantum yield that can be produced at low cost zähringer 2014 oxidized riboflavin exists in cationic neutral and anionic form the neutral oxidized riboflavin has the highest fluorescence quantum yield 0 26 and emits green light peak emission at 516 nm when excited with uv light chen et al 2014 drössler et al 2002 because speciation and optical properties of riboflavin are ph dependent maximum fluorescence occurs between a ph of 4 and 8 the acceptance of two electrons and two protons leads to complete reduction of neutral riboflavin eq 1 which does not fluoresce 1 riboflavin ox h 2 e 2 h riboflavin red h 3 modified from bae and lee 2014 it has already been shown that nanoscale zvi can reduce riboflavin rapidly bae and lee 2014 hence riboflavin was considered as well suited turn off redox indicator to ascertain that lack of observed green fluorescence from riboflavin would not simply be caused by insufficient fluorophore injection or a malfunctioning detection system an additional redox inactive fluorophore rhodamine wt was co injected with riboflavin via the geoprobe s injection port rhodamine wt fluoresces red making it distinguishable from riboflavin and its behaviour is well known from hydrological studies flury and wai 2003 rhodamine wt exits in two different isomers with one isomer being more prone to retardation shiau et al 1993 and fluorescence is less ph sensitive independent of the isomer käss et al 1998 during probe advancement both fluorophores are injected simultaneously via the injection port thus if riboflavin is reduced green fluorescence would decrease and the red fluorescence of rhodamine wt would dominate the signal observed by the passing oip unit for use with the dye oip the fluorophores must meet four criteria 1 the redox indicator must react fast so that its fluorescence has substantially decreased upon passage of the oip unit at reasonable penetration rates our first objective was thus to expose riboflavin to s nzvi with and without carboxymethyl cellulose cmc and use uv vis spectrophotometry to assess its reduction rate cmc is typically used for stabilizing nzvi which enhances the mobility in the subsurface he et al 2007 li et al 2015 2 the redox reaction of the indicator fluorophore must be much faster with s nzvi than with other electron donors present so that the signal is specific to the injected reactant hence our second objective was to determine if riboflavin is readily reduced by magnetite fe ii fe iii 2o4 magnetite was chosen because it is an abundant natural mineral with mobile electrons in the crystal lattice that can be reversibly oxidized and reduced by microbes byrne et al 2015 kündig and steven hargrove 1969 hence magnetite could potentially reduce riboflavin 3 the fluorescence of the less reactive fluorophore must not decrease substantially before passage of the oip unit this might for example occur as a result of sorption to s nzvi and sediment which could quench fluorescence our third objective thus focused on the long term fate of rhodamine wt upon exposure to s nzvi for this changes in rhodamine wt concentration and absorbance pattern were studied with uv vis spectrophotometry over several days 4 the fluorophores must be detectable and distinguishable with the oip in our fourth objective we therefore examined the detectability of riboflavin and rhodamine wt by imaging fluorophore solutions of different concentrations and conducting time resolved imaging of the fluorescence of a riboflavin and rhodamine wt mixture exposed to s nzvi containing sand in earlier studies the potential of direct push based soil colour imaging was highlighted for detection of geochemical changes in the subsurface one study for example has correlated organic carbon content with observed soil colour hausmann et al 2017 and in another study soil colour was interpreted to vary with changes in water saturation and redox conditions reischer et al 2020b hence a fifth objective was to study the influence of s nzvi concentrations in sand on the colour in visible images to test if visible imaging can be used as a complementary method for s nzvi detection finally the capabilities of the dye oip for detection of s nzvi in sediments were tested after injecting 20 g of the material in a 1 m3 sized tank with water saturated sand 3 materials and methods unless noted all laboratory work was conducted in an anaerobic chamber coylab filled with 98 nitrogen and 2 hydrogen 3 1 synthesis of s nzvi and magnetite for experiments to study interaction between fluorophore and solids we synthesized s nzvi and magnetite s nzvi was synthesized via co precipitation based on the recipe in mangayayam et al 2019b with and without carboxymethyl cellulose cmc during the nzvi synthesis step to produce two different types of s nzvi unstabilised s nzvi and presynthesis stabilized s nzvi briefly 35 8 ml of 0 5 m fecl2 solution fecl2 4h2o 99 purity acros organics was mixed with 14 3 ml deoxygenated deionized water do di water resistivity 18 mω cm milliq and 21 5 ml deoxygenated ethanol 96 for presynthesis stabilisation with cmc the fecl2 was replaced with feso4 feso4 7h2o 99 sigma aldrich and 0 107 g of cmc mw 250 000 ds 1 2 sigma aldrich were added to the feso4 ethanol mixture to give 1 g l cmc afterwards 35 8 ml do di water with 2 g dissolved nabh4 sigma aldrich 99 was titrated into the reaction vessels after 15 min the synthesized nanoparticulate zvi were magnetically separated from the supernatant and resuspended in 0 2 m acetate buffer ph 5 6 followed by the addition of 4 2 ml 1 m na2s sigma aldrich 98 the nanoparticulate zvi reacted with na2s for 3 h to produce s nzvi in an agitated crimp sealed bottle outside of the anaerobic chamber the unstabilised s nzvi was washed with do di water and resuspended in do di water to give 10 g l s nzvi the presynthesis stabilized s nzvi was dried and when required for experiments 5 mg were resuspended in 5 ml do di water the suspension was then sonicated for 15 min to produce also with cmc poststabilised s nzvi for some experiments the unstabilised s nzvi was exposed to a cmc solution as the poststabilisation process varied between different experiments the poststabilisation procedure is described in detail in the relevant sections table s1 for testing if other reduced soil constituents readily react with riboflavin we synthesized nanoscale magnetite fe ii fe iii 2o4 the synthesis was based on a modified common recipe jayapaul et al 2011 first 432 5 mg fecl3 6h2o merck 99 and 222 4 mg feso4 7h2o were dissolved in 14 6 ml do di water afterwards 5 4 ml ammonium solution applichem 25 was poured into the reaction vessel the suspension was stirred for 10 min at 1200 rpm after which the magnetite was separated from the supernatant with a magnet washed and resuspended in 10 ml do di water to give 19 g l magnetite characterization of the cmc free unstabilised s nzvi and magnetite with synchrotron x ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis showed that the atomic structures of the materials conform to those expected from the recipes although the s nzvi may contain a very small amount of green rust details given in si text s1 3 2 interaction of fluorophores with s nzvi and magnetite initial experiments to study the interaction of fluorophores with unstabilized s nzvi poststabilised s nzvi and magnetite were conducted using uv vis spectrophotometry a cuvette holder connected to the uv vis spectrophotometer oceanoptics sts uv miniature spectrometer and to the light source avantes avalight dh s bal was placed on top of a magnetic stirrer to record changes in the absorbance spectra during reaction the spectrometer recorded a spectrum every 5 s over the wavelength range from 180 to 670 nm first do di water was transferred to a plastic macro uv cuvette which was continuously stirred and then a volume of 0 035 ml unstabilized s nzvi or 0 020 ml magnetite suspension was added to give final concentrations of 0 1 g l the s nzvi and magnetite suspensions were sonicated for 15 min prior to addition afterwards 2 54 ml riboflavin solution 52 mg l sigma aldrich 98 were added for the experiments with poststabilised s nzvi a 0 7 ml deoxygenated cmc solution 5 g l mw 250 000 ds 1 2 sigma aldrich was added before transferring the solids to determine if rhodamine wt can be used as an inert fluorophore we studied its interaction with s nzvi in these experiments vials were first added do di water or a mixture of do di water and deoxygenated cmc solution 0 05 ml of deoxygenated rhodamine wt stock solution 2500 mg l 25 fluorophore sensient was then added and a volume of s nzvi suspension was transferred to give final concentrations of 1 g l s nzvi and 5 mg l rhodamine wt s nzvi was used either unstabilized or was postsynthesis stabilized with 1 g l cmc which was added to the vials the s nzvi stock solution was sonicated for 15 min prior use and control vials were prepared without s nzvi after preparation the vials were wrapped in aluminium foil to avoid photolytic decomposition and then shaken at 190 rpm after various time intervals a 1 2 ml sample was extracted from the vials for determination of absorbance the sample was centrifuged to separate solid and solution and 0 9 ml supernatant were transferred into a plastic micro uv cuvette the absorbance spectrum was measured to quantify changes to the fluorophore s absorption profile 3 3 detectability of s nzvi and fluorophores with the oip unit to assess the detectability of riboflavin and rhodamine wt with the oip experiments were conducted with water saturated sand solutions with different fluorophore concentrations were prepared under aerobic conditions and 1 4 ml of the fluorophore mixtures was filled into quartz cuvettes afterwards the cuvettes were filled completely with fine sand dansand a s d50 0 194 mm and sealed with a lid this sand is very similar to that used in related studies reischer et al 2020a because s nzvi is black it might tint sediments sufficiently for detection with the oip s visible imaging to better understand the sensitivity of the oip we imaged samples having sand of different grain size and with variable s nzvi concentration using visible light to prepare the samples a stock solution of unstabilised s nzvi was diluted with do di water to obtain suspensions with s nzvi concentrations from 0 25 to 2 5 g l the suspensions were then transferred to 4 ml plastic cuvettes and sands with different size dansand a s d50 0 586 mm 0 194 mm and 0 121 mm fig s5 were added to the suspensions the cuvettes were then shaken and left to settle for 12 h finally they were closed with a lid and sealed with paraffin wax to minimize s nzvi oxidation during measurement outside the anaerobic chamber for oip measurement the cuvette was put in a black cuvette holder with a single opening held in direct contact with the sapphire window of the oip to exclude ambient light fig s6 for samples with s nzvi 3 or 4 sections of the cuvettes were measured images were obtained using visible light source s nzvi containing sand and uv light source samples with rhodamine wt and riboflavin the performance of the probe was regularly checked by measuring reference materials with known fluorescence diesel fuel creosote motor oil a non fluorescent black reference and a colour card optical target after use the quartz cuvettes were rinsed with chlorine isopropyl alcohol and trice with deionized water for reuse finally we studied the real time evolution of fluorescence in a mixed fluorophore solution with riboflavin and rhodamine wt in contact with s nzvi containing sand in these experiments we injected small volumes of fluorophore solution into a cuvette filled with water sand and s nzvi the evolution was then recorded with the oip in preparation a cuvette was first filled with a s nzvi suspension final concentration 1 g l the s nzvi stock solutions were sonicated for 15 min prior to use we used three different types of s nzvi unstabilized prestabilized and poststabilized s nzvi to form postsynthesis stabilized s nzvi a cmc solution was added to the unstabilized s nzvi in the cuvette and the mix was shaken for 1 h final cmc concentration was 5 g l the cuvette was then filled entirely with a fine sand d50 0 194 mm and sealed with parafilm and paraffin wax to minimize oxidation after transfer from the anaerobic chamber for the measurement the cuvette was put on the sapphire window the exterior sides were covered with a black glove and wrapped in aluminium foil to exclude ambient light and the entire setup was fixed on the sapphire window with tape fig s6 100 to 140 μl of fluorophore solution was then injected in the cuvette with a syringe the fluorophore solution contained 100 mg l riboflavin and 10 mg l of rhodamine wt which had been buffered at ph 7 4 with 0 1 m hepes to have optimal quantum yield for riboflavin for the post synthesis cmc stabilized s nzvi the injected fluorophore solution contained the same cmc concentration as the injected slurry to study the influence of a lower viscosity on mixing images were recorded approximately every 2 s to determine the evolution of the fluorescence and assess riboflavin reduction rate by s nzvi containing sand 3 4 testing of the dye oip during tank experiment to test the dye oip prototype in controlled conditions resembling those in the field we conducted imaging of sand after injection of s nzvi in a tank detailed descriptions of the experiment and the results are given in reischer et al 2020a briefly 40 l of postsynthesis cmc stabilized s nzvi suspension 0 5 g l s nzvi 5 g l cmc was injected in a 1 m3 sized container filled with fine sand d50 0 179 mm the injection was conducted using a centrally placed well made of high density polyethylene with 50 mm outer diameter and 10 cm vertical screen length slot width 0 3 mm the fine sand was separated from the well screen by a gravel pack with grains sizes from 0 4 to 0 8 mm the results from the tank experiment indicated the presence of a mobile and a retained s nzvi fraction the mobile fraction was transported radially from the well to distances 20 cm whereas the retained fraction was deposited mainly in the fine sand just adjacent to the gravel pack after the s nzvi injection we conducted five logs with the dye oip at various positions the dye oip was manually and slowly advanced into the sand with the sapphire window oriented towards the injection well during probe penetration a fluorophore solution containing 50 mg l riboflavin 5 mg l rhodamine wt and 0 05 m hepes ph adjusted at 7 4 using naoh was injected via the injection port at a rate between 0 5 and 1 ml min using a peristaltic pump ismatech ipc images were recorded automatically and additional still images were taken manually 3 5 image processing for assessment of fluorescence and sediment colour the 8bit jpg images captured with the oip were processed as described in reischer et al 2020b each image was mean filtered pixel radius of 2 to remove noise then the size of the image was cropped to a smaller region of interest roi to exclude artefacts such as the shadow from the sapphire window at the edges of the image to reduce the amount of data and ease data comparison the individual images were averaged i e afterwards each pixel of the image had the same value after this step the primary colours where extracted using red r green g and blue b of the rgb colour scheme and hue h saturation s and value v of the hsv colour scheme following the 8bit logic of the raw image each primary colour could have a value between 0 and 255 4 results and discussion determination of the distribution of injected material in the subsurface is complicated to examine the performance of the dye oip direct push probe for detection of s nzvi we have conducted a range of experiments at variable scale and complexity 4 1 spectral evolution of riboflavin and rhodamine wt upon interaction with s nzvi and magnetite optimally a reactive fluorophore should react fast and specifically with s nzvi hence we investigated the reduction rates of riboflavin by s nzvi to determine if we can expect the reaction to be so fast that changes in fluoresence can be observed during penetration of the probe to gauge if riboflavin is readily reduced by naturally occurring minerals experiments were also performed with magnetite fig 2 shows the absorption spectra recorded for riboflavin after different reaction times with poststabilized s nzvi and magnetite the spectrum recorded immediately after addition of the riboflavin solution to the s nzvi suspension time 0 s is characterized by peaks at wavelengths of 267 375 and 445 nm and a nearly constant absorbance of 0 35 between 525 and 670 nm fig 2a this spectrum is consistent with that expected for neutral oxidized riboflavin bae and lee 2014 drössler et al 2002 with time the peak intensity at 375 and 445 nm decreased an additional peak appeared at 297 nm and the initial peak at 267 nm shifted to shorter wavelengths these changes agree with those published for complete reduction of the riboflavin bae and lee 2014 ghisla et al 1974 simultaneous with changes in the absorption spectra the yellow colouring of the liquid disappeared similar results were obtained in experiments with unstabilised s nzvi data not shown when riboflavin was exposed to magnetite peak positions were identical to those expected for neutral oxidized riboflavin and no changes in the absorbance spectra were observed over 5 min fig 2b thus we conclude that s nzvi is capable of rapid reduction of riboflavin whereas magnetite is not the lack of riboflavin reduction by magnetite suggests that riboflavin does not react quickly with natural fe2 bearing oxides of the soil but more studies would be needed to confirm this to quantify the reduction rates of the riboflavin upon exposure to s nzvi the intensity of the peak at 445 nm was plotted as a function of time fig 3 a pseudo first order reaction was fitted to this data trend to derive the rate constant k obs abs 2 a t a 0 exp k obs abs t y here a t represents the absorbance at time t a 0 the initial absorbance t time and y the absorbance of reduced riboflavin at 445 nm a 0 y and k obs abs were adjusted to minimize the mean square error mse under the tested conditions the reduction of riboflavin by s nzvi is fast complete within 200 s and follows a pseudo first order reaction quite well the presence of cmc has no significant influence on the reduction kinetics i e the derived rate constants are similar table 1 these results suggest that riboflavin most likely can be used as a fluorescent turn off probe with the dye oip contrary to the observations for riboflavin the relative intensities of peaks for rhodamine wt did not change significantly after exposure to s nzvi example spectra shown for experiment with poststabilised s nzvi fig 4a this suggests that rhodamine wt in solution has remained intact i e unreduced clearly the absolute intensities of the peaks decrease with time indicating that the fluorophore concentration decreases possibly because of uptake by the s nzvi or its corrosion products fig 4b shows the decrease in absorbance at a wavelength of 558 nm as a function of time when rhodamine wt was exposed to unstabilised and poststabilised s nzvi the decrease in signal was much slower than for riboflavin when 5 g l cmc was added for postsynthesis stabilisation perhaps because cmc competes with sorption sites on the surface of s nzvi or corrosion products or because cmc influences corrosion rates thus the results indicate that the fluorescence from rhodamine wt would only decrease marginally between injection and imaging with the oip if cmc is present in conclusion the substance could function as an indicator for successful injection and fluorophore detection 4 2 detectability of the fluorophores with the oip to assess the detectability of rhodamine wt and riboflavin in sediment with the dye oip we recorded fluorescence images of the fluorophores in fine sand at various concentrations with the oip in the images riboflavin very clearly emits green light with a hue of 70 at concentrations between 20 and 60 mg l fig 5a the brightness of the colour increases markedly at a concentration of 20 mg l and reaches maximum values of 100 at 40 mg l fig 5b for rhodamine wt images are clearly orange at higher concentration the average hue of the fluorescence is 21 at concentrations from 2 5 to 60 mg l similar to that reported in reischer et al 2020b brightness increases markedly with concentration reaching a maximum value of 200 at 40 mg l the results show that rhodamine wt and riboflavin can be clearly detected with the oip in fine sand when excited with uv light but with variable detection limit the oip is more sensitive to the presence of rhodamine wt with a detection limit of 2 5 mg l based on brightness whereas riboflavin features a detection limit of 20 mg l 4 3 real time detection of the riboflavin reduction with the oip to test how the fluorescence from a combination of rhodamine wt and riboflavin in sand is influenced by s nzvi we injected small volumes of a fluorophore mixture into cuvettes filled with water saturated sand some of the cuvettes contained s nzvi at fixed concentrations whereas others were s nzvi free we then imaged the fluorescence as a function of time with the oip example images in fig 6 from the images movies were compiled to illustrate the results examples supplementary video 1 to 16 in the absence of s nzvi the derived hue was nearly constant meaning that fluorescence did not change significantly with time fig 6a supplementary video 1 4 in the presence of s nzvi hue decreased substantially with time approaching that of rhodamine wt and the colour of the images became reddish fig 6b d supplementary video 5 16 to quantify colour change as a function of time k obs hue was derived by fitting the data using eq 2 with a0 representing the initial hue at the hue at a certain time t time and y the average hue of rhodamine wt 21 between 5 and 60 mg l fig 5a the fastest rate was observed for the prestabilized s nzvi followed by unstabilised s nzvi and poststabilized s nzvi the slowest rate was observed for the s nzvi free control one reason for the different results might be that the rate of hue change depends on s nzvi type for example it has been reported that presynthesis stabilisation of nanoparticulate zvi produces smaller particles that are more reactive in redox reaction he et al 2007 eljamal et al 2020 which might explain why the fastest rate was observed for the presynthesis cmc stabilized s nzvi for the test with postsynthesis stabilized s nzvi the cmc added to the fluorophore solution would have increased solution viscosity which might have decreased the degree of mixing with the s nzvi suspension if so reactions would have been slower compared to the tests with unstabilized s nzvi compared to the k obs abs derived from the uv vis study for unstabilised s nzvi and poststabilized s nzvi no added sand table 1 the k obs hue derived from these injection experiments with sand fig 6 are smaller meaning that the reaction is slower in the sediment matrix than in the constantly stirred suspension this is not surprising given that diffusion would be expected to play a larger role in static non stirred systems regardless of the cause the slower change in fluorescence in sediments needs to be considered when selecting the rates of probe advancement into the subsurface so that sufficient time exists for reduction of the fluorophore between injection and imaging the half life calculated for the reduction of riboflavin by various s nzvi types using eq 2 were between 59 and 200 s based on this half life and the 13 cm distance between injection port and sapphire window penetration rates from 0 04 to 0 13 m min should assure that detectable hue changes have occurred when the oip unit passes a decrease in the value for hue of 15 the reduction rate of redox indicators are expected to increases with zvi mass tratnyek et al 2001 thus a higher penetration rate might allow detection of s nzvi if it is more abundant than the 1 g l as used here in summary our results show that riboflavin reduction by s nzvi in a sand led to a detectable colour change from green to red in images when a riboflavin rhodamine wt mixture was injected this indicates that the dye oip system will allow detection of s nzvi in sediments 4 4 laboratory tests of s nzvi detection in sediments by imaging colour to investigate if changes in sediment colour from addition of black s nzvi can be detected mixtures of sand and s nzvi were imaged in cuvettes using the oip and illumination with visible light fig 7 shows the results for s nzvi concentrations ranging from 0 25 2 5 g l corresponding to 0 to 0 6 mg g sand which encompass the concentrations used in injected slurries e g kocur et al 2014 and those that are likely to occur in the sediment upon retention of particles regular photographs show that samples with s nzvi were greyish to black clearly different in colour from the light brown sand fig 7c the raw images captured with the oip for samples with s nzvi are also greyish consistent with colouring of the sediment fig 7b in images of the coarsest sand aggregates of black particles can be recognized fig 7c shows the average hue and saturation in the images the pure sands have values 45 for hue and 94 138 for saturation fig 7a in the presence of s nzvi the values for saturation decrease with a concomitant increase in hue these results indicate that imaging of colour might also allow delineation of the emplacement of black particles after injection provided sediments have light colour 4 5 dye oip testing after s nzvi injection in 1 m3 tank our small scale laboratory experiments substantiate that s nzvi can be detected in the subsurface through imaging of fluorescence from an injected riboflavin rhodamine wt mixture and through imaging of soil colour if sediments are lightly coloured however the experiments mainly test the performance of the dye oip detection system and they do not take into account complications that could arise during realistic probe use such as those caused by probe penetration to determine if the dye oip is capable of detecting s nzvi in sediments when used in a regular fashion several logs were obtained in sand after an injection experiment results reported in reischer et al 2020a in the experiment 40 l of 0 5 g l s nzvi slurry postsynthesis stabilized with 5 g l cmc had been injected from a central well into a 1 m3 sized tank filled with fine grained sand d50 0 179 mm the injected s nzvi was dispersed in a spherical manner around the screen meaning that s nzvi was also found at shallower and deeper depth than that of the screen fig 8 consistent with this ec of logs increases at a depth of 20 to 30 cm and remain elevated to a depth of 80 to 90 cm fig s7 approximately 70 of the s nzvi was retained within a radius of 10 cm and most of it in the fine sand adjacent to the gravel pack surrounding the well screen here fe concentrations reached 1 mg g dry sediment with increasing radial distance the fe concentration decreased steeply so that samples 2 cm from the gravel pack had concentrations of 0 2 mg g thus high concentrations of s nzvi occurred only in a very narrow region of sand 5 5 8 cm from the well centre five dye oip logs were recorded within 20 cm of the well the position of the entry points at the surface is given in fig s7 and fig 8 indicates the penetration paths of the logs when projected radially these paths were identified based on the location for marks from the probe recorded during excavation the penetration path for log 1 is inclined so that distance from the well increases with depth fig 9 shows the fluorescence recorded in the images as a function of depth as well as the average hue and the red green ratio derived from image processing in addition the average soil colour and hue derived from the visible images are shown the images of fluorescence and the obtained hue can be categorised in three overall types type a with green images and hue values similar to the 53 determined for the unreacted fluorophore mixture in the laboratory experiments fig 6 e g log 1 and log 2 in fig 9 type b with black images and a hue that is higher than expected for the fluorophore solution e g log 4 at a depth of 10 cm and log 5 at a depth of 45 cm type c with images that are brownish or reddish and with values for hue lower than the unreacted mixture 53 and closer to that expected for rhodamine wt 21 as examples such images occur in log 3 at 56 cm depth and in log 4 at depths of 35 60 cm concomitant with decrease in hue the red green ratio increases when illumination occurred with visible light grey images in general correspond in depth to fluorescence images of type b and type c type c images for example are either brownish with hue of 25 50 or grey with a hue of up to 145 in the bench top laboratory experiments the hue of the fluorophore mixture changed towards that of rhodamine wt as riboflavin was reduced by s nzvi this pattern corresponds to the observation in type c images with a hue between 52 and 21 the experiments also showed that hue in visible images increase when s nzvi is present with hue values 50 being indicative of the presence of s nzvi based on these two criteria we detected s nzvi in logs 3 4 and 5 below a depth of approximately 30 40 cm these are the logs closest to the well at the level of the screen with a few exceptions this corresponds to detection of s nzvi in regions where soil sampling indicates that fe concentration exceed 0 2 mg g clearly these results are very promising however variations occur in the detection that require detailed scrutiny visible images from log 3 to 5 indicate the presence of s nzvi from a depth of 30 to 45 cm but do not provide information about s nzvi located deeper most likely this discrepancy was caused by the penetration into the gravel pack which contained 100 μg g fe fig 8c interestingly images recorded with uv light below 45 cm indicate the presence of s nzvi for logs 3 5 suggesting that fluorescent imaging is sensitive to lower s nzvi concentration than visible imaging conversely fluorescence was not detected when penetrating regions where visible images were clearly grey and where sampling indicated high fe concentration type b images several aspects of the logging could explain this lack of fluorescence firstly s nzvi could have become smeared on the sapphire window however it is unlikely that such smearing would have effectively blocked the entire window and the visible images reveal greyness not the complete blackness expected for s nzvi secondly the fluorophore injection port could have been blocked by particles originating from the sand or by the s nzvi itself if s nzvi was particularly prone to cause blocking this could explain a lack of detectable fluorescence at the levels with high s nzvi concentration if this was the case it could probably be remediated by using a pump capable of producing higher pressure thirdly our earlier study showed that the detected fluorescence for a given fluorophore concentration depended on the pore size of the sediment with decreasing detection at smaller pore size reischer et al 2020b this behaviour was attributed to less fluorophore molecules being present between sapphire window and pore wall a similar argument might be put forward for turbid solutions where particles or aggregates would also limit the penetration length of light such turbid solution might be caused by the hammering of the dye oip which could have suspended s nzvi particles thus if the s nzvi injection significantly lowered pore size or the probe penetration led to highly turbid pore fluids detected fluorescence would decrease such effect would presumably be most pronounced where the s nzvi concentration were highest we note that the dark rims occurring as relicts of the logging fig s9 suggests that the penetration itself leads to higher s nzvi concentration just next to the probe this would be comparable with the known contaminant accumulation at the probe surface during penetration which results in overestimation of concentrations interstate technology and regulatory council 2019 thus we find it plausible that high s nzvi concentration could have decreased the detectability of the fluorescence given that the lack of detection in this case reflect that the number of fluorescent molecules were too few in the imaged volume it is likely that a higher fluorophore concentration in the injected solution could remedy the complication however this comes at a cost if riboflavin reduction rates are limited by the s nzvi concentration increased fluorophore concentration would require higher s nzvi abundance for an equivalent relative decrease in the fluorescence of riboflavin within the same time span thus sensitivity might be lost alternatively the light intensity for inducing fluorescence could be increased the exposure time to the camera sensor extended or another fluorophore could be used with a higher fluorescence quantum yield it would also be preferable to advance the probe statically instead of hammering to avoid turbidity the degree of riboflavin reduction depends partly on the time available for reaction thus variation in penetration rates could also have influenced the results for the intervals where s nzvi was detected via changes in fluorescence images the penetration rates were similar to or lower than the ones indicated to be operational by the laboratory experiments fig s7 thus this might set an upper limit on how quick penetration can occur for our probe which features 13 cm distance between injection port and oip for a next generation probe a larger distance would most likely be beneficial in conclusion our results demonstrate that visual and fluorescence imaging can be used to detect injected s nzvi but that the dye oip can be developed further in nature soil colour varies which might complicate the detection of s nzvi by colour alone hence the combination of visible and fluorescence images with a reactive dye would probably be required for identification of s nzvi in the subsurface interestingly the differences in sensitivity of fluorescent and visible imaging towards s nzvi detection might allow a semi quantitative assessment of the reactant concentration generally more studies are needed to investigate dye oip detection of nzvi and the other types of s nzvi that exists garcia et al 2021 fresh nzvi might also be detected because it is also black johnson et al 2013 and reduces riboflavin rapidly though reaction rates can be affected by presence of contaminants bae and lee 2014 nzvi oxidiation is accompanied by colour change johnson et al 2013 and it loses its reactivity rapidly mangayayam et al 2019a as a consequence nzvi might only be detectable by the dye oip immediately after injection when the injected particles are fresh other reactants such as permanganate could potentially be detected simply by visible imaging because of its intensive colour a fluorescent turn on indicator has recently be developed for permanganate detection which potentially could be used with the dye oip shi et al 2019 finally the remediation agent could be labelled with a fluorophore to enable detection this has been demonstrated earlier with layer double hydroxides and the oip and so complications arising from the fluorophore injection could be avoided in this case dietmann et al 2020 the possibility for detection of contaminants via reactive fluorophores has already been demonstrated using a similar direct push probe dye lif einarson et al 2018 horst et al 2018 5 conclusion and outlook our laboratory experiments show that that riboflavin rapidly lost its fluorescence as it became reduced by s nzvi whereas rhodamine wt retained much of its fluorescence when cmc was present in addition tests of visible imaging of sand with s nzvi shows that this lightly coloured sediment becomes detectably tinted at s nzvi concentration above 0 25 g l we have combined these two methods for s nzvi detection via fluorescence and visible imaging in a new novel direct push technique dye oip during the penetration of the tool a mixture of riboflavin and rhodamine wt is injected near the tip of the tool and visible and fluorescence images are captured further up the tool after the fluorophores have had time to interact with the sediment logging with the dye oip after an injection experiment in a 1 m3 tank indicates that the probe detected s nzvi when concentrations exceeded 0 2 mg g dry sediment it is likely that improvements of the methods the probe and the acquisition software can improve detection limit compared to other methods for determining s nzvi distribution the dye oip does not require the installation of a well or core extraction and can be flexibly and dynamically placed as results are obtained these features could make the dye oip an important advancement for in situ treatment where delineation of the treated volume is notoriously complicated to assess rhodamine wt is toxic to freshwater life at elevated concentrations however a recent study indicates that the compound should not pose a risk at concentrations of below 0 9 mg l skjolding et al 2021 the dye oip method is based on injections of very small volumes 8 ml per meter of log at typical penetration rates at concentrations of about 5 mg l thus lowering of the rhodamine wt to concentrations so low that no risk is expected requires mixing of the injected solution with a trivial 35 ml of groundwater hence it is highly unlikely that the rhodamine wt injection have adverse effects on the biosphere should rhodamine wt never the less be considered problematic

vegetation xin et al 2008 a et al aa et al 2019 granata et al 2020 due to the complexity of the land plant atmosphere system direct measurement of eta is time consuming and costly and difficult to conduct on a regional scale ning et al 2018 eddy correlation method is considered to be the most effective method for measuring eta which provides instantaneous heat fluxes and calculates hourly eta feng et al 2017 however due to its high cost many regions do not have the conditions to conduct zhang et al 2018 the commonly used method to estimate eta is to use potential evapotranspiration et0 and budyko framework to improve the accuracy of eta estimation it is crucial to understand the influence of environmental factors on eta liu et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2019 the diffusion of water vapor in the atmosphere is enhanced by vapor pressure deficit vpd and wind speed ws granata 2019 thus solar radiation ra air temperature ta relative humidity rh and ws are the main climatic parameters that influence the evaporation process granata 2019 ma et al 2019 assessed the influence of climate and vegetation on eta during the restoration period on the loess plateau and concluded that ws and vegetation cover were the two major driving factors of eta changes in addition et0 has been universally used in water resources research and management yin et al 2010a 2010b saggi and jain 2018 the food and agriculture organization fao recommended a standard method penman monteith for calculating et0 allen et al 1998 which has already been widely adopted in some studies suleiman et al 2007 gundalia and dholakia 2017 a growing body of research has revealed the impact of meteorological factors on et0 the relationship between temperature and et0 is interesting because the et0 is expected to increase with temperature however a reduction in et0 has been observed in many areas over recent decades mcvicar et al 2012 shi et al 2017 the discrepancy between observed and expected evaporation is called the evaporation paradox roderick and farquhar 2002 though great efforts have been made to understand the paradox and cause of et0 tebakari et al 2005 rayner 2007 mozny et al 2020 the mechanism of the phenomenon remains unclear and different regions have different influencing factors for example some studies have pointed out that the differences are mainly due to changes in sunshine duration ssd ws and rh rayner 2007 shi et al 2017 soroush et al 2020 roderick et al 2007 attributed the decrease in pan evaporation to changes in basic physical variables in addition to the above factors soil moisture content smc is an important element affecting et0 and eta and it is also essential in determining soil surface water and energy flux vereecken et al 2008 wang and singh 2017 a et al aa et al 2019 however due to its strong temporal and spatial variability smc interacts with a variety of environmental factors including soil characteristics meteorological conditions and groundwater level in a complex and non linear manner making it difficult to accurately predict vereecken et al 2007 gao et al 2012 generally the temporal and spatial variability of smc changes significantly as soil depth increases some researchers have also tried to determine the relationship between smc and meteorological conditions groundwater level gl reference to the mean sea level of the yellow sea and other factors and analyze the influence and mutual feedback of these factors on smc chen and hu 2004 tuttle and salvucci 2016 for example ma et al 2004 said smc was significantly affected by light intensity and ws at the plot scale and sample point scale yu et al 2013 considered that smc was mainly affected by precipitation p soil temperature ts and rh in short the interaction of different environmental factors has a significant impact on eta et0 and smc despite the great advances the previous studies made there is still a lack of quantification of the relative influence of various environmental factors on eta et0 and smc liu et al 2019a 2019b han et al 2020 machine learning methods applied to the field of hydrometeorology are considered to be valuable as it represents a powerful tool capable of providing accurate forecasts granata 2019 granata et al 2020 therefore the boosted regression tree brt method was used to simulate evapotranspiration and soil water changes in addition previous studies have considered changes in et0 or eta separately while the analysis of trends in the difference between et0 and actual eta in the same area needs further development liu et al 2019a 2019b the specific objectives of our study were 1 to determine the applicability of the brt method in predicting eta et0 and smc at different depths of the research site 2 to quantify the relative contribution of environmental factors on eta et0 and smc and 3 to determine the influence of environmental factors on the difference of the smc at different depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study the wudaogou hydrological experimental station 117 21 e 33 9 n of xinmaqiao township guzhen county bengbu city anhui province was selected as a typical hydrological station which is located in the south of wanbei plain wbp fig 1a and fig 1b the mean annual rainfall is 884 7 mm 1970 2017 which is unevenly distributed within the year the annual rainfall is mainly concentrated in june to september of which the rainfall during the flood season accounts for about 60 to 70 of the annual rainfall han et al 2012 the annual average water surface evaporation is 1011 mm 1970 2017 the annual average temperature is 14 9 c and the average annual ssd is 1837 9 h wang et al 2020 the soil type of the station is lime concretion black soil and the soil texture is silty clay where the particle composition is clay 0 002 mm accounting for 13 1 silt 0 02 0 002 mm accounting for 49 4 and sand 2 0 02 mm accounting for 37 5 the wbp is a crop production area and the experimental station is located in a cropping field the hydrology and crop growth conditions in the area represent the average conditions of the wbp gou et al 2020 therefore it was selected as a typical representative station in the wbp to study the influence of environmental factors on et0 and smc 2 2 data description and preprocessing the data sets used in the study are divided into three groups the first group is the manual observation data from the meteorological field of the experimental station fig 1c the measurement elements include p ts 0 5 10 15 20 40 80 160 and 320 cm and ssd the p was measured by the standard rain gauge daily observation data at 8 00 am the ts is observed 3 times per day at 8 00 am 2 00 pm and 8 00 pm respectively and the ssd was measured by the sunshine meter daily observation data at 20 00 pm the second group is the automatic observation data of the high precision automatic monitoring system in the meteorological field fig 1c and fig 1d the equipment was mounted at the height of 2 m above the ground surface a series of meteorological variables were recorded including ra net radiation rn ta rh pressure wind direction wd and wind speed ws soil heat flux gs and smc were also measured on the system the soil water sensor was installed to measure the smc at various depths 10 20 30 and 40 cm by converting soil dielectric permittivity into smc all data were collected every 10 mins and then integrated into daily values and the subsequent analysis was based on the daily scale the third data group came from the automatic observation well of gl outside the meteorological field fig 1c the distance between the well and the system was about 50 m groundwater level data was also integrated to daily values the meteorological field observation data series of the station was longer 1986 2020 but the high precision automatic monitoring system was installed in 2016 the instrument has been in regular use since november 2016 and was previously in the commissioning phase to maintain the consistency of the data series this study chose the series length to be the two year data from 2017 to 2018 which had the best quality the leaf area index lai data were used to assess the effect of vegetation cover on eta which were derived from the modis satellite data https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov with a temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m the 8 day lai data were linearly interpolated to daily values before further analysis note that outliers of manual observation and automatic observation data were excluded and then linear interpolation was used to fill the blank data missing data is mainly from 10 mins time with linear interpolation using the integrated 1 day s data if there are many missing if there are few missing data then interpolation is done by using the 10 mins time data before and after the penman monteith p m model revised by the fao in 1998 allen et al 1998 was used to calculate et0 and eta which were calculated as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 et a k c et 0 where et 0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux concentration mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t mean is the mean air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s and e a are saturated vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure respectively kpa et a is actual crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 k c is the crop coefficient including wheat and maize yuan et al 2018 liu et al 2020 2 3 analysis methods the boosted regression tree brt method was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of environmental factors to evapotranspiration and soil water content in the wbp this method was developed by elith et al 2008 and combines the boosting technique with the regression tree method to study the relationship between prediction variables and response variables elith et al 2008 arabameri et al 2019 the brt is a machine learning algorithm that uses the recursive binary splitting method it fits all the data for the observation value based on the tree fitting model through which the model first identifies the observations with poor modeling effect and then adds new trees to improve the modeling effect until the difference between the predicted and observed value reaches the minimum elith et al 2008 it has the advantage of handling different types of predictors and accommodating missing values sun et al 2019 compared with the regression method of a single prediction model the brt model is more suitable for multiple simple models and combining them for prediction thereby improving the prediction performance buston and elith 2011 accordingly it is widely used in different scientific fields to determine the relative importance of different predictors salazara et al 2016 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2019a 2019b the brt model has four key parameters tree complexity tc bag fraction bf learning rate lr and the number of trees nt the parameter tc controls the structure of the tree the parameter bf represents the proportion of data selected at each step the parameter lr determines the contribution of each tree to the final fitted model and the parameter nt represents the number of trees required for the model to reach the optimal prediction in this study we calculated the relative importance of the variables by running the brt model using the gbm package in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 a brief description of the model is given in this research and detailed information can be found in elith et al 2008 the brt model has a better effect on predicting multiple non collinear variables the multiple collinearities of the predictor variables and the higher autocorrelation of the response variable can lead to data overfitting which will affect the prediction effect of the brt model to solve this problem it is essential to analyze the multicollinearity between the predictor variable and the response variable according to pearson s correlation coefficient r p 0 8 and variance expansion factor vif 10 aertsen et al 2010 sun et al 2019 before running the brt model the multicollinearity tests of all predictor variables and response variables are presented in the supplemental tables s1 and s2 the environmental influencing factors with acceptable levels of multicollinearity were selected for brt analysis the environmental influencing factors are provided in table s2 the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to estimate the differences between the observed and modeled values according to the multiple linearity test results the appropriate response variables for prediction were selected and different combinations of each parameter value tc e g 4 5 6 and 7 bf e g 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 75 and lr e g 0 05 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 were used to determine the optimal prediction result of the model the prediction effect of the brt model was evaluated using a 10 fold cross validated method elith et al 2008 first the data set was split randomly into 10 equal subsets 9 of which were chosen to construct the model as the training set and then the remaining subset was used to evaluate the performance of the model this process was repeated 10 times to obtain the final model prediction results the final optimal parameter values of tc bf and lr were 7 0 05 and 0 01 respectively table s3 to determine which environmental factors lead to differences in smc in different soil layers we calculated the contribution differences ctdf sun et al 2019 as 3 ctdf f m x f n x f n x where f m x and f n x are the relative contribution of environmental factor x calculated by the brt model to the soil water content of the mth and nth layer respectively 3 results 3 1 dynamics of hydrometeorological factors of the study site the average daily eta showed strong fluctuations with the average of 1 9 0 12 mm d 1 and a maximum value occurring in august or september fig 2a the values here and below represent the mean sd the average daily et0 was 1 8 0 07 mm d 1 and the paired sample t test indicated that daily et0 was less than daily eta p 0 05 n 649 the average annual eta was 611 57 mm and about 50 of p was returned to the atmosphere through via evapotranspiration the average annual et0 was 664 25 mm the annual et0 was less than the water surface evaporation in the area this research had shown that the p m model underestimated the daily et0 by 21 29 azhar and perera 2011 the temperature of different soil layers shows interesting characteristics fig 2b from april to august the temperature decreases with the increase of soil depth and from september to march of the following year the temperature increases with the increase of soil depth the daily mean soil temperature mts at different depths showed clear seasonal monotonic patterns with the maximum occurring in july or august as for inter annual variability the rainfall in 2018 is 300 mm more than that in 2017 with annual rainfall of 1202 155 mm which exceeds the multi year average rainfall of 885 mm fig 2c the maximum daily rainfall in 2017 was 100 mm while the maximum daily rainfall in 2018 reached 225 mm 70 year return period the rainfall varies greatly within the year with june to september accounting for 64 4 of the annual total at the same time the rainfall in 2018 increased due to the influence of a typhoon soil depth significantly affected the temporal and spatial distribution of smc xu et al 2017 moreover the smc at different depths had a good response to rainfall fig 2c the smc generally increased with depth from 0 to 40 cm with no significant differences between 10 and 20 cm but significant differences between 10 and 30 cm and 40 cm smc but the coefficient of variation cv value is between 10 and 20 which is the sub active layer chen et al 2008 the results of the variance test showed that there was a significant difference in smc at different depths p 0 01 the ta shows an obvious seasonal variation with an annual average of 15 69 0 02 c fig 3a while the atmospheric pressure changes in a small range over time the average annual vpd at the site was 7 0 0 7 hpa rh ws and ssd show weaker seasonal variations than ta and vpd the correlation coefficient between the average ts and ta reaches 0 95 p 0 01 table s1 global warming has a significant impact on ts and changes in ts can also indirectly reflect changes in ta bergh and linder 1999 hu and feng 2003 the annual average of lai was slightly greater in 2017 than in 2018 fig 3d since the land cover of the station is dominated by crops and the heavy rainfall in 2018 led to crop flooding and death due to the short installation time of the groundwater level observation well there was a partial lack of gl fig 3j it can be seen from the existing data that the gl in 2017 had a small amplitude while the gl in 2018 changed drastically especially in august due to its heavy rain the average gl in this station was 18 5 0 04 m in addition there was a delay in the response of gl changes to p for example after several consecutive days of p the gl slowly rises and the gl suddenly rises to a peak after 2 days there appears to be evidence to indicate that the delayed effect was affected by rainfall intensity initial smc and gl zang et al 2017 3 2 effects of environmental factors on eta et0 and smc 3 2 1 relationships between eta et0 and environmental factors before quantitatively analyzing the impact of environmental elements on eta et0 we first analyzed the relationship between 13 environmental elements including ta rn ra and mean soil moisture content msmc and eta et0 the results showed that eta et0 increased with the increase of ta ra rn gs ssd mts and vpd fig 4 the ssd had the greatest correlation with et0 with a correlation coefficient of 0 6 p 0 01 also when ssd 0 the trend of eta et0 increasing with the increase of ssd was more obvious et0 was negatively correlated with the rh atmospheric pressure and msmc when rh 80 the decreasing trend of et0 was very weak when 0 p 40 mm d 1 eta et0 displayed a decreasing trend interestingly when p 60 mm d 1 the eta et0 value is not close to 0 the main reason is that most of the rainfall events in this area occur at night or early in the morning for example it can be seen from the 2018 yearbook data that the water surface evaporation was 3 mm when the maximum daily rainfall occurs 3 2 2 relationships between smc and environmental factors it can be seen that the smc had greater correlations with the four factors of rh p ssd and gl but the smc decreased as the ssd increased fig 5 and fig s1 table s1 meanwhile the correlations between 30 cm smc and ta gs atmospheric pressure and 30 cm ts were greater than that at other depths however the correlation between 10 cm smc and vpd was greater than at other depths in addition when 0 p 60 mm d 1 the smc increased with the increase of p while the smc changes very little when p 60 mm d 1 consequently p 60 mm d 1 may be the threshold for smc changes smc went through three stages with the change of gl first it changed steadily 16 gl 17 6 m then increased rapidly 17 6 gl 20 m and finally remained stable 20 gl 24 m therefore smc was very sensitive to the gl in the second stage especially 0 30 cm smc since water smc is indispensable during the growth of crops the gl can indirectly reflect the growth of crops which is very important for farmland water management lei et al 2020 in order to analyze the impact of p on smc we examined the relationship between p in the rainy season and smc fig 2c and found that the sharp increase in smc was related to the p in the same period the cv value of smc at different depths in 2018 was greater than that in 2017 indicating that the smc in 2018 fluctuated greatly this is mainly due to the heavier rainfall was more frequent in 2018 resulted in large fluctuations on smc 3 3 control of influence factors on eta et0 and smc 3 3 1 environmental controls on eta et0 in the study area we evaluated the multicollinearity between environmental factors and selected variables with acceptable levels of multicollinearity i e r p 0 8 and vif 10 for brt analysis table s1 hence atmospheric pressure ra and mts were excluded and ta rh rn gs ws p ssd vpd and msmc were selected as the predictive variables of the brt model the model test presented that the coefficient of certainty r2 for eta and et0 were 0 92 and 0 93 p 0 01 respectively for eta the mae and rmse are 0 22 and 0 30 respectively and for et0 the mae and rmse are 0 17 and 0 22 respectively fig 6a the modeled eta et0 showed good agreement with the observations illustrating the feasibility of the brt model in the study area in order to further evaluate the relative contribution rate of influencing factors to eta et0 the analysis results of the brt model were shown in fig 7 the ssd vpd and lai were the main factors affecting eta variations that ssd vpd and lai explained 57 6 of total variation in daily eta during the research period however the p exerted slight impact on daily eta 4 when the p exceeds 40 mm d 1 the daily eta was 0 fig s2 et0 is mainly controlled by three factors vpd 43 1 ssd 23 0 and lai 6 7 fig 7 simultaneously the ta has a high correlation with atmospheric pressure and mts r p 0 9 and p 0 01 with the increase in temperature the gas molecules would spread around then the number of gas molecules in the region would be reduced thus contributing to the decrease in pressure which indirectly reflect that atmospheric pressure and mts also have a strong influence on et0 other predictive variables such as ta gs p rh msmc rn and ws have little effect on the et0 of the site with a relative contribution rate of less than 6 also it can be seen from the partial dependency graph that when 2 vpd 17 hpa et0 increased sharply with the increase of vpd while it increased in a stepped manner when 1 ssd 12 h fig s3 3 3 2 environmental controls on smc in the study area we also used the brt model to evaluate the relative contribution of environmental factors rh rn gs ws p ssd vpd ts and gl to 10 cm smc 20 cm smc 30 cm smc 40 cm smc and the msmc the high coefficient of determination r2 0 99 p 0 01 and the low value of rmse 0 08 0 22 and mae 0 06 0 16 indicated the good agreement between the modeled and observed smc fig 6b cosh et al 2008 demonstrated that rmse was less than 2 in smc prediction and the prediction result was reliable it can be found from fig 8 that the gl and ts were the main influencing factors gl and lai had the highest relative contribution rates to msmc 0 40 cm both at 19 2 followed by rh 12 2 and mts 11 4 especially when the gl is in the range of 17 20 m the msmc changes strongly fig s4 other factors have less influence on the msmc and most of them contribute less than 10 we also analyzed the influence of environmental factors on smc at different depths fig 8 in these cases gl and lai were also the main factors controlling smc at 10 cm and 20 cm with the total contribution rate of 41 4 and 36 2 respectively gl ts and lai were the main factors controlling smc at 30 cm and 40 cm with the total contribution rate of 66 and 51 7 respectively overall the primary controlling factor of 40 cm smc was gl and the main controlling factor of smc at other depths was lai as the soil depth increased the relative contribution rate of the gl increased when 17 gl 20 m the smc at different soil depths increased rapidly figs s5 s8 3 4 differences of smc at different depths to explore the differences in the impact of environmental factors on smc at different depths we calculated the ctdf eq 4 between smc at different depths fig 9 the results showed that the difference in smc between 10 and 20 cm was mainly caused by p and the difference in smc of 10 30 cm was mainly caused by vpd and rh followed by rn and vpd the difference in smc between 10 and 40 cm and 20 40 cm can be mainly attributed to the lai ts and vpd the difference in smc of 20 30 cm was mainly caused by p vpd and rh and the difference in smc of 30 40 cm was mainly due to lai in conclusion the differences in smc at different depths were determined by a number of influencing factors including ts lai vpd rh and p these results suggested that the spatial heterogeneity of multiple influencing factors jointly determined the variability of smc at the study site 4 discussion 4 1 effects of environmental factors on eta eta as an important component of water loss from ecosystems is strongly controlled by environmental factors such as vpd lai ws and ta li et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2019 dai et al 2021 about 60 65 of global rainfall is returned to the atmosphere by eta jung et al 2010 sheffield et al 2010 evapotranspiration is the second largest component of the global water cycle on land following precipitation pascolini campbell et al 2021 the amount of p returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in this study was about 50 the runoff in the plains is negligible and another part of water loss may be infiltration to recharge groundwater due to the shallow depth of groundwater burial in the study area it has been suggested that the factors affecting eta are seasonally related in the spring and summer the dominant factor is ws and in the autumn and winter the dominant factor is rn chu et al 2019 however our research demonstrated the dominant control of vpd ssd and lai on eta crops wheat and maize are grown throughout the year in the study area and lai is an important factor influencing evapotranspiration which has been confirmed in the previous studies yan et al 2018 sun et al 2019 han et al 2020 they indicated that hydrological processes near the land surface are more sensitive to changes in vegetation the transpiration and evaporation of the crop increased sharply with the increase of vpd when vpd increases to a certain level vpd 16 hpa the crop will close the stomata to maintain the water balance thus reducing transpiration fig s2 liu et al 2019b meanwhile the ssd affects the photosynthesis of crops within a certain range with the increase of ssd the foliar photosynthesis is enhanced and the transpiration of crops is promoted liu et al 2019a 2019b and han et al 2020 suggested that the control of eta by smc was strong in arid areas but the study area in this work received sufficient p and the relative weak control of smc on crop growth resulted in weak control of eta by smc dai et al 2021 smc as a measure of surface state related to the distribution of surface heat fluxes is required for crop growth to absorb large amounts of water and the factor lai appears to be an improvement in available soil water thus the response of eta to smc is mainly reflected by the change in lai han et al 2020 4 2 effects of environmental factors on et0 various studies have already evaluated the impact of environmental factors on et0 goyal 2004 gao et al 2006 we used the brt method to analyze the relative contribution rates of 9 meteorological factors to the et0 at the study site as expected et0 was most affected by vpd 43 1 followed by ssd and lai fig 7 which is consistent with some previous research gao et al 2006 cao and li 2018 however different research sites have different factors that affect the change of et0 the change of et0 was mainly affected by the combined effect of various factors such as temperature ssd and moisture conditions yin et al 2010a 2010b et0 had a strong correlation with the smc of the surface layer 10 cm and the correlation weakened with the increase in depth table s1 however the contribution rate of msmc to et0 was very low 3 1 therefore the influence of 0 10 cm smc on et0 can be properly considered in the future research aa et al 2019 in most basins in the northern china rh or ws is closely related to et0 while ssd is more important in the southern china gao et al 2006 for example the study of the haihe river basin by zhao et al 2014 showed that et0 was most sensitive to rh tabari et al 2012 and shi et al 2017 found that ws was the most important variable leading to changes in et0 in this study ws and rh had relatively little influence on et0 within a certain range et0 increases with vpd 2 ssd 17 hpa while et0 increases with ssd fig s3 although vpd has the greatest effect on et0 the analysis of the 1986 2020 yearbook information reveals that vpd changes weakly in the region therefore the effect of this factor can be ignored when studying the evaporation paradox however with the economic development of the region the aerosol content in the air has increased leading to a significantly decrease in ssd and rs wang et al 2020 in this research the relative contribution rate of ssd to et0 23 is 5 8 times that of ta 4 indicating that et0 is more sensitive to ssd this is a good explanation for the decrease of et0 with the decrease of ssd or the increase of ta climate warming yin et al 2010a 2010b cao et al 2014 consequently it explains the evaporation paradox phenomenon in the study area when the daily rainfall is less than 40 mm d 1 fig s2 et0 remains unchanged at 0 mm d 1 this is somewhat different from the measured results in fig 4 in fact the ecosystem will dynamically adjust the evapotranspiration as the water conditions change and the rainfall days are dominated by free surface evaporation liu and man 2017 nevertheless the value of daily et0 depends on the weather conditions of the day and the time when the daily rainfall occurs 4 3 effects of influence factors on smc the changing pattern of smc at different depths of the study site is basically similar fig 2c which is consistent with the results of other studies li et al 2018 li et al 2019a 2019b through measuring the soil particle size distribution at different depths in the study site it is found that the strong homogeneity of soil texture is the main reason for the change we also used the brt method to analyze the relative contribution of environmental factors to the smc and there is no significant difference in the impact of these factors on the smc at different depths if we divide the environmental factors into aboveground factors and underground factors we can find that the three underground factors gl lai and mts contribute approximately 49 6 to the msmc and contribute between 46 and 66 to the smc at different depths the contribution rate of the other 6 aboveground factors is about 50 our results confirm that among the aboveground factors rh has a great influence on smc while among the underground factors gl lai and ts play a predominant role these results are consistent with previous studies chen and hu 2004 li et al 2019a 2019b the vegetation in the study area is mainly wheat and maize and the roots of the crop are mainly distributed in 0 50 cm the crop growth consumes smc and then groundwater directly recharges smc liu et al 2008 wei et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 in addition temperature changes can promote the flow of groundwater and the leaf area of crops affects rainfall infiltration solar radiation soil evaporation and other processes which have an indirect impact on smc zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 pointed out that the smc of the study site is mainly affected by the gl and has a weak correlation with p which is mainly related to the shallow gl 1 2 m of the study site gou et al 2020 the gl has a strong control effect on the smc in this area at the same time ts affects smc by changing soil evaporation processes when diving evaporation increases the groundwater can replenish the smc making the ts and gl the main factors to in smc cao et al 2014 li et al 2019a 2019b furthermore previous studies indicated that increased rainfall will increase the fluctuation of smc which is the primary factor leading to the temporal and spatial variability of smc wang and singh 2017 therefore we separately studied the relative contribution of rainfall in the rainy and non rainy seasons to smc during the rainy season june september the smc fluctuates greatly especially in 2018 mainly because several heavy rain events occurred during this period causing the smc to increase sharply fig 2c however the contribution of p to smc is relatively small fig s9 and fig s10 these results were inconsistent with those achieved by wang et al 2018 who demonstrated that p plays a more important role in explaining smc changes the possible reason is that the study site is in an area of intermittent p of high intensity and short duration han et al 2012 therefore p has a short term effect on smc but does make smc change drastically this change affects smc for a short time while gl rh lai and mts have long term effects on smc according to liu et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 there is no significant correlation between p and smc and smc is more affected by previous rainfall than simultaneous rainfall the impact of rainfall on smc is not only related to rainfall but many factors such as rainfall intensity and rainfall duration kantharao and rakesh 2018 holgate et al 2019 taken together these results suggest that different environmental factors control smc it is noteworthy that this control effect is extremely critical for predicting future changes in smc current research results indicate that global warming and extreme rainfall events have increased but the number of rainfall events has decreased which will further intensify the control of temperature on smc and weaken the control of p on smc papalexiou and montanari 2019 further research should be undertaken to investigate the control effect of temperature ta and ts and other factors vegetation type tillage system and soil texture on smc li et al 2017 acharya et al 2019 5 conclusions in this investigation based on the high precision automatic monitoring and environmental field observation data sets from 2017 to 2018 the aim was to assess the applicability of the machine learning methods brt in predicting eta et0 and smc and to analyze the relative contribution rate of different environmental factors to eta et0 and smc the main conclusions are as follows 1 the brt algorithm could be applied well in the research site to investigate the relative control of different environmental factors on eta et0 and smc r2 0 93 2 about 50 of the rainfall in the study area was returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and the vpd ssd and lai played an important role in controlling eta and et0 followed by ta the findings contribute to the understanding of the evaporation paradox phenomenon that occurred in the study area the msmc had little control on eta crop growth absorbs large amounts of soil water and the effect of soil water on eta is reflected by changes in lai 3 among the underground factors gl and lai played a dominant role in the relative contribution of smc among the aboveground factors rh and ts have a great influence on smc this result could be attributed to the increase of soil evaporation due to the increase of ts in this area while the gl was shallow enough to supply smc in time 4 the differences of the smc at different depths were determined by many factors including lai vpd and p however there are still many unresolved issues regarding the synergy between various influencing factors on eta et0 and smc control especially in the context of climate warming the interaction of temperature ta and ts and other factors controls eta et0 and smc declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study has been financially supported by the

1376,evapotranspiration and soil moisture content smc are key elements of the hydrological cycle accurate prediction of the dynamic processes of evapotranspiration and soil water is essential for irrigation and water management here the boosted regression tree brt method was employed to quantify environmental controls on actual evapotranspiration eta potential evapotranspiration et0 and smc using monitoring data from the wudaogou hydrological experimental station the results indicated that 1 the brt algorithm was effective in predicting the relative control of different environmental factors on eta et0 and smc and 2 vapor pressure deficit vpd was the most important factor affecting daily et0 and sunshine duration ssd also played a nonnegligible role the results further explained the phenomenon of the evaporation paradox in the study area ssd could be a leading control on daily eta followed by vpd leaf area index lai 3 among the underground factors groundwater level gl and lai played a dominant role in the relative contribution to smc among the aboveground factors relative humidity rh and soil temperature ts have a relatively large influence on smc 4 the differences in smc at different depths were determined by multiple influencing factors including lai vpd and precipitation p this study also underscores the importance of vegetation variations to hydrological cycle processes in general climate warming and an increase in extreme rainfall events will increase the control of temperature on smc and weaken the control of p on smc in the future keywords evapotranspiration soil moisture content boosted regression tree environmental factors wudaogou experimental station 1 introduction climate change has become a vital environmental science factor that greatly affects the natural hydrological cycle including evapotranspiration rainfall and runoff sun et al 2011 shi et al 2017 selten et al 2020 padrón et al 2020 pascolini campbell et al 2021 global land evapotranspiration has increased by about 10 due to rising temperature pascolini campbell et al 2021 actual evapotranspiration eta which is composed of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a crucial link between ecological and hydrological processes and an important part of surface water and heat balance berg et al 2016 chen et al 2017 hussain et al 2019 eta is the main factor that affects regional climate which transfers water from the surface with vegetation and it is also influenced by various factors of the environment and crops physiological characteristics of vegetation xin et al 2008 a et al aa et al 2019 granata et al 2020 due to the complexity of the land plant atmosphere system direct measurement of eta is time consuming and costly and difficult to conduct on a regional scale ning et al 2018 eddy correlation method is considered to be the most effective method for measuring eta which provides instantaneous heat fluxes and calculates hourly eta feng et al 2017 however due to its high cost many regions do not have the conditions to conduct zhang et al 2018 the commonly used method to estimate eta is to use potential evapotranspiration et0 and budyko framework to improve the accuracy of eta estimation it is crucial to understand the influence of environmental factors on eta liu et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2019 the diffusion of water vapor in the atmosphere is enhanced by vapor pressure deficit vpd and wind speed ws granata 2019 thus solar radiation ra air temperature ta relative humidity rh and ws are the main climatic parameters that influence the evaporation process granata 2019 ma et al 2019 assessed the influence of climate and vegetation on eta during the restoration period on the loess plateau and concluded that ws and vegetation cover were the two major driving factors of eta changes in addition et0 has been universally used in water resources research and management yin et al 2010a 2010b saggi and jain 2018 the food and agriculture organization fao recommended a standard method penman monteith for calculating et0 allen et al 1998 which has already been widely adopted in some studies suleiman et al 2007 gundalia and dholakia 2017 a growing body of research has revealed the impact of meteorological factors on et0 the relationship between temperature and et0 is interesting because the et0 is expected to increase with temperature however a reduction in et0 has been observed in many areas over recent decades mcvicar et al 2012 shi et al 2017 the discrepancy between observed and expected evaporation is called the evaporation paradox roderick and farquhar 2002 though great efforts have been made to understand the paradox and cause of et0 tebakari et al 2005 rayner 2007 mozny et al 2020 the mechanism of the phenomenon remains unclear and different regions have different influencing factors for example some studies have pointed out that the differences are mainly due to changes in sunshine duration ssd ws and rh rayner 2007 shi et al 2017 soroush et al 2020 roderick et al 2007 attributed the decrease in pan evaporation to changes in basic physical variables in addition to the above factors soil moisture content smc is an important element affecting et0 and eta and it is also essential in determining soil surface water and energy flux vereecken et al 2008 wang and singh 2017 a et al aa et al 2019 however due to its strong temporal and spatial variability smc interacts with a variety of environmental factors including soil characteristics meteorological conditions and groundwater level in a complex and non linear manner making it difficult to accurately predict vereecken et al 2007 gao et al 2012 generally the temporal and spatial variability of smc changes significantly as soil depth increases some researchers have also tried to determine the relationship between smc and meteorological conditions groundwater level gl reference to the mean sea level of the yellow sea and other factors and analyze the influence and mutual feedback of these factors on smc chen and hu 2004 tuttle and salvucci 2016 for example ma et al 2004 said smc was significantly affected by light intensity and ws at the plot scale and sample point scale yu et al 2013 considered that smc was mainly affected by precipitation p soil temperature ts and rh in short the interaction of different environmental factors has a significant impact on eta et0 and smc despite the great advances the previous studies made there is still a lack of quantification of the relative influence of various environmental factors on eta et0 and smc liu et al 2019a 2019b han et al 2020 machine learning methods applied to the field of hydrometeorology are considered to be valuable as it represents a powerful tool capable of providing accurate forecasts granata 2019 granata et al 2020 therefore the boosted regression tree brt method was used to simulate evapotranspiration and soil water changes in addition previous studies have considered changes in et0 or eta separately while the analysis of trends in the difference between et0 and actual eta in the same area needs further development liu et al 2019a 2019b the specific objectives of our study were 1 to determine the applicability of the brt method in predicting eta et0 and smc at different depths of the research site 2 to quantify the relative contribution of environmental factors on eta et0 and smc and 3 to determine the influence of environmental factors on the difference of the smc at different depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study the wudaogou hydrological experimental station 117 21 e 33 9 n of xinmaqiao township guzhen county bengbu city anhui province was selected as a typical hydrological station which is located in the south of wanbei plain wbp fig 1a and fig 1b the mean annual rainfall is 884 7 mm 1970 2017 which is unevenly distributed within the year the annual rainfall is mainly concentrated in june to september of which the rainfall during the flood season accounts for about 60 to 70 of the annual rainfall han et al 2012 the annual average water surface evaporation is 1011 mm 1970 2017 the annual average temperature is 14 9 c and the average annual ssd is 1837 9 h wang et al 2020 the soil type of the station is lime concretion black soil and the soil texture is silty clay where the particle composition is clay 0 002 mm accounting for 13 1 silt 0 02 0 002 mm accounting for 49 4 and sand 2 0 02 mm accounting for 37 5 the wbp is a crop production area and the experimental station is located in a cropping field the hydrology and crop growth conditions in the area represent the average conditions of the wbp gou et al 2020 therefore it was selected as a typical representative station in the wbp to study the influence of environmental factors on et0 and smc 2 2 data description and preprocessing the data sets used in the study are divided into three groups the first group is the manual observation data from the meteorological field of the experimental station fig 1c the measurement elements include p ts 0 5 10 15 20 40 80 160 and 320 cm and ssd the p was measured by the standard rain gauge daily observation data at 8 00 am the ts is observed 3 times per day at 8 00 am 2 00 pm and 8 00 pm respectively and the ssd was measured by the sunshine meter daily observation data at 20 00 pm the second group is the automatic observation data of the high precision automatic monitoring system in the meteorological field fig 1c and fig 1d the equipment was mounted at the height of 2 m above the ground surface a series of meteorological variables were recorded including ra net radiation rn ta rh pressure wind direction wd and wind speed ws soil heat flux gs and smc were also measured on the system the soil water sensor was installed to measure the smc at various depths 10 20 30 and 40 cm by converting soil dielectric permittivity into smc all data were collected every 10 mins and then integrated into daily values and the subsequent analysis was based on the daily scale the third data group came from the automatic observation well of gl outside the meteorological field fig 1c the distance between the well and the system was about 50 m groundwater level data was also integrated to daily values the meteorological field observation data series of the station was longer 1986 2020 but the high precision automatic monitoring system was installed in 2016 the instrument has been in regular use since november 2016 and was previously in the commissioning phase to maintain the consistency of the data series this study chose the series length to be the two year data from 2017 to 2018 which had the best quality the leaf area index lai data were used to assess the effect of vegetation cover on eta which were derived from the modis satellite data https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov with a temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 m the 8 day lai data were linearly interpolated to daily values before further analysis note that outliers of manual observation and automatic observation data were excluded and then linear interpolation was used to fill the blank data missing data is mainly from 10 mins time with linear interpolation using the integrated 1 day s data if there are many missing if there are few missing data then interpolation is done by using the 10 mins time data before and after the penman monteith p m model revised by the fao in 1998 allen et al 1998 was used to calculate et0 and eta which were calculated as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 et a k c et 0 where et 0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux concentration mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t mean is the mean air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s and e a are saturated vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure respectively kpa et a is actual crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 k c is the crop coefficient including wheat and maize yuan et al 2018 liu et al 2020 2 3 analysis methods the boosted regression tree brt method was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of environmental factors to evapotranspiration and soil water content in the wbp this method was developed by elith et al 2008 and combines the boosting technique with the regression tree method to study the relationship between prediction variables and response variables elith et al 2008 arabameri et al 2019 the brt is a machine learning algorithm that uses the recursive binary splitting method it fits all the data for the observation value based on the tree fitting model through which the model first identifies the observations with poor modeling effect and then adds new trees to improve the modeling effect until the difference between the predicted and observed value reaches the minimum elith et al 2008 it has the advantage of handling different types of predictors and accommodating missing values sun et al 2019 compared with the regression method of a single prediction model the brt model is more suitable for multiple simple models and combining them for prediction thereby improving the prediction performance buston and elith 2011 accordingly it is widely used in different scientific fields to determine the relative importance of different predictors salazara et al 2016 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2019a 2019b the brt model has four key parameters tree complexity tc bag fraction bf learning rate lr and the number of trees nt the parameter tc controls the structure of the tree the parameter bf represents the proportion of data selected at each step the parameter lr determines the contribution of each tree to the final fitted model and the parameter nt represents the number of trees required for the model to reach the optimal prediction in this study we calculated the relative importance of the variables by running the brt model using the gbm package in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 a brief description of the model is given in this research and detailed information can be found in elith et al 2008 the brt model has a better effect on predicting multiple non collinear variables the multiple collinearities of the predictor variables and the higher autocorrelation of the response variable can lead to data overfitting which will affect the prediction effect of the brt model to solve this problem it is essential to analyze the multicollinearity between the predictor variable and the response variable according to pearson s correlation coefficient r p 0 8 and variance expansion factor vif 10 aertsen et al 2010 sun et al 2019 before running the brt model the multicollinearity tests of all predictor variables and response variables are presented in the supplemental tables s1 and s2 the environmental influencing factors with acceptable levels of multicollinearity were selected for brt analysis the environmental influencing factors are provided in table s2 the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to estimate the differences between the observed and modeled values according to the multiple linearity test results the appropriate response variables for prediction were selected and different combinations of each parameter value tc e g 4 5 6 and 7 bf e g 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 75 and lr e g 0 05 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 were used to determine the optimal prediction result of the model the prediction effect of the brt model was evaluated using a 10 fold cross validated method elith et al 2008 first the data set was split randomly into 10 equal subsets 9 of which were chosen to construct the model as the training set and then the remaining subset was used to evaluate the performance of the model this process was repeated 10 times to obtain the final model prediction results the final optimal parameter values of tc bf and lr were 7 0 05 and 0 01 respectively table s3 to determine which environmental factors lead to differences in smc in different soil layers we calculated the contribution differences ctdf sun et al 2019 as 3 ctdf f m x f n x f n x where f m x and f n x are the relative contribution of environmental factor x calculated by the brt model to the soil water content of the mth and nth layer respectively 3 results 3 1 dynamics of hydrometeorological factors of the study site the average daily eta showed strong fluctuations with the average of 1 9 0 12 mm d 1 and a maximum value occurring in august or september fig 2a the values here and below represent the mean sd the average daily et0 was 1 8 0 07 mm d 1 and the paired sample t test indicated that daily et0 was less than daily eta p 0 05 n 649 the average annual eta was 611 57 mm and about 50 of p was returned to the atmosphere through via evapotranspiration the average annual et0 was 664 25 mm the annual et0 was less than the water surface evaporation in the area this research had shown that the p m model underestimated the daily et0 by 21 29 azhar and perera 2011 the temperature of different soil layers shows interesting characteristics fig 2b from april to august the temperature decreases with the increase of soil depth and from september to march of the following year the temperature increases with the increase of soil depth the daily mean soil temperature mts at different depths showed clear seasonal monotonic patterns with the maximum occurring in july or august as for inter annual variability the rainfall in 2018 is 300 mm more than that in 2017 with annual rainfall of 1202 155 mm which exceeds the multi year average rainfall of 885 mm fig 2c the maximum daily rainfall in 2017 was 100 mm while the maximum daily rainfall in 2018 reached 225 mm 70 year return period the rainfall varies greatly within the year with june to september accounting for 64 4 of the annual total at the same time the rainfall in 2018 increased due to the influence of a typhoon soil depth significantly affected the temporal and spatial distribution of smc xu et al 2017 moreover the smc at different depths had a good response to rainfall fig 2c the smc generally increased with depth from 0 to 40 cm with no significant differences between 10 and 20 cm but significant differences between 10 and 30 cm and 40 cm smc but the coefficient of variation cv value is between 10 and 20 which is the sub active layer chen et al 2008 the results of the variance test showed that there was a significant difference in smc at different depths p 0 01 the ta shows an obvious seasonal variation with an annual average of 15 69 0 02 c fig 3a while the atmospheric pressure changes in a small range over time the average annual vpd at the site was 7 0 0 7 hpa rh ws and ssd show weaker seasonal variations than ta and vpd the correlation coefficient between the average ts and ta reaches 0 95 p 0 01 table s1 global warming has a significant impact on ts and changes in ts can also indirectly reflect changes in ta bergh and linder 1999 hu and feng 2003 the annual average of lai was slightly greater in 2017 than in 2018 fig 3d since the land cover of the station is dominated by crops and the heavy rainfall in 2018 led to crop flooding and death due to the short installation time of the groundwater level observation well there was a partial lack of gl fig 3j it can be seen from the existing data that the gl in 2017 had a small amplitude while the gl in 2018 changed drastically especially in august due to its heavy rain the average gl in this station was 18 5 0 04 m in addition there was a delay in the response of gl changes to p for example after several consecutive days of p the gl slowly rises and the gl suddenly rises to a peak after 2 days there appears to be evidence to indicate that the delayed effect was affected by rainfall intensity initial smc and gl zang et al 2017 3 2 effects of environmental factors on eta et0 and smc 3 2 1 relationships between eta et0 and environmental factors before quantitatively analyzing the impact of environmental elements on eta et0 we first analyzed the relationship between 13 environmental elements including ta rn ra and mean soil moisture content msmc and eta et0 the results showed that eta et0 increased with the increase of ta ra rn gs ssd mts and vpd fig 4 the ssd had the greatest correlation with et0 with a correlation coefficient of 0 6 p 0 01 also when ssd 0 the trend of eta et0 increasing with the increase of ssd was more obvious et0 was negatively correlated with the rh atmospheric pressure and msmc when rh 80 the decreasing trend of et0 was very weak when 0 p 40 mm d 1 eta et0 displayed a decreasing trend interestingly when p 60 mm d 1 the eta et0 value is not close to 0 the main reason is that most of the rainfall events in this area occur at night or early in the morning for example it can be seen from the 2018 yearbook data that the water surface evaporation was 3 mm when the maximum daily rainfall occurs 3 2 2 relationships between smc and environmental factors it can be seen that the smc had greater correlations with the four factors of rh p ssd and gl but the smc decreased as the ssd increased fig 5 and fig s1 table s1 meanwhile the correlations between 30 cm smc and ta gs atmospheric pressure and 30 cm ts were greater than that at other depths however the correlation between 10 cm smc and vpd was greater than at other depths in addition when 0 p 60 mm d 1 the smc increased with the increase of p while the smc changes very little when p 60 mm d 1 consequently p 60 mm d 1 may be the threshold for smc changes smc went through three stages with the change of gl first it changed steadily 16 gl 17 6 m then increased rapidly 17 6 gl 20 m and finally remained stable 20 gl 24 m therefore smc was very sensitive to the gl in the second stage especially 0 30 cm smc since water smc is indispensable during the growth of crops the gl can indirectly reflect the growth of crops which is very important for farmland water management lei et al 2020 in order to analyze the impact of p on smc we examined the relationship between p in the rainy season and smc fig 2c and found that the sharp increase in smc was related to the p in the same period the cv value of smc at different depths in 2018 was greater than that in 2017 indicating that the smc in 2018 fluctuated greatly this is mainly due to the heavier rainfall was more frequent in 2018 resulted in large fluctuations on smc 3 3 control of influence factors on eta et0 and smc 3 3 1 environmental controls on eta et0 in the study area we evaluated the multicollinearity between environmental factors and selected variables with acceptable levels of multicollinearity i e r p 0 8 and vif 10 for brt analysis table s1 hence atmospheric pressure ra and mts were excluded and ta rh rn gs ws p ssd vpd and msmc were selected as the predictive variables of the brt model the model test presented that the coefficient of certainty r2 for eta and et0 were 0 92 and 0 93 p 0 01 respectively for eta the mae and rmse are 0 22 and 0 30 respectively and for et0 the mae and rmse are 0 17 and 0 22 respectively fig 6a the modeled eta et0 showed good agreement with the observations illustrating the feasibility of the brt model in the study area in order to further evaluate the relative contribution rate of influencing factors to eta et0 the analysis results of the brt model were shown in fig 7 the ssd vpd and lai were the main factors affecting eta variations that ssd vpd and lai explained 57 6 of total variation in daily eta during the research period however the p exerted slight impact on daily eta 4 when the p exceeds 40 mm d 1 the daily eta was 0 fig s2 et0 is mainly controlled by three factors vpd 43 1 ssd 23 0 and lai 6 7 fig 7 simultaneously the ta has a high correlation with atmospheric pressure and mts r p 0 9 and p 0 01 with the increase in temperature the gas molecules would spread around then the number of gas molecules in the region would be reduced thus contributing to the decrease in pressure which indirectly reflect that atmospheric pressure and mts also have a strong influence on et0 other predictive variables such as ta gs p rh msmc rn and ws have little effect on the et0 of the site with a relative contribution rate of less than 6 also it can be seen from the partial dependency graph that when 2 vpd 17 hpa et0 increased sharply with the increase of vpd while it increased in a stepped manner when 1 ssd 12 h fig s3 3 3 2 environmental controls on smc in the study area we also used the brt model to evaluate the relative contribution of environmental factors rh rn gs ws p ssd vpd ts and gl to 10 cm smc 20 cm smc 30 cm smc 40 cm smc and the msmc the high coefficient of determination r2 0 99 p 0 01 and the low value of rmse 0 08 0 22 and mae 0 06 0 16 indicated the good agreement between the modeled and observed smc fig 6b cosh et al 2008 demonstrated that rmse was less than 2 in smc prediction and the prediction result was reliable it can be found from fig 8 that the gl and ts were the main influencing factors gl and lai had the highest relative contribution rates to msmc 0 40 cm both at 19 2 followed by rh 12 2 and mts 11 4 especially when the gl is in the range of 17 20 m the msmc changes strongly fig s4 other factors have less influence on the msmc and most of them contribute less than 10 we also analyzed the influence of environmental factors on smc at different depths fig 8 in these cases gl and lai were also the main factors controlling smc at 10 cm and 20 cm with the total contribution rate of 41 4 and 36 2 respectively gl ts and lai were the main factors controlling smc at 30 cm and 40 cm with the total contribution rate of 66 and 51 7 respectively overall the primary controlling factor of 40 cm smc was gl and the main controlling factor of smc at other depths was lai as the soil depth increased the relative contribution rate of the gl increased when 17 gl 20 m the smc at different soil depths increased rapidly figs s5 s8 3 4 differences of smc at different depths to explore the differences in the impact of environmental factors on smc at different depths we calculated the ctdf eq 4 between smc at different depths fig 9 the results showed that the difference in smc between 10 and 20 cm was mainly caused by p and the difference in smc of 10 30 cm was mainly caused by vpd and rh followed by rn and vpd the difference in smc between 10 and 40 cm and 20 40 cm can be mainly attributed to the lai ts and vpd the difference in smc of 20 30 cm was mainly caused by p vpd and rh and the difference in smc of 30 40 cm was mainly due to lai in conclusion the differences in smc at different depths were determined by a number of influencing factors including ts lai vpd rh and p these results suggested that the spatial heterogeneity of multiple influencing factors jointly determined the variability of smc at the study site 4 discussion 4 1 effects of environmental factors on eta eta as an important component of water loss from ecosystems is strongly controlled by environmental factors such as vpd lai ws and ta li et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2019 dai et al 2021 about 60 65 of global rainfall is returned to the atmosphere by eta jung et al 2010 sheffield et al 2010 evapotranspiration is the second largest component of the global water cycle on land following precipitation pascolini campbell et al 2021 the amount of p returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in this study was about 50 the runoff in the plains is negligible and another part of water loss may be infiltration to recharge groundwater due to the shallow depth of groundwater burial in the study area it has been suggested that the factors affecting eta are seasonally related in the spring and summer the dominant factor is ws and in the autumn and winter the dominant factor is rn chu et al 2019 however our research demonstrated the dominant control of vpd ssd and lai on eta crops wheat and maize are grown throughout the year in the study area and lai is an important factor influencing evapotranspiration which has been confirmed in the previous studies yan et al 2018 sun et al 2019 han et al 2020 they indicated that hydrological processes near the land surface are more sensitive to changes in vegetation the transpiration and evaporation of the crop increased sharply with the increase of vpd when vpd increases to a certain level vpd 16 hpa the crop will close the stomata to maintain the water balance thus reducing transpiration fig s2 liu et al 2019b meanwhile the ssd affects the photosynthesis of crops within a certain range with the increase of ssd the foliar photosynthesis is enhanced and the transpiration of crops is promoted liu et al 2019a 2019b and han et al 2020 suggested that the control of eta by smc was strong in arid areas but the study area in this work received sufficient p and the relative weak control of smc on crop growth resulted in weak control of eta by smc dai et al 2021 smc as a measure of surface state related to the distribution of surface heat fluxes is required for crop growth to absorb large amounts of water and the factor lai appears to be an improvement in available soil water thus the response of eta to smc is mainly reflected by the change in lai han et al 2020 4 2 effects of environmental factors on et0 various studies have already evaluated the impact of environmental factors on et0 goyal 2004 gao et al 2006 we used the brt method to analyze the relative contribution rates of 9 meteorological factors to the et0 at the study site as expected et0 was most affected by vpd 43 1 followed by ssd and lai fig 7 which is consistent with some previous research gao et al 2006 cao and li 2018 however different research sites have different factors that affect the change of et0 the change of et0 was mainly affected by the combined effect of various factors such as temperature ssd and moisture conditions yin et al 2010a 2010b et0 had a strong correlation with the smc of the surface layer 10 cm and the correlation weakened with the increase in depth table s1 however the contribution rate of msmc to et0 was very low 3 1 therefore the influence of 0 10 cm smc on et0 can be properly considered in the future research aa et al 2019 in most basins in the northern china rh or ws is closely related to et0 while ssd is more important in the southern china gao et al 2006 for example the study of the haihe river basin by zhao et al 2014 showed that et0 was most sensitive to rh tabari et al 2012 and shi et al 2017 found that ws was the most important variable leading to changes in et0 in this study ws and rh had relatively little influence on et0 within a certain range et0 increases with vpd 2 ssd 17 hpa while et0 increases with ssd fig s3 although vpd has the greatest effect on et0 the analysis of the 1986 2020 yearbook information reveals that vpd changes weakly in the region therefore the effect of this factor can be ignored when studying the evaporation paradox however with the economic development of the region the aerosol content in the air has increased leading to a significantly decrease in ssd and rs wang et al 2020 in this research the relative contribution rate of ssd to et0 23 is 5 8 times that of ta 4 indicating that et0 is more sensitive to ssd this is a good explanation for the decrease of et0 with the decrease of ssd or the increase of ta climate warming yin et al 2010a 2010b cao et al 2014 consequently it explains the evaporation paradox phenomenon in the study area when the daily rainfall is less than 40 mm d 1 fig s2 et0 remains unchanged at 0 mm d 1 this is somewhat different from the measured results in fig 4 in fact the ecosystem will dynamically adjust the evapotranspiration as the water conditions change and the rainfall days are dominated by free surface evaporation liu and man 2017 nevertheless the value of daily et0 depends on the weather conditions of the day and the time when the daily rainfall occurs 4 3 effects of influence factors on smc the changing pattern of smc at different depths of the study site is basically similar fig 2c which is consistent with the results of other studies li et al 2018 li et al 2019a 2019b through measuring the soil particle size distribution at different depths in the study site it is found that the strong homogeneity of soil texture is the main reason for the change we also used the brt method to analyze the relative contribution of environmental factors to the smc and there is no significant difference in the impact of these factors on the smc at different depths if we divide the environmental factors into aboveground factors and underground factors we can find that the three underground factors gl lai and mts contribute approximately 49 6 to the msmc and contribute between 46 and 66 to the smc at different depths the contribution rate of the other 6 aboveground factors is about 50 our results confirm that among the aboveground factors rh has a great influence on smc while among the underground factors gl lai and ts play a predominant role these results are consistent with previous studies chen and hu 2004 li et al 2019a 2019b the vegetation in the study area is mainly wheat and maize and the roots of the crop are mainly distributed in 0 50 cm the crop growth consumes smc and then groundwater directly recharges smc liu et al 2008 wei et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 in addition temperature changes can promote the flow of groundwater and the leaf area of crops affects rainfall infiltration solar radiation soil evaporation and other processes which have an indirect impact on smc zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 pointed out that the smc of the study site is mainly affected by the gl and has a weak correlation with p which is mainly related to the shallow gl 1 2 m of the study site gou et al 2020 the gl has a strong control effect on the smc in this area at the same time ts affects smc by changing soil evaporation processes when diving evaporation increases the groundwater can replenish the smc making the ts and gl the main factors to in smc cao et al 2014 li et al 2019a 2019b furthermore previous studies indicated that increased rainfall will increase the fluctuation of smc which is the primary factor leading to the temporal and spatial variability of smc wang and singh 2017 therefore we separately studied the relative contribution of rainfall in the rainy and non rainy seasons to smc during the rainy season june september the smc fluctuates greatly especially in 2018 mainly because several heavy rain events occurred during this period causing the smc to increase sharply fig 2c however the contribution of p to smc is relatively small fig s9 and fig s10 these results were inconsistent with those achieved by wang et al 2018 who demonstrated that p plays a more important role in explaining smc changes the possible reason is that the study site is in an area of intermittent p of high intensity and short duration han et al 2012 therefore p has a short term effect on smc but does make smc change drastically this change affects smc for a short time while gl rh lai and mts have long term effects on smc according to liu et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 there is no significant correlation between p and smc and smc is more affected by previous rainfall than simultaneous rainfall the impact of rainfall on smc is not only related to rainfall but many factors such as rainfall intensity and rainfall duration kantharao and rakesh 2018 holgate et al 2019 taken together these results suggest that different environmental factors control smc it is noteworthy that this control effect is extremely critical for predicting future changes in smc current research results indicate that global warming and extreme rainfall events have increased but the number of rainfall events has decreased which will further intensify the control of temperature on smc and weaken the control of p on smc papalexiou and montanari 2019 further research should be undertaken to investigate the control effect of temperature ta and ts and other factors vegetation type tillage system and soil texture on smc li et al 2017 acharya et al 2019 5 conclusions in this investigation based on the high precision automatic monitoring and environmental field observation data sets from 2017 to 2018 the aim was to assess the applicability of the machine learning methods brt in predicting eta et0 and smc and to analyze the relative contribution rate of different environmental factors to eta et0 and smc the main conclusions are as follows 1 the brt algorithm could be applied well in the research site to investigate the relative control of different environmental factors on eta et0 and smc r2 0 93 2 about 50 of the rainfall in the study area was returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and the vpd ssd and lai played an important role in controlling eta and et0 followed by ta the findings contribute to the understanding of the evaporation paradox phenomenon that occurred in the study area the msmc had little control on eta crop growth absorbs large amounts of soil water and the effect of soil water on eta is reflected by changes in lai 3 among the underground factors gl and lai played a dominant role in the relative contribution of smc among the aboveground factors rh and ts have a great influence on smc this result could be attributed to the increase of soil evaporation due to the increase of ts in this area while the gl was shallow enough to supply smc in time 4 the differences of the smc at different depths were determined by many factors including lai vpd and p however there are still many unresolved issues regarding the synergy between various influencing factors on eta et0 and smc control especially in the context of climate warming the interaction of temperature ta and ts and other factors controls eta et0 and smc declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study has been financially supported by the

1377,irrigation systems play vital roles not only in food production but also in supporting ecosystems understanding how the ecosystem has evolved in response to human activities is crucial for sustainable food production especially for arid and semi arid regions in this study we examined the trends of vegetation growth on a monthly basis in the ancient yellow river irrigation system in ningxia china we used the leaf area index lai to characterize the vegetation growth from 2007 to 2019 the lai trends were associated with a series of driving forces explaining the spatial and temporal change of vegetation growth with the provision of the wilks feature importance method 2 month averaged air temperature and irrigation were identified as the two most important variables for monthly lai simulation future climate projections based on the regional climate model system regcm suggested dryer and longer summers under the rcp 8 5 scenario these changes will increase the crop water demand during the growing months in the future water conflict might be further intensified in may in which the present irrigation water has already led to a decreased crop growth our findings demonstrated that the mann kendall monthly trend analysis could provide more helpful information for monitoring the vegetation growth than the trend analysis on a yearly and seasonal basis keywords leaf area index mann kendall trend analysis stepwise clustered analysis reginal climate model projection 1 introduction traditional irrigation systems have evolved from the simple function of delivering water resources for food production raheem et al 2015 these systems now also play vital roles in providing ecological services especially in arid and semi arid regions where nature restoration alone cannot amend the degrading ecosystems owing to intensive human activities therefore understanding the underlying mechanisms for ecosystem evolutions is critical in improving the capacities of irrigation systems however due to the complexity of irrigation systems and the uncertainty of climate change current understandings for ecosystem evolutions in irrigation systems are still limited gregory et al 2018 liu et al 2009 mu 2000 consequently it is much desired to precisely describe the changes of ecosystems temporally and spatially and identify the key influencing factors in response to these changes leaf area index lai is one of the essential biophysical variables for characterizing land surface ecosystems jiang et al 2010 it is defined as the one sided green leaf area per unit ground area in needle leaf vegetation lai is defined as the projected needle leaf area per unit ground area buermann et al 2002 lai is closely linked to many key ecological processes such as photosynthesis transpiration carbon and nutrient cycle as well as evapotranspiration thus lai is widely used to estimate net primary productivity and other quantities chen and cihlar 1996 jiang et al 2010 from the perspective of earth sciences lai affects the exchange of substance energy and momentum between the land surface and atmosphere monteith and unsworth 2013 and serves as critical input or key variable in most simulation models of climate hydrology and biogeochemistry karimi 2020 yin 2017 the two predominant approaches to obtain the lai are ground based and remote sensing rs based approaches breda 2003 even though the ground based method for measuring lai is more accurate than the rs based one it only suitable for a small scale yin et al 2017 for most earth science related studies rs based lai products are much preferred for their availability for long term large scale and continuous observations rs based lai products are routinely produced from various satellite data such as modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer spot vegetation multiangle imaging spectroradiometer misr and so on jiang et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 these lai time series products have been used to examine the dynamic changes of vegetation cover and associated ecosystems from a global perspective alton 2018 examined the decadal trends through linear regression in photosynthetic capacity and lai to ascertain the biochemical and structural responses of vegetation to environmental change they found that the decadal trends were of a sufficient magnitude to influence vegetation productivity and carbon uptake zhu et al 2017 investigated the seasonal mean lai trends at northern latitudes north of 30 n between 1982 and 2009 using three rs based lai products they found that climate change controls the spatial pattern of seasonal lai trends and dominates the increase in seasonal lai in the northern high latitudes jiang et al 2017 compared four long term global lai products in terms of trends interannual variabilities and uncertainty variations from 1982 through 2011 rasul et al 2020 examined the trend and linear regression modeling of lai derived from the modis data in their study the relationships between lai and lst were assessed across the continents more recently cortés et al 2021 employed the mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 to detect the annual trend of lai globally with the time span of 2000 2018 they reported evidence for an increasing seasonal amplitude in lai north of 35 n from a regional perspective yin et al 2017 used the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method and the gimms lai dataset from 1982 to 2010 to analyze the nonlinear feature and spatial difference of forest lai over china for the past 29 years their results indicated that the national averaged forest lai was characterized by quasi 3 and quasi 7 year oscillations which generally exhibited a rising trend with an increasing rate liang et al 2015 investigated the spatial temporal characteristics and interrelationships of the vegetation dynamics and climate variability in xinjiang province china using the glass lai dataset and a gridded meteorological dataset from 1982 2012 their results suggested a significant increasing trend of vegetation growth in the oases and a significant decreasing trend of vegetation growth in certain areas reygadas et al 2019 detected forest degradation by analyzing the trend component of the time series of lai collected by the modis over central mexico from 2002 to 2017 more recently zhang et al 2021 explored vegetation stability tendency and sustainability in the three river source region china with multiple methods based on the 2000 2017 glass lai product in their results differentiation patterns of lai variations and multiyear mean lai value under different topographic factors were investigated even though the studies mentioned above have provided concrete frameworks for detecting lai trends and the associated driving forces most of these assessment efforts focused on interannual lai trends reygadas et al 2019 yuan 2021 zhang 2021 only one of these studies focused on the seasonal averaged lai trends zhu et al 2017 there has been no attempt to evaluate the trends of monthly averaged lai in fact assessing the trends of monthly averaged lai is critical for understanding the relationships between the land surface and atmosphere at a finer temporal resolution it is acknowledged that climate change not only influences the annual mean values of climate variables but also influences the interannual climate variability shrestha and wang 2020 wang et al 2006 the frequencies and extremes of climatic indices may impose a much larger impact on vegetation growth than the annual mean values do alton 2018 in irrigated watersheds understanding the interannual climate variability on a monthly basis is more important than pristine watersheds because one wants to know the exact time to begin planting relating trends of monthly averaged lai with the associated driving forces can improve our understanding of its underlying mechanism therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the trends of monthly averaged lai in an irrigated watershed and explore its potential driving forces in terms of qualitative and quantitative manners the objective entails 1 detecting the trend of monthly modis lai time series in the ancient yellow river irrigation system china from 2007 to 2019 2 investigating the potential driving forces of the monthly lai change through correlation analysis to understand the temporal and spatial changes of vegetation growth 3 modeling monthly lai with the stepwise clustered ensemble sce to identify the relative importance of several contributing variables and 4 inferring the future changes for the vegetation growth based on the climate projections from regional climate model regcm 2 the ancient yellow river irrigation system the ancient yellow river irrigation system ayris in ningxia is the oldest yellow river irrigation system in north china with a total area of 660 000 ha and an irrigated area of 552 000 ha the ayris has been well documented since 215 bce in the qin dynasty zhang and deng 1987 when the first settlers opened canals from the yellow river and started irrigation during the successive 2000 years the irrigation systems had been advanced significantly from 1722 to 1735 in the qing dynasty it became a sophisticated irrigation system serving an irrigation area of 146 700 ha lu 2019 the construction of qingtongxia dam in 1959 tremendously advanced the irrigation system by elevating the water head and the irrigation area was increased to 330 000 ha the ayris has been recognized as a world irrigation heritage in 2017 international commission on irrigation and drainage as the west part of the ayris the study area is located at the west alluvial plain of the yellow river crisscrossed by six main irrigation canals and numerous drainages fig 1 shows the detailed layout of the ayris this area is endowed for the abundant heat i e 10c above the accumulative temperature ranges from 3200c to 3400c during the farming season i e april to september the adequate radiation i e 148 cal cm2 a and the long non frost days i e 164 days in average these natural advantages combined with the sediment rich irrigation water have benefited various crops through flood irrigation the study area is characterized by an arid climate with the high potential evaporation ranging from 1100 to 1600 mm gauged by e601 and the low annual precipitation ranging from 180 to 200 mm yang et al 2015 the inner year precipitation distribution is uneven as it accumulates predominantly during autumn july september showing distinct wet and dry seasons the main soil type of the flood plain is sandy loam which allows a rapid and deep percolation the aquifer thickness reaches a maximum of 30 m in the west edge of the area near the mountains and is thinning towards the river plain with a depth of less than 1 m on the other hand the salinity increases from 0 5 g l to 3 g l as the aquifer thickness decreases irrigation plays a key role in local hydrological processes during spring irrigation si and winter irrigation wi normally si spans the entire farming season april to september of three main crops i e rice wheat and corn in this area the average daily flow rate diverted from the yellow river during si is over 180 m3 s with an annual peak daily flow rate above 300 m3 s in mid may when the water demands are overlapped for the three main crops wi is necessary to freeze the topsoil in winter to preserve soil moisture and facilitate the plowing for the next farming season the wi starts at the end of october and lasts until the end of november with the daily average and annual peak flow rate around 200 m3 s and 370 m3 s respectively as a majority of farmland still adopt flood irrigation in the area the irrigation return flow contributes to a substantial share of the streamflow typically the local groundwater is not used for irrigation because it does not contain high nutrients in comparison with the water from the yellow river in addition it has high salinity for most crops advanced irrigation technologies e g pressurized wheel line sprinkler systems are the only exception because these irrigation methods do not prefer sediment rich water 3 data and methods 3 1 dataset modis provides one of the most widely used global lai products in the research community xiao et al 2017 the modis lai time series product starts from 2000 myneni et al 2002 buermann et al 2002 assessed the magnitude and interannual variations of field observed and rs based lai their results suggested that modis derived lai values its interannual variability showed reasonable agreement with ground measurements in this study the modis lai product mcd15a3h version 6 from 2007 to 2019 was used for the trend analysis this lai product is a 4 day composite data set with 500 m pixel size according to the u s geological survey myneni 2015 the algorithm chooses the best pixel available from all the acquisitions of both modis sensors located on nasa s terra and aqua satellites from within the 4 day period yan et al 2016 also reported that mcd15a3h version 6 is considerably better than the previous version version 6 can adequately capture the interannual variation of lai and the general seasonality of all biomes except for evergreen broadleaf forests where poor quality retrievals are produced nevertheless this shortcoming also exists in other satellite products such as the cyclopes glass and the spot vegetation system reygadas et al 2019 the modis lai time series product is retrieved using the r software with the r package modistools once the data were retrieved the land data operational product evaluation ldope tool was used to inspect the retrievals and remove those with poor quality the obtained 4 day composite data set with 0 5 km pixel size was then aggregated into 4 5 km 4 5 km tiles using the mean value to improve the robustness of results interpretation consequently there are 200 tiles in the entire study area as illustrated in fig 2 finally monthly lai means were calculated on a tile by tile basis for each month from january 2007 to december 2019 the time series datasets used in this study include daily streamflow time series from 13 drainage gauges daily irrigation water flow time series from 6 canals daily precipitation from 8 rain stations daily mean temperature and evaporation from 2 climate stations as well as daily groundwater head from 9 groundwater observation wells these daily time series were all aggregated into monthly values from january 2007 to december 2019 future climate projections conducted by the regional climate model regcm were used to infer future lai changes regcm is based on the laws of physics including the conservation of momentum continuity equation thermodynamic equation and the hydrostatic equation in the same way as gcms do elguindi et al 2013 lu et al 2019 compared with global climate models gcms regcm is able to reflect regional details such as the influences of local topography and land cover use two grid points with a resolution of 50 km were used to represent the climate conditions for the two climate stations fig 2 the gridded dataset which spans from 2030 to 2099 was extracted from the regcm simulations in lu et al 2019 3 2 monthly mann kendal trend test the monthly mann kendall mk trend test runs a separate mk trend test on each of m months separately the mk trend test has been widely used for trend detection in hydrology and climatology zhang et al 2001 in the test the null hypothesis h0 assumes that the sample is randomly ordered i e no trend while the alternative hypothesis h1 of a two sided test denotes that the sample follows a monotonic trend the mann kendall test statistic s is calculated as s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i sgn x j x i if x j x i 0 then 1 if x j x i 0 then 0 if x j x i 0 then 1 where x 1 x n denotes the total number of n samples for mk test n should be greater than 10 the basic idea of mk test is that every sample point is compared to its preceding one in the time series the positive values of s designate an increasing trend while negative values of s represent a decreasing trend in the time series for sample size n 10 the test is accompanied using a normal distribution σ2 1 and mean μ 0 with probability e and variance var as shown below e s 0 var s n n 1 2 n 5 p q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 18 where q is the tied groups representing observations having the same value excluding the position of unique rank numbers t p is the number of data values in the p th group and symbol σ characterizes the summation of all the tied groups however if there are no tied groups in the data this summary sequence may be ignored ashraf et al 2021 therefore the standard mk test statistic z for sample n is larger than ten is given by z mk s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 where z mk is used to check the null hypothesis h0 the value of z mk is compared with the normal distribution table of the two tailed test at a confidence level of α in a two tailed test the null hypothesis h0 is agreed for no trend if the computed value of z mk fall between z 1 α 2 and z 1 α 2 in this study α 0 05 was used at the 5 significance level the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z mk 1 96 3 3 stepwise clustered ensemble stepwise clustered ensemble sce li et al 2021 is used for identifying the relative significance of driving factors e g temperature and precipitation influencing the monthly lai simulation sce is a tree structured machine learning model that has been reported to outperform the well known random forests rf breiman 2001 in certain simulation tasks li et al 2021 the sce shares most advantages of rf for time series simulation owing to the 1 superior predictive accuracy with little parameter tuning erdal and karakurt 2013 fernández delgado et al 2014 li et al 2019 schmidt et al 2020 shortridge et al 2016 2 capacity to identify relevant predictor subsets in the presence of a large number of irrelevant predictors biau et al 2008 menze et al 2011 and 3 the ability to produce interpretable inference process murdoch et al 2019 compared with other measures for identifying the relative significance such as the mean decrease in impurity mdi used in rf and analysis of variance anova in a linear regression model bénard 2021 lyu and fan 2021 yang 2020 the sce can provide more reliable variable rankings due to the advanced tree deduction process and the ability to deal with non linearity li et al 2021 more specifically the wilks feature importance wfi method embedded in sce provides a less biased variable ranking than the mean decrease in impurity mdi and permutation feature importance pfi methods embedded in rf model leading to a more faithful understanding of the related mechanisms li et al 2021 in this study the sce will be applied to investigate the relative importance of contributing variables for the monthly lai simulation each sca tree in an sce grows in accordance with a random subset of predictors sampled without replacement and a bootstrapped version of the training set same size to the original training set drawn randomly from the initial training dataset with replacement such a bootstrap sampling process can leave about 1 3 of the training dataset as out of bag oob data these oob data will not be involved in training the n th sca tree and thus can be used as a validation dataset for the corresponding tree since the validation result obtained from each sca tree randomly covers 1 3 of the data over the training period the ensemble i e average of these validation results from each tree of the forest can generally cover the entire data length over the training period when the number of tree is large 4 results analysis 4 1 trend analysis of monthly lai values the mk trends based on the monthly mean lai value have shown a significant spatial and temporal variability fig 3 specifically significant increasing trends for vegetation growth are found for february and march in general with z scores between 0 and 1 96 yellow tiles and between 1 96 and 3 83 light green tiles such increasing trends gradually turn into decreasing trends and reach the overall lowest z score in may in which a majority of tiles are in orange z scores between 1 95 to 0 and red z scores between 1 96 to 4 24 after that the decreasing trends gradually turn into increasing trends in june and reach the highest z score in august with most of the tiles in the north area in deep green z scores between 1 96 and 5 31 the exceptions are those tiles around the city of yinchuan as shown in fig 1 where the vegetation growth has experienced a significant decreasing trend during may to september i e crop growing months most tiles have shown increasing trends in october and november with scattered tiles showing a slightly decreasing trend in december and january some tiles in the north have indicated a decreasing trend the spatial patterns of the lai trend are closely related to water resources management agricultural development and urban expansion from the perspective of water resources management the irrigation system has been enforcing the strictest water resources control regulations state council of the people s republic of china since 2011 leading to a significant reduction of water diversion from the yellow river fig 4 shows the z scores of mk trend test for monthly water diversions from 2007 to 2019 the most significant reduction of irrigation water happened in may with the mean value of z score equal to 3 4 such a reduction explains why lai experienced a significant decreasing trend in may in fact the crops in this area i e rice wheat and corn require more water in their early growing stages than their later stages as indicated in table 1 this is verified by the positive correlation fig 5 between the z scores of monthly water diversion and monthly lai regional mean during the farming season i e april to september in fig 5 vegetation growth in their later growing stages i e july to september is less impacted by the reduced irrigation than in their earlier stages i e april to june it is worth mentioning that even though the monthly irrigation water indicates decreasing trends the monthly vegetation growth increased in general except may such increasing trends are mainly caused by the widespread water conservation practices including water saving irrigation technology canal lining as well as conjunctive use of ground and surface water resources consequently widespread water conservation practices have significantly improved irrigation water use efficiency mi et al 2020 thus facilitating vegetation growth even with reduced irrigation water the decreasing trends of lai during june to september are identified around the city of yinchuan according to zhang et al 2019 the city of yinchuan has expanded from an area of 121 9 km2 in 2006 to 175 6 km2 in 2011 which then further expanded to 243 7 km2 in 2017 the rapid expansion of the city inevitably occupied its surrounding farmlands leading to the decreasing trend of lai from june to september i e the most vigorous period of crop growth meanwhile the expansion of the city has led to increasing trends of lai for october and november this is because the urban greening can provide a high vegetation cover all year round while the cropland will become bare ground after all the crops are harvested at the end of september the widespread ecosystem restoration since 2003 is also responsible for the increasing trend of lai for the non farming months i e october to march according to wang et al 2018 the wetland area within the study area was increased from 431 7 km2 in 2005 to 484 4 km2 in 2016 such widespread wetland restoration is evidenced by the increasing trend of water diversion in october fig 4 these wetlands provide substantial water in the unsaturated zone to maintain the ecosystem health during the winter and early spring months december to march fig 6a shows that a majority of the drainages indicate an increasing trend of streamflow volumes from january to march suggesting an increased soil water content the cropland in the north has been experiencing increasing trends of lai from june to september fig 3 such increased vegetation growth mainly benefited from the exploitation of saline wasteland due to the extremely high evaporation and shallow groundwater table around 33 of farmland suffered from high salinity with poor crop growth and low production wang and li 2009 soil remediation for the saline wasteland has been a priority for local agricultural development since the last decade several soil remediation practices such as lowering the groundwater table and growing saline alkali tolerant plants have significantly improved the local soil conditions the mk trends for groundwater table depth show that most of the observation wells indicate increasing trends with the highest z score of 4 3 in may fig 6b the increased depth in the groundwater table has helped reduce the evaporation underground thereby reducing the soil salinity and facilitating vegetation growth leading to growing trends of lai during the crop growing seasons i e from june to september fig 6c and d show the mk trends for monthly mean temperature t evaporation e and precipitation of each weather stations the correlations between the mk trends for temperature and evaporation are strongly correlated with pearson correlation coefficients over 0 7 for yinchuan yc and huinong hn fig 7 even though the precipitation and evaporation positively contributed to the crop growth fig 8 such correlation was less convincing i e the p value for the correlation between lai and precipitation equals 0 13 the p value for the correlation between lai and evaporation in the city of yinchuan equals 0 2 in fact from january 2007 to december 2019 neither temperature nor precipitation indicated significant monthly trend i e z mk 1 96 or at the 5 significance level therefore there is no clear evidence that the climate variations from 2007 to 2019 contributed to the monthly trend of local vegetation growth 4 2 identifying relative importance of contributing variables through the monthly lai simulation monthly lai simulation was performed to investigate the relative importance of associated contributing factors including monthly irrigation evaporation precipitation and groundwater depth the 1 month lagged impact of these factors was also considered in the simulation model therefore the input output structure for the monthly lai simulation can be written as follows 1 lai t f pr t et t ir t pr t pr t 1 2 et t et t 1 2 ir t ir t 1 2 gw t where lai t represents the regional mean lai value of month t pr et ir and gw represent monthly values of precipitation evaporation irrigation and groundwater level respectively f x represents the simulation functions of the sce model results indicate sce model can well simulate monthly lai value with the r2 equals 0 87 based on the oob validation dataset fig 9 it should be noted that sce underestimated some high lai values and overestimated some mid values two reasons are causing such discrepancy the first is nonstationary of monthly lai values the sce model like most machine learning methods takes observation i e lai values in this study to be independent and identically distributed this assumption is violated for time series data characterized by an increasing or decreasing trend leading to distortions in simulation the second reason is that sce may fail to extrapolate beyond the range of the training dataset for a particular sca tree if an lai value in its oob dataset falls outside the range of values in the training dataset such an lai value will likely to be overestimated or underestimated the analysis from wfi fig 10 shows that 2 month averaged evaporation achieves the highest importance followed by the 2 month averaged irrigation and precipitation in addition the monthly averaged predictors achieve lower importance scores than the 2 month averaged predictors this result suggests that monthly vegetation growth response time to its driving forces is longer than one month such delayed response is also reported by fang et al 2019 who found the vegetation growth could respond to precipitation variations with the time lag ranging from 3 to 8 months in loess plateau notably even though over 90 of agricultural water use in the study area is derived from the yellow river ningxia water conservancy 2007 the 2 month averaged precipitation still played a critical role in vegetation growth with the importance score equals 16 5 4 3 climate change may increase future crop water demands analysis from wfi indicates that the importance of 2 month averaged irrigation ranked as the second highest for monthly lai simulation meanwhile correlation analysis suggests that the significant change in irrigation shown in fig 4 is the primary reason for the changing patterns of lai with a p value equal to 0 01 shown in fig 5 these facts have led to a deduction that if monthly averaged evaporation or precipitation show significant trends in the future the lai patterns might experience substantial changes to this end the monthly trends of temperature and precipitation projections were examined based on the mk test fig 11 shows that under the rcp 4 5 scenario the annual precipitation and temperature for yinchuan area do not have a significant trend annually while under the rcp 8 5 scenario a slightly increasing trend can be found for annual mean precipitation and a significant increasing trend can be found for annual mean temperature in order to better present the gradual change of the future climate the future period is separated into three time slices early mid twenty first century 2030 2050 mid late twenty first century 2051 2070 and late twenty first century 2070 2099 future projections suggest that an increase of only 36 mm precipitations is expected in the yinchuan area from early mid to the late twenty first century under the rcp 8 5 scenario moreover an increase of 1 c in daily mean temperature is expected from early mid to the mid late twenty first century under the rcp 8 5 scenario while such an increase will reach 2 3 c from early mid to late twenty first century the mk trend analysis for monthly mean precipitation projections suggests that no significant trends for precipitation i e z mk 1 96 can be identified for most of the months under either rcp 4 5 or 8 5 scenarios fig 12 the exceptional months include an increasing trend in march and a decreasing trend in october under rcp 4 5 scenario in the yinchuan area as well as an increasing trend in march and may under rcp 8 5 scenario in the yinchuan area these increases in precipitation will positively contribute to crop growth in early spring however such an increase in precipitation may not alleviate the water shortage in the yinchuan area because the evaporation may increase even higher under the rcp 8 5 scenario the mk trend analysis for monthly mean temperature projections suggests that there might be a slightly increasing trend under the rcp 4 5 scenario and a significant increasing trend under the rcp 8 5 scenario in particular a warmer december is expected with a significant increasing trend z equals 2 8 for both yinchuan and huinong area under the rcp 4 5 scenario the warmer winter will lead to reduced ground frozen time which will challenge the irrigation practice since the soil moisture will deplete quicker in winter affecting the crop growth of next year such a situation will worsen under the rcp 8 5 scenario in which the highest increase in temperature would happen in june and july followed by august october and september as a consequence the summer will last much longer than the present the long lasting summer will inevitably increase the evaporation in the crop growing months thereby increasing the agricultural water demand 5 remarks and conclusions in this study mk trend analysis was performed to investigate the spatial and temporal change of lai on a monthly basis compared with previous trend analysis studies focused on a yearly or seasonal basis such a study at a finer temporal resolution provided more valuable and detailed information supporting agriculture management combined with the trend analysis of several contributing variables influencing lai irrigation was considered a critical factor leading to the nonstationary lai water conservation practices city expansion soil remediation practices and wetland restoration were also responsible for the spatial and temporal change of lai there was no clear evidence that climate variations during the study period influenced lai the analysis from wfi indecated that the response time of monthly vegetation growth to its driving forces is longer than one month the 2 month average evaporation achieved the highest importance followed by the 2 month average irrigation and precipitation according to future climate projections no significant trend for precipitation can be identified for most of the months under either rcp 4 5 or 8 5 scenarios at the same time significant increasing trends for air temperature were identified for every month under the rcp 8 5 scenario especially for the crop growing months the main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the mk trend analysis for lai on a monthly basis can provide more valuable information than on a yearly and seasonal basis in irrigated watersheds such trend analysis may help to diagnose monthly crop growth conditions and their reasoning decision makers can then optimize irrigation scheduling month to month for dealing with crop water deficit in this study the crop growth in may experienced significant degradation and such degradation may worsen in the future due to the increased evaporation in winter more importantly irrigators may face dryer and longer summers in the future which inevitably challenge the agriculture industry of ningxia in this study only one regional climate model was used to investigate future climate change in the future an ensemble of regional climate models should be preferred to improve the robustness of the result in addition an improved interpretable machine learning model should be proposed in the future to consider the nonstationary effect of lai simulation such simulation models may

1377,irrigation systems play vital roles not only in food production but also in supporting ecosystems understanding how the ecosystem has evolved in response to human activities is crucial for sustainable food production especially for arid and semi arid regions in this study we examined the trends of vegetation growth on a monthly basis in the ancient yellow river irrigation system in ningxia china we used the leaf area index lai to characterize the vegetation growth from 2007 to 2019 the lai trends were associated with a series of driving forces explaining the spatial and temporal change of vegetation growth with the provision of the wilks feature importance method 2 month averaged air temperature and irrigation were identified as the two most important variables for monthly lai simulation future climate projections based on the regional climate model system regcm suggested dryer and longer summers under the rcp 8 5 scenario these changes will increase the crop water demand during the growing months in the future water conflict might be further intensified in may in which the present irrigation water has already led to a decreased crop growth our findings demonstrated that the mann kendall monthly trend analysis could provide more helpful information for monitoring the vegetation growth than the trend analysis on a yearly and seasonal basis keywords leaf area index mann kendall trend analysis stepwise clustered analysis reginal climate model projection 1 introduction traditional irrigation systems have evolved from the simple function of delivering water resources for food production raheem et al 2015 these systems now also play vital roles in providing ecological services especially in arid and semi arid regions where nature restoration alone cannot amend the degrading ecosystems owing to intensive human activities therefore understanding the underlying mechanisms for ecosystem evolutions is critical in improving the capacities of irrigation systems however due to the complexity of irrigation systems and the uncertainty of climate change current understandings for ecosystem evolutions in irrigation systems are still limited gregory et al 2018 liu et al 2009 mu 2000 consequently it is much desired to precisely describe the changes of ecosystems temporally and spatially and identify the key influencing factors in response to these changes leaf area index lai is one of the essential biophysical variables for characterizing land surface ecosystems jiang et al 2010 it is defined as the one sided green leaf area per unit ground area in needle leaf vegetation lai is defined as the projected needle leaf area per unit ground area buermann et al 2002 lai is closely linked to many key ecological processes such as photosynthesis transpiration carbon and nutrient cycle as well as evapotranspiration thus lai is widely used to estimate net primary productivity and other quantities chen and cihlar 1996 jiang et al 2010 from the perspective of earth sciences lai affects the exchange of substance energy and momentum between the land surface and atmosphere monteith and unsworth 2013 and serves as critical input or key variable in most simulation models of climate hydrology and biogeochemistry karimi 2020 yin 2017 the two predominant approaches to obtain the lai are ground based and remote sensing rs based approaches breda 2003 even though the ground based method for measuring lai is more accurate than the rs based one it only suitable for a small scale yin et al 2017 for most earth science related studies rs based lai products are much preferred for their availability for long term large scale and continuous observations rs based lai products are routinely produced from various satellite data such as modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer spot vegetation multiangle imaging spectroradiometer misr and so on jiang et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 these lai time series products have been used to examine the dynamic changes of vegetation cover and associated ecosystems from a global perspective alton 2018 examined the decadal trends through linear regression in photosynthetic capacity and lai to ascertain the biochemical and structural responses of vegetation to environmental change they found that the decadal trends were of a sufficient magnitude to influence vegetation productivity and carbon uptake zhu et al 2017 investigated the seasonal mean lai trends at northern latitudes north of 30 n between 1982 and 2009 using three rs based lai products they found that climate change controls the spatial pattern of seasonal lai trends and dominates the increase in seasonal lai in the northern high latitudes jiang et al 2017 compared four long term global lai products in terms of trends interannual variabilities and uncertainty variations from 1982 through 2011 rasul et al 2020 examined the trend and linear regression modeling of lai derived from the modis data in their study the relationships between lai and lst were assessed across the continents more recently cortés et al 2021 employed the mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 to detect the annual trend of lai globally with the time span of 2000 2018 they reported evidence for an increasing seasonal amplitude in lai north of 35 n from a regional perspective yin et al 2017 used the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method and the gimms lai dataset from 1982 to 2010 to analyze the nonlinear feature and spatial difference of forest lai over china for the past 29 years their results indicated that the national averaged forest lai was characterized by quasi 3 and quasi 7 year oscillations which generally exhibited a rising trend with an increasing rate liang et al 2015 investigated the spatial temporal characteristics and interrelationships of the vegetation dynamics and climate variability in xinjiang province china using the glass lai dataset and a gridded meteorological dataset from 1982 2012 their results suggested a significant increasing trend of vegetation growth in the oases and a significant decreasing trend of vegetation growth in certain areas reygadas et al 2019 detected forest degradation by analyzing the trend component of the time series of lai collected by the modis over central mexico from 2002 to 2017 more recently zhang et al 2021 explored vegetation stability tendency and sustainability in the three river source region china with multiple methods based on the 2000 2017 glass lai product in their results differentiation patterns of lai variations and multiyear mean lai value under different topographic factors were investigated even though the studies mentioned above have provided concrete frameworks for detecting lai trends and the associated driving forces most of these assessment efforts focused on interannual lai trends reygadas et al 2019 yuan 2021 zhang 2021 only one of these studies focused on the seasonal averaged lai trends zhu et al 2017 there has been no attempt to evaluate the trends of monthly averaged lai in fact assessing the trends of monthly averaged lai is critical for understanding the relationships between the land surface and atmosphere at a finer temporal resolution it is acknowledged that climate change not only influences the annual mean values of climate variables but also influences the interannual climate variability shrestha and wang 2020 wang et al 2006 the frequencies and extremes of climatic indices may impose a much larger impact on vegetation growth than the annual mean values do alton 2018 in irrigated watersheds understanding the interannual climate variability on a monthly basis is more important than pristine watersheds because one wants to know the exact time to begin planting relating trends of monthly averaged lai with the associated driving forces can improve our understanding of its underlying mechanism therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the trends of monthly averaged lai in an irrigated watershed and explore its potential driving forces in terms of qualitative and quantitative manners the objective entails 1 detecting the trend of monthly modis lai time series in the ancient yellow river irrigation system china from 2007 to 2019 2 investigating the potential driving forces of the monthly lai change through correlation analysis to understand the temporal and spatial changes of vegetation growth 3 modeling monthly lai with the stepwise clustered ensemble sce to identify the relative importance of several contributing variables and 4 inferring the future changes for the vegetation growth based on the climate projections from regional climate model regcm 2 the ancient yellow river irrigation system the ancient yellow river irrigation system ayris in ningxia is the oldest yellow river irrigation system in north china with a total area of 660 000 ha and an irrigated area of 552 000 ha the ayris has been well documented since 215 bce in the qin dynasty zhang and deng 1987 when the first settlers opened canals from the yellow river and started irrigation during the successive 2000 years the irrigation systems had been advanced significantly from 1722 to 1735 in the qing dynasty it became a sophisticated irrigation system serving an irrigation area of 146 700 ha lu 2019 the construction of qingtongxia dam in 1959 tremendously advanced the irrigation system by elevating the water head and the irrigation area was increased to 330 000 ha the ayris has been recognized as a world irrigation heritage in 2017 international commission on irrigation and drainage as the west part of the ayris the study area is located at the west alluvial plain of the yellow river crisscrossed by six main irrigation canals and numerous drainages fig 1 shows the detailed layout of the ayris this area is endowed for the abundant heat i e 10c above the accumulative temperature ranges from 3200c to 3400c during the farming season i e april to september the adequate radiation i e 148 cal cm2 a and the long non frost days i e 164 days in average these natural advantages combined with the sediment rich irrigation water have benefited various crops through flood irrigation the study area is characterized by an arid climate with the high potential evaporation ranging from 1100 to 1600 mm gauged by e601 and the low annual precipitation ranging from 180 to 200 mm yang et al 2015 the inner year precipitation distribution is uneven as it accumulates predominantly during autumn july september showing distinct wet and dry seasons the main soil type of the flood plain is sandy loam which allows a rapid and deep percolation the aquifer thickness reaches a maximum of 30 m in the west edge of the area near the mountains and is thinning towards the river plain with a depth of less than 1 m on the other hand the salinity increases from 0 5 g l to 3 g l as the aquifer thickness decreases irrigation plays a key role in local hydrological processes during spring irrigation si and winter irrigation wi normally si spans the entire farming season april to september of three main crops i e rice wheat and corn in this area the average daily flow rate diverted from the yellow river during si is over 180 m3 s with an annual peak daily flow rate above 300 m3 s in mid may when the water demands are overlapped for the three main crops wi is necessary to freeze the topsoil in winter to preserve soil moisture and facilitate the plowing for the next farming season the wi starts at the end of october and lasts until the end of november with the daily average and annual peak flow rate around 200 m3 s and 370 m3 s respectively as a majority of farmland still adopt flood irrigation in the area the irrigation return flow contributes to a substantial share of the streamflow typically the local groundwater is not used for irrigation because it does not contain high nutrients in comparison with the water from the yellow river in addition it has high salinity for most crops advanced irrigation technologies e g pressurized wheel line sprinkler systems are the only exception because these irrigation methods do not prefer sediment rich water 3 data and methods 3 1 dataset modis provides one of the most widely used global lai products in the research community xiao et al 2017 the modis lai time series product starts from 2000 myneni et al 2002 buermann et al 2002 assessed the magnitude and interannual variations of field observed and rs based lai their results suggested that modis derived lai values its interannual variability showed reasonable agreement with ground measurements in this study the modis lai product mcd15a3h version 6 from 2007 to 2019 was used for the trend analysis this lai product is a 4 day composite data set with 500 m pixel size according to the u s geological survey myneni 2015 the algorithm chooses the best pixel available from all the acquisitions of both modis sensors located on nasa s terra and aqua satellites from within the 4 day period yan et al 2016 also reported that mcd15a3h version 6 is considerably better than the previous version version 6 can adequately capture the interannual variation of lai and the general seasonality of all biomes except for evergreen broadleaf forests where poor quality retrievals are produced nevertheless this shortcoming also exists in other satellite products such as the cyclopes glass and the spot vegetation system reygadas et al 2019 the modis lai time series product is retrieved using the r software with the r package modistools once the data were retrieved the land data operational product evaluation ldope tool was used to inspect the retrievals and remove those with poor quality the obtained 4 day composite data set with 0 5 km pixel size was then aggregated into 4 5 km 4 5 km tiles using the mean value to improve the robustness of results interpretation consequently there are 200 tiles in the entire study area as illustrated in fig 2 finally monthly lai means were calculated on a tile by tile basis for each month from january 2007 to december 2019 the time series datasets used in this study include daily streamflow time series from 13 drainage gauges daily irrigation water flow time series from 6 canals daily precipitation from 8 rain stations daily mean temperature and evaporation from 2 climate stations as well as daily groundwater head from 9 groundwater observation wells these daily time series were all aggregated into monthly values from january 2007 to december 2019 future climate projections conducted by the regional climate model regcm were used to infer future lai changes regcm is based on the laws of physics including the conservation of momentum continuity equation thermodynamic equation and the hydrostatic equation in the same way as gcms do elguindi et al 2013 lu et al 2019 compared with global climate models gcms regcm is able to reflect regional details such as the influences of local topography and land cover use two grid points with a resolution of 50 km were used to represent the climate conditions for the two climate stations fig 2 the gridded dataset which spans from 2030 to 2099 was extracted from the regcm simulations in lu et al 2019 3 2 monthly mann kendal trend test the monthly mann kendall mk trend test runs a separate mk trend test on each of m months separately the mk trend test has been widely used for trend detection in hydrology and climatology zhang et al 2001 in the test the null hypothesis h0 assumes that the sample is randomly ordered i e no trend while the alternative hypothesis h1 of a two sided test denotes that the sample follows a monotonic trend the mann kendall test statistic s is calculated as s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i sgn x j x i if x j x i 0 then 1 if x j x i 0 then 0 if x j x i 0 then 1 where x 1 x n denotes the total number of n samples for mk test n should be greater than 10 the basic idea of mk test is that every sample point is compared to its preceding one in the time series the positive values of s designate an increasing trend while negative values of s represent a decreasing trend in the time series for sample size n 10 the test is accompanied using a normal distribution σ2 1 and mean μ 0 with probability e and variance var as shown below e s 0 var s n n 1 2 n 5 p q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 18 where q is the tied groups representing observations having the same value excluding the position of unique rank numbers t p is the number of data values in the p th group and symbol σ characterizes the summation of all the tied groups however if there are no tied groups in the data this summary sequence may be ignored ashraf et al 2021 therefore the standard mk test statistic z for sample n is larger than ten is given by z mk s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 where z mk is used to check the null hypothesis h0 the value of z mk is compared with the normal distribution table of the two tailed test at a confidence level of α in a two tailed test the null hypothesis h0 is agreed for no trend if the computed value of z mk fall between z 1 α 2 and z 1 α 2 in this study α 0 05 was used at the 5 significance level the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z mk 1 96 3 3 stepwise clustered ensemble stepwise clustered ensemble sce li et al 2021 is used for identifying the relative significance of driving factors e g temperature and precipitation influencing the monthly lai simulation sce is a tree structured machine learning model that has been reported to outperform the well known random forests rf breiman 2001 in certain simulation tasks li et al 2021 the sce shares most advantages of rf for time series simulation owing to the 1 superior predictive accuracy with little parameter tuning erdal and karakurt 2013 fernández delgado et al 2014 li et al 2019 schmidt et al 2020 shortridge et al 2016 2 capacity to identify relevant predictor subsets in the presence of a large number of irrelevant predictors biau et al 2008 menze et al 2011 and 3 the ability to produce interpretable inference process murdoch et al 2019 compared with other measures for identifying the relative significance such as the mean decrease in impurity mdi used in rf and analysis of variance anova in a linear regression model bénard 2021 lyu and fan 2021 yang 2020 the sce can provide more reliable variable rankings due to the advanced tree deduction process and the ability to deal with non linearity li et al 2021 more specifically the wilks feature importance wfi method embedded in sce provides a less biased variable ranking than the mean decrease in impurity mdi and permutation feature importance pfi methods embedded in rf model leading to a more faithful understanding of the related mechanisms li et al 2021 in this study the sce will be applied to investigate the relative importance of contributing variables for the monthly lai simulation each sca tree in an sce grows in accordance with a random subset of predictors sampled without replacement and a bootstrapped version of the training set same size to the original training set drawn randomly from the initial training dataset with replacement such a bootstrap sampling process can leave about 1 3 of the training dataset as out of bag oob data these oob data will not be involved in training the n th sca tree and thus can be used as a validation dataset for the corresponding tree since the validation result obtained from each sca tree randomly covers 1 3 of the data over the training period the ensemble i e average of these validation results from each tree of the forest can generally cover the entire data length over the training period when the number of tree is large 4 results analysis 4 1 trend analysis of monthly lai values the mk trends based on the monthly mean lai value have shown a significant spatial and temporal variability fig 3 specifically significant increasing trends for vegetation growth are found for february and march in general with z scores between 0 and 1 96 yellow tiles and between 1 96 and 3 83 light green tiles such increasing trends gradually turn into decreasing trends and reach the overall lowest z score in may in which a majority of tiles are in orange z scores between 1 95 to 0 and red z scores between 1 96 to 4 24 after that the decreasing trends gradually turn into increasing trends in june and reach the highest z score in august with most of the tiles in the north area in deep green z scores between 1 96 and 5 31 the exceptions are those tiles around the city of yinchuan as shown in fig 1 where the vegetation growth has experienced a significant decreasing trend during may to september i e crop growing months most tiles have shown increasing trends in october and november with scattered tiles showing a slightly decreasing trend in december and january some tiles in the north have indicated a decreasing trend the spatial patterns of the lai trend are closely related to water resources management agricultural development and urban expansion from the perspective of water resources management the irrigation system has been enforcing the strictest water resources control regulations state council of the people s republic of china since 2011 leading to a significant reduction of water diversion from the yellow river fig 4 shows the z scores of mk trend test for monthly water diversions from 2007 to 2019 the most significant reduction of irrigation water happened in may with the mean value of z score equal to 3 4 such a reduction explains why lai experienced a significant decreasing trend in may in fact the crops in this area i e rice wheat and corn require more water in their early growing stages than their later stages as indicated in table 1 this is verified by the positive correlation fig 5 between the z scores of monthly water diversion and monthly lai regional mean during the farming season i e april to september in fig 5 vegetation growth in their later growing stages i e july to september is less impacted by the reduced irrigation than in their earlier stages i e april to june it is worth mentioning that even though the monthly irrigation water indicates decreasing trends the monthly vegetation growth increased in general except may such increasing trends are mainly caused by the widespread water conservation practices including water saving irrigation technology canal lining as well as conjunctive use of ground and surface water resources consequently widespread water conservation practices have significantly improved irrigation water use efficiency mi et al 2020 thus facilitating vegetation growth even with reduced irrigation water the decreasing trends of lai during june to september are identified around the city of yinchuan according to zhang et al 2019 the city of yinchuan has expanded from an area of 121 9 km2 in 2006 to 175 6 km2 in 2011 which then further expanded to 243 7 km2 in 2017 the rapid expansion of the city inevitably occupied its surrounding farmlands leading to the decreasing trend of lai from june to september i e the most vigorous period of crop growth meanwhile the expansion of the city has led to increasing trends of lai for october and november this is because the urban greening can provide a high vegetation cover all year round while the cropland will become bare ground after all the crops are harvested at the end of september the widespread ecosystem restoration since 2003 is also responsible for the increasing trend of lai for the non farming months i e october to march according to wang et al 2018 the wetland area within the study area was increased from 431 7 km2 in 2005 to 484 4 km2 in 2016 such widespread wetland restoration is evidenced by the increasing trend of water diversion in october fig 4 these wetlands provide substantial water in the unsaturated zone to maintain the ecosystem health during the winter and early spring months december to march fig 6a shows that a majority of the drainages indicate an increasing trend of streamflow volumes from january to march suggesting an increased soil water content the cropland in the north has been experiencing increasing trends of lai from june to september fig 3 such increased vegetation growth mainly benefited from the exploitation of saline wasteland due to the extremely high evaporation and shallow groundwater table around 33 of farmland suffered from high salinity with poor crop growth and low production wang and li 2009 soil remediation for the saline wasteland has been a priority for local agricultural development since the last decade several soil remediation practices such as lowering the groundwater table and growing saline alkali tolerant plants have significantly improved the local soil conditions the mk trends for groundwater table depth show that most of the observation wells indicate increasing trends with the highest z score of 4 3 in may fig 6b the increased depth in the groundwater table has helped reduce the evaporation underground thereby reducing the soil salinity and facilitating vegetation growth leading to growing trends of lai during the crop growing seasons i e from june to september fig 6c and d show the mk trends for monthly mean temperature t evaporation e and precipitation of each weather stations the correlations between the mk trends for temperature and evaporation are strongly correlated with pearson correlation coefficients over 0 7 for yinchuan yc and huinong hn fig 7 even though the precipitation and evaporation positively contributed to the crop growth fig 8 such correlation was less convincing i e the p value for the correlation between lai and precipitation equals 0 13 the p value for the correlation between lai and evaporation in the city of yinchuan equals 0 2 in fact from january 2007 to december 2019 neither temperature nor precipitation indicated significant monthly trend i e z mk 1 96 or at the 5 significance level therefore there is no clear evidence that the climate variations from 2007 to 2019 contributed to the monthly trend of local vegetation growth 4 2 identifying relative importance of contributing variables through the monthly lai simulation monthly lai simulation was performed to investigate the relative importance of associated contributing factors including monthly irrigation evaporation precipitation and groundwater depth the 1 month lagged impact of these factors was also considered in the simulation model therefore the input output structure for the monthly lai simulation can be written as follows 1 lai t f pr t et t ir t pr t pr t 1 2 et t et t 1 2 ir t ir t 1 2 gw t where lai t represents the regional mean lai value of month t pr et ir and gw represent monthly values of precipitation evaporation irrigation and groundwater level respectively f x represents the simulation functions of the sce model results indicate sce model can well simulate monthly lai value with the r2 equals 0 87 based on the oob validation dataset fig 9 it should be noted that sce underestimated some high lai values and overestimated some mid values two reasons are causing such discrepancy the first is nonstationary of monthly lai values the sce model like most machine learning methods takes observation i e lai values in this study to be independent and identically distributed this assumption is violated for time series data characterized by an increasing or decreasing trend leading to distortions in simulation the second reason is that sce may fail to extrapolate beyond the range of the training dataset for a particular sca tree if an lai value in its oob dataset falls outside the range of values in the training dataset such an lai value will likely to be overestimated or underestimated the analysis from wfi fig 10 shows that 2 month averaged evaporation achieves the highest importance followed by the 2 month averaged irrigation and precipitation in addition the monthly averaged predictors achieve lower importance scores than the 2 month averaged predictors this result suggests that monthly vegetation growth response time to its driving forces is longer than one month such delayed response is also reported by fang et al 2019 who found the vegetation growth could respond to precipitation variations with the time lag ranging from 3 to 8 months in loess plateau notably even though over 90 of agricultural water use in the study area is derived from the yellow river ningxia water conservancy 2007 the 2 month averaged precipitation still played a critical role in vegetation growth with the importance score equals 16 5 4 3 climate change may increase future crop water demands analysis from wfi indicates that the importance of 2 month averaged irrigation ranked as the second highest for monthly lai simulation meanwhile correlation analysis suggests that the significant change in irrigation shown in fig 4 is the primary reason for the changing patterns of lai with a p value equal to 0 01 shown in fig 5 these facts have led to a deduction that if monthly averaged evaporation or precipitation show significant trends in the future the lai patterns might experience substantial changes to this end the monthly trends of temperature and precipitation projections were examined based on the mk test fig 11 shows that under the rcp 4 5 scenario the annual precipitation and temperature for yinchuan area do not have a significant trend annually while under the rcp 8 5 scenario a slightly increasing trend can be found for annual mean precipitation and a significant increasing trend can be found for annual mean temperature in order to better present the gradual change of the future climate the future period is separated into three time slices early mid twenty first century 2030 2050 mid late twenty first century 2051 2070 and late twenty first century 2070 2099 future projections suggest that an increase of only 36 mm precipitations is expected in the yinchuan area from early mid to the late twenty first century under the rcp 8 5 scenario moreover an increase of 1 c in daily mean temperature is expected from early mid to the mid late twenty first century under the rcp 8 5 scenario while such an increase will reach 2 3 c from early mid to late twenty first century the mk trend analysis for monthly mean precipitation projections suggests that no significant trends for precipitation i e z mk 1 96 can be identified for most of the months under either rcp 4 5 or 8 5 scenarios fig 12 the exceptional months include an increasing trend in march and a decreasing trend in october under rcp 4 5 scenario in the yinchuan area as well as an increasing trend in march and may under rcp 8 5 scenario in the yinchuan area these increases in precipitation will positively contribute to crop growth in early spring however such an increase in precipitation may not alleviate the water shortage in the yinchuan area because the evaporation may increase even higher under the rcp 8 5 scenario the mk trend analysis for monthly mean temperature projections suggests that there might be a slightly increasing trend under the rcp 4 5 scenario and a significant increasing trend under the rcp 8 5 scenario in particular a warmer december is expected with a significant increasing trend z equals 2 8 for both yinchuan and huinong area under the rcp 4 5 scenario the warmer winter will lead to reduced ground frozen time which will challenge the irrigation practice since the soil moisture will deplete quicker in winter affecting the crop growth of next year such a situation will worsen under the rcp 8 5 scenario in which the highest increase in temperature would happen in june and july followed by august october and september as a consequence the summer will last much longer than the present the long lasting summer will inevitably increase the evaporation in the crop growing months thereby increasing the agricultural water demand 5 remarks and conclusions in this study mk trend analysis was performed to investigate the spatial and temporal change of lai on a monthly basis compared with previous trend analysis studies focused on a yearly or seasonal basis such a study at a finer temporal resolution provided more valuable and detailed information supporting agriculture management combined with the trend analysis of several contributing variables influencing lai irrigation was considered a critical factor leading to the nonstationary lai water conservation practices city expansion soil remediation practices and wetland restoration were also responsible for the spatial and temporal change of lai there was no clear evidence that climate variations during the study period influenced lai the analysis from wfi indecated that the response time of monthly vegetation growth to its driving forces is longer than one month the 2 month average evaporation achieved the highest importance followed by the 2 month average irrigation and precipitation according to future climate projections no significant trend for precipitation can be identified for most of the months under either rcp 4 5 or 8 5 scenarios at the same time significant increasing trends for air temperature were identified for every month under the rcp 8 5 scenario especially for the crop growing months the main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the mk trend analysis for lai on a monthly basis can provide more valuable information than on a yearly and seasonal basis in irrigated watersheds such trend analysis may help to diagnose monthly crop growth conditions and their reasoning decision makers can then optimize irrigation scheduling month to month for dealing with crop water deficit in this study the crop growth in may experienced significant degradation and such degradation may worsen in the future due to the increased evaporation in winter more importantly irrigators may face dryer and longer summers in the future which inevitably challenge the agriculture industry of ningxia in this study only one regional climate model was used to investigate future climate change in the future an ensemble of regional climate models should be preferred to improve the robustness of the result in addition an improved interpretable machine learning model should be proposed in the future to consider the nonstationary effect of lai simulation such simulation models may

1378,physical barrier is a coastal engineering widely used to prevent seawater intrusion however previous studies have not evaluated the combined influence of type and structure of the physical barrier on nitrate accumulation in upstream aquifers furthermore the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation caused by the physical barriers are still unclear in this study numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the mechanisms and influence of the physical barrier on seawater intrusion and no 3 accumulation the results show that constructing physical barrier can result in the reduction of nitrate discharge to the sea and accumulation of nitrate in upstream aquifers the accumulation degree is significant if the barrier height is large the barrier location is near the sea the nitrate infiltration rate is large the infiltration nitrate concentration is large the inflow is weak and the inflow doc concentration is low a cut off wall is more likely to cause nitrate accumulation than a subsurface dam it can result in mean nitrate concentration in groundwater upstream increasing by more than 30 because a nitrate accumulation zone is formed behind the cut off wall where the flow is slow and dissolved oxygen carbon is difficult to be replenished so that the denitrification is weak despite the subsurface dam may not result in a significant increase in nitrate concentration it cannot be applied to the areas where si has occurred due to the residual seawater problem the nitrate accumulation in the upstream aquifer is a long term process that lasts for more than three years to reach a pseudo steady state seasonal variations of inflow and infiltration lead to fluctuation of mean nitrate concentration thereby the nitrate accumulation rate increased after april and weakened between july and december keywords numerical simulation coastal hydrology nitrate pollution groundwater contamination 1 introduction in coastal regions groundwater is an important freshwater source for domestic agricultural and industrial usage lu and werner 2013 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 with the increase in population density in many coastal areas the demand for water resources has also increased kim and yang 2018 yan et al 2021 this has led to an over exploitation of coastal aquifers thomas and famiglietti 2019 and reduction in groundwater recharge badaruddin et al 2015 as such coastal aquifers are facing an increasing threat of seawater intrusion si werner et al 2013 walther et al 2017 the engineering measures used to control si can be divided into two main categories the hydraulic barrier and the physical barrier abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a wu et al 2020 the hydraulic barrier mainly blocks the intrusion of seawater by increasing the difference between the groundwater head and seawater head werner et al 2013 the hydraulic barrier includes the following types artificial recharge badaruddin et al 2015 christy and lakshmanan 2017 raicy and elango 2020 injection wells lu et al 2017 extraction wells abarca et al 2006 and mixed hydraulic barriers ebeling et al 2019 the subsurface physical barriers benefit from low operating costs and high stability and hence have been widely investigated ishida et al 2003 luyun et al 2009 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a chang et al 2019 the barrier are constructed by injecting impervious material into a subterranean aquifer abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b which are distinguished by two main types the subsurface dam and the cut off wall abdoulhalik et al 2017 a subsurface dam is constructed at the bottom of the aquifer leaving an opening at the upper part of the aquifer for groundwater discharge a cut off wall is constructed at the upper part of the aquifer which leaves an opening at the bottom of the aquifer for groundwater discharge in 1978 an experimental subsurface dam was constructed on miyako island japan with the dimensions of 16 5 m in height 5 m in width and 500 m in length it has been reported to be effective in combating si as well as increasing groundwater storage sugio et al 1987 essink 2001 contented that the subsurface dam is only suitable for si prevention in shallow aquifers because the construction cost would be prohibitively expensive if the aquifer is deep another issue worthy of attention is that the construction of a subsurface dam may generate residual seawater in the landward aquifer luyun et al 2009 takahashi et al 2011 2018 moreover the efficiency of the subsurface dam on si prevention is also influenced by the aquifer heterogeneity abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b and the permeability of the barriers li et al 2018 anwar 1983 developed an analytical solution to describe the saltwater wedge distribution under the effect of the cut off wall the author indicated that the cut off wall can depress the seawater wedge and the performance depends on the barrier height using numerical simulation kaleris and ziogas 2013 investigated the protective effect of the cut off wall on groundwater extraction they found the cut off wall can produce a more significant protection effect for a single well in addition they developed an analytical approach to facilitate the design of safe extractions under the effect of the cut off wall recently a new approach for the cut off wall installation was presented by strack et al 2016 the approach involves injecting a precipitate into the aquifer to reduce the permeability of aqueous medium in the upper part of the aquifer and thus controls si this method could reduce construction costs significantly compared to traditional excavation methods for the island water resources which are recharged by precipitation lu et al 2019 proposed a method to construct cut off walls around the shoreline of the island to mitigate si moreover abdoulhalik et al 2017 introduced a mixed physical barrier system which contained a subsurface dam and a cut off wall this barriers system was experimentally shown to perform stronger si control efficiency compared to a cut off wall on its own although these previous studies generate significant insights into the effectiveness of the subsurface dam and the cut off wall on si prevention the influence of these barriers on inland contaminants is not involved due to the effect of anthropogenic activities nutrient contamination has been found in many coastal region santoni et al 2020 nitrate no 3 which is generally considered to originate from fertilizer leaching and sewage infiltration jaunat et al 2019 has been proved to be a major contaminant that harms coastal groundwater anwar et al 2014 and the offshore marine environment abarca et al 2013 since the groundwater discharge is an important pathway for no 3 li et al 2018 and the construction of a physical barrier results in the shift in groundwater pathway chang et al 2019 the mean no 3 concentration after the construction of the barrier would be determined by the new flow field and denitrification spiteri et al 2008 sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 the change of no 3 concentration after the physical barriers construction has also been confirmed by field observations satoshi et al 2003 kang and xu 2017 and numerical simulation method lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 zheng et al 2020 sun et al 2019 however scientists draw different conclusions about the accumulation effect of the physical barriers kang and xu 2017 found that the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream of the cut off wall was significantly higher than that in downstream a similar result was obtained by lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 through field observation combined with numerical simulation using field scale numerical simulation zheng et al 2020 found that constructing cut off walls can accumulate no 3 significantly in the landward aquifer while for the influence of the subsurface dam on no 3 accumulation the results are conflicting yoshimoto et al 2013 found that the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream of the subsurface dam slightly increased and they developed a model to predict that the no 3 concentration would increase by 1 46 mg l in 100 years through laboratory experiments sun et al 2019 identified that the subsurface dam height is a key factor influencing no 3 contaminated degree in the landward aquifer a high subsurface dam could cause severe no 3 contamination however the field observation results over ten years provided by satoshi et al 2003 showed that the impact of the subsurface dam on no 3 was negligible previous studies have showed that the construction of physical barriers results in no 3 contamination in upstream aquifers especially sun et al 2019 quantitatively discussed the influences of subsurface dam height location and no 3 infiltration rate on no 3 contamination degree in upstream aquifer however they did not employ the denitrification reactions in their model which may overestimate no 3 contamination degree zheng et al 2020 presented that the cut off wall can cause severe no 3 contamination but they did not analyze the no 3 accumulation mechanism in addition the previous studies only considered a single type of physical barrier and a specific environmental factor such as no 3 infiltration rate the combined influences of type and structure of physical barriers on no 3 accumulation have not been evaluated furthermore the numerical models used in previous studies are mainly based on fixed boundary conditions but the no 3 accumulation process under changing boundary conditions is still unclear the specific objectives of this study are to clarify the no 3 accumulation mechanisms of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam and evaluate the influence of several key parameters i e the infiltration no 3 concentration the inflow dissolved organic carbon doc concentration the barrier height and the barrier location on the performance of the two types of physical barriers a numerical model was employed to achieve field scale simulations of no 3 transport and reaction in coastal aquifers 2 method 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 shows the geometry of the 2 d vertical slice of the aquifer which is perpendicular to the coast the concenptual model was developed based on the following assumptions 1 the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic chang et al 2019 2 the physical barrier is assumed to be impervious chang et al 2019 3 the denitrification rate is assumed to be determined by no 3 concentration doc concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration zheng et al 2020 4 the doc leached from agricultural soils was omitted in the model siemens et al 2003 the thickness of the aquifer was set to 50 m chang et al 2020 and the considered aquifer length was set to 500 m the ocean boundary was assumed on the left side with the variable hydraulic head denoted by h s m and constant seawater concentration c s 35 000 mg l the inland boundary was assumed on the right side with the variable freshwater inflow denoted by q m d and doc concentration c d a no 3 infiltration zone was imposed along the upper boundary with the fixed length of 300 m highlighted by a red line the range of infiltration no 3 concentration denoted by c n and no 3 infiltration rate denoted by r m d were based on the research of ju et al 2006 zero flux boundary conditions were assigned on the remaining boundaries the subsurface dam and the cut off wall were constructed in the aquifer to prevent si their thickness were set to 1 m the barrier height and the barrier location were defined as variables denoted by h and l respectively the positions of the seawater toe location before and after the construction of a physical barrier were denoted by τ 0 and τ h respectively the denitrification process used in this model followed kim et al 2017 spiteri et al 2008 the kinetic formulations are shown in table 1 this simplified conceptual model allows the effects of physical barriers on si and no 3 accumulation in coastal aquifers to be analyzed the model also facilitates comparisons with the previous laboratory experiment results sun et al 2019 luyun et al 2009 numerical simulations results zheng et al 2020 and field observation results siemens et al 2003 yoshimoto et al 2013 lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 kang and xu 2017 2 2 numerical modeling species transport and reaction processes in coastal aquifers under the influence of physical barriers were investigated via steady state to steady state simulations using fe flow 7 0 the reader is referred to the fe flow reference book diersch and jg 2014 for a comprehensive theoretical basis the advancing front algorithm was used to generate the triangular finite element meshes the number of nodes used in the simulations was selected based on a grid convergence study in which the seawater toe locations and no 3 contours were compared for different grid resolutions which include 2404 9052 35 062 and 138 930 nodes respectively the results showed that the resolutions containing 35 062 nodes or more displayed insignificant discrepancies and therefore used as the grid independent solution a warm up period without a barrier was simulated in advance in which the inflow q 0 was set to 0 20 m d to generate a weak si condition then the physical barriers were included in the model in order to accurately determine the barrier heights and locations the elements that represented the physical barrier were further refined to a factor of 5 with respect to the domain discretization the real simulations include univariate cases and multivariate cases and flowchart of the simulation procedures are shown in fig 2 in the univariate cases the infiltration no 3 concentration the inflow doc the barrier height and the barrier location were simulated as univariate in turn then a group of multivariate cases with changing boundary conditions was simulated the range of sea level fluctuation was taken from li et al 2008 for the values of infiltration rate and freshwater inflow we refer to the researches of ramberg et al 2006 and xiong et al 2020 respectively the simulation time of the univariate cases and the multivariate cases were set to 3600 d and 1080 d respectively the maximum time step size was limited to 0 0625 d in multivariate cases to ensure an accurate simulation of the tidal process a second order predictor corrector strategy with a one step full newton approach was imposed to solve the nonlinear equations the parameter settings for each simulation can be found in table 2 in which the variable parameters are listed separately and the benchmark values are underlined 2 3 evaluating indexes to generalize the simulation results we transformed the barrier heights to dimensionless form 1 h h b where h and b are the barrier height and aquifer thickness in simulations respectively the dimensionless barrier location is defined as 2 l l b where l is the actual distance between the physical barrier and the sea boundary the effectiveness of a physical barrier is evaluated by the change rate of the seawater toe location denoted by δτ 3 δ τ τ 0 τ h τ 0 where τ 0 and τ h were the steady state seawater toe locations before and after the construction of a physical barrier it was measured by the position of 50 seawater interfaces ketabchi et al 2016 the no 3 accumulation degree is evaluated by the change rate of the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream after the barrier construction which is denoted by δα 4 δ α α 0 α h α 0 where α 0 and α h are the mean no 3 concentrations in the groundwater upstream before and after the construction of a physical barrier repectively 3 results and discussion simulations have been conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the two types of physical barriers on si prevention and no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream of the barriers our work showed that the construction of physical barriers results in the changes of flow field the reduction of seawater wedge length and the increase in mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream the no 3 accumulation degree is related to the barrier type the barrier height and the barrier location a cut off wall constructed close to the coast with a larger barrier height could result in severe no 3 accumulation 3 1 no 3 accumulation mechanisms under the barrier to investigate the mechanism of no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream caused by the physical barriers and the influence of the environmental factors a series of cut off wall cases and subsurface dam cases with fixed barrier height and location but different no 3 infiltration concentrations and inflow doc concentrations were simulated 3 1 1 no 3 accumulation under cut off wall fig 3 displays the steady state cross sectional distributions of simulated constituents and the flow field in the base case and the cut off wall cases with different infiltration no 3 concentrations and inflow doc concentrations in the base case groundwater migrated above the saltwater wedge due to the buoyancy effect and converged to discharge to the ocean the infiltrated no 3 mainly concentrated at the upper portion of the aquifer fig 3 a where doc was lacking fig 3 b when a cut off wall was constructed to the aquifer fig 3 c and fig 3 d groundwater discharged through the opening below the barrier in comparison with the base case the no 3 plume significantly expanded and the doc plume filled the lower part of the aquifer because of the reduction of seawater wedge especially the no 3 contamination deepth sharply increased in the vicinity of the barrier it is worth noting that a low velocity zone appeared at the upper corner of the cut off wall where no 3 concentration increased substantially but doc was lacking we call it the accumulation zone fig 3 e and 3 f display the typical distributions of no 3 and doc with a larger infiltration no 3 concentration of 500 mg l it can be observed that severe no 3 contamination occurred in the landward aquifer but there was an ignorable change in doc plume compared to the previous case fig 3 d fig 3 g and fig 3 h show the no 3 and doc distributions under the effect of a cut off wall with a low inflow doc concentration of 0 01 mg l the no 3 plume moderately expanded and a very small doc plume was observed in the natural condition the infiltrated no 3 was subjected to the combined effect of flow field and denitrification to form a semi elliptical plume at the upper portion of the aquifer fig 3 a which is consist with ju et al 2006 who found that despite irrigation agriculture resulted in severe no 3 contamination in the shallow groundwater the no 3 concentration in deep wells seldom exceeded the maximum standard of 50 mg l after the construction of a cut off wall a accumulation zone appeared at the upper corner of the barrier due to the change of the flow field fig 3 similar results can also be found in the no 3 distribution plot presented by zheng et al 2020 since the flow rate was significantly reduced at this zone and the doc cannot be replenished by inflow the denitrification was degraded zhou et al 2018 thus resulting in severe no 3 accumulation therefore in order to control no 3 accumulation at this zone introducing an external carbon source to enhance denitrification for decomposition may be a good choice which is recommended for further research 3 1 2 no 3 accumulation under subsurface dam fig 4 displays the distributions of simulated constituents and the flow field in the base case and the subsurface dam cases as shown in fig 4 c when a subsurface dam was constructed groundwater discharged over the barrier the mainly change in no 3 plume occurred at the area near the barrier the deep part of the aquifer was uncontaminated it was observed from fig 3 d that the subsurface dam could trap doc behind it similar to the cut off wall case there was a severe no 3 contamination occurred in the subsurface dam case with c n 500 mg l fig 3 e and fig 3 f when the inflow doc concentration was 0 01 mg l it was observed that the doc concentration in groundwater was low fig 3 h and the no 3 plume gradually expanded fig 3 g in contrast when a subsurface dam was constructed to the aquifer the groundwater was forced to drain through the upper opening since the no 3 plume was originally gathered in the upper portion of the aquifer and the inflow was assumed as constant the construction of a subsurface dam could be conducive to no 3 discharge to some extent therefore the results showed that the subsurface dam performed less no 3 accumulation compared to the cut off wall the irrigation water containing nitrogen fertilizers leads to high concentration no 3 leaching into the aquifer which is a common culprit for groundwater no 3 contaminantion 3 1 3 influence of environmental factors in order to compare the influence of inlow doc concentration and the infiltration no 3 concentration on the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam fig 5 was plotted negative correlations between the mean groundwater no 3 concentration and the inflow doc concentration were identified for both the cut off wall case and subsurface dam case fig 5 a the no 3 concentration in the cut off wall case was always higher than that of the subsurface dam case fig 5 b shows that the α h increases linearly with the increase of the infiltration no 3 concentration for both cases it was observed that the α h in the cut off wall case increased more rapidly compared to the subsurface dam case in general when the barrier height and location were the same a cut off wall can accumulate more no 3 contaminant compared to a subsurface dam at any no 3 infiltration concentration or inflow doc concentration even when the barrier height was different the subsurface dam could perform a smaller no 3 accumulation effect compared to a cut off wall the results were in line with previous studies showing that the construction of a subsurface dam causes less or no change in the no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream satoshi et al 2003 yoshimoto et al 2013 but consturcting cut off wall can cause a significant increase in the no 3 concentration lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 kang and xu 2017 zheng et al 2020 moreover since the doc concentration in groundwater is generally less than 5 mg l rivett et al 2007 thereby the lack of doc is usually identified as the main factor that limits groundwater denitrification rivett et al 2008 in practice the following two situations may occur 1 when doc was relatively abundant in groundwater and the infiltration no 3 concentration was low a large amount of infiltrated no 3 can be removed by denitrification thus results in few no 3 existing in the groundwater upstream 2 when the infiltration no 3 concentration was high and the doc concentration in groundwater was low a very small amount of no 3 can be eliminated by denitrification in this case the construction of the physical barrier could lead to severe no 3 contamination 3 2 influence of barrier design 3 2 1 effects of barrier height in this subsection a series of cut off wall cases and subsurface dam cases with different barrier heights were simulated to investigate the influence of the barrier height on si prevention and no 3 accumulation 1 steady state performance as shown in fig 6 when the cut off wall height was low fig 6 a the seawater partly intruded into the landward aquifer and the no 3 plume mildly expanded compared to the base case fig 3 a however when the barrier height was large fig 6 c despite the seawater was completely blocked on the outside of the barrier the no 3 plume significantly expanded in contrast it was observed that the no 3 plumes in the two subsurface dam cases differed only in the vicinity of the barriers fig 3 b and fig 3 d fig 7 shows the influence of the barrier height on the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam it can be seen from fig 7 a that the changes of δα with the barrier height for the cut off wall cases and the subsurface dam cases showed different trends a logistic curve showing the cumulative growth of δα was observed in the cut off wall cases where δα increased over 40 in contrast the δα curve in the subsurface dam cases was not smooth an anomalously low δα value appeared when the subsurface dam height was 0 4 which corresponded to the case failed to control si when h 0 5 δα slightly decreased with the increase in h the result indicates that the no 3 accumulation effect was reduced when the subsurface dam height was large furthermore in comparison with an equal height subsurface dam a cut off wall generally results in a larger δα especially when h 0 5 in addition as shown in fig 7 b when h 0 9 the subsurface dam achieved stronger effectiveness on si prevention compared to an equal height cut off wall the height of a physical barrier is one of the most important structural parameters to determine its performance the results indicate that construction of a cut off wall at higher barrier height produced significant no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream while for the subsurface dam the influence of the barrier height was insignificant this is because when the height of the cut off wall was large the accumulation zone became larger consequently resulting in more no 3 accumulated in the groundwater upstream however there was not a accumulation zone for a subsurface dam therefore changing its height has a small impact on the no 3 accumulation degree this is contrary to the previous experimental results by sun et al 2019 in which we observed that no 3 contaminated area expanded when the subsurface dam height was large it is valid to think that the difference arises from whether denitrification is considered since a higher subsurface dam could trap both no 3 and doc behind the barrier if the inlow doc is sufficient a higher subsurface dam could promote denitrification and reduce δα fig 7 depicts the effect of the barrier height on si control effectiveness and no 3 accumulation degree the result implies that a cut off wall can achieve a satisfactory si prevention effect if h 0 8 however in this case severe no 3 accumulation occurred in the landward aquifer this result suggests that once a high barrier is required to prevent si a subsurface dam may be a better choice under certain conditions 2 transient behavior in this section the transient no 3 concentration under the effect of physical barriers was discussed as shown in fig 8 a δα increase in the first 2500 d and then level off for each case the maximum of δα was found in the cut off wall case with the highest barrier height for the subsurface dam cases the increase of δα was relatively small fig 8 b shows the changes of ratio of no 3 discharge the negative sign of δα indicates the decrease of no 3 discharge to the sea overall the δα of each case decreased sharply in the first three years and then turn to level off while an overshoot occurred in the cut off wall cases the decrease of no 3 discharge in cut off wall cases were more than 10 which is obviously larger than the subsurface dam cases the cases with higher barrier height have lower no 3 discharge transient simulation results shown in fig 8 indicate that the no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream after a barrier construction is a long term process the overshoot phenomenon occurred in the cut off wall case can be explained as follows the flow field changed significantly after the construction of a cutoff wall then the no 3 slowly accumulated in the accumulation zone therefore the no 3 discharge decreased sharply when the no 3 concentration in the accumulation zone stablelized the no 3 discharge began to rise in addition when the barrier height is considerable the no 3 accumulation becomes more obvious this is because a higher barrier can trap more no 3 in the groundwater upstream especially for the cut off wall because of the accumulation zone a subsurface dam accumulates less no 3 in comparison with the cut off wall 3 2 2 effects of barrier location fig 9 shows the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam at different locations by comparing fig 9 a and fig 9 c it was clearly showed that the expansion of no 3 plume was more significant in the former case in which the cut off wall was constructed close to the coast and the seawater wedge was short similarly result was also observed in the subsurface dam cases fig 6 b and fig 6 d it is noteworthy that in the subsurface dam case where l 50 m a small amount of residual seawater was trapped behind the subsurface dam fig 10 shows the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam at different locations overall there was a moderately drop in δα for the cut off wall case and a substantially decrease of δα for the subsurface dam case fig 10 a the δα in the cut off wall case were always higher than that in the subsurface dam case for the cut off wall case δα decreased slowly at first and from l 3 it appeared to level off at about 35 77 however for the subsurface dam case δα decreased continously from 19 83 to 0 71 a drop of about 20 moreover if ignoring the residual seawater the two types of physical barriers achieve the same si prevention effectiveness as shown in fig 10 b changing physical barrier locations has a relatively small influence on no 3 accumulation but has a considerable influence on the si prevention effectiveness as shown in fig 9 the no 3 plumes in the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case close to the ocean are larger than that in the cases far away from the ocean this implies that constructing physical barriers near the ocean results in no 3 accumulation which is in line with the simulation result of the subsurface dam cases by sun et al 2019 moreover residual seawater was observed in the subsurface dam case where l 50 m because in the warm up period the seawater toe location was 79 55 m when the subsurface dam was constructed at 50 00 m part of the seawater was trapped in the landward aquifer the residual seawater has not been flushed out at the end of the simulation time this is comparable to the results of laboratory experiment by luyun et al 2009 who indicated that the retracement of the residual seawater can be slow if the subsurface dam height is large therefore it is believed that despite the subsurface dam has a good performance on si prevention and reducing no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream its applications is limited by the location for the areas where si has occurred priority should be given to the cut off wall or other si control measures rather than using the subsurface dam fig 10 depicts the effects of the barrier location on si prevention and no 3 accumulation the results imply that constructing physical barriers close to the coast enhances si prevention effectiveness but also increases no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream the significant difference between δα values in the cut off wall cases and the subsurface dam cases highlight that the cut off wall is more likely to cause no 3 accumulation than an equal height subsurface dam at the same location 3 3 multivariate analysis in this section a group of multivariate cases was simulated to evaluate the results obtained from the previous section the fluctuations of sea level the seasonal variation of freshwater inflow as well as the changing infiltration rate were considered these boundary conditions are shown in fig 11 the sea level followed a sinusoidal fluctuation the amount of infiltration rate increased sharply in april because of agricultural irrigation a large amount of precipitation from july to november makes the inflow increase significantly fig 12 shows the no 3 concentration at a fixed observation point for the base case the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case it is observed that the no 3 concentration in the cut off case is the largest the intraday fluctuation of the no 3 concentration is caused by the sea level fluctuation fig 13 shows the transient behavior of δα and δτ for the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case comparing this result with the fix boundary cases shown in fig 8 the main difference is that here δα presented seasonal fluctuations because of the changing boundary conditions after march agricultural irrigation increased which resulted in a significant increase in no 3 infiltration rate so that δα increased rapidly after june the increase in precipitation leads to the increase in groundwater inflow which was conducive to the removal of no 3 and seawater therefore from july to december each year δα and τ trend to slightly decrease in both the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case overall we quantitively study the no 3 behavior and accumulation mechanism in upstream aquifer considering real barrier types subsurface dam and cut off wall barrier structure height location as well as reasonable environmental conditions infiltration of rain and no 3 lateral recharge rate of groundwater and doc tidal sea boundary in this case the findings of the results can be extended to the other case studies and other conditions 4 conclusion in this study by numerical simulation the performance of two types of physical barriers on si prevention and no 3 accumulation were investigated an univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the influences of four key parameters the infiltration no 3 concentration the inflow doc concentration the barrier height and the barrier location on no 3 accumulation a multivariate analysis was carried out to explore the environmental effect of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam under changing boundary conditions moreover the mechanisms of no 3 accumulation caused by the two types of physical barriers has been discussed in depth conclusions drawn from this study are shown as follows 1 generally the height of a cut off wall should be larger than 70 of aquifer thickness to effectively prevent seawater intrusion however in this case the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream will increase by more than 30 2 subsurface dams generally causes less no 3 accumulation compared to a cut off wall but it is not applicable for quifers where seawater intrusion has occurred 3 a accumulation zone was formed after the construction of a cut off wall where the flow rate is slow and doc is difficult to be replenished so it becomes a no 3 accumulation zone 4 physical barriers cause a greater reduction in no 3 discharge than the subsurface dams the no 3 discharge reduction and no 3 accumulation occur simultaneously and this process lasts for more than 3 years to reach a pseudo steady state 5 generally subsurface physical barriers lead to significant no 3 accumulation if the barrier height is large the barrier location is near the sea the no 3 infiltration rate is large the infiltration no 3 concentration is large the inflow is weak and the doc concentration is low 6 seasonal variations of inflow and infiltration rate lead to fluctuation along the no 3 accumulation process after march mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream increases significantly while from july to december each year it slightly decreases there are still limitations that are worth noting in reality the aquifer can be heterogeneous or anisotropy and the denitrification may be more complex therefore appropriate augmentations are required for the current numerical model an uncertainty model is strongly recommended for optimizing the design of the physical barrier in engineering furthermore the findings of this research would be valuable for policy makers as they describe the environmental effects of the two most commonly used physical barriers at the field scale in time an interdisciplinary discussion of scientists from marine coastal and inland environmental research should evaluate the most appropriate barrier on a case by case basis declaration of competing interest

1378,physical barrier is a coastal engineering widely used to prevent seawater intrusion however previous studies have not evaluated the combined influence of type and structure of the physical barrier on nitrate accumulation in upstream aquifers furthermore the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation caused by the physical barriers are still unclear in this study numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the mechanisms and influence of the physical barrier on seawater intrusion and no 3 accumulation the results show that constructing physical barrier can result in the reduction of nitrate discharge to the sea and accumulation of nitrate in upstream aquifers the accumulation degree is significant if the barrier height is large the barrier location is near the sea the nitrate infiltration rate is large the infiltration nitrate concentration is large the inflow is weak and the inflow doc concentration is low a cut off wall is more likely to cause nitrate accumulation than a subsurface dam it can result in mean nitrate concentration in groundwater upstream increasing by more than 30 because a nitrate accumulation zone is formed behind the cut off wall where the flow is slow and dissolved oxygen carbon is difficult to be replenished so that the denitrification is weak despite the subsurface dam may not result in a significant increase in nitrate concentration it cannot be applied to the areas where si has occurred due to the residual seawater problem the nitrate accumulation in the upstream aquifer is a long term process that lasts for more than three years to reach a pseudo steady state seasonal variations of inflow and infiltration lead to fluctuation of mean nitrate concentration thereby the nitrate accumulation rate increased after april and weakened between july and december keywords numerical simulation coastal hydrology nitrate pollution groundwater contamination 1 introduction in coastal regions groundwater is an important freshwater source for domestic agricultural and industrial usage lu and werner 2013 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 with the increase in population density in many coastal areas the demand for water resources has also increased kim and yang 2018 yan et al 2021 this has led to an over exploitation of coastal aquifers thomas and famiglietti 2019 and reduction in groundwater recharge badaruddin et al 2015 as such coastal aquifers are facing an increasing threat of seawater intrusion si werner et al 2013 walther et al 2017 the engineering measures used to control si can be divided into two main categories the hydraulic barrier and the physical barrier abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a wu et al 2020 the hydraulic barrier mainly blocks the intrusion of seawater by increasing the difference between the groundwater head and seawater head werner et al 2013 the hydraulic barrier includes the following types artificial recharge badaruddin et al 2015 christy and lakshmanan 2017 raicy and elango 2020 injection wells lu et al 2017 extraction wells abarca et al 2006 and mixed hydraulic barriers ebeling et al 2019 the subsurface physical barriers benefit from low operating costs and high stability and hence have been widely investigated ishida et al 2003 luyun et al 2009 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a chang et al 2019 the barrier are constructed by injecting impervious material into a subterranean aquifer abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b which are distinguished by two main types the subsurface dam and the cut off wall abdoulhalik et al 2017 a subsurface dam is constructed at the bottom of the aquifer leaving an opening at the upper part of the aquifer for groundwater discharge a cut off wall is constructed at the upper part of the aquifer which leaves an opening at the bottom of the aquifer for groundwater discharge in 1978 an experimental subsurface dam was constructed on miyako island japan with the dimensions of 16 5 m in height 5 m in width and 500 m in length it has been reported to be effective in combating si as well as increasing groundwater storage sugio et al 1987 essink 2001 contented that the subsurface dam is only suitable for si prevention in shallow aquifers because the construction cost would be prohibitively expensive if the aquifer is deep another issue worthy of attention is that the construction of a subsurface dam may generate residual seawater in the landward aquifer luyun et al 2009 takahashi et al 2011 2018 moreover the efficiency of the subsurface dam on si prevention is also influenced by the aquifer heterogeneity abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b and the permeability of the barriers li et al 2018 anwar 1983 developed an analytical solution to describe the saltwater wedge distribution under the effect of the cut off wall the author indicated that the cut off wall can depress the seawater wedge and the performance depends on the barrier height using numerical simulation kaleris and ziogas 2013 investigated the protective effect of the cut off wall on groundwater extraction they found the cut off wall can produce a more significant protection effect for a single well in addition they developed an analytical approach to facilitate the design of safe extractions under the effect of the cut off wall recently a new approach for the cut off wall installation was presented by strack et al 2016 the approach involves injecting a precipitate into the aquifer to reduce the permeability of aqueous medium in the upper part of the aquifer and thus controls si this method could reduce construction costs significantly compared to traditional excavation methods for the island water resources which are recharged by precipitation lu et al 2019 proposed a method to construct cut off walls around the shoreline of the island to mitigate si moreover abdoulhalik et al 2017 introduced a mixed physical barrier system which contained a subsurface dam and a cut off wall this barriers system was experimentally shown to perform stronger si control efficiency compared to a cut off wall on its own although these previous studies generate significant insights into the effectiveness of the subsurface dam and the cut off wall on si prevention the influence of these barriers on inland contaminants is not involved due to the effect of anthropogenic activities nutrient contamination has been found in many coastal region santoni et al 2020 nitrate no 3 which is generally considered to originate from fertilizer leaching and sewage infiltration jaunat et al 2019 has been proved to be a major contaminant that harms coastal groundwater anwar et al 2014 and the offshore marine environment abarca et al 2013 since the groundwater discharge is an important pathway for no 3 li et al 2018 and the construction of a physical barrier results in the shift in groundwater pathway chang et al 2019 the mean no 3 concentration after the construction of the barrier would be determined by the new flow field and denitrification spiteri et al 2008 sun et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 the change of no 3 concentration after the physical barriers construction has also been confirmed by field observations satoshi et al 2003 kang and xu 2017 and numerical simulation method lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 zheng et al 2020 sun et al 2019 however scientists draw different conclusions about the accumulation effect of the physical barriers kang and xu 2017 found that the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream of the cut off wall was significantly higher than that in downstream a similar result was obtained by lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 through field observation combined with numerical simulation using field scale numerical simulation zheng et al 2020 found that constructing cut off walls can accumulate no 3 significantly in the landward aquifer while for the influence of the subsurface dam on no 3 accumulation the results are conflicting yoshimoto et al 2013 found that the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream of the subsurface dam slightly increased and they developed a model to predict that the no 3 concentration would increase by 1 46 mg l in 100 years through laboratory experiments sun et al 2019 identified that the subsurface dam height is a key factor influencing no 3 contaminated degree in the landward aquifer a high subsurface dam could cause severe no 3 contamination however the field observation results over ten years provided by satoshi et al 2003 showed that the impact of the subsurface dam on no 3 was negligible previous studies have showed that the construction of physical barriers results in no 3 contamination in upstream aquifers especially sun et al 2019 quantitatively discussed the influences of subsurface dam height location and no 3 infiltration rate on no 3 contamination degree in upstream aquifer however they did not employ the denitrification reactions in their model which may overestimate no 3 contamination degree zheng et al 2020 presented that the cut off wall can cause severe no 3 contamination but they did not analyze the no 3 accumulation mechanism in addition the previous studies only considered a single type of physical barrier and a specific environmental factor such as no 3 infiltration rate the combined influences of type and structure of physical barriers on no 3 accumulation have not been evaluated furthermore the numerical models used in previous studies are mainly based on fixed boundary conditions but the no 3 accumulation process under changing boundary conditions is still unclear the specific objectives of this study are to clarify the no 3 accumulation mechanisms of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam and evaluate the influence of several key parameters i e the infiltration no 3 concentration the inflow dissolved organic carbon doc concentration the barrier height and the barrier location on the performance of the two types of physical barriers a numerical model was employed to achieve field scale simulations of no 3 transport and reaction in coastal aquifers 2 method 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 shows the geometry of the 2 d vertical slice of the aquifer which is perpendicular to the coast the concenptual model was developed based on the following assumptions 1 the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic chang et al 2019 2 the physical barrier is assumed to be impervious chang et al 2019 3 the denitrification rate is assumed to be determined by no 3 concentration doc concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration zheng et al 2020 4 the doc leached from agricultural soils was omitted in the model siemens et al 2003 the thickness of the aquifer was set to 50 m chang et al 2020 and the considered aquifer length was set to 500 m the ocean boundary was assumed on the left side with the variable hydraulic head denoted by h s m and constant seawater concentration c s 35 000 mg l the inland boundary was assumed on the right side with the variable freshwater inflow denoted by q m d and doc concentration c d a no 3 infiltration zone was imposed along the upper boundary with the fixed length of 300 m highlighted by a red line the range of infiltration no 3 concentration denoted by c n and no 3 infiltration rate denoted by r m d were based on the research of ju et al 2006 zero flux boundary conditions were assigned on the remaining boundaries the subsurface dam and the cut off wall were constructed in the aquifer to prevent si their thickness were set to 1 m the barrier height and the barrier location were defined as variables denoted by h and l respectively the positions of the seawater toe location before and after the construction of a physical barrier were denoted by τ 0 and τ h respectively the denitrification process used in this model followed kim et al 2017 spiteri et al 2008 the kinetic formulations are shown in table 1 this simplified conceptual model allows the effects of physical barriers on si and no 3 accumulation in coastal aquifers to be analyzed the model also facilitates comparisons with the previous laboratory experiment results sun et al 2019 luyun et al 2009 numerical simulations results zheng et al 2020 and field observation results siemens et al 2003 yoshimoto et al 2013 lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 kang and xu 2017 2 2 numerical modeling species transport and reaction processes in coastal aquifers under the influence of physical barriers were investigated via steady state to steady state simulations using fe flow 7 0 the reader is referred to the fe flow reference book diersch and jg 2014 for a comprehensive theoretical basis the advancing front algorithm was used to generate the triangular finite element meshes the number of nodes used in the simulations was selected based on a grid convergence study in which the seawater toe locations and no 3 contours were compared for different grid resolutions which include 2404 9052 35 062 and 138 930 nodes respectively the results showed that the resolutions containing 35 062 nodes or more displayed insignificant discrepancies and therefore used as the grid independent solution a warm up period without a barrier was simulated in advance in which the inflow q 0 was set to 0 20 m d to generate a weak si condition then the physical barriers were included in the model in order to accurately determine the barrier heights and locations the elements that represented the physical barrier were further refined to a factor of 5 with respect to the domain discretization the real simulations include univariate cases and multivariate cases and flowchart of the simulation procedures are shown in fig 2 in the univariate cases the infiltration no 3 concentration the inflow doc the barrier height and the barrier location were simulated as univariate in turn then a group of multivariate cases with changing boundary conditions was simulated the range of sea level fluctuation was taken from li et al 2008 for the values of infiltration rate and freshwater inflow we refer to the researches of ramberg et al 2006 and xiong et al 2020 respectively the simulation time of the univariate cases and the multivariate cases were set to 3600 d and 1080 d respectively the maximum time step size was limited to 0 0625 d in multivariate cases to ensure an accurate simulation of the tidal process a second order predictor corrector strategy with a one step full newton approach was imposed to solve the nonlinear equations the parameter settings for each simulation can be found in table 2 in which the variable parameters are listed separately and the benchmark values are underlined 2 3 evaluating indexes to generalize the simulation results we transformed the barrier heights to dimensionless form 1 h h b where h and b are the barrier height and aquifer thickness in simulations respectively the dimensionless barrier location is defined as 2 l l b where l is the actual distance between the physical barrier and the sea boundary the effectiveness of a physical barrier is evaluated by the change rate of the seawater toe location denoted by δτ 3 δ τ τ 0 τ h τ 0 where τ 0 and τ h were the steady state seawater toe locations before and after the construction of a physical barrier it was measured by the position of 50 seawater interfaces ketabchi et al 2016 the no 3 accumulation degree is evaluated by the change rate of the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream after the barrier construction which is denoted by δα 4 δ α α 0 α h α 0 where α 0 and α h are the mean no 3 concentrations in the groundwater upstream before and after the construction of a physical barrier repectively 3 results and discussion simulations have been conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the two types of physical barriers on si prevention and no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream of the barriers our work showed that the construction of physical barriers results in the changes of flow field the reduction of seawater wedge length and the increase in mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream the no 3 accumulation degree is related to the barrier type the barrier height and the barrier location a cut off wall constructed close to the coast with a larger barrier height could result in severe no 3 accumulation 3 1 no 3 accumulation mechanisms under the barrier to investigate the mechanism of no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream caused by the physical barriers and the influence of the environmental factors a series of cut off wall cases and subsurface dam cases with fixed barrier height and location but different no 3 infiltration concentrations and inflow doc concentrations were simulated 3 1 1 no 3 accumulation under cut off wall fig 3 displays the steady state cross sectional distributions of simulated constituents and the flow field in the base case and the cut off wall cases with different infiltration no 3 concentrations and inflow doc concentrations in the base case groundwater migrated above the saltwater wedge due to the buoyancy effect and converged to discharge to the ocean the infiltrated no 3 mainly concentrated at the upper portion of the aquifer fig 3 a where doc was lacking fig 3 b when a cut off wall was constructed to the aquifer fig 3 c and fig 3 d groundwater discharged through the opening below the barrier in comparison with the base case the no 3 plume significantly expanded and the doc plume filled the lower part of the aquifer because of the reduction of seawater wedge especially the no 3 contamination deepth sharply increased in the vicinity of the barrier it is worth noting that a low velocity zone appeared at the upper corner of the cut off wall where no 3 concentration increased substantially but doc was lacking we call it the accumulation zone fig 3 e and 3 f display the typical distributions of no 3 and doc with a larger infiltration no 3 concentration of 500 mg l it can be observed that severe no 3 contamination occurred in the landward aquifer but there was an ignorable change in doc plume compared to the previous case fig 3 d fig 3 g and fig 3 h show the no 3 and doc distributions under the effect of a cut off wall with a low inflow doc concentration of 0 01 mg l the no 3 plume moderately expanded and a very small doc plume was observed in the natural condition the infiltrated no 3 was subjected to the combined effect of flow field and denitrification to form a semi elliptical plume at the upper portion of the aquifer fig 3 a which is consist with ju et al 2006 who found that despite irrigation agriculture resulted in severe no 3 contamination in the shallow groundwater the no 3 concentration in deep wells seldom exceeded the maximum standard of 50 mg l after the construction of a cut off wall a accumulation zone appeared at the upper corner of the barrier due to the change of the flow field fig 3 similar results can also be found in the no 3 distribution plot presented by zheng et al 2020 since the flow rate was significantly reduced at this zone and the doc cannot be replenished by inflow the denitrification was degraded zhou et al 2018 thus resulting in severe no 3 accumulation therefore in order to control no 3 accumulation at this zone introducing an external carbon source to enhance denitrification for decomposition may be a good choice which is recommended for further research 3 1 2 no 3 accumulation under subsurface dam fig 4 displays the distributions of simulated constituents and the flow field in the base case and the subsurface dam cases as shown in fig 4 c when a subsurface dam was constructed groundwater discharged over the barrier the mainly change in no 3 plume occurred at the area near the barrier the deep part of the aquifer was uncontaminated it was observed from fig 3 d that the subsurface dam could trap doc behind it similar to the cut off wall case there was a severe no 3 contamination occurred in the subsurface dam case with c n 500 mg l fig 3 e and fig 3 f when the inflow doc concentration was 0 01 mg l it was observed that the doc concentration in groundwater was low fig 3 h and the no 3 plume gradually expanded fig 3 g in contrast when a subsurface dam was constructed to the aquifer the groundwater was forced to drain through the upper opening since the no 3 plume was originally gathered in the upper portion of the aquifer and the inflow was assumed as constant the construction of a subsurface dam could be conducive to no 3 discharge to some extent therefore the results showed that the subsurface dam performed less no 3 accumulation compared to the cut off wall the irrigation water containing nitrogen fertilizers leads to high concentration no 3 leaching into the aquifer which is a common culprit for groundwater no 3 contaminantion 3 1 3 influence of environmental factors in order to compare the influence of inlow doc concentration and the infiltration no 3 concentration on the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam fig 5 was plotted negative correlations between the mean groundwater no 3 concentration and the inflow doc concentration were identified for both the cut off wall case and subsurface dam case fig 5 a the no 3 concentration in the cut off wall case was always higher than that of the subsurface dam case fig 5 b shows that the α h increases linearly with the increase of the infiltration no 3 concentration for both cases it was observed that the α h in the cut off wall case increased more rapidly compared to the subsurface dam case in general when the barrier height and location were the same a cut off wall can accumulate more no 3 contaminant compared to a subsurface dam at any no 3 infiltration concentration or inflow doc concentration even when the barrier height was different the subsurface dam could perform a smaller no 3 accumulation effect compared to a cut off wall the results were in line with previous studies showing that the construction of a subsurface dam causes less or no change in the no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream satoshi et al 2003 yoshimoto et al 2013 but consturcting cut off wall can cause a significant increase in the no 3 concentration lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 kang and xu 2017 zheng et al 2020 moreover since the doc concentration in groundwater is generally less than 5 mg l rivett et al 2007 thereby the lack of doc is usually identified as the main factor that limits groundwater denitrification rivett et al 2008 in practice the following two situations may occur 1 when doc was relatively abundant in groundwater and the infiltration no 3 concentration was low a large amount of infiltrated no 3 can be removed by denitrification thus results in few no 3 existing in the groundwater upstream 2 when the infiltration no 3 concentration was high and the doc concentration in groundwater was low a very small amount of no 3 can be eliminated by denitrification in this case the construction of the physical barrier could lead to severe no 3 contamination 3 2 influence of barrier design 3 2 1 effects of barrier height in this subsection a series of cut off wall cases and subsurface dam cases with different barrier heights were simulated to investigate the influence of the barrier height on si prevention and no 3 accumulation 1 steady state performance as shown in fig 6 when the cut off wall height was low fig 6 a the seawater partly intruded into the landward aquifer and the no 3 plume mildly expanded compared to the base case fig 3 a however when the barrier height was large fig 6 c despite the seawater was completely blocked on the outside of the barrier the no 3 plume significantly expanded in contrast it was observed that the no 3 plumes in the two subsurface dam cases differed only in the vicinity of the barriers fig 3 b and fig 3 d fig 7 shows the influence of the barrier height on the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam it can be seen from fig 7 a that the changes of δα with the barrier height for the cut off wall cases and the subsurface dam cases showed different trends a logistic curve showing the cumulative growth of δα was observed in the cut off wall cases where δα increased over 40 in contrast the δα curve in the subsurface dam cases was not smooth an anomalously low δα value appeared when the subsurface dam height was 0 4 which corresponded to the case failed to control si when h 0 5 δα slightly decreased with the increase in h the result indicates that the no 3 accumulation effect was reduced when the subsurface dam height was large furthermore in comparison with an equal height subsurface dam a cut off wall generally results in a larger δα especially when h 0 5 in addition as shown in fig 7 b when h 0 9 the subsurface dam achieved stronger effectiveness on si prevention compared to an equal height cut off wall the height of a physical barrier is one of the most important structural parameters to determine its performance the results indicate that construction of a cut off wall at higher barrier height produced significant no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream while for the subsurface dam the influence of the barrier height was insignificant this is because when the height of the cut off wall was large the accumulation zone became larger consequently resulting in more no 3 accumulated in the groundwater upstream however there was not a accumulation zone for a subsurface dam therefore changing its height has a small impact on the no 3 accumulation degree this is contrary to the previous experimental results by sun et al 2019 in which we observed that no 3 contaminated area expanded when the subsurface dam height was large it is valid to think that the difference arises from whether denitrification is considered since a higher subsurface dam could trap both no 3 and doc behind the barrier if the inlow doc is sufficient a higher subsurface dam could promote denitrification and reduce δα fig 7 depicts the effect of the barrier height on si control effectiveness and no 3 accumulation degree the result implies that a cut off wall can achieve a satisfactory si prevention effect if h 0 8 however in this case severe no 3 accumulation occurred in the landward aquifer this result suggests that once a high barrier is required to prevent si a subsurface dam may be a better choice under certain conditions 2 transient behavior in this section the transient no 3 concentration under the effect of physical barriers was discussed as shown in fig 8 a δα increase in the first 2500 d and then level off for each case the maximum of δα was found in the cut off wall case with the highest barrier height for the subsurface dam cases the increase of δα was relatively small fig 8 b shows the changes of ratio of no 3 discharge the negative sign of δα indicates the decrease of no 3 discharge to the sea overall the δα of each case decreased sharply in the first three years and then turn to level off while an overshoot occurred in the cut off wall cases the decrease of no 3 discharge in cut off wall cases were more than 10 which is obviously larger than the subsurface dam cases the cases with higher barrier height have lower no 3 discharge transient simulation results shown in fig 8 indicate that the no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream after a barrier construction is a long term process the overshoot phenomenon occurred in the cut off wall case can be explained as follows the flow field changed significantly after the construction of a cutoff wall then the no 3 slowly accumulated in the accumulation zone therefore the no 3 discharge decreased sharply when the no 3 concentration in the accumulation zone stablelized the no 3 discharge began to rise in addition when the barrier height is considerable the no 3 accumulation becomes more obvious this is because a higher barrier can trap more no 3 in the groundwater upstream especially for the cut off wall because of the accumulation zone a subsurface dam accumulates less no 3 in comparison with the cut off wall 3 2 2 effects of barrier location fig 9 shows the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam at different locations by comparing fig 9 a and fig 9 c it was clearly showed that the expansion of no 3 plume was more significant in the former case in which the cut off wall was constructed close to the coast and the seawater wedge was short similarly result was also observed in the subsurface dam cases fig 6 b and fig 6 d it is noteworthy that in the subsurface dam case where l 50 m a small amount of residual seawater was trapped behind the subsurface dam fig 10 shows the performance of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam at different locations overall there was a moderately drop in δα for the cut off wall case and a substantially decrease of δα for the subsurface dam case fig 10 a the δα in the cut off wall case were always higher than that in the subsurface dam case for the cut off wall case δα decreased slowly at first and from l 3 it appeared to level off at about 35 77 however for the subsurface dam case δα decreased continously from 19 83 to 0 71 a drop of about 20 moreover if ignoring the residual seawater the two types of physical barriers achieve the same si prevention effectiveness as shown in fig 10 b changing physical barrier locations has a relatively small influence on no 3 accumulation but has a considerable influence on the si prevention effectiveness as shown in fig 9 the no 3 plumes in the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case close to the ocean are larger than that in the cases far away from the ocean this implies that constructing physical barriers near the ocean results in no 3 accumulation which is in line with the simulation result of the subsurface dam cases by sun et al 2019 moreover residual seawater was observed in the subsurface dam case where l 50 m because in the warm up period the seawater toe location was 79 55 m when the subsurface dam was constructed at 50 00 m part of the seawater was trapped in the landward aquifer the residual seawater has not been flushed out at the end of the simulation time this is comparable to the results of laboratory experiment by luyun et al 2009 who indicated that the retracement of the residual seawater can be slow if the subsurface dam height is large therefore it is believed that despite the subsurface dam has a good performance on si prevention and reducing no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream its applications is limited by the location for the areas where si has occurred priority should be given to the cut off wall or other si control measures rather than using the subsurface dam fig 10 depicts the effects of the barrier location on si prevention and no 3 accumulation the results imply that constructing physical barriers close to the coast enhances si prevention effectiveness but also increases no 3 accumulation in groundwater upstream the significant difference between δα values in the cut off wall cases and the subsurface dam cases highlight that the cut off wall is more likely to cause no 3 accumulation than an equal height subsurface dam at the same location 3 3 multivariate analysis in this section a group of multivariate cases was simulated to evaluate the results obtained from the previous section the fluctuations of sea level the seasonal variation of freshwater inflow as well as the changing infiltration rate were considered these boundary conditions are shown in fig 11 the sea level followed a sinusoidal fluctuation the amount of infiltration rate increased sharply in april because of agricultural irrigation a large amount of precipitation from july to november makes the inflow increase significantly fig 12 shows the no 3 concentration at a fixed observation point for the base case the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case it is observed that the no 3 concentration in the cut off case is the largest the intraday fluctuation of the no 3 concentration is caused by the sea level fluctuation fig 13 shows the transient behavior of δα and δτ for the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case comparing this result with the fix boundary cases shown in fig 8 the main difference is that here δα presented seasonal fluctuations because of the changing boundary conditions after march agricultural irrigation increased which resulted in a significant increase in no 3 infiltration rate so that δα increased rapidly after june the increase in precipitation leads to the increase in groundwater inflow which was conducive to the removal of no 3 and seawater therefore from july to december each year δα and τ trend to slightly decrease in both the cut off wall case and the subsurface dam case overall we quantitively study the no 3 behavior and accumulation mechanism in upstream aquifer considering real barrier types subsurface dam and cut off wall barrier structure height location as well as reasonable environmental conditions infiltration of rain and no 3 lateral recharge rate of groundwater and doc tidal sea boundary in this case the findings of the results can be extended to the other case studies and other conditions 4 conclusion in this study by numerical simulation the performance of two types of physical barriers on si prevention and no 3 accumulation were investigated an univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the influences of four key parameters the infiltration no 3 concentration the inflow doc concentration the barrier height and the barrier location on no 3 accumulation a multivariate analysis was carried out to explore the environmental effect of the cut off wall and the subsurface dam under changing boundary conditions moreover the mechanisms of no 3 accumulation caused by the two types of physical barriers has been discussed in depth conclusions drawn from this study are shown as follows 1 generally the height of a cut off wall should be larger than 70 of aquifer thickness to effectively prevent seawater intrusion however in this case the mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream will increase by more than 30 2 subsurface dams generally causes less no 3 accumulation compared to a cut off wall but it is not applicable for quifers where seawater intrusion has occurred 3 a accumulation zone was formed after the construction of a cut off wall where the flow rate is slow and doc is difficult to be replenished so it becomes a no 3 accumulation zone 4 physical barriers cause a greater reduction in no 3 discharge than the subsurface dams the no 3 discharge reduction and no 3 accumulation occur simultaneously and this process lasts for more than 3 years to reach a pseudo steady state 5 generally subsurface physical barriers lead to significant no 3 accumulation if the barrier height is large the barrier location is near the sea the no 3 infiltration rate is large the infiltration no 3 concentration is large the inflow is weak and the doc concentration is low 6 seasonal variations of inflow and infiltration rate lead to fluctuation along the no 3 accumulation process after march mean no 3 concentration in groundwater upstream increases significantly while from july to december each year it slightly decreases there are still limitations that are worth noting in reality the aquifer can be heterogeneous or anisotropy and the denitrification may be more complex therefore appropriate augmentations are required for the current numerical model an uncertainty model is strongly recommended for optimizing the design of the physical barrier in engineering furthermore the findings of this research would be valuable for policy makers as they describe the environmental effects of the two most commonly used physical barriers at the field scale in time an interdisciplinary discussion of scientists from marine coastal and inland environmental research should evaluate the most appropriate barrier on a case by case basis declaration of competing interest

1379,foam propagation and stability in highly permeable porous media encountered in soil pollution applications are still challenging here we investigated the application of foam for blocking the aquifer to divert the flow from a contaminated zone and therefore ease the remediation treatments the main aim was to better understand the critical parameters when the foam is injected into a highly permeable aquifer with high groundwater flow velocity up to 10 m day a decimetric scale 2d tank experimental setup filled with 1 mm glass beads was used the front part of the 2d tank was made of transparent glass to photograph the foam flow using the light reflected method the water flow was generated horizontally through injection and pumping points on the sides of the tank the pre generated foam was injected at the bottom center of the tank water streamlines using dye tracing and water saturation were investigated using image interpretation results show that 100 of the water flow was diverted during the injection of the foam foam stability in porous media depends significantly on the horizontal water flow rate recirculating water containing the surfactant increases foam stability the main mechanism of destruction was identified as the dilution of the surfactant in water however the head loss measurements showed that despite foam destruction the relative permeability of the water phase in the media remained quite low injection of foam increases the radius of gas propagation thanks to foam s high viscosity compared to a pure gas injection case these results are new highlights on the efficiency of foam as a blocking agent showing that it can also serve as a means for gas transport more efficiently in porous media especially for soil remediation applications keywords foam saturated zone soil pollution high permeability 2d tank 1 introduction foams have multiple applications in soil remediation in recent research three different foam uses were studied vectorization desorption and mobilization and blocking foams for each foam technology new formulations must be considered surfactant and its concentration additives gas to adjust the properties of the foam to its application vectorization foam is used to transport a specific additive for an in situ chemical remediation foams can transport nanoparticles sheng 2013 calcium polysulfide zhong et al 2011 bacteria for aerobic biodegradation choi et al 2009 or hydrogen maire et al 2019 desorption and mobilization foams use the surfactant properties of the foam to desorb pollutants and push them to a recovery well recent laboratory studies have been carried out to assess how foam behaves in porous media for shallow contaminated soil remediation couto et al 2009 dicksen et al 2002 mulligan and eftekhari 2003 several studies have focused on the remediation of soils contaminated by dnapl such as trichloroethylene tce jeong and corapcioglu 2003 jeong et al 2000 rothmel et al 1998 foam as blocking or diverting agents acts to reduce fluid flow in a high permeability zone of heterogeneous porous media this blocking effect is possible thanks to the high viscosity of the foam and its gas fraction reducing the mobility of water in the injected area foams formed in the different layers of soil are not identical in general stronger foam is generated in the layers of higher permeability partially blocking these layers this helps to homogenize flows between different layers this is one of the main advantages of foam as a non newtonian fluid a few authors have studied foam in the laboratory with the objective of a blocking application aranda et al 2020 bertin et al 2017 kovscek and bertin 2003 portois et al 2018a portois et al 2018b blocking more permeable areas also redirects recovery fluids to less permeable areas wever et al 2011 the reason is related to bubble stability and the capillary pressure khatib et al 1988 layers with high permeabilities have larger pores and therefore lower capillary pressure low capillary pressure means that the foam bubbles will not break as easily in these layers in addition small bubbles in more permeable layers will reduce gas mobility and divert the flow of water in these layers rossen et al 1999 the foam generated for blocking applications must be very stable to withstand flow over potentially long periods the main phenomenon for foam coalescence in porous media is related to the capillary pressure introduced generally as a critical value kovscek et al 2007 the capillary pressure in porous media is a function of water saturation and surfactant concentration surfactant concentration as well as foam quality also significantly influence foam stability in porous media wang and mulligan 2004 more recently aranda et al 2020 investigated the properties of foam generated using an alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant and nitrogen for flow blocking purposes in a very high permeable porous medium 10 10 m2 a packed column was used to study the impact of different parameters such as the foam generation method and the pre generated foam permeability on the foam blocking properties foam flow in highly porous media behaves with two regimes a weak foam flow followed by a strong foam flow these two distinct flow regimes were more significant when the foam was generated by the co injection technique surfactant and gas they found that a pre generated foam is a good option for blocking the highly permeable zone this pre generated foam showed non newtonian shear thinning behavior aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a b the final goal of this study was not to redirect the groundwater flows in areas of low permeability but rather to block an entire area upstream of the area to be remedied the final goal was to divert or slow down underground flows and to isolate the saturated zone which is under chemical treatment fig 1 the increase in the residence time inside this zone should facilitate the implementation of in situ remediation techniques in the saturated zone chemical vectorization and treatments at the end of the remediation processes the foam will have to be destroyed naturally to allow underground flows naturally finally the pilot site on which these technologies will potentially be applied has very high permeability from 10 10 to 10 8 m2 thus one of the main novelties of the present work is to study the blocking effect of foam in highly permeable porous media at the microscopic scale foam has been studied in micro models to examine the generation and destruction of gas bubbles through their direct visualization and thus establish a predictive model of bubble size distribution in the foam géraud et al 2017 on a macroscopic scale foam flow has been studied in homogeneous and heterogeneous media foam propagation in 2d tanks has been studied recently by some authors bertin et al 2017 bouzid et al 2018 forey et al 2021 longpré girard et al 2016 using different configurations to focus on the effect of heterogeneity and or the presence of pollutant they showed the importance of several physical parameters like permeability contrast presence of pollutant and surfactant formulation on the foam propagation and stability to our knowledge there is a lack of information in the literature concerning the study of foam flow and stability under water flow conditions in a decimetric scale 2d setup the setup presented here combines dye tracing mass balance calculation and a photographic analysis technique to assess foam flow and saturation values in the porous medium the objective of the present research work was to study foam injection in the presence of a flow of water to assess its potential as a blocking fluid for diverting flow from a polluted area although the real situation occurs in a 3d geometry to simplify the problem and to visualize better the foam flow using an imaging technique all experiments were carried out in a 2d tank the propagation and the stability of the foam were studied in a reference case with a water flow of different velocities as well as 10 m day according to the groundwater flow rate in a real polluted site additional experiments were carried out to study the influence of the nature of the water flow and its velocity on the propagation and stability of the foam 2 materials and fluids 2 1 porous media in all 2d tank experiments 1 mm glass beads were used for the study these glass beads supplied by dutscher were the same as those used in aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020b the porous media obtained using these glass beads have an average permeability of 8 4 10 10 m2 and an average porosity of 0 37 the transparency properties of glass beads allow good visualization of flows and saturation levels by image analysis 2 2 surfactant solution and gas building upon the results in aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020b a solution of alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant aos concentrated at 4 cmc was used for the experiments the surfactant solutions were always prepared the same day or the day before starting the experiments to avoid possible aging effects in addition further surface tension measurements were made on the stock solution to ensure that the cmc value 1 8 g l had not changed over time the results show that the cmc was not changed for more than a year after opening the product the gas used to generate the foam was n2 supplied by air liquide purity 99 99 carbon dioxide supplied by the same provider purity 99 7 was also used to prepare the foam pre generator 3 experimental setup and procedure 3 1 foam pre generation the pre generator consists of a porous medium made of calibrated glass beads of 0 1 mm diameter contained in a pvc column of 10 cm effective length as presented in aranda et al 2020 the porous medium porosity of the pre generator column was 0 38 with a permeability of 1 1 10 11 m2 3 2 2d tank setup two tanks of small s and medium m sizes were used in this study the geometric characteristics of the porous media contained in these tanks are presented in table 1 2d tanks are composed of a central volume to contain the porous medium on the two sides of this volume are two cavities separated from the central volume by two 250 μm metal grids allowing fluids to flow but fine enough to contain the porous medium the cavities insure an almost vertical homogeneous pressure inside the 2d tank the dimensions of 2d tank and the length of the cavities are specified in table 1 the assumption was made that the flows in the tanks were two dimensional to support this hypothesis the ratios between the effective height of the saturated porous medium and its width are also presented in table 1 the tanks have a central injection point on their lower part through which the foam is injected the m tank also has side connection points for connecting pipes and generating lateral water flows the experimental setup is presented in fig 2 it consists of a primary circuit foam injection a secondary circuit lateral flow of water and a tertiary circuit pumping of excess water in the primary circuit the nitrogen and the surfactant solution are co injected into the foam pre generator column the gas using a brooks delta smart ii mass flowmeter precision 0 34 ml min 1 and the liquid by an ismatec reglo icc peristaltic pump precision 0 063 ml min 1 the co injection system used a swagelok tee connector the fluids left the pre generator in the form of foam this foam flowed to a 4 way valve which directed it either to a beaker while awaiting stabilization or to the tank to begin injection the circuit pipes were made of pvc and had an inside diameter of 0 635 cm the secondary circuit consisted of four pipes and an ismatec reglo icc peristaltic pump with four independent channels this circuit allows deionized water to be injected into the inlet or left cavity of the tank this injection was carried out by two pipes the ends of which were located at the top and bottom of the cavity s tank or at two lateral connection points m tank to create as homogeneous a flow as possible likewise two pipes pumped water from the outlet or right cavity symmetrically to the water injection pipes to maintain a constant lateral flow the pumping rate in all four pipes was the same the tertiary circuit was made up of two pipes and an ismatec reglo icc peristaltic pump the two ends of the pipes were placed at the water air interface in the two cavities directly in the cavity s tank or attached to a connection point m tank this circuit was used to pump excess water from the cavities when foam was injected into the tank it occupied a volume replacing water that should be pumped by the tertiary circuit to a beaker placed on a sartorius mse8201s balance precision 0 1 g from the measured mass one can deduce the volume occupied by the foam during the injection photos were taken using a nikon d850 camera with a 105 mm focal length lens installed on a tripod the camera was placed in the central axis of the tank as close as possible but at sufficient distance to capture the entire tank a broncolor litos projector was placed above the tank slightly in front of the device and off center the placement above the tank avoids the reflection of the projector on the 2d tank glass the slight offset ensured that images were not obstructed by the projector foot a scuadra xpogrey element representing standard gray levels was attached to the tank to allow the photographs to be calibrated during the first photography tests these standards served to verify that white was not overexposed brightness value 255 or underexposed black brightness value 0 the photos were taken in a darkroom to overcome variations in exterior light 3 3 experimental procedures the 2d tanks were slowly filled up to height h with glass beads to obtain a homogeneous stack deionized water was then injected through the injection point at the bottom of the tank at a rate of 2 0 ml min the homogeneity of the glass beads and the low injection speed keep water flow stable due to very low capillary effects no air bubbles trapped in the medium were observed the tank was saturated with water up to an effective saturated height h listed in table 1 and shown in fig 2 the unsaturated zone helps to prevent the lateral flow of water at the surface all experiments are referenced in table 2 with the size of the associated tank and the type of lateral flow the type of lateral flow was changed in some experiments the lateral flow is of type open when the deionized water is injected continuously the experimental setup has been modified so that the pipes of the secondary flow operate in a closed circuit this means that the fluid pumped into the outlet cavity is directly reinjected into the inlet cavity instead of deionized water a flow of this closed type allows water to be reused in the tank with a surfactant that has been diluted beforehand and carried away by the lateral flow finally some experiments were simply carried out without activating the secondary circuit in this case there is no lateral flow in the tank without flow case this corresponds to the ideal case where there is no groundwater flow and foam should be in its maximum stability value it can help to better understand the effect of the lateral flow on foam flow behavior which is one of the main objectives of this work the pre generator column was first filled with the porous medium 0 1 mm glass beads then co2 was injected into the column followed by deionized water and finally the aos surfactant solution at a concentration of 4 cmc since a pre generator column is used for several experiments it is initially filled with destroyed foam gas and surfactant solution as the experiment is initialized following the same procedures as described in aranda et al 2020 gas and surfactant solution are co injected into the pre generator directing the foam to the effluent beaker using the 4 way valve this achieves a steady state foam flow in the pre generator column guaranteeing that the foam quality is 85 and the total flow rate is 4 ml min the objective of this preliminary step is to generate a strong foam repeatable for each experiment inside the pre generator the steady state was achieved when the pressure signal before the pre generator became stable at the same time the second circuit was activated to generate a lateral flow with a flow velocity of 10 m day the tertiary circuit was also activated to pump out any water excess before the start of the experiment to confirm the homogeneity of the lateral flow a tracing test was carried out with a solution of bromcresol green bcg at 1 g l 1 the dye is injected into the inlet left cavity and its flow is photographed finally when all the flows are stable and the foam is ready to be injected a first zero photo is taken the foam was injected into the 2d tank by changing the 4 way valve at the end of the injection period the 4 way valve was turned to direct the foam to the effluent beaker the primary circuit injection was stopped but the secondary and tertiary circuits were left active to study the stability of the foam over time a new tracing is done at the end of the experiment to visualize the impact of the foam on the lateral flow the duration of the injection was not the same for all the experiments some injections had to be stopped earlier because of some experimental constraints 4 image analysis to use the data acquired by photography the images must be processed and interpreted the final objective of this approach is to define a relationship between light intensity and liquid saturation to achieve this we used the light reflection methods lrm see alazaiza et al 2016 4 1 image treatments first a global area of interest aoi was defined to obtain the mean grey value necessary to associate with the water saturation this area is smaller than the 2d tank glass surface to remove the shadows that appear near the edges before any treatment step it is important to choose the appropriate analyzing wavelength the authors recommend working in monochrome flores et al 2011 however the technical limitations in the laboratory made it necessary to use white light during the experiments as the foam is white its intensity is approximately equal in all monochrome spectra consequently the choice was made to work on shades of gray the photographs are therefore converted into a 8 bit format to obtain 255 shades of grey the gray level was calculated using i grey i red i green i blue 3 where i is the light intensity between 0 and 255 there are many other methods described in the literature for converting rgb color images to grayscale câdík 2008 the most appropriate technique should be chosen according to the set objective aesthetics contrast highlighting a particular color etc many pixels may have under or over brightening to correct this effect it is essential to create small meshes where the intensity of the pixels will be averaged the first step is to determine the optimal size of this mesh for simplicity these meshes will be square the optimal size should be chosen as small as possible to get the most accurate information possible but large enough to avoid pixel order variations the primary analysis showed that the microscopic variations in intensity stabilize at an area of 8836 px2 or a small mesh of 94 pixels per side in the photographs the lighting may also not be perfectly uniform in the horizontal and vertical directions to correct this lack of uniformity the global mean intensity i m over aoi is calculated on an image before injecting foam reference image where the 2d tank is fully saturated with water s l 1 t 0 each analysis of a series for one experiment of photos will be based on its reference image the matrix δi 0 is defined for each mesh such that δi 0 i m i raw with i raw the mean intensity over each small mesh this uniformization gives a unified gray corresponding to s l 1 however the difference δi 0 between the global average value i m over aoi and the original average value of each small mesh i raw is kept for the rest of the analysis finally the intensity is linearly corrected using the standard black and white of the image 1 i 255 i uni i black i white i black where i is the corrected intensity of each small mesh the coefficient 255 changes the value of the intensity to a scale of 0 to 255 as initially to obtain more meaningful values technically this coefficient is unnecessary for image analysis i white and i black are the standard white and black intensities of the analyzed image and i uni the uniform intensity of each mesh is calculated as below using the variations in the intensity of the image zero δi 0 2 i uni i raw λ δi 0 where λ presents the correction for the possible variation between photographs 3 λ i white i black i 0 white i 0 black where i 0 white and i 0 black are the standard black and white intensities of the image zero 4 2 calibration of the intensity saturation relationship the optical density was used to estimate water saturation from grayscale images of a 2d tank flores et al 2011 kechavarzi et al 2000 it has been shown that the optical density can be related to water saturation using a linear function colombano et al 2020 luciano et al 2010 o carroll et al 2004 philippe et al 2020 in the case of light reflection methods the transmitted and received energy flux can be associated with the measured reflected light intensity i r and the light intensity reflected by a perfect white surface i i flores et al 2011 kechavarzi et al 2000 schincariol et al 1993 therefore the optical density od can be calculated as 4 od l og 10 i r i i then the water saturation can be calculated according to a linear relationship 5 s l αod β the coefficients α and β are then calculated from two calibration images where the saturations are known for high precision and simplicity the photos used were at s l 0 15 value of liquid saturation in the foam just after injection and s l 1 to visualize the results of this analysis the meshes were colored according to their gray intensity this visualization imposes a discretization of intensities and saturations for this study the saturation slices 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 0 7 0 7 0 9 0 9 1 were used and associated with a color scale from white to blue 4 3 method validation to validate this method the volume of gas in the tank calculated from the image analysis was compared to that calculated from the mass measurements of the excess water for this comparison an experiment without lateral flow was used to eliminate errors due to a difference between the injection and pumping rates generating the lateral injection during injection the gas occupied a volume equal to the volume of water leaving the tank from which the volume of injected surfactant solution is subtracted from imaging the volume of gas in the tank was deduced from the saturation values calculated from the light intensity considering the 2d tank volume and porous medium porosity the calibration performed on this experiment gave the values α 2 90 β 6 40 and i m 70 fig 3 presents the temporal evolution of the volume of gas in the tank calculated by measuring the mass and estimated by imaging error bars represent 5 of the value calculated by imaging the values calculated by the two techniques are similar within only 5 of error it is therefore concluded that the imaging analysis technique allows estimation of the saturation in the tank within 5 5 results and discussions 5 1 foam flow and its blocking effect this section discusses the results obtained for the reference case lateral flow of 10 m day i e the propagation of the foam front the ability to block the lateral flow and the stability of the foam in the porous medium after stopping the injection fig 4 shows the results of the tracings carried out before and after injection into the s tank experiment 1 before injection the tracer flows quite uniformly across the 2d tank the broadening of the shape is due to the diffusion of the tracer in the porous medium after the foam injection is complete the tracer flows around the strong foam the lateral flow of water is therefore completely diverted by the strong foam in this case the foam injection was extended so that it reached the unsaturated zone of the tank the photos show that the water level rises upstream to allow water to flow over the foam this behavior is attributed to low mobility of strong foam due to its high viscosity and low relative permeability therefore water flows around the foam zone as seen in fig 4 these results demonstrate that the foam can divert the flow of water acting as a blocking fluid 5 2 stability after the end of the foam injection its temporal stability was investigated during this phase of the experiment a lateral water flow was maintained in the tank fig 5 s photos show the destruction of the foam in the tank m experiment 6 during the stability phase the strong foam is weakened progressively and destroyed after 53 h of constant water flow shortly after this stage of foam destruction the gas phase was redistributed in the whole 2d tank most of the remaining gas in the porous medium was then trapped by capillary forces in the pores fig 6 shows the changes of gas volume over time in the tank obtained by imaging after a short delay the gas volume decreased and reached a limit value corresponding to the remaining gas volume in the tank once all the strong foam is destroyed it is interesting to note that the gas volume decreased little during the destruction of the strong foam from 1150 ml to 955 ml 83 of the gas supplied by the flow of foam therefore remains trapped in the porous medium either at the initial location of the foam or above it by buoyancy the photo of the tank after foam destruction shows a gas saturation distribution that is much more homogeneous than at the end of the injection the tracing tests carried out at the end of the destruction of the foam show that the flow is slowed down in the foam injection zone but that it passes through this zone again see fig 7 the delay before the start of the destruction of the foam seems to be related to the surfactant concentration indeed during the first moments of the stability phase the surfactant solution is sufficiently concentrated to guarantee the stability of the foam with the phenomenon of advection diffusion at the interface the concentration of surfactant in the solution decreases below the cmc which promotes foam coalescence by taking photos it is also possible to measure the height of the water in the inlet and outlet cavities the height differences correspond to the pressure drop required to generate the lateral flow in the porous medium due to foam propagation in the pore space this pressure drop corresponds to a reduction in the average mobility of water in the tank this reduction can be presented as a resistance factor rf water lat as below 6 rf water lat t h t h init where h init m is the difference in water height due to the lateral flow before the foam injection and h m is the difference in water height due to the lateral flow at time t the temporal evolution of resistance factor rf water lat is presented in fig 8 for experiment 6 during the foam injection phase rf increases as gas was invading the tank water mobility is logically reduced because of the space occupied by the strong foam which diverted the lateral flow after stopping foam injection rf continued to increase slowly compared to the foam injection stage consequently water mobility continued to decrease despite the destruction of the strong foam because a large part of the gas supplied by the foam remained present in the tank in addition the gas that escaped from the strong foam after foam coalescence rose toward the surface and became trapped in pores thus the gas saturation and its distribution increased in this zone above the strong foam and remained high in the zone previously occupied by the strong foam thus the average mobility in the tank decreased during the coalescence of the strong foam strong foam strictly diverts water flow during the injection phase but is gradually destroyed after the injection is stopped after this destruction the mobility of water greatly decreases due to the homogenization and distribution of gas saturation in the 2d tank the lateral flow generates more pressure difference to flow into the tank after the foam is destroyed thus the foam retains its blocking properties even after its destruction the main interest of the foam for blocking an area could therefore be a means of transporting gas in a porous medium in a homogeneous manner thanks to its high viscosity once the zone is occupied by the foam it can be destroyed to be replaced by the trapped gas which will maintain a low relative permeability and can be trapped in pores for a longer time 5 3 influence of lateral flow type to study how the type of lateral flow influenced foam propagation and stability the injections were stopped at a time corresponding to the same water mass measured at the outlet of the tank to have the same gas saturation in the tank after the foam injection was stopped the lateral water flow was continued at the same velocity as during the injection fig 9 shows the photos taken during the stability phase time zero corresponds to the end of the foam injection three different weak foam patterns were observed during the three types of flow at the end of foam injection t 0 these patterns were systematically observed for each of the repetitions carried out under the same conditions these photos were taken at equal trapped gas volumes for each experiment the main difference between open and closed flow was the presence of surfactant in the flowing water in the latter although the flow is the cause of unsymmetrical patterns in both cases the surfactant supply in the closed flow contributes to the generation of a weak foam around the strong foam zone where gas and surfactant are present the weak foam corresponds to gas bubbles coming from the strong foam zone that are stabilized by the surfactant molecules transported by the closed lateral flow in the case without lateral flow the strong foam is quickly destroyed and the gas coming from the strong foam zone is moving up in the tank with an open flow the strong foam is quickly destroyed in contrast the destruction of the foam is much more limited in the case of a closed flow for an experiment without flow only a slight diffusion of the gas is observed changing the strong foam contours slightly and without observing visible destruction the absence of foam destruction for an experiment without lateral flow proves the fact that lateral flow is the main cause of the coalescence phenomena and therefore of the destruction of the strong foam it is therefore concluded that it is the advection diffusion phenomenon that dominates the coalescence dynamics of the strong foam the experiments with the open and closed lateral flow were performed with the same lateral flow velocity and therefore exhibit the same viscous stresses on the strong foam the fact that foam destruction was greatly reduced for closed flow proves that viscous interactions due to flow play a very limited role in foam destruction the main advantage of using a closed flow is to supply the water flowing laterally with surfactant the observed difference is therefore due to the presence of surfactant in the lateral flow the closed circulation of water increases foam stability and reduces its rejection in groundwater 5 4 influence of lateral flow velocity experiments were carried out in the m tank to assess the influence of the lateral flow velocity four experiments numbers 4 5 6 and 7 were carried out with lateral flow velocities of 5 7 5 and 10 m day and one experiment without any lateral flow the results are presented below to quantify the foam volume the radius of influence roi of the foam is defined as the geometric mean of the lateral radius r h and the vertical radius r v as roi r h r v to complete the analysis of the shape of the foam the aspect ratio ar is defined as ar r h r v only the shape of the strong foam zone will be discussed strong foam can be visually distinguished from weak foam and gas bubbles by the regularity of its shape as well as its color very close to white indicating a high gas saturation the areas of the tank where weak foam or gas bubbles flow have irregular shapes are difficult to qualify geometrically fig 10 the results concerning the radius of influence are presented in fig 11 for different water lateral flow velocities the dynamics of the radius of influence follow an evolution close to a power law function in the theoretical case where no coalescence phenomenon would occur the radius of influence would evolve according to a relation of the type roi a t by geometric definition for a constant the foam injection rate the maximum theoretical value for a when the whole foam volume would be converted into strong foam can be calculated by a 2 q ϕπe with q injection flow rate and ϕ porous medium porosity however because of the coalescence phenomena part of the volume of injected gas escapes and is not included in the strong foam mass thus the roi follows a power law with an exponent less than 0 5 0 44 0 47 depending on the coalescence rate the coalescence rate should be higher for higher lateral flow velocity therefore the exponent for the roi factor is slightly lower however the precision of experiments does not allow us to see a significant difference between low lateral flow velocities 0 and 5 m day and high ones 7 5 and 10 m day the aspect ratios are plotted in fig 12 for different water lateral flow velocities the aspect ratios are just above 1 at the beginning of the injection and decrease with time to reach the values closer to one at the end of the injection the elongation observed in the horizontal direction at the beginning of the injection can be attributed to bottom wall effects this means that the elongation of the half ellipse is more horizontal at the beginning of the injection and tends to a half circular form at the end these results show that gravity has no significant impact on strong foam propagation this confirms the results obtained in aranda et al 2020 which show that in the case of the flow of a strong foam in a porous medium the viscous forces are dominant over the gravitational forces the lateral flow rate tends very slightly to increase the aspect ratio however because of the random pathway of foam preferential paths in the 2d tank it is difficult to obtain more precise results to study the influence of the lateral flow speed on the stability of the foam the injections were stopped at the same mass measured at the outlet of the tank after the foam injection was stopped the lateral flow was continued at the same velocity as during the injection fig 13 shows photos of the tanks according to the time elapsed since the stopping of their respective foam injections the lateral flow velocity has a significant impact on the stability of the strong foam the higher the flow velocity the faster the destruction of the strong foam these observations support the hypothesis of destruction mainly controlled by dilution of the surfactant by lateral flow the volumes of gas in the tank for each of the experiments were estimated by the imaging technique the results of these analyzes are presented in fig 14 since the initial gas volumes vary slightly the volumes are presented in the form of relative gas volume equal to the ratio between the gas volume at time t and the gas volume measured at the end of the injection t 0 the measurement error due to the difficulty to delimit the boundary between the strong foam zone and the exterior leads to values greater than 1 in the limit of 5 for the 10 m day experiment the volume of gas remaining in the final state tank is quite high compared to the other experiments however the relevance of this graph lies in the destruction phase and not only on the value of the volume of gas in the final state first of all in the absence of lateral flow the foam zone is stable during the time of the experiment in presence of lateral flow the foam zone remains stable for a time that depends on the velocity these times are around 30 12 and 5 h for 5 7 5 and 10 m day lateral water velocity respectively this delay is attributed to the time necessary to reduce the surfactant concentration below the cmc by an advection diffusion phenomenon the velocity of the flow primarily affects the time before decreasing the volume of gas there is no significant difference in destruction speed between experiments after this time limit is reached since the advection and dispersion of surfactant are proportional to the velocity of the flow the latter accelerates the loss of surfactant and coalescence is initiated more quickly when the surfactant concentration decreases the strong foam coalesces starting with the areas with low surfactant concentration i e the foam water interface and in particular the sidewall on the upstream side of the lateral flow 6 conclusions we studied the behavior of the foam flowing in a highly permeable porous medium in the presence of a lateral flow of water using 2d tank setups the influence of this flow and its velocity on the propagation and stability of the foam have been studied in detail a flow of strong foam in the form of a semi circular semi ellipse and a weak foam around it followed by the free gas flow occurred during the foam injection the quasi circular shape of the strong foam shows its viscosity and the domination of viscous effects over gravity effects the weak foam on the other hand flows toward the top of the tank indicating a lower viscosity lateral flow creates an asymmetry in the weak foam pattern by inhibiting coalescence on the upstream side of the strong foam tracing tests showed that all of the lateral flow was diverted by the strong foam during its injection thanks to its high viscosity stability tests have shown that all of the strong foam is destroyed within a few tens of hours a low lateral flow rate helps to delay the onset of foam coalescence we found that the coalescence is mainly controlled by the phenomenon of advection diffusion of the surfactant in the 2d tank it is expected that when the surfactant concentration decreases below the critical micelle concentration cmc the strong foam begins to coalesce foam destruction decreases its viscosity and generates trapped and free gas that escapes from the strong foam zone upwards toward the top of the tank this increases gas saturation and its distribution in the area above the strong foam reducing water s mobility in the porous medium the foam therefore has a double blocking effect the first is a strict and direct blocking effect caused by the viscosity of the strong foam and the second is a relative and indirect blocking effect caused by the homogenous distribution of the gas phase in the porous medium the gas remains trapped in the porous medium and slows the flows if these are generated by a constant pressure head as is the case with unconfined aquifers these results shed new light on the efficiency of foam as a blocking agent showing that it can also serve as a means of

1379,foam propagation and stability in highly permeable porous media encountered in soil pollution applications are still challenging here we investigated the application of foam for blocking the aquifer to divert the flow from a contaminated zone and therefore ease the remediation treatments the main aim was to better understand the critical parameters when the foam is injected into a highly permeable aquifer with high groundwater flow velocity up to 10 m day a decimetric scale 2d tank experimental setup filled with 1 mm glass beads was used the front part of the 2d tank was made of transparent glass to photograph the foam flow using the light reflected method the water flow was generated horizontally through injection and pumping points on the sides of the tank the pre generated foam was injected at the bottom center of the tank water streamlines using dye tracing and water saturation were investigated using image interpretation results show that 100 of the water flow was diverted during the injection of the foam foam stability in porous media depends significantly on the horizontal water flow rate recirculating water containing the surfactant increases foam stability the main mechanism of destruction was identified as the dilution of the surfactant in water however the head loss measurements showed that despite foam destruction the relative permeability of the water phase in the media remained quite low injection of foam increases the radius of gas propagation thanks to foam s high viscosity compared to a pure gas injection case these results are new highlights on the efficiency of foam as a blocking agent showing that it can also serve as a means for gas transport more efficiently in porous media especially for soil remediation applications

blocking or diverting agents acts to reduce fluid flow in a high permeability zone of heterogeneous porous media this blocking effect is possible thanks to the high viscosity of the foam and its gas fraction reducing the mobility of water in the injected area foams formed in the different layers of soil are not identical in general stronger foam is generated in the layers of higher permeability partially blocking these layers this helps to homogenize flows between different layers this is one of the main advantages of foam as a non newtonian fluid a few authors have studied foam in the laboratory with the objective of a blocking application aranda et al 2020 bertin et al 2017 kovscek and bertin 2003 portois et al 2018a portois et al 2018b blocking more permeable areas also redirects recovery fluids to less permeable areas wever et al 2011 the reason is related to bubble stability and the capillary pressure khatib et al 1988 layers with high permeabilities have larger pores and therefore lower capillary pressure low capillary pressure means that the foam bubbles will not break as easily in these layers in addition small bubbles in more permeable layers will reduce gas mobility and divert the flow of water in these layers rossen et al 1999 the foam generated for blocking applications must be very stable to withstand flow over potentially long periods the main phenomenon for foam coalescence in porous media is related to the capillary pressure introduced generally as a critical value kovscek et al 2007 the capillary pressure in porous media is a function of water saturation and surfactant concentration surfactant concentration as well as foam quality also significantly influence foam stability in porous media wang and mulligan 2004 more recently aranda et al 2020 investigated the properties of foam generated using an alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant and nitrogen for flow blocking purposes in a very high permeable porous medium 10 10 m2 a packed column was used to study the impact of different parameters such as the foam generation method and the pre generated foam permeability on the foam blocking properties foam flow in highly porous media behaves with two regimes a weak foam flow followed by a strong foam flow these two distinct flow regimes were more significant when the foam was generated by the co injection technique surfactant and gas they found that a pre generated foam is a good option for blocking the highly permeable zone this pre generated foam showed non newtonian shear thinning behavior aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020a b the final goal of this study was not to redirect the groundwater flows in areas of low permeability but rather to block an entire area upstream of the area to be remedied the final goal was to divert or slow down underground flows and to isolate the saturated zone which is under chemical treatment fig 1 the increase in the residence time inside this zone should facilitate the implementation of in situ remediation techniques in the saturated zone chemical vectorization and treatments at the end of the remediation processes the foam will have to be destroyed naturally to allow underground flows naturally finally the pilot site on which these technologies will potentially be applied has very high permeability from 10 10 to 10 8 m2 thus one of the main novelties of the present work is to study the blocking effect of foam in highly permeable porous media at the microscopic scale foam has been studied in micro models to examine the generation and destruction of gas bubbles through their direct visualization and thus establish a predictive model of bubble size distribution in the foam géraud et al 2017 on a macroscopic scale foam flow has been studied in homogeneous and heterogeneous media foam propagation in 2d tanks has been studied recently by some authors bertin et al 2017 bouzid et al 2018 forey et al 2021 longpré girard et al 2016 using different configurations to focus on the effect of heterogeneity and or the presence of pollutant they showed the importance of several physical parameters like permeability contrast presence of pollutant and surfactant formulation on the foam propagation and stability to our knowledge there is a lack of information in the literature concerning the study of foam flow and stability under water flow conditions in a decimetric scale 2d setup the setup presented here combines dye tracing mass balance calculation and a photographic analysis technique to assess foam flow and saturation values in the porous medium the objective of the present research work was to study foam injection in the presence of a flow of water to assess its potential as a blocking fluid for diverting flow from a polluted area although the real situation occurs in a 3d geometry to simplify the problem and to visualize better the foam flow using an imaging technique all experiments were carried out in a 2d tank the propagation and the stability of the foam were studied in a reference case with a water flow of different velocities as well as 10 m day according to the groundwater flow rate in a real polluted site additional experiments were carried out to study the influence of the nature of the water flow and its velocity on the propagation and stability of the foam 2 materials and fluids 2 1 porous media in all 2d tank experiments 1 mm glass beads were used for the study these glass beads supplied by dutscher were the same as those used in aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020b the porous media obtained using these glass beads have an average permeability of 8 4 10 10 m2 and an average porosity of 0 37 the transparency properties of glass beads allow good visualization of flows and saturation levels by image analysis 2 2 surfactant solution and gas building upon the results in aranda et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020b a solution of alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant aos concentrated at 4 cmc was used for the experiments the surfactant solutions were always prepared the same day or the day before starting the experiments to avoid possible aging effects in addition further surface tension measurements were made on the stock solution to ensure that the cmc value 1 8 g l had not changed over time the results show that the cmc was not changed for more than a year after opening the product the gas used to generate the foam was n2 supplied by air liquide purity 99 99 carbon dioxide supplied by the same provider purity 99 7 was also used to prepare the foam pre generator 3 experimental setup and procedure 3 1 foam pre generation the pre generator consists of a porous medium made of calibrated glass beads of 0 1 mm diameter contained in a pvc column of 10 cm effective length as presented in aranda et al 2020 the porous medium porosity of the pre generator column was 0 38 with a permeability of 1 1 10 11 m2 3 2 2d tank setup two tanks of small s and medium m sizes were used in this study the geometric characteristics of the porous media contained in these tanks are presented in table 1 2d tanks are composed of a central volume to contain the porous medium on the two sides of this volume are two cavities separated from the central volume by two 250 μm metal grids allowing fluids to flow but fine enough to contain the porous medium the cavities insure an almost vertical homogeneous pressure inside the 2d tank the dimensions of 2d tank and the length of the cavities are specified in table 1 the assumption was made that the flows in the tanks were two dimensional to support this hypothesis the ratios between the effective height of the saturated porous medium and its width are also presented in table 1 the tanks have a central injection point on their lower part through which the foam is injected the m tank also has side connection points for connecting pipes and generating lateral water flows the experimental setup is presented in fig 2 it consists of a primary circuit foam injection a secondary circuit lateral flow of water and a tertiary circuit pumping of excess water in the primary circuit the nitrogen and the surfactant solution are co injected into the foam pre generator column the gas using a brooks delta smart ii mass flowmeter precision 0 34 ml min 1 and the liquid by an ismatec reglo icc peristaltic pump precision 0 063 ml min 1 the co injection system used a swagelok tee connector the fluids left the pre generator in the form of foam this foam flowed to a 4 way valve which directed it either to a beaker while awaiting stabilization or to the tank to begin injection the circuit pipes were made of pvc and had an inside diameter of 0 635 cm the secondary circuit consisted of four pipes and an ismatec reglo icc peristaltic pump with four independent channels this circuit allows deionized water to be injected into the inlet or left cavity of the tank this injection was carried out by two pipes the ends of which were located at the top and bottom of the cavity s tank or at two lateral connection points m tank to create as homogeneous a flow as possible likewise two pipes pumped water from the outlet or right cavity symmetrically to the water injection pipes to maintain a constant lateral flow the pumping rate in all four pipes was the same the tertiary circuit was made up of two pipes and an ismatec reglo icc peristaltic pump the two ends of the pipes were placed at the water air interface in the two cavities directly in the cavity s tank or attached to a connection point m tank this circuit was used to pump excess water from the cavities when foam was injected into the tank it occupied a volume replacing water that should be pumped by the tertiary circuit to a beaker placed on a sartorius mse8201s balance precision 0 1 g from the measured mass one can deduce the volume occupied by the foam during the injection photos were taken using a nikon d850 camera with a 105 mm focal length lens installed on a tripod the camera was placed in the central axis of the tank as close as possible but at sufficient distance to capture the entire tank a broncolor litos projector was placed above the tank slightly in front of the device and off center the placement above the tank avoids the reflection of the projector on the 2d tank glass the slight offset ensured that images were not obstructed by the projector foot a scuadra xpogrey element representing standard gray levels was attached to the tank to allow the photographs to be calibrated during the first photography tests these standards served to verify that white was not overexposed brightness value 255 or underexposed black brightness value 0 the photos were taken in a darkroom to overcome variations in exterior light 3 3 experimental procedures the 2d tanks were slowly filled up to height h with glass beads to obtain a homogeneous stack deionized water was then injected through the injection point at the bottom of the tank at a rate of 2 0 ml min the homogeneity of the glass beads and the low injection speed keep water flow stable due to very low capillary effects no air bubbles trapped in the medium were observed the tank was saturated with water up to an effective saturated height h listed in table 1 and shown in fig 2 the unsaturated zone helps to prevent the lateral flow of water at the surface all experiments are referenced in table 2 with the size of the associated tank and the type of lateral flow the type of lateral flow was changed in some experiments the lateral flow is of type open when the deionized water is injected continuously the experimental setup has been modified so that the pipes of the secondary flow operate in a closed circuit this means that the fluid pumped into the outlet cavity is directly reinjected into the inlet cavity instead of deionized water a flow of this closed type allows water to be reused in the tank with a surfactant that has been diluted beforehand and carried away by the lateral flow finally some experiments were simply carried out without activating the secondary circuit in this case there is no lateral flow in the tank without flow case this corresponds to the ideal case where there is no groundwater flow and foam should be in its maximum stability value it can help to better understand the effect of the lateral flow on foam flow behavior which is one of the main objectives of this work the pre generator column was first filled with the porous medium 0 1 mm glass beads then co2 was injected into the column followed by deionized water and finally the aos surfactant solution at a concentration of 4 cmc since a pre generator column is used for several experiments it is initially filled with destroyed foam gas and surfactant solution as the experiment is initialized following the same procedures as described in aranda et al 2020 gas and surfactant solution are co injected into the pre generator directing the foam to the effluent beaker using the 4 way valve this achieves a steady state foam flow in the pre generator column guaranteeing that the foam quality is 85 and the total flow rate is 4 ml min the objective of this preliminary step is to generate a strong foam repeatable for each experiment inside the pre generator the steady state was achieved when the pressure signal before the pre generator became stable at the same time the second circuit was activated to generate a lateral flow with a flow velocity of 10 m day the tertiary circuit was also activated to pump out any water excess before the start of the experiment to confirm the homogeneity of the lateral flow a tracing test was carried out with a solution of bromcresol green bcg at 1 g l 1 the dye is injected into the inlet left cavity and its flow is photographed finally when all the flows are stable and the foam is ready to be injected a first zero photo is taken the foam was injected into the 2d tank by changing the 4 way valve at the end of the injection period the 4 way valve was turned to direct the foam to the effluent beaker the primary circuit injection was stopped but the secondary and tertiary circuits were left active to study the stability of the foam over time a new tracing is done at the end of the experiment to visualize the impact of the foam on the lateral flow the duration of the injection was not the same for all the experiments some injections had to be stopped earlier because of some experimental constraints 4 image analysis to use the data acquired by photography the images must be processed and interpreted the final objective of this approach is to define a relationship between light intensity and liquid saturation to achieve this we used the light reflection methods lrm see alazaiza et al 2016 4 1 image treatments first a global area of interest aoi was defined to obtain the mean grey value necessary to associate with the water saturation this area is smaller than the 2d tank glass surface to remove the shadows that appear near the edges before any treatment step it is important to choose the appropriate analyzing wavelength the authors recommend working in monochrome flores et al 2011 however the technical limitations in the laboratory made it necessary to use white light during the experiments as the foam is white its intensity is approximately equal in all monochrome spectra consequently the choice was made to work on shades of gray the photographs are therefore converted into a 8 bit format to obtain 255 shades of grey the gray level was calculated using i grey i red i green i blue 3 where i is the light intensity between 0 and 255 there are many other methods described in the literature for converting rgb color images to grayscale câdík 2008 the most appropriate technique should be chosen according to the set objective aesthetics contrast highlighting a particular color etc many pixels may have under or over brightening to correct this effect it is essential to create small meshes where the intensity of the pixels will be averaged the first step is to determine the optimal size of this mesh for simplicity these meshes will be square the optimal size should be chosen as small as possible to get the most accurate information possible but large enough to avoid pixel order variations the primary analysis showed that the microscopic variations in intensity stabilize at an area of 8836 px2 or a small mesh of 94 pixels per side in the photographs the lighting may also not be perfectly uniform in the horizontal and vertical directions to correct this lack of uniformity the global mean intensity i m over aoi is calculated on an image before injecting foam reference image where the 2d tank is fully saturated with water s l 1 t 0 each analysis of a series for one experiment of photos will be based on its reference image the matrix δi 0 is defined for each mesh such that δi 0 i m i raw with i raw the mean intensity over each small mesh this uniformization gives a unified gray corresponding to s l 1 however the difference δi 0 between the global average value i m over aoi and the original average value of each small mesh i raw is kept for the rest of the analysis finally the intensity is linearly corrected using the standard black and white of the image 1 i 255 i uni i black i white i black where i is the corrected intensity of each small mesh the coefficient 255 changes the value of the intensity to a scale of 0 to 255 as initially to obtain more meaningful values technically this coefficient is unnecessary for image analysis i white and i black are the standard white and black intensities of the analyzed image and i uni the uniform intensity of each mesh is calculated as below using the variations in the intensity of the image zero δi 0 2 i uni i raw λ δi 0 where λ presents the correction for the possible variation between photographs 3 λ i white i black i 0 white i 0 black where i 0 white and i 0 black are the standard black and white intensities of the image zero 4 2 calibration of the intensity saturation relationship the optical density was used to estimate water saturation from grayscale images of a 2d tank flores et al 2011 kechavarzi et al 2000 it has been shown that the optical density can be related to water saturation using a linear function colombano et al 2020 luciano et al 2010 o carroll et al 2004 philippe et al 2020 in the case of light reflection methods the transmitted and received energy flux can be associated with the measured reflected light intensity i r and the light intensity reflected by a perfect white surface i i flores et al 2011 kechavarzi et al 2000 schincariol et al 1993 therefore the optical density od can be calculated as 4 od l og 10 i r i i then the water saturation can be calculated according to a linear relationship 5 s l αod β the coefficients α and β are then calculated from two calibration images where the saturations are known for high precision and simplicity the photos used were at s l 0 15 value of liquid saturation in the foam just after injection and s l 1 to visualize the results of this analysis the meshes were colored according to their gray intensity this visualization imposes a discretization of intensities and saturations for this study the saturation slices 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 0 7 0 7 0 9 0 9 1 were used and associated with a color scale from white to blue 4 3 method validation to validate this method the volume of gas in the tank calculated from the image analysis was compared to that calculated from the mass measurements of the excess water for this comparison an experiment without lateral flow was used to eliminate errors due to a difference between the injection and pumping rates generating the lateral injection during injection the gas occupied a volume equal to the volume of water leaving the tank from which the volume of injected surfactant solution is subtracted from imaging the volume of gas in the tank was deduced from the saturation values calculated from the light intensity considering the 2d tank volume and porous medium porosity the calibration performed on this experiment gave the values α 2 90 β 6 40 and i m 70 fig 3 presents the temporal evolution of the volume of gas in the tank calculated by measuring the mass and estimated by imaging error bars represent 5 of the value calculated by imaging the values calculated by the two techniques are similar within only 5 of error it is therefore concluded that the imaging analysis technique allows estimation of the saturation in the tank within 5 5 results and discussions 5 1 foam flow and its blocking effect this section discusses the results obtained for the reference case lateral flow of 10 m day i e the propagation of the foam front the ability to block the lateral flow and the stability of the foam in the porous medium after stopping the injection fig 4 shows the results of the tracings carried out before and after injection into the s tank experiment 1 before injection the tracer flows quite uniformly across the 2d tank the broadening of the shape is due to the diffusion of the tracer in the porous medium after the foam injection is complete the tracer flows around the strong foam the lateral flow of water is therefore completely diverted by the strong foam in this case the foam injection was extended so that it reached the unsaturated zone of the tank the photos show that the water level rises upstream to allow water to flow over the foam this behavior is attributed to low mobility of strong foam due to its high viscosity and low relative permeability therefore water flows around the foam zone as seen in fig 4 these results demonstrate that the foam can divert the flow of water acting as a blocking fluid 5 2 stability after the end of the foam injection its temporal stability was investigated during this phase of the experiment a lateral water flow was maintained in the tank fig 5 s photos show the destruction of the foam in the tank m experiment 6 during the stability phase the strong foam is weakened progressively and destroyed after 53 h of constant water flow shortly after this stage of foam destruction the gas phase was redistributed in the whole 2d tank most of the remaining gas in the porous medium was then trapped by capillary forces in the pores fig 6 shows the changes of gas volume over time in the tank obtained by imaging after a short delay the gas volume decreased and reached a limit value corresponding to the remaining gas volume in the tank once all the strong foam is destroyed it is interesting to note that the gas volume decreased little during the destruction of the strong foam from 1150 ml to 955 ml 83 of the gas supplied by the flow of foam therefore remains trapped in the porous medium either at the initial location of the foam or above it by buoyancy the photo of the tank after foam destruction shows a gas saturation distribution that is much more homogeneous than at the end of the injection the tracing tests carried out at the end of the destruction of the foam show that the flow is slowed down in the foam injection zone but that it passes through this zone again see fig 7 the delay before the start of the destruction of the foam seems to be related to the surfactant concentration indeed during the first moments of the stability phase the surfactant solution is sufficiently concentrated to guarantee the stability of the foam with the phenomenon of advection diffusion at the interface the concentration of surfactant in the solution decreases below the cmc which promotes foam coalescence by taking photos it is also possible to measure the height of the water in the inlet and outlet cavities the height differences correspond to the pressure drop required to generate the lateral flow in the porous medium due to foam propagation in the pore space this pressure drop corresponds to a reduction in the average mobility of water in the tank this reduction can be presented as a resistance factor rf water lat as below 6 rf water lat t h t h init where h init m is the difference in water height due to the lateral flow before the foam injection and h m is the difference in water height due to the lateral flow at time t the temporal evolution of resistance factor rf water lat is presented in fig 8 for experiment 6 during the foam injection phase rf increases as gas was invading the tank water mobility is logically reduced because of the space occupied by the strong foam which diverted the lateral flow after stopping foam injection rf continued to increase slowly compared to the foam injection stage consequently water mobility continued to decrease despite the destruction of the strong foam because a large part of the gas supplied by the foam remained present in the tank in addition the gas that escaped from the strong foam after foam coalescence rose toward the surface and became trapped in pores thus the gas saturation and its distribution increased in this zone above the strong foam and remained high in the zone previously occupied by the strong foam thus the average mobility in the tank decreased during the coalescence of the strong foam strong foam strictly diverts water flow during the injection phase but is gradually destroyed after the injection is stopped after this destruction the mobility of water greatly decreases due to the homogenization and distribution of gas saturation in the 2d tank the lateral flow generates more pressure difference to flow into the tank after the foam is destroyed thus the foam retains its blocking properties even after its destruction the main interest of the foam for blocking an area could therefore be a means of transporting gas in a porous medium in a homogeneous manner thanks to its high viscosity once the zone is occupied by the foam it can be destroyed to be replaced by the trapped gas which will maintain a low relative permeability and can be trapped in pores for a longer time 5 3 influence of lateral flow type to study how the type of lateral flow influenced foam propagation and stability the injections were stopped at a time corresponding to the same water mass measured at the outlet of the tank to have the same gas saturation in the tank after the foam injection was stopped the lateral water flow was continued at the same velocity as during the injection fig 9 shows the photos taken during the stability phase time zero corresponds to the end of the foam injection three different weak foam patterns were observed during the three types of flow at the end of foam injection t 0 these patterns were systematically observed for each of the repetitions carried out under the same conditions these photos were taken at equal trapped gas volumes for each experiment the main difference between open and closed flow was the presence of surfactant in the flowing water in the latter although the flow is the cause of unsymmetrical patterns in both cases the surfactant supply in the closed flow contributes to the generation of a weak foam around the strong foam zone where gas and surfactant are present the weak foam corresponds to gas bubbles coming from the strong foam zone that are stabilized by the surfactant molecules transported by the closed lateral flow in the case without lateral flow the strong foam is quickly destroyed and the gas coming from the strong foam zone is moving up in the tank with an open flow the strong foam is quickly destroyed in contrast the destruction of the foam is much more limited in the case of a closed flow for an experiment without flow only a slight diffusion of the gas is observed changing the strong foam contours slightly and without observing visible destruction the absence of foam destruction for an experiment without lateral flow proves the fact that lateral flow is the main cause of the coalescence phenomena and therefore of the destruction of the strong foam it is therefore concluded that it is the advection diffusion phenomenon that dominates the coalescence dynamics of the strong foam the experiments with the open and closed lateral flow were performed with the same lateral flow velocity and therefore exhibit the same viscous stresses on the strong foam the fact that foam destruction was greatly reduced for closed flow proves that viscous interactions due to flow play a very limited role in foam destruction the main advantage of using a closed flow is to supply the water flowing laterally with surfactant the observed difference is therefore due to the presence of surfactant in the lateral flow the closed circulation of water increases foam stability and reduces its rejection in groundwater 5 4 influence of lateral flow velocity experiments were carried out in the m tank to assess the influence of the lateral flow velocity four experiments numbers 4 5 6 and 7 were carried out with lateral flow velocities of 5 7 5 and 10 m day and one experiment without any lateral flow the results are presented below to quantify the foam volume the radius of influence roi of the foam is defined as the geometric mean of the lateral radius r h and the vertical radius r v as roi r h r v to complete the analysis of the shape of the foam the aspect ratio ar is defined as ar r h r v only the shape of the strong foam zone will be discussed strong foam can be visually distinguished from weak foam and gas bubbles by the regularity of its shape as well as its color very close to white indicating a high gas saturation the areas of the tank where weak foam or gas bubbles flow have irregular shapes are difficult to qualify geometrically fig 10 the results concerning the radius of influence are presented in fig 11 for different water lateral flow velocities the dynamics of the radius of influence follow an evolution close to a power law function in the theoretical case where no coalescence phenomenon would occur the radius of influence would evolve according to a relation of the type roi a t by geometric definition for a constant the foam injection rate the maximum theoretical value for a when the whole foam volume would be converted into strong foam can be calculated by a 2 q ϕπe with q injection flow rate and ϕ porous medium porosity however because of the coalescence phenomena part of the volume of injected gas escapes and is not included in the strong foam mass thus the roi follows a power law with an exponent less than 0 5 0 44 0 47 depending on the coalescence rate the coalescence rate should be higher for higher lateral flow velocity therefore the exponent for the roi factor is slightly lower however the precision of experiments does not allow us to see a significant difference between low lateral flow velocities 0 and 5 m day and high ones 7 5 and 10 m day the aspect ratios are plotted in fig 12 for different water lateral flow velocities the aspect ratios are just above 1 at the beginning of the injection and decrease with time to reach the values closer to one at the end of the injection the elongation observed in the horizontal direction at the beginning of the injection can be attributed to bottom wall effects this means that the elongation of the half ellipse is more horizontal at the beginning of the injection and tends to a half circular form at the end these results show that gravity has no significant impact on strong foam propagation this confirms the results obtained in aranda et al 2020 which show that in the case of the flow of a strong foam in a porous medium the viscous forces are dominant over the gravitational forces the lateral flow rate tends very slightly to increase the aspect ratio however because of the random pathway of foam preferential paths in the 2d tank it is difficult to obtain more precise results to study the influence of the lateral flow speed on the stability of the foam the injections were stopped at the same mass measured at the outlet of the tank after the foam injection was stopped the lateral flow was continued at the same velocity as during the injection fig 13 shows photos of the tanks according to the time elapsed since the stopping of their respective foam injections the lateral flow velocity has a significant impact on the stability of the strong foam the higher the flow velocity the faster the destruction of the strong foam these observations support the hypothesis of destruction mainly controlled by dilution of the surfactant by lateral flow the volumes of gas in the tank for each of the experiments were estimated by the imaging technique the results of these analyzes are presented in fig 14 since the initial gas volumes vary slightly the volumes are presented in the form of relative gas volume equal to the ratio between the gas volume at time t and the gas volume measured at the end of the injection t 0 the measurement error due to the difficulty to delimit the boundary between the strong foam zone and the exterior leads to values greater than 1 in the limit of 5 for the 10 m day experiment the volume of gas remaining in the final state tank is quite high compared to the other experiments however the relevance of this graph lies in the destruction phase and not only on the value of the volume of gas in the final state first of all in the absence of lateral flow the foam zone is stable during the time of the experiment in presence of lateral flow the foam zone remains stable for a time that depends on the velocity these times are around 30 12 and 5 h for 5 7 5 and 10 m day lateral water velocity respectively this delay is attributed to the time necessary to reduce the surfactant concentration below the cmc by an advection diffusion phenomenon the velocity of the flow primarily affects the time before decreasing the volume of gas there is no significant difference in destruction speed between experiments after this time limit is reached since the advection and dispersion of surfactant are proportional to the velocity of the flow the latter accelerates the loss of surfactant and coalescence is initiated more quickly when the surfactant concentration decreases the strong foam coalesces starting with the areas with low surfactant concentration i e the foam water interface and in particular the sidewall on the upstream side of the lateral flow 6 conclusions we studied the behavior of the foam flowing in a highly permeable porous medium in the presence of a lateral flow of water using 2d tank setups the influence of this flow and its velocity on the propagation and stability of the foam have been studied in detail a flow of strong foam in the form of a semi circular semi ellipse and a weak foam around it followed by the free gas flow occurred during the foam injection the quasi circular shape of the strong foam shows its viscosity and the domination of viscous effects over gravity effects the weak foam on the other hand flows toward the top of the tank indicating a lower viscosity lateral flow creates an asymmetry in the weak foam pattern by inhibiting coalescence on the upstream side of the strong foam tracing tests showed that all of the lateral flow was diverted by the strong foam during its injection thanks to its high viscosity stability tests have shown that all of the strong foam is destroyed within a few tens of hours a low lateral flow rate helps to delay the onset of foam coalescence we found that the coalescence is mainly controlled by the phenomenon of advection diffusion of the surfactant in the 2d tank it is expected that when the surfactant concentration decreases below the critical micelle concentration cmc the strong foam begins to coalesce foam destruction decreases its viscosity and generates trapped and free gas that escapes from the strong foam zone upwards toward the top of the tank this increases gas saturation and its distribution in the area above the strong foam reducing water s mobility in the porous medium the foam therefore has a double blocking effect the first is a strict and direct blocking effect caused by the viscosity of the strong foam and the second is a relative and indirect blocking effect caused by the homogenous distribution of the gas phase in the porous medium the gas remains trapped in the porous medium and slows the flows if these are generated by a constant pressure head as is the case with unconfined aquifers these results shed new light on the efficiency of foam as a blocking agent showing that it can also serve as a means of transporting gas more efficiently in porous media especially for soil remediation applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
