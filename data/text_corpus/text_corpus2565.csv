12825,this study investigated the effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads rload and cathode conditions on the overall removal rate of ortho hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation characteristics in anti gravity flow microbial fuel cell agf mfc through co metabolism approach sodium acetate outperformed sucrose glucose and carbamide and the optimum influent acetate concentration 1000 mg l 1 significantly enhanced the o hydroxytoluene degradation by 13 41 98 71 output voltage by 15 14 609 25 mv and power generation by 30 96 159 44 mw m 2 the results demonstrated that there were prominent differences in mfc performances under different rload p 0 05 different external load conditions resulted in varying electron transfer reactions and thus affecting the removal efficiency and power responses of mfc system a complete removal of o hydroxytoluene and highest power density of 173 10 mw m 2 with a chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 93 56 were obtained with the rload of 230 ω where the rload approaches the cell design point hysteresis phenomenon was detected in the dynamic polarization during rload variations moreover it was observed that the removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene was significantly enhanced with aeration rate of 50 ml min 1 and dissolved oxygen concentration of 5 4 mg l 1 conversely higher aeration rate 400 ml min 1 had caused a decline of 26 in power generation ascribed to the limited active surface area for oxygen reduction reaction additionally the degradation pathway of o hydroxytoluene was proposed based on the identified intermediates graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell o hydroxytoluene co metabolism wastewater treatment bioelectricity generation dynamic polarization 1 introduction phenolic compounds pcs are ubiquitously distributed phytochemicals commonly present in various industrial wastewaters such as petroleum refineries coal tar resin manufacturing explosives plastics and pharmaceutical industries these organic compounds are toxic at low dose and highly resistant to conventional treatment methods due to their persistence toxicity and unpleasant organoleptic properties the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the agency for the registry of toxic substances and diseases atsdr have defined phenolic compounds as pollutants of priority concern 1 among phenols ortho hydroxytoluene also called ortho cresol has been extensively used as an intermediate for the production of phytosanitary products pharmaceuticals and epoxy resins but also as an important component of disinfectants and cleaning agents they are often present in the effluents from the chemical and petrochemical industries and their concentration in wastewater can vary from a few milligrams per litre to as high as 7 g l 1 2 moreover there have been umpteen reports on the intake of contaminated water containing o hydroxytoluene which has profoundly affected human health and caused suppression of locomotor activity respiration failure metabolic acidosis and ventricular fibrillation 3 ahead of the pollutant persistence and the technology aroused in wastewater treatment physico chemical methods were implemented to treat cresylic compounds extensively however these methods have severe drawbacks for instances incomplete removal of pollutants production of secondary pollutants and economically unviable 4 on the other hand biological treatments are capable in overcoming these drawbacks with the regard the effort to develop an integrated anaerobic aerobic reactor with bio materials in treating hydroxytoluene is never end as the effective treatment technique is much needed to mitigate environmental pollution in addition to that the degradation of hydroxytoluene and its derivates has aroused intense interest of researchers all over the world microbial fuel cell mfc is an environmentally sustainable technology that not only allows the treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants but also the conversion of chemical energy from the biodegradable wastes into electrical energy in the past decades numerous designs of mfcs have been reported but major designs composed only of double chambers mfc single chamber mfc and stacked mfc 5 among these single chamber mfcs were shown to represent a simpler design with reduced cost of operation and has added a value in producing higher volumetric power density due to smaller cell volume 6 previous research studies have indicated the efficient removal of majority of the biorefractory pollutants following the presence of robust microbial consortia in the anodic chamber of mfc which is capable of degrading the emerging contaminants ecs 7 the substrate plays an important role in the mfc system because the electroactive bacteria eab in the anodic region of mfc tend to utilize the biodegradable organics and transfer electrons to the anode howbeit the toxic recalcitrant pollutants can potentially damage the biofilm and hinder microbial metabolic activities owing to their biological toxicity according to yu et al 8 only 62 of 2 4 dichlorophenol was degraded and a weak current production of 123 ma m 2 was attained in mfc another study demonstrated that the maximum power density was only 1 7 w m 3 when 500 mg l 1 of pyridine was used as sole carbon source 9 moreover the study of hedbavna et al 10 also indicated that the removal of sole phenol containing wastewater was merely 52 6 with corresponding low power density of 1 8 mw m 2 in a double chamber mfc obviously the employment of refractory pollutant as the sole source of carbon is absolutely insufficient to optimize the decomposition of the complex molecules into harmless products while generating electric power therefore suitable co substrate should be well utilized to perform ideal pollutant removal with simultaneous power generation co metabolism strategies are well addressed in the state of art of wastewater treatment technologies for degradation of recalcitrant pollutants interestingly co metabolism is the transformation of a non growth substance in the obligate presence of a growth substrate 11 the reinforcement of growth substrates could be associated to the oxidizing enzyme induction and bacteria proliferation supported by biodegradable carbon sources 12 in general microbial mono or dioxygenase enzymes initiate the co metabolic reactions of aromatic contaminants by transforming the aromatic contaminants to dihydroxy aromatic intermediates 13 meanwhile glucose xylose acetate starch and sucrose are most known oxidizable carbon sources needed by microorganisms to maintain their bioenergetic status and engage in metabolic pathways for enhanced removal of pollutants and bioelectricity generation 14 application of co metabolism has its own breakthrough as one of the promising methods for rapid biodegradation of refractory pollutants such as aromatic and halogenated compounds for instance the use of acetate as co substrate activated β lactamase amidases transaminase and amide c n hydrolase activities contributing to the enhancement of amoxicillin removal by the anode functional bacteria strain lelliottia aquatilis 15 buitrón et al 16 also disclosed that the employment of acetate as co substrate significantly improved the electricity generation and phenol degradation by geobacter shewanella and pseudomonas in mfc undeniably the availability of co substrate in mfc provide an excellent platform in minimizing the poisoning of refractories on the anode respiring bacteria which is a necessity for mfc to recover energy from highly toxic wastewater moreover different co substrates could stimulate a specific microbial metabolism mechanism which would in turn affect the organic metabolism and electrons transfer process therefore the participation of appropriate carbon source in co metabolism in mfc plays huge significance in determining the degradation of phenolic compounds and bioelectricity generation meanwhile external load governs not only the electron transfer flux via the circuit but also the metabolism rate and electron transfer activity of anodic microorganisms 17 it was thus hypothesized that the treatment of o hydroxytoluene in mfc might also be influenced by external loads owing to the sensitivity of microbes towards the changes in anodic conditions most importantly the understandings of dynamic behaviour in fuel cell system should not be neglected because it has been a crucial criterion for system control and optimization additionally potential variation of cathode following the changes in the cathodic electron acceptors can significantly affect the performances of mfc auxiliary aeration was proved to have significantly enhanced the removal efficiency of organics and nutrients along with electricity generation when the numbers of electron acceptors were optimized in mfc system 18 to date the comprehensive effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads and aeration rates on o hydroxytoluene removal and power generation remained obscure and demand further exploration in the present study o hydroxytoluene was selected as a target refractory pollutant due to its semi recalcitrant characteristic pollution history and also its intense harmful effect on the receiving waterbodies to our knowledge this is the first attempt to treat o hydroxytoluene with energy recovery in a single chamber anti gravity flow mfc by adopting co metabolism strategy to fill the knowledge gaps the effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads and aeration rates on o hydroxytoluene removal and power generation were thoroughly evaluated nevertheless the dynamic response of agf mfc during load variation was discussed comparisons between operating factors were also conducted through tukey kramer statistical analysis to further investigate the significant difference on the performance of operational parameters in the mfc system furthermore detailed degradation pathway of o hydroxytoluene was proposed based on the results obtained from uv vis s spectrophotometry and gas chromatography mass spectrum gc ms analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction of agf mfc a single chamber anti gravity flow microbial fuel cell agf mfc was fabricated using poly acrylic plastic column with diameter of 6 cm and height of 30 cm as shown in fig 1 the agf mfc was operated under ambient temperature at 28 4 c in an indoor laboratory the volumes of anodic and cathodic compartment of agf mfc are 282 74 cm2 and 565 49 cm2 respectively the anodic compartment of the reactor was filled with uniform polypropylene carriers whereby each has the nominal diameter and length of 8 mm and 10 mm respectively there were three sampling points s1 s2 and s3 positioned at respective distances of 6 cm 12 cm and 18 cm from the bottom of the reactor two layers of sponges were inserted between the dual compartments to hinder the media carriers from floating as the carriers are less dense than the solution in the reactor carbon felts sg 222 maido cooperation japan with dimension of 3 2 5 2 cm length width height served as anodes the stainless steel mesh holder supporting activated carbon flakes cf sm was used as the bio cathode as previously described in tan et al 19 the cylindrical cf sm bio cathode has a dimension of 7 cm height and 5 5 cm diameter cf sm was fabricated by integrating reticulated porous stainless steel mesh sus 304 250 mesh with 85 3 g of activated carbon flakes the cylindrical stainless steel mesh holder fit in the modified beaker perfectly and the modified beaker served as a supporting structure to keep both the mesh holder and the carbon flakes in packed form the filler media and electrodes were inoculated with mixed cultured activated sludge wherein it was randomly collected from a rubber glove manufacturing factory located in perlis malaysia during the inoculation period synthetic wastewater was supplemented to the aerobic and anaerobic inoculation tank to support the growth of microbial community the electrical circuit of the system was completed by connecting the electrodes across a variable of external resistor with copper wires attached to the carbon rods each with 7 82 cm2 of contact area after incorporation of the electrode assembly it has a total net volume of 380 ml the entire column of agf mfc was covered with aluminium foil to block exterior light and prevent algae growth on inside of the system the cathodic compartment was supplied with aeration by using an air diffuser the air flow rate was controlled by using an air flow meter with a control valve lzb 3 china or unless otherwise stated 2 2 experimental design and operations four phases of studies were successively performed in an agf mfc reactor to examine the influence of type and concentrations of external carbon sources external resistances forward and reverse scan and aeration rates on the removal performance of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation in agf mfc each experimental study was carried out at least three times and an average of all the replicated experimental data was reported the reliability of the mean was indicated by the standard error presented in this study basic nutrient medium along with organic carbon source were served as the anodic growth medium for agf mfc the nutrient medium consisting of 0 31 g l 1 ammonium chloride 0 13 g l 1 potassium chloride 3 4 g l 1 dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 0 1 g l 1 magnesium chloride hexahydrate 4 4 g l 1 potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 0 116 g l 1 sodium chloride was fed into the agf mfc system prior to initiation of the start up for the experimental operations using a peristaltic pump bt100 100 m longer precision pump as reported in our previous study 20 sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide with invariable concentration of 1000 mg cod l 1 were used as the organic source of carbon in this system respectively this operation lasted for 45 days to acclimate microbial growth and achieve voltage stability the mfc was operated in continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 day due to the extensive usage of highly volatile phenolic compounds in petroleum industries and its hazardous characteristics even at low concentration 21 o hydroxytoluene with the concentration of 50 mg l 1 was introduced into the synthetic wastewater to simulate the petroleum refinery wastewater four different carbon source species e g sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide were supplemented to the system separately to study the effect of different carbon sources on the wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation performances of agf mfc phase i each co substrate in the anodic chamber with circuit disconnection was operated in open circuit as control experiment while other phases of research were all operated under closed circuit condition subsequently the initial concentration of carbon source species which exhibited the most favourable performances of the system would be varied in phase ii the purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the co substrate loading which is conducive to the optimal o hydroxytoluene removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation outcome besides the impact of different external loads 100 230 500 1000 and 10 000 ω on the performances of agf mfc was studied in phase iii to investigate the dynamic behaviour of mfc system the external loads variations in step wise forward and reverse manner were performed in the last phase phases iv of study different aeration rates 0 5 50 and 400 ml min 1 were adjusted to investigate the wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation performances of mfc under varying do concentration the detailed operational conditions were summarized in table 1 chemicals used for the preparation of synthetic wastewater were purchased from sigma aldrich and pure o hydroxytoluene 99 was purchased from acros organics all the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 3 analytical procedure 2 3 1 water sampling and analysis wastewater samples were collected from influent and all sampling points two to three times per week throughout the study to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance of agf mfc system the characteristics of wastewater were routinely measured by using do meter hanna hi 9146 orp meter hanna hi 8424 conductivity bante 510 china and ph meter bante 210 china respectively water samples were centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 10 min by a benchtop centrifuge cence l500 prior proceeding to the cod analysis the cod was determined by colorimetric method and measured using a spectrophotometer hach dr2800 usa the concentrations of o hydroxytoluene in the water samples were inspected using uv vis spectrophotometry uv professional china the uv vis spectrometer was turned on and the lamps were allowed to warm up for an appropriate period of time around 20 min to stabilize them subsequently an absorbance spectrum was determined using the standard solutions the absorption maximum wavelength λmax is 271 nm one of the cuvettes was selected for the blank solution the cuvettes were rinsed several times before taking a measurement a calibration line was first created to determine concentrations of standard solutions by uv vis spectrophotometry the blank distilled water and sample solutions were placed in the cuvette separately to be inserted into the spectrophotometer the concentrations of o hydroxytoluene were inspected by measuring the intensity of light passing through the sample solutions in a cuvette and compare it to the intensity of the light before it passes through the sample 22 degradation products of o hydroxytoluene were identified by using gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 2010 plus shimadzu japan equipped with a bpx 5 capillary column 30 m length 0 25 mm inner diameter 0 25 μm thickness interpretation on mass spectrum gc ms was conducted using the library database of national institute standard and technology nist the o hydroxytoluene removal efficiency was calculated as per the following equation 1 oht r oht in oht out oht in 100 where ohtin is the influent concentration of o hydroxytoluene and ohtout is the effluent concentration of o hydroxytoluene mg l 1 2 3 2 bioelectricity generation characteristics the voltages in agf mfc were recorded every 2 s by a digital data acquisition module graphtec midi logger gl820 the polarization tests were performed by varying the resistor from 20 k ω to 50 ω by using an adjustable resistor box before a variable of external resistance is used to obtain a polarization curve the fixed external resistor were disconnected from the circuit to determine the open circuit potential voc of the mfc subsequently the corresponding output voltage at various external load values was obtained only when pseudo steady state conditions have been established polarization and power density curves were then plotted for diagnostic purposes in determining the internal resistance and power density pd of the system power density was calculated based on the geometrical surface area of the anode 2 p d p a a where pd is the power density w m 2 p is the power w and aa is the surface area of the anode coulombic efficiency ce was also ascertained by the charge efficiency by which electrons were transferred in the cells as shown below 3 ce mi f q n δcod where m is the molecular weight of ch3coona 82 0343 g mol 1 i is the current flow a f is the faraday constant 96 485c mol electrons 1 q is the flow rate l s 1 n is the 4 electrons exchanged per mole of oxygen and δcod is the change in chemical oxygen demand cod between influent and sampling points 2 4 kinetics and statistical analysis pseudo kinetic model was used to analyse the degradation of o hydroxytoluene subjected to the effect of co substrate types and concentration external loads forward and reverse scan and aeration rates statistical analysis was conducted through one way analysis of variance anova at significant level of 0 05 to determine the significance of agf mfc performance between the operating conditions the tukey kramer post hoc method was then implemented to identify the significant difference of agf mfc performance among the operating conditions p value 0 05 indicated that there is a prominent difference between the groups while p value 0 05 indicated that there is no prominent difference between the groups goodness of fit of the kinetic model was examined using coefficient of determination for linear regression r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment performance of agf mfc system under different operating conditions 3 1 1 effect of co substrate types organic co substrate is one of the most decisive factors in determining the overall performance of mfcs due to its availability for anaerobic microorganisms particularly on co metabolic biodegradation of refractory pollutants it can serve as both a carbon source for microorganisms and an electron donor to produce the energy carrier molecule simultaneously the selection of an appropriate co substrate is crucial to ensure stable operation and the effectiveness of the pollutant treatment in mfc system four different types of co substrates acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide at concentration of 1000 mg cod l 1 were individually employed in this study to investigate the effect of co substrate types on the agf mfc system performances the agf mfc was initially operated under open circuit condition to evaluate their performance when there is no load in a circuit the open circuit voltages voc were nearly constant during the start up process and the stable voc of the mfc system were recorded the maximum voc of 754 mv 740 mv 731 mv and 720 mv across anode and cathode were attained for the agf mfc supplemented with co substrate of sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide respectively during the initiation phase of operation moreover the consumption of organic load in mfc operated under open circuit condition was also examined in open circuit the cod removal efficiencies of the mfc supplemented with sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide were 81 02 0 11 65 10 0 17 73 98 0 11 and 47 75 0 22 respectively fig 2 a displays the cod removal profile of agf mfc supported by different types of co substrates respectively low standard deviation had indicated the consistent removal of cod and stable operation of the system throughout this phase of study as shown in fig 2 a it was noticed that different types of co substrates contributed to different extent of cod removal the total cod removal efficiencies for afc mfc fed with sodium acetate phase ia sucrose phase ib glucose phase ic and carbamide phase id were 89 46 1 02 71 14 0 34 81 83 0 37 and 56 34 0 30 respectively the results have also shown that a large fraction of the cod was reduced in the anaerobic region a sharp increase in cod removal can be observed at s1 owing to the high cell density retainment and microbial viability at the bottom of the reactor fig a3 it was followed by uniform increment from s1 to s2 and s3 anaerobic oxidation of organic substrates in the wastewater was performed by the facultative anaerobes to stimulate biofilm formation 18 based on anova the difference between the four phases for the total cod removal efficiency was statistically significant p 0 05 the tukey post hoc test was further carried out by forming six groups of pairing among the co substrate choices acetate sucrose acetate glucose acetate carbamide sucrose glucose sucrose carbamide glucose carbamide to determine the significant differences between specific operating parameters tukey kramer post hoc test revealed that there was a significant difference for the six pairings p 0 05 this indicated the profound effect of co substrate on organic matter degradation and the mfc supplied with acetate significantly outperformed the other carbon sources in the removal capacity of organic matter in agf mfc system the effect of different co substrates types on the degradation of 50 mg l 1 o hydroxytoluene was investigated by supplementing different co substrates separately in the influent wastewater to evaluate the removal performance along the mfc system the total removal percentages of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc supplied with sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide were 98 79 0 042 78 35 0 017 91 02 0 056 and 58 16 1 26 respectively the effluent o hydroxytoluene concentrations in agf mfc for all the four phases were as follows sodium acetate 0 606 0 021 mg l 1 glucose 4 496 0 030 mg l 1 sucrose 10 826 0 010 mg l 1 carbamide 20 952 0 609 mg l 1 from the results it can be observed that sodium acetate is the favourite carbon source of the mixed microbial culture it was also proven by anova that the effluent o hydroxytoluene concentration from the system supplied with sodium acetate was significantly lower p 0 05 than those supplied with glucose sucrose and carbamide in addition kinetic study was conducted on the degradation of o hydroxytoluene to compare the degradation rate of o hydroxytoluene in mfc system supplied with different types of co substrates table s1 presented the reaction rate constant k and regression coefficient r2 compatible with the o hydroxytoluene degradation the degradation of o hydroxytoluene was best fitted to the pseudo first order kinetic model with a high regression coefficient value where r2 0 9 for all phases these results are consistent with the finding of the previous study 12 which reported the degradation of phenol and co substrate acetate in an air cathode mfc followed the first order kinetic in this study the degradation kinetics of o hydroxytoluene were ranked in descending order where sodium acetate 0 1703 h 1 glucose 0 09 h 1 sucrose 0 0574 h 1 carbamide 0 0326 h 1 the highest consumption rate of sodium acetate further verified that sodium acetate is the most efficient co substrate in comparison to glucose sucrose and carbamide the presence of sodium acetate as a co metabolic substrate exhibited the highest o hydroxytoluene degradation kinetic constant k1 which was 1 89 times higher than glucose 2 97 times higher than sucrose and 5 22 times higher than carbamide overall sodium acetate was found to be the best co metabolic carbon source for the degradation of 50 mg l 1 o hydroxytoluene in this mfc system from fig 2 b it was clearly found that the concentration of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc declined sharply at s1 and then gradually declined in the subsequent sampling points s2 and s3 under anaerobic conditions further reduction in the concentration of o hydroxytoluene was also observed in the aerobic region of the bioreactor for all four types of organic co substrates degradation of o hydroxytoluene with exogenous substrate via co metabolism in the anaerobic region of agf mfc was predominately accounted for the removal of o hydroxytoluene the biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microorganisms in mfc systems is an endogenous metabolism process which occur within the living cell in the absence of compounds that could serve specifically as exogenous substrates 23 the attachment and growth of microbes on the bio media filters anodic packing materials promoted the biodegradation process in the system on the other hand activated carbon flakes acf in the cathodic set up had also contributed to the adsorption biodegradation and bio regeneration in agf mfc therefore it can be expected that adsorption biodegradation and bio regeneration were the biological processes contributing to the total removal of o hydroxytoluene in this system bio regeneration is the renewal of the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon by microorganisms for further adsorption and it contributes to the removal of o hydroxytoluene through the biological degradation of pollutants into non toxic substances 24 furthermore the externally connected circuit at the bottom electrode of the reactor ensured microbial enrichment at s1 19 meanwhile the accumulation of o hydroxytoluene was the highest at s1 as the influent wastewater would be the first in reaching s1 the synergistic effect of the biological pollutant removal processes and high microbial viability at s1 had promoted a significant reduction in the o hydroxytoluene concentration at s1 the performance of o hydroxytoluene degradation was corresponded to the cod removal in this study moreover the supplementation of sodium acetate as carbon source was the best in terms of cod removal and o hydroxytoluene degradation in agf mfc followed by glucose sucrose and carbamide sodium acetate glucose and sucrose are ordinary and inexpensive commodity chemicals which can be produced either biologically or chemically sodium acetate a hygroscopic sodium salt is the intermediate product of the tricarboxylic acid cycle which can be directly utilized by microorganisms as carbon source glucose and sucrose are two types of sugars glucose also called dextrose is the most abundant monosaccharide and also a subcategory of carbohydrates meanwhile sucrose is disaccharide or a molecule made of two monosaccharides in comparison to glucose and sucrose the small and simple short chain fatty acids of sodium acetate are more conducive to the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms 25 the highest cod removal efficiency fig 2 and ce table 2 obtained with acetate have further verified that acetate is more conducive to microbial catabolism as compared to glucose as well as sucrose in agf mfc system obviously the presence of sodium acetate favourably contributed to cod removal efficiency and concomitantly expediting the degradation of o hydroxytoluene this is because acetate can be converted into acetyl coa directly by microorganism for energy production with high atomic economy 26 in contrast the conversion of glucose and sucrose is much more complex because these molecules contain more carbon atoms 27 a molecule of sodium acetate contains two carbon atoms glucose has six carbon atoms hexose bonded together as a chain with additional atoms of oxygen and hydrogen whereas a sucrose molecule composes of twelve atoms of carbon in addition organic matter was initially transformed into small molecular organics which was then utilized by electroactive bacteria and other bacteria on the anode of mfcs 28 the organic carbon sources with different molecular weight and complexity of molecular structure possess different metabolic processes which would have indirect impact on the co metabolic degradation of phenolic compounds in mfc system compared with sodium acetate catabolism of glucose through glycolysis pathway presents low atomic economy ascribed to the release of carbon dioxide in pyruvate decarboxylation 26 this would eventually result a reduction in mfc performance both sucrose and glucose are typical fermentative carbon whereas acetate is non fermentative carbon source therefore the nature of carbon sources availability may also influence the microbial community distribution in mfc system 12 interestingly the use of carbamide as a carbon source has not been directly examined in previous study however the presence of carbamide showed partial degradation of o hydroxytoluene suggesting that carbamide did serve as carbon source in this study possible toxicity of breakdown intermediates of carbamide to the anaerobic microbes could be the reason that causes it could not be sufficiently assimilated by microbes 29 3 1 2 effect of carbon source concentrations based on the results obtained in phase i sodium acetate was selected as the best source of carbon for cod and pollutant removal herein the concentrations of acetate were varied 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 to evaluate the mfc performances fig 3 a shows the cod removal under different acetate concentrations similar to phase i the cod removal continuously improved as the wastewater moving up the reactor from influent to effluent the total cod removal efficiencies were 98 6 0 33 88 75 0 92 75 34 0 22 and 68 35 0 85 for acetate concentration of 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 respectively based on anova the influent co substrate loading was found to have significantly affected the cod removal efficiencies of agf mfc system p 0 05 highest cod removal was obtained with 500 mg l 1 sodium acetate whereby 95 98 of cod removal was contributed by the anodic region this suggested that co substrate limitation might have occurred and an influent co substrate concentration lower than 500 mg l 1 should be refrained to avoid restriction on microbial growth by carbon source scarcity the cod removal efficiencies were noted to have significantly declined when the influent co substrate loadings were further increased up to 3000 mg l 1 this phenomenon could be ascribed to excessive co substrate supply which had exceeded the working capability of the microbes by considering the overall cod removal performance co substrate loading with 1000 mg l 1 was the most suitable concentration of influent co substrate yet with efficient cod removal to be achieved in agf mfc this is because influent co substrate lower than 1000 mg l 1 became a limiting factor for microbial growth while influent co substrate higher than 1000 mg l 1 contributed to lower cod removal the results were in line with the findings of tan et al 30 where the excessively high co substrate loading would hinder the cod removal of mfc system besides the removal performance of o hydroxytoluene under different acetate concentrations was investigated during phase ii while other operating conditions were kept constant as shown in fig 3 b the concentration of o hydroxytoluene declined sharply at s1 followed by a continual decline in the following sampling points for all co substrate loadings the influent organic loading was found to have significant impact p 0 05 on the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc system according to anova the total removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in this system were ranked in the order as follows 1000 mg l 1 sodium acetate 98 71 0 02 500 mg l 1 sodium acetate 85 47 0 67 2000 mg l 1 sodium acetate 75 79 0 91 3000 mg l 1 sodium acetate 51 67 0 97 correspondingly the average effluent concentrations obtained were 0 65 0 08 mg l 1 7 28 0 34 mg l 1 12 12 0 47 mg l 1 and 24 18 0 46 mg l 1 respectively the post hoc test was further conducted by forming six groups of pairings among the sodium acetate loadings to determine significant difference between certain operational parameters however the outcome indicated that there was significant difference p 0 05 for all the six pairings these significant pairings indicated that the effects between all the influent co substrate on o hydroxytoluene were prominent yu et al 8 revealed that poorer capability of phenolic compounds degradation could be exhibited at considerably lower or higher influent co substrate loading in mfc a concentration of 500 mg l 1 was insufficient to support the expanded microbial community along the anodic region despite the high cod removal conversely the excessively high influent co substrate concentration 3000 mg l 1 showed significant decline in the removal of o hydroxytoluene this is because microbial growth rate was inhibited at high co substrate concentration as organic acids would accumulate in the microbial cells via fermentation process substrate inhibition would occur when the concentration of co substrate supply exceeds the optimal parameters which will in turn reduce the microbial growth rate within the system importantly the readily biodegradable organic matter is more preferable to be utilized by the microorganisms it would therefore reduce the necessity for o hydroxytoluene as a carbon source and consequently decreasing the removal capability of o hydroxytoluene based on the results obtained higher removal of o hydroxytoluene concentration can be attained with influent sodium acetate of 1000 mg l 1 the growth and metabolism demands of microorganisms will be significantly enhanced when adequate amount of carbon source was provided a moderate amount of co substrate will stimulate microbial activity thereby enhancing the removal efficiency of cresylic acid in agf mfc 3 1 3 effect of external loads the effect of external loads on agf mfc performance was evaluated by adopting different external loads rload under constant acetate loading of 1000 mg l 1 and initial o hydroxytoluene concentration of 50 mg l 1 based on the results obtained during phase ii the internal resistance r i of mfc with 1000 mg l 1 of acetate concentration was found to be approximately 230 ω the range of external loads used in this study was selected to include the value of r i 230 ω as well as values higher and lower than that of r i on account of that five external loads were employed which included 100 ω below r i 230 ω r i 500 ω above r i 1000 ω reference rload and 10 000 ω above reference rload each rload was kept constant in the mfc system for approximately 7 days before samples collection for cod analysis can be performed in order to achieve the steady state response the performance of cod removal at each rload was monitored within the period of a constant cell potential generation fig 4 a shows the cod removal profile of mfc system under different external loads the cod removal attained in mfc operated under different rload was statistically significant p 0 05 it was observed that the agf mfc achieved substantial cod removal efficiencies of 94 87 0 29 and 93 56 0 41 under lower rload of 100 ω and 230 ω respectively when the rload was increased to 500 ω and 1000 ω the cod removal efficiencies were noted to have reduced to 89 73 0 60 and 87 06 0 50 respectively meanwhile the lowest cod removal efficiency of 68 98 0 99 was recorded during the application of the highest rload of 10 000 ω the results suggested that the lower external load would lead to a higher cod removal this phenomenon can be attributed to higher anodic electron transfer rates and microbial metabolic activities in substrates utilization as lower external load can ease the transfer of electrons to the cathode it would be expected that a greater amount of electrons will be transferred from anode to cathode via the external circuit when the system was operated under low rload hence a higher electrogenic metabolism would have facilitated the organic matter degradation the ce was observed to be consistent with cod removal in this study following an increase in rload from 100 ω to 10 000 ω ce decreased from 12 85 to 8 57 table 2 this circumstance suggested the capacity of organic matter utilization for releasing electrons by electroactive bacteria was diminished because of the lower relative abundance of electricity producing bacterial communities on the anodic surface of mfc fig 4 b depicts the reduction in o hydroxytoluene concentration along the sampling points in agf mfc statistical analysis indicated that the external loads have significant influences p 0 05 on the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in the current mfc system the removal percentage of o hydroxytoluene was 88 8 0 07 when the system was operated with the lowest rload 100 ω when the external load was increased to 230 ω the removal percentage of o hydroxytoluene increased correspondingly and a complete removal of o hydroxytoluene 100 was achieved however it was observed that the removal percentages of o hydroxytoluene declined when the rload was further increased the removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene decreased to 77 11 1 83 when the external load was increased to 10 000 ω the difference in the effluent concentration of o hydroxytoluene was increasingly apparent particularly when the rload was increased up to 10 000 ω the post hoc test also revealed that the effluent o hydroxytoluene concentration in agf mfc operated with an external load of 230 ω was significantly lower p 0 05 compared to the one operated with 10 000 ω external load it is generally accepted that a lower electron flux in conjunction with a higher anode potential can be achieved with the application of a higher external load 14 conversely lower external load rload r i favours the dominancy of electrogenic microbes in the anodic region 17 in this study the cod removal was favoured by lowering the rload nevertheless the variation of o hydroxytoluene removal presented in this system was noticeably different from the organic matter degradation this phenomenon indicated the complications associated with the removal mechanisms of refractory cresylic compounds in agf mfc the removal of o hydroxytoluene in mfc system was found to have increased initially followed by further declination when the rload were increased from 100 ω to 10 000 ω as shown in fig 4 considering the removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene throughout phase iii the external load of 230 ω was the optimal external resistance for effective removal of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc a relatively higher removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene was attained in this system when the rload was adjusted to 230 ω where the external resistance was approximately equal to the internal resistance 221 ω of agf mfc system rload r i this outcome was compatible with the findings observed by wen et al 14 where the best removal performances of antibiotics i e sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline were achieved with the application of a moderate rload 700 ω which correlates to the internal resistance of cw mfcs meanwhile the reduction in o hydroxytoluene removal efficiencies when rload ri is because fermentation and methanogenic bacteria communities can be dominant over electrogenic bacteria in the anodic biofilm at high applied resistance 17 apparently the abundance of non electroactive bacteria reduced the consumption of metabolites owing to the reduction of metabolic respiration rate and electron transfer reactions at the anodic region under condition with lower applied resistance rload ri competition as terminal electron acceptors may have existed between functional groups presented in recalcitrant organic pollutants and anode 31 this would eventually lead to the lower removal efficiency of cresylic acid in agf mfc 3 1 4 effect of aeration rates oxygen is an effective electron acceptor which is extensively utilized in mfc owing to its comparatively high redox potential easy availability being economically valuable and preferably with environmental sustainability 19 nevertheless an increased aeration demand is highly associated with higher energy consumption the effect of aeration rate on overall mfc performance was investigated during phase iv to determine the optimal aeration rate for wastewater treatment with concurrent bioelectricity generation in agf mfc to minimize energy wastage there are two pathways of oxygen reduction reaction orr at the cathodic region reduction via four electrons o2 4h 4e 2h2o and reduction of o2 to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 via two electrons o2 2h 2e h2o2 7 besides aeration rate variation has a different impact on the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc particularly at cathodic region the auxiliary aeration was initially adjusted to a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 and the dissolved oxygen do concentration was retained at 2 07 0 15 mg l 1 fig 6 e fig 6 a illustrated the cod removal under different cathodic aeration rates the total cod removal efficiency obtained was 87 15 where the anodic and cathodic region accounted for 78 29 and 8 86 respectively when the aeration rate was further increased to 50 ml min 1 and 400 ml min 1 the do concentration increased correspondingly up by 61 67 to 5 4 0 1 mg l 1 and by 68 01 to 6 47 0 15 mg l 1 respectively as compared to the cod removal during aeration rate of 5 ml min 1 higher cod removal efficiencies can be obtained at cathodic region when a higher aeration rates of 50 ml min 1 and 400 ml min 1 were introduced this would thus contribute to the higher total cod removal efficiencies of 88 80 and 94 50 with the anodic region accounted for 78 39 and 81 69 respectively meanwhile lowest cod removal efficiency 80 77 was obtained in the absence of auxiliary aeration at the cathodic region these results indicated that mfc can perform a higher removal efficiency under aeration condition rather than that without aeration statistical analysis proved that aeration rate significantly p 0 05 affects the total removal of cod in agf mfc this could be due to the production of metabolic intermediates from the degradation of o hydroxytoluene which are recalcitrant to anaerobic degradation the cod concentration was found to have declined sharply from influent to s1 followed by gradual degradation at s2 and s3 in the anaerobic region anova with tukey s post hoc test revealed that there were statistically significant differences between 400 ml min 1 and others p 0 05 whereas there were no significant difference for other three pairings on anaerobic cod removal p 0 05 this phenomenon is caused by the diffusion of oxygen into s3 region when an aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 was introduced to the cathodic region of agf mfc it can be further verified by the increased do concentration at s3 fig 6 e besides the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc were noticeably affected by the presence of auxiliary aeration at the cathodic region fig 6 b based on the control system without aeration the total removal of o hydroxytoluene was 87 67 0 20 following an increase in the aeration rate in mfc system the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene increased correspondingly statistical analysis revealed that aeration rate significantly affected the removal percentages of o hydroxytoluene in this system p 0 05 the total removal of o hydroxytoluene in this system were 400 ml min 1 100 0 0014 50 ml min 1 98 7 0 098 5 ml min 1 93 15 0 94 control 87 76 0 20 significant differences p 0 05 were also observed in the effluent o hydroxytoluene among four different aeration rates with corresponding values of 0 0 65 0 048 3 43 0 47 and 6 12 0 11 mg l 1 respectively higher o hydroxytoluene removal efficiency can be achieved with higher cathodic aeration rate due to higher amount of dissolved oxygen available for the aerobic oxidation of the aromatic compounds moreover lowest percentage of o hydroxytoluene removal was attained in mfc system without auxiliary aeration as indicated in eqs 4 6 the available cathodic reaction potentials were considerably higher with auxiliary aeration than without aeration hydrogen gas is possible to be produced in mfc device when oxygen was kept out of the mfc system 32 but the collection and detection of hydrogen in mfc is not practical under open system conditions hence the enhanced redox reaction will lead to a faster electron transport and higher reactive energy for the reaction mechanisms furthermore higher aeration rate could provide more driving force for the contact enhancement between cathode and aerobic microbial circulation this would facilitate the synergistic effect between electrochemical and biological action which further improved the removal of cresylic compounds in agf mfc from fig 6 b it was found that the amount of o hydroxytoluene reduced at s1 and s3 under aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 was significantly higher compared to the amount of o hydroxytoluene reduced under the other aeration rate there were two reasons for such occurrences first higher aeration rate would contribute to a higher amount of oxygen which can be utilized as terminal electron acceptors at the cathodic region since s1 was externally connected to the cathode more terminal electron acceptors at cathodic region would stimulate microbial electron transfer from s1 to cathode which will cause an increase in the effective degradation of o hydroxytoluene at s1 second the high reduction of o hydroxytoluene at s3 suggested the production of anaerobic recalcitrant intermediates from o hydroxytoluene degradation before reaching s3 in agf mfc these anaerobic recalcitrant intermediates would then be degraded easily at s3 because there was oxygen intrusion into s3 from the cathodic region under an aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 meanwhile there was no oxygen diffusion to the anodic region for mfc under the rest of the controlled aeration rates in this study the cod removal is in line with the o hydroxytoluene removal in this study auxiliary aeration at the cathodic region was shown to be efficacious in promoting nutrient organic pollutants and cod removal in mfcs as well as bioelectricity generation 33 previous studies indicated that the microorganisms at the cathodic region could act as biocatalysts to promote direct electron transfer to final electron acceptor owing to direct involvement of cathodic microbes in the redox reactions 34 thus the optimization of aeration rate at the aerobic region is very important in achieving the greatest extent of microbial activities and biodegradation of organic matter

generation characteristics of agf mfc system under different operating conditions considering the concept of waste to energy recovery novel mfc technology was developed to accomplish simultaneous pollutants removal and bioelectricity generation from organic matter present in the wastewater by exploiting microbial metabolism to catalyse the electrochemical reactions bioelectricity generation in agf mfc is sensitive to the environmental changes despite the limited power generation the bioelectricity generation can be used to reflect the operational performance of mfc system and govern the microbial metabolism process therefore it is vitally important to evaluate the bioelectricity performance of agf mfc through the monitoring of output voltage and power generation 3 2 1 effect of co substrate types fig 2 c illustrated the average output voltage of agf mfc fed with four different types of carbon source species the low standard deviation indicated voltage stability condition was achieved in this system the output voltage of agf mfc system supplied with four different carbon sources were ranked in the following order sodium acetate 609 25 3 77 mv glucose 506 94 4 40 mv sucrose 394 41 3 05 mv carbamide 226 78 2 63 mv respectively the post hoc test attested that agf mfc system supplied with sodium acetate displayed significantly higher output voltage compared to the other three carbon source species p 0 05 a similar trend was observed in the power density of the mfc system fig 2 d in comparison with sucrose glucose and carbamide a significantly higher power density was observed in the system with sodium acetate p 0 05 likewise it was noted that the minimization of the internal resistance ri 224 40 ω can also be attained with sodium acetate this phenomenon was ascribed to the capacity strengthening of electroactive bacteria in transforming organic matter into bioelectricity by using sodium acetate as co substrate it can be affirmed with the highest ce 11 86 as shown in table 2 however there was no statistical difference in ce among different sources of carbon p 0 05 previous study conducted by yu et al 8 also indicated that acetate is the optimal co substrate for enhanced removal of 4 chlorophenol and 4 fold enhancement of power generation in mfc this priority could be explained by the relatively lower molecular weight of sodium acetate 82 03 g mol 1 than sucrose 342 3 g mol 1 and glucose 180 16 g mol 1 sucrose and glucose are a disaccharide and monosaccharide respectively which would impose difficulties on the direct metabolism of electroactive bacteria for bioelectricity generation particularly sucrose although carbamide possesses lowest molecular weight among all carbon choices the degradation metabolites of carbamide such as hydrazine may have an inhibitory effect on electroactive microorganisms in mfc 29 consequently the negatively affected electroactive bacteria could therefore hinder the bioelectricity generation overall sodium acetate is considered to be an optimum carbon source and has been widely applied in the treatment of numerous kind of pollutants such as antibiotics 35 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 36 and phenolic compounds 8 3 2 2 effect of carbon source concentrations the average output voltages of agf mfc under different carbon source concentrations were demonstrated in fig 3 c the output voltages remained stable throughout the phases of study which can be indicated by the small standard deviation according to anova there were significant differences in the output voltages among the four different carbon source concentrations p 0 05 the average voltages were 517 2 54 mv 500 mg l 1 609 2 2 99 mv 1000 mg l 1 554 2 2 98 mv 2000 mg l 1 and 325 01 3 02 mv 3000 mg l 1 respectively the amount of influent carbon source sodium acetate supplementation as well as the capability of anaerobic microorganisms in utilizing the co substrate plays a decisive role in the output voltages generation in mfc system generally a higher output voltage would be obtained with a higher concentration of co substrate in the present study the highest average voltage 609 20 mv as obtained with an influent sodium acetate concentration of 1000 mg l 1 besides it was also observed that the average voltages increased accordingly when the influent sodium acetate concentration was increased from 500 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 this is because the increment of sodium acetate concentration had led to a higher ionic conduction along the bioreactor system the high ionic strength might contribute to an increase in co substrate mass transfer to the microorganisms in the system which would expedite the co substrate degradation more effectively the succeeding higher ion exchange rate between anode and cathode by virtue of acetate oxidation under higher influent co substrate concentration will definitely drive more electrons and protons to travel to the anode externally as previously disclosed 37 thus higher output voltage will be generated it can be further verified by the electrical conductivity of the system where the conductivities were 5 63 ms cm 1 500 mg l 1 6 57 ms cm 1 1000 mg l 1 and 6 2 ms cm 1 2000 mg l 1 respectively however the output voltage declined slightly following an increase in sodium acetate concentration up to 2000 mg l 1 a significant decline in output voltage was observed when the sodium acetate concentration was further increased to 3000 mg l 1 it was in accordance with the cod removal obtained where the cod removal efficiencies decreased from 88 75 to 68 35 when the sodium acetate concentration was increased from 1000 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 such phenomenon could be ascribed to the suppression of microbial oxidation mechanism in mfc system the electroactive bacteria in mfc system was adversely affected by the excessive hydrogen ions produced during the oxidation of sodium acetate in the anodic region previous study 38 indicated that the electrochemical oxidation of sodium acetate engendered the acid production ch3coo 2h2o 2co2 7h 8e as presented in the equation 7 mol of hydrogen ions will be produced for each mole of acetate oxidized by anaerobic microbes which can give rise to a drop in ph within the biofilm microenvironment based on the power density curves fig 3 d the power densities showed the same manner as the output voltages of mfc where the power densities were 110 07 2 11 mw m 2 500 mg l 1 159 44 8 57 mw m 2 1000 mg l 1 103 23 2 09 mw m 2 2000 mg l 1 and 31 59 1 51 mw m 2 3000 mg l 1 respectively the internal resistances were in accordance with both the output voltages and power densities table 2 conversely ce was found to have increased as the influent cod concentration increased the utilization of electrons by non electroactive bacteria in the solution for other metabolic processes can potentially contribute to lower ce with higher cod removal 3 2 3 effect of external loads the application of rload is peculiarly important in mfc system especially in terms of bioelectricity generation fig 4 c and d presents the polarization and power density curves for agf mfc under different rload with a constant acetate loading of 1000 mg l 1 and initial o hydroxytoluene concentration of 50 mg l 1 the open circuit voltages voc of system were 754 7 mv 100 ω 755 mv 230 ω 755 1 mv 500 ω 753 4 mv 1000 ω and 754 8 mv 10 000 ω respectively anova revealed that there was no significant difference in their voc p 0 05 which indicated that the electrolyte properties were unaffected throughout the system operation contrariwise the mfcs with different rload exhibited massive differences in their output voltage and power production anova p 0 05 when the rload was increased stepwise from 100 to 10 000 ω the output voltage increased in accordance with ohm s law the mfc system operated with rload of 10 000 ω generated an average output voltage va of 724 67 mv which was remarkably higher than those generated under 100 230 500 and 1000 ω with average voltages of 224 05 382 55 517 56 and 616 23 mv respectively the external loads governed not only the potential difference between the anode and cathode but also the anodic electron transfer rate through an external circuit in mfc system in addition the changes in external resistance would also result in a change in the microbial community and population distribution in the anodic region thereby affecting the power generation and treatment efficiency of pollutants 39 from fig 4 d the highest maximum power density of 173 10 mw m 2 was noticed in the agf mfc system with rload of 230 ω followed by 100 169 69 mw m 2 500 168 12 mw m 2 1000 164 69 mw m 2 and 10 000 ω 160 73 mw m 2 as shown in table 2 the internal resistance obtained at peak power point ri under different rload increased in the following order where 230 ω ri 221 88 ω 100 ω ri 225 97 ω 500 ω ri 228 25 ω 1000 ω ri 231 65 ω 10 000 ω ri 237 83 ω moreover it is evident that the differences existing between the rload and ri have a direct influence on the maximum power density of mfc system the smallest difference of 3 66 between rload and ri was displayed with mfc operated under rload of 230 ω it was followed by 100 ω 57 54 500 ω 119 06 1000 ω 331 69 10 000 ω 4104 68 interestingly the relationships between the total differences between the rload and ri and the associated amount of maximum power density in mfc were directly proportional this can be absolutely affirmed with the order of maximum power density obtained in this study the mfc operated under rload of 230 ω which had the smallest ri and difference with its ri yielded the highest power production according to jacobi s maximum power transfer theorem maximum power will be obtained when external resistance equals the internal resistance of mfc system hence by having the rload 230 ω closer to the ri 221 88 ω highest power production 173 10 mw m2 and current production 483 65 ma m2 was yielded conversely lowest power production of 160 73 mw m2 with corresponding current density of 466 01 ma m2 was yielded under rload of 10 000 ω this phenomenon can be attributed to its high ri which restricted the flow of current through rload of 10 000 ω as high rload resulted in low current however it was observed that mfc with the lowest rload of 100 ω had a lower power production of 169 69 mw m2 with corresponding current density of 478 86 ma m2 compared to those obtained with rload 230 ω this is because a comparably high electron flow rate that exceeded the maximum sustainable charge transfer rate was attained when rload was low consequently the electrical potential of mfc would deteriorate rapidly and impose a limit on the current that may be delivered to the load therefore the electric current declined and led to a lower power production apart from that internal loss is also the possible contributing factor for limited electron transport taking place in low rload it can be verified through the slightly higher ri obtained with rload of 100 ω table 2 these findings ratified jacobi s law of maximum power transfer overall the findings implied that the cell design point rload ri should be regulated so that the mfc operation can be maintained in generating maximum power density the dynamic behaviour of agf mfc under rload variation was evaluated to compare the intensity obtained when the rload was step wise increased and decreased on this section the polarization test was performed by varying the resistors from 10 m ω to 1 ω using resistor box the reason of plotting more sample points in the dynamic polarization curves is to ensure the differences between forward and backward polarization can be easily identified all the polarization curves were measured after the mfc system has reached the steady state performance in this study rload of 230 1000 and 10 000 ω were chosen to perform dynamic polarization tests because there were statistically significant differences in power production between these three groups anova p 0 05 the polarization curves were plotted by varying rload in an increasing manner forward polarization followed by inverting it in a decreasing manner reverse polarization as shown in fig 5 there were three negative hysteresis loops remarked obviously it can be observed that the power production in the forward polarizations was higher than the reverse polarization this phenomenon could be ascribed to the establishment of different anodic microbial community under different rload this change in the microbial population could be the plausible factor causing a reduction in the power production after operated under high rload previous study 40 also indicated that mfc operated under different rload served as a selection force for different electroactive microorganisms which would thus induce differences in the anodic potentials subsequently these changes in the microbial distribution could affect the electrochemical activity of the anodic electroactive bacteria by altering the activation losses and internal resistance of the anode 40 however it was proven by tukey kramer post hoc test that significant difference only existed between the polarization curves of 10 000 ω forward scan and 10 000 ω reverse scan p 0 05 while there was no significant difference for another two forward reverse pairings p 0 05 lyon et al 41 revealed that the resulting microbial community did not resemble the communities established at the same rload when the rload was step wise increased and decreased thus the flexibility of the mfc system was demonstrated as different microbial community developed under different rload but resulted in similar power production in addition it is commonly known that mfc performance can be enhanced by minimizing the ohmic voltage losses activation overpotentials concentration overpotentials and coulombic losses three distinct regimes associated with the internal losses can be observed by referring to the dynamic polarization curves fig 5 based on fig 5 there was almost no voltage loss in the regime of activation losses this phenomenon suggested that varying the load in the circuit have no effect on the activation energy needed for an oxidation reduction reaction in mfc because the nature of the electrode remains unaltered contrariwise the dynamic polarization curves of agf mfc under rload of 10 000 ω exhibited the largest voltage deviation in the regime of ohmic losses this phenomenon disclosed that ohmic overpotential due to a combination of resistances from electrons transfer in the electric circuit and movement of ions through the electrolyte in the cell was the main factor that impacts the internal losses apart from that it was observed that there was only slight voltage deviation in the regime of concentration loss this circumstance implied that the decrease in reactant concentration at the surface of the electrodes as fuel is used does not significantly affect the internal resistance of this system similarly the dynamic polarization curves fig 5 also demonstrated that there were some losses in power production at the regime of ohmic losses the internal resistance of the mfcs at different rload was then determined from the slope of the ohmic linear range of the registered voltage current curves the mfc operated with step wise decreasing rload of 10 000 1000 and 230 ω had ohmic resistance rohmic of 254 47 2 12 235 57 5 07 and 225 72 3 58 ω respectively meanwhile the ohmic resistance obtained with step wise increasing rload of 230 1000 and 10 000 ω are 221 88 0 74 ω 231 65 3 70 ω and 237 83 7 65 ω respectively largest ohmic losses difference was displayed with rload of 10 000 ω followed by 1000 and 230 ω the ohmic losses could be partly minimized by reducing the rload from reference rload 1000 ω to maximum power point 230 ω likewise optimization of mfc operating conditions appropriate design of the interconnection between components in the system and the use of electrode and current collectors with high electrical conductivity can also reduce mass transfer limitations and performance losses 3 2 4 effect of aeration rates fig 6 c and d displayed the average output voltage and power density curves of agf mfc under different cathodic aeration rates based on statistical analysis the effect of different aeration rates on the bioelectricity generation performances of agf mfc system was significant p 0 05 initially the output voltage and power density at 5 ml min 1 aeration rate were 333 65 mv and 32 53 mw m 2 respectively when the aeration rate was increased by 10 fold to 50 ml min 1 it was noticed that both the output voltage and power density were significantly improved to 607 96 mv and 158 17 mw m 2 respectively correspondingly the ce increased slightly in accordance with the increase in aeration rate from 5 ml min 1 to 50 ml min 1 at the cathodic region table 2 furthermore there was no diffusion of oxygen to the anodic region occurred during these two phases of study the enhanced bioelectricity generation performances can be attributed to the elevated do concentration at the cathodic region thereby facilitating the ability of electrons to transfer externally from anode to cathode by increasing number of terminal electron acceptors o2 nevertheless further increase in the aeration rate up to 400 ml min 1 did not improve the output voltage and power density of the system in fact it has caused a reduction in the bioelectricity generation performances the output voltage and power density were declined to 572 39 mv and 116 99 mw m 2 respectively in the meantime the diffusion of air into s3 anodic region occurred this can be further verified by the do concentration at s3 1 77 ml min 1 as shown in the do profile fig 6 e these outcomes indicated that excessive aeration is not favourable for bioelectricity generation in a bio cathode single chamber membrane less mfc system there were two plausible factors that contribute to the reduction in power generation in this respect first excessive biofilm growth would cause the thickening of the biofilm on the cathode which will eventually lead to a limited active surface area for oxygen reduction reaction second higher aeration rates would generate more bubbles and bubble coalescence will certainly affect the mass transfer of mfc system thus resulting in a deterioration in the bioelectricity generation performance to further investigate the interaction between aeration and the performances of mfc system aeration at the cathodic region was removed during phase iv d from fig 6 it was observed that the organic matter consumption o hydroxytoluene degradation output voltages power generation and internal resistance were unfavourably affected without the presence of an adequate supply of oxygen this was well reflected in the prominent decline in cod removal percentage particularly at the cathodic region apart from that it was also observed that there was just a slight degradation of o hydroxytoluene at the non aerated cathodic region besides output voltage and power density decreased considerably to 253 46 mv and 17 28 mw m 2 respectively owing to the decline in the dissolved oxygen at the cathodic region these results suggested that the highest maximum power density was obtained at aeration rate of 50 ml min 1 the results showed that either lower or higher aeration rates had a negative impact on the power density post hoc tests revealed that there were significant differences between all the pairings of aeration rates p 0 05 the variation in the aeration rates is closely related to their internal resistance table 2 fig 6 d presented the polarization and power density curves of mfc system under different aeration rates it can be observed that the voltages declined linearly with current density this implied that the total internal loss of this mfc system is dominated by internal ohmic losses through the system which had eventually led to the lower voltage and power density generated in comparison to higher aeration rates 50 and 400 ml min 1 prominent open circuit loss due to reduction of electrical potential difference between two terminals of mfc system was observed in system with lower aeration rate of 5 ml min 1 and without aeration moreover a positive linear relationship between the output voltage and cathodic do concentration was presented in fig 6 f it was observed that the output voltage increased remarkably when the aeration rate was increased to 50 ml min 1 while the output voltage declined slightly when the aeration rate was further increased by 8 times to 400 ml min 1 contrariwise when the aeration rates of 0 5 50 and 400 ml min 1 were supplemented the concentration of dissolved oxygen increased remarkably from 0 88 mg l 1 to 2 07 5 4 and 6 47 mg l 1 respectively overall an aeration rate of 50 ml min 1 was considered as the optimal aeration rate for effective o hydroxytoluene degradation and bioelectricity generation in agf mfc therefore a sufficient do concentration should be supplemented at the cathodic region in order to optimize the overall system performance 3 3 degradation pathway fig 7 presents the proposed degradation pathway of ortho hydroxytoluene in agf mfc system the catabolic pathway of o hydroxytoluene was proposed based on the results obtained through gc ms analysis fig a1 possible but undetected intermediates were indicated in brackets initially the o hydroxytoluene was catabolized anaerobically via two main metabolic pathways one involves the side chain oxidation at the methyl group of o hydroxytoluene while the other utilizes the benzoyl coa reductase bcr to catalyse dehydroxylation of the hydroxyl substitute of o hydroxytoluene 42 side chain oxidation of o hydroxytoluene yields 1 hydroxybenzyl alcohol which further coverts to 1 hydroxybenzyl aldehyde and finally to 1 hydroxybenzoic acid the latter intermediates would then undergo ring oxidation to form 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid subsequently decarboxylation of 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid resulted in the formation of catechol catechol was presumed to be oxidized to its highly reactive quinone form through autoxidation with the assistance of enzymes such as tyrosinase horseradish peroxidase 43 ring cleavage of benzoquinone occurred with the aid of intradiol dioxygenases in the aerobic region leading to the formation of cis cis muconic acid ccma 44 lastly ccma was further degraded into succinic acid and ethanoic acid which was then transformed into carbon dioxide and water on the other hand hydroxylation of benzyl alcohol led to the substitution of hydroxyl group adjacent to the hydroxymethyl group namely 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol further oxidation of 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol yields 4 hydroxybenzyl aldehyde 4 hydroxybenzyl aldehyde was presumed to undergo hydroxylation reaction to form 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid it was then followed by decarboxylation or dihydroxylation eventuating in the formation of resorcinol phenol and hydroxyquinone aromatic ring cleavage and oxidation of these intermediates occurred forming maleic acid malic acid tartronic acid and fumaric acid these intermediates could be further degraded to simple organic acids such as oxalic acid and acetic acid which were generally transformed into water and carbon dioxide 4 conclusion the complete removal of refractory phenolic compounds has required a great effort to reduce water pollution this study succinctly demonstrated a high performance mfc system in complete removal of o hydroxytoluene with energy recovery the effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads rload and cathode conditions on the removal rate of ortho hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation in agf mfc were comprehensively evaluated sodium acetate was the most efficient co substrate which yielded the highest o hydroxytoluene removal via co metabolism and power generation optimal carbon source concentration 1000 mg l 1 significantly affected the microbial degradation of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation moreover the rload showed significant differences in both wastewater treatment and power generation p 0 05 the results ratified jacobi s law where maximum power generation was obtained when rload was close to internal resistance rload ri contrariwise lower performances were obtained when mfc was operated at higher rload ri or lower rload rload ri thus the rload should be adjusted as close as possible to its internal resistance to reduce the ohmic losses an optimum aeration rate was beneficial for the removal of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation because sufficient terminal electron acceptors would facilitate the anodic electrons transfer in sum the influencing parameters on the removal of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation in mfc should be optimized and regulated in real application for realizing more efficient removal of phenolic laden wastewater and energy recovery credit authorship contribution statement sing mei tan

12825,this study investigated the effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads rload and cathode conditions on the overall removal rate of ortho hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation characteristics in anti gravity flow microbial fuel cell agf mfc through co metabolism approach sodium acetate outperformed sucrose glucose and carbamide and the optimum influent acetate concentration 1000 mg l 1 significantly enhanced the o hydroxytoluene degradation by 13 41 98 71 output voltage by 15 14 609 25 mv and power generation by 30 96 159 44 mw m 2 the results demonstrated that there were prominent differences in mfc performances under different rload p 0 05 different external load conditions resulted in varying electron transfer reactions and thus affecting the removal efficiency and power responses of mfc system a complete removal of o hydroxytoluene and highest power density of 173 10 mw m 2 with a chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 93 56 were obtained with the rload of 230 ω where the rload approaches the cell design point hysteresis phenomenon was detected in the dynamic polarization during rload variations moreover it was observed that the removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene was significantly enhanced with aeration rate of 50 ml min 1 and dissolved oxygen concentration of 5 4 mg l 1 conversely higher aeration rate 400 ml min 1 had caused a decline of 26 in power generation ascribed to the limited active surface area for oxygen reduction reaction additionally the degradation pathway of o hydroxytoluene was proposed based on the identified intermediates graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell o hydroxytoluene co metabolism wastewater treatment bioelectricity generation dynamic polarization 1 introduction phenolic compounds pcs are ubiquitously distributed phytochemicals commonly present in various industrial wastewaters such as petroleum refineries coal tar resin manufacturing explosives plastics and pharmaceutical industries these organic compounds are toxic at low dose and highly resistant to conventional treatment methods due to their persistence toxicity and unpleasant organoleptic properties the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the agency for the registry of toxic substances and diseases atsdr have defined phenolic compounds as pollutants of priority concern 1 among phenols ortho hydroxytoluene also called ortho cresol has been extensively used as an intermediate for the production of phytosanitary products pharmaceuticals and epoxy resins but also as an important component of disinfectants and cleaning agents they are often present in the effluents from the chemical and petrochemical industries and their concentration in wastewater can vary from a few milligrams per litre to as high as 7 g l 1 2 moreover there have been umpteen reports on the intake of contaminated water containing o hydroxytoluene which has profoundly affected human health and caused suppression of locomotor activity respiration failure metabolic acidosis and ventricular fibrillation 3 ahead of the pollutant persistence and the technology aroused in wastewater treatment physico chemical methods were implemented to treat cresylic compounds extensively however these methods have severe drawbacks for instances incomplete removal of pollutants production of secondary pollutants and economically unviable 4 on the other hand biological treatments are capable in overcoming these drawbacks with the regard the effort to develop an integrated anaerobic aerobic reactor with bio materials in treating hydroxytoluene is never end as the effective treatment technique is much needed to mitigate environmental pollution in addition to that the degradation of hydroxytoluene and its derivates has aroused intense interest of researchers all over the world microbial fuel cell mfc is an environmentally sustainable technology that not only allows the treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants but also the conversion of chemical energy from the biodegradable wastes into electrical energy in the past decades numerous designs of mfcs have been reported but major designs composed only of double chambers mfc single chamber mfc and stacked mfc 5 among these single chamber mfcs were shown to represent a simpler design with reduced cost of operation and has added a value in producing higher volumetric power density due to smaller cell volume 6 previous research studies have indicated the efficient removal of majority of the biorefractory pollutants following the presence of robust microbial consortia in the anodic chamber of mfc which is capable of degrading the emerging contaminants ecs 7 the substrate plays an important role in the mfc system because the electroactive bacteria eab in the anodic region of mfc tend to utilize the biodegradable organics and transfer electrons to the anode howbeit the toxic recalcitrant pollutants can potentially damage the biofilm and hinder microbial metabolic activities owing to their biological toxicity according to yu et al 8 only 62 of 2 4 dichlorophenol was degraded and a weak current production of 123 ma m 2 was attained in mfc another study demonstrated that the maximum power density was only 1 7 w m 3 when 500 mg l 1 of pyridine was used as sole carbon source 9 moreover the study of hedbavna et al 10 also indicated that the removal of sole phenol containing wastewater was merely 52 6 with corresponding low power density of 1 8 mw m 2 in a double chamber mfc obviously the employment of refractory pollutant as the sole source of carbon is absolutely insufficient to optimize the decomposition of the complex molecules into harmless products while generating electric power therefore suitable co substrate should be well utilized to perform ideal pollutant removal with simultaneous power generation co metabolism strategies are well addressed in the state of art of wastewater treatment technologies for degradation of recalcitrant pollutants interestingly co metabolism is the transformation of a non growth substance in the obligate presence of a growth substrate 11 the reinforcement of growth substrates could be associated to the oxidizing enzyme induction and bacteria proliferation supported by biodegradable carbon sources 12 in general microbial mono or dioxygenase enzymes initiate the co metabolic reactions of aromatic contaminants by transforming the aromatic contaminants to dihydroxy aromatic intermediates 13 meanwhile glucose xylose acetate starch and sucrose are most known oxidizable carbon sources needed by microorganisms to maintain their bioenergetic status and engage in metabolic pathways for enhanced removal of pollutants and bioelectricity generation 14 application of co metabolism has its own breakthrough as one of the promising methods for rapid biodegradation of refractory pollutants such as aromatic and halogenated compounds for instance the use of acetate as co substrate activated β lactamase amidases transaminase and amide c n hydrolase activities contributing to the enhancement of amoxicillin removal by the anode functional bacteria strain lelliottia aquatilis 15 buitrón et al 16 also disclosed that the employment of acetate as co substrate significantly improved the electricity generation and phenol degradation by geobacter shewanella and pseudomonas in mfc undeniably the availability of co substrate in mfc provide an excellent platform in minimizing the poisoning of refractories on the anode respiring bacteria which is a necessity for mfc to recover energy from highly toxic wastewater moreover different co substrates could stimulate a specific microbial metabolism mechanism which would in turn affect the organic metabolism and electrons transfer process therefore the participation of appropriate carbon source in co metabolism in mfc plays huge significance in determining the degradation of phenolic compounds and bioelectricity generation meanwhile external load governs not only the electron transfer flux via the circuit but also the metabolism rate and electron transfer activity of anodic microorganisms 17 it was thus hypothesized that the treatment of o hydroxytoluene in mfc might also be influenced by external loads owing to the sensitivity of microbes towards the changes in anodic conditions most importantly the understandings of dynamic behaviour in fuel cell system should not be neglected because it has been a crucial criterion for system control and optimization additionally potential variation of cathode following the changes in the cathodic electron acceptors can significantly affect the performances of mfc auxiliary aeration was proved to have significantly enhanced the removal efficiency of organics and nutrients along with electricity generation when the numbers of electron acceptors were optimized in mfc system 18 to date the comprehensive effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads and aeration rates on o hydroxytoluene removal and power generation remained obscure and demand further exploration in the present study o hydroxytoluene was selected as a target refractory pollutant due to its semi recalcitrant characteristic pollution history and also its intense harmful effect on the receiving waterbodies to our knowledge this is the first attempt to treat o hydroxytoluene with energy recovery in a single chamber anti gravity flow mfc by adopting co metabolism strategy to fill the knowledge gaps the effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads and aeration rates on o hydroxytoluene removal and power generation were thoroughly evaluated nevertheless the dynamic response of agf mfc during load variation was discussed comparisons between operating factors were also conducted through tukey kramer statistical analysis to further investigate the significant difference on the performance of operational parameters in the mfc system furthermore detailed degradation pathway of o hydroxytoluene was proposed based on the results obtained from uv vis s spectrophotometry and gas chromatography mass spectrum gc ms analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction of agf mfc a single chamber anti gravity flow microbial fuel cell agf mfc was fabricated using poly acrylic plastic column with diameter of 6 cm and height of 30 cm as shown in fig 1 the agf mfc was operated under ambient temperature at 28 4 c in an indoor laboratory the volumes of anodic and cathodic compartment of agf mfc are 282 74 cm2 and 565 49 cm2 respectively the anodic compartment of the reactor was filled with uniform polypropylene carriers whereby each has the nominal diameter and length of 8 mm and 10 mm respectively there were three sampling points s1 s2 and s3 positioned at respective distances of 6 cm 12 cm and 18 cm from the bottom of the reactor two layers of sponges were inserted between the dual compartments to hinder the media carriers from floating as the carriers are less dense than the solution in the reactor carbon felts sg 222 maido cooperation japan with dimension of 3 2 5 2 cm length width height served as anodes the stainless steel mesh holder supporting activated carbon flakes cf sm was used as the bio cathode as previously described in tan et al 19 the cylindrical cf sm bio cathode has a dimension of 7 cm height and 5 5 cm diameter cf sm was fabricated by integrating reticulated porous stainless steel mesh sus 304 250 mesh with 85 3 g of activated carbon flakes the cylindrical stainless steel mesh holder fit in the modified beaker perfectly and the modified beaker served as a supporting structure to keep both the mesh holder and the carbon flakes in packed form the filler media and electrodes were inoculated with mixed cultured activated sludge wherein it was randomly collected from a rubber glove manufacturing factory located in perlis malaysia during the inoculation period synthetic wastewater was supplemented to the aerobic and anaerobic inoculation tank to support the growth of microbial community the electrical circuit of the system was completed by connecting the electrodes across a variable of external resistor with copper wires attached to the carbon rods each with 7 82 cm2 of contact area after incorporation of the electrode assembly it has a total net volume of 380 ml the entire column of agf mfc was covered with aluminium foil to block exterior light and prevent algae growth on inside of the system the cathodic compartment was supplied with aeration by using an air diffuser the air flow rate was controlled by using an air flow meter with a control valve lzb 3 china or unless otherwise stated 2 2 experimental design and operations four phases of studies were successively performed in an agf mfc reactor to examine the influence of type and concentrations of external carbon sources external resistances forward and reverse scan and aeration rates on the removal performance of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation in agf mfc each experimental study was carried out at least three times and an average of all the replicated experimental data was reported the reliability of the mean was indicated by the standard error presented in this study basic nutrient medium along with organic carbon source were served as the anodic growth medium for agf mfc the nutrient medium consisting of 0 31 g l 1 ammonium chloride 0 13 g l 1 potassium chloride 3 4 g l 1 dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 0 1 g l 1 magnesium chloride hexahydrate 4 4 g l 1 potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 0 116 g l 1 sodium chloride was fed into the agf mfc system prior to initiation of the start up for the experimental operations using a peristaltic pump bt100 100 m longer precision pump as reported in our previous study 20 sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide with invariable concentration of 1000 mg cod l 1 were used as the organic source of carbon in this system respectively this operation lasted for 45 days to acclimate microbial growth and achieve voltage stability the mfc was operated in continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 day due to the extensive usage of highly volatile phenolic compounds in petroleum industries and its hazardous characteristics even at low concentration 21 o hydroxytoluene with the concentration of 50 mg l 1 was introduced into the synthetic wastewater to simulate the petroleum refinery wastewater four different carbon source species e g sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide were supplemented to the system separately to study the effect of different carbon sources on the wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation performances of agf mfc phase i each co substrate in the anodic chamber with circuit disconnection was operated in open circuit as control experiment while other phases of research were all operated under closed circuit condition subsequently the initial concentration of carbon source species which exhibited the most favourable performances of the system would be varied in phase ii the purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the co substrate loading which is conducive to the optimal o hydroxytoluene removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation outcome besides the impact of different external loads 100 230 500 1000 and 10 000 ω on the performances of agf mfc was studied in phase iii to investigate the dynamic behaviour of mfc system the external loads variations in step wise forward and reverse manner were performed in the last phase phases iv of study different aeration rates 0 5 50 and 400 ml min 1 were adjusted to investigate the wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation performances of mfc under varying do concentration the detailed operational conditions were summarized in table 1 chemicals used for the preparation of synthetic wastewater were purchased from sigma aldrich and pure o hydroxytoluene 99 was purchased from acros organics all the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 3 analytical procedure 2 3 1 water sampling and analysis wastewater samples were collected from influent and all sampling points two to three times per week throughout the study to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance of agf mfc system the characteristics of wastewater were routinely measured by using do meter hanna hi 9146 orp meter hanna hi 8424 conductivity bante 510 china and ph meter bante 210 china respectively water samples were centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 10 min by a benchtop centrifuge cence l500 prior proceeding to the cod analysis the cod was determined by colorimetric method and measured using a spectrophotometer hach dr2800 usa the concentrations of o hydroxytoluene in the water samples were inspected using uv vis spectrophotometry uv professional china the uv vis spectrometer was turned on and the lamps were allowed to warm up for an appropriate period of time around 20 min to stabilize them subsequently an absorbance spectrum was determined using the standard solutions the absorption maximum wavelength λmax is 271 nm one of the cuvettes was selected for the blank solution the cuvettes were rinsed several times before taking a measurement a calibration line was first created to determine concentrations of standard solutions by uv vis spectrophotometry the blank distilled water and sample solutions were placed in the cuvette separately to be inserted into the spectrophotometer the concentrations of o hydroxytoluene were inspected by measuring the intensity of light passing through the sample solutions in a cuvette and compare it to the intensity of the light before it passes through the sample 22 degradation products of o hydroxytoluene were identified by using gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 2010 plus shimadzu japan equipped with a bpx 5 capillary column 30 m length 0 25 mm inner diameter 0 25 μm thickness interpretation on mass spectrum gc ms was conducted using the library database of national institute standard and technology nist the o hydroxytoluene removal efficiency was calculated as per the following equation 1 oht r oht in oht out oht in 100 where ohtin is the influent concentration of o hydroxytoluene and ohtout is the effluent concentration of o hydroxytoluene mg l 1 2 3 2 bioelectricity generation characteristics the voltages in agf mfc were recorded every 2 s by a digital data acquisition module graphtec midi logger gl820 the polarization tests were performed by varying the resistor from 20 k ω to 50 ω by using an adjustable resistor box before a variable of external resistance is used to obtain a polarization curve the fixed external resistor were disconnected from the circuit to determine the open circuit potential voc of the mfc subsequently the corresponding output voltage at various external load values was obtained only when pseudo steady state conditions have been established polarization and power density curves were then plotted for diagnostic purposes in determining the internal resistance and power density pd of the system power density was calculated based on the geometrical surface area of the anode 2 p d p a a where pd is the power density w m 2 p is the power w and aa is the surface area of the anode coulombic efficiency ce was also ascertained by the charge efficiency by which electrons were transferred

l s 1 n is the 4 electrons exchanged per mole of oxygen and δcod is the change in chemical oxygen demand cod between influent and sampling points 2 4 kinetics and statistical analysis pseudo kinetic model was used to analyse the degradation of o hydroxytoluene subjected to the effect of co substrate types and concentration external loads forward and reverse scan and aeration rates statistical analysis was conducted through one way analysis of variance anova at significant level of 0 05 to determine the significance of agf mfc performance between the operating conditions the tukey kramer post hoc method was then implemented to identify the significant difference of agf mfc performance among the operating conditions p value 0 05 indicated that there is a prominent difference between the groups while p value 0 05 indicated that there is no prominent difference between the groups goodness of fit of the kinetic model was examined using coefficient of determination for linear regression r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment performance of agf mfc system under different operating conditions 3 1 1 effect of co substrate types organic co substrate is one of the most decisive factors in determining the overall performance of mfcs due to its availability for anaerobic microorganisms particularly on co metabolic biodegradation of refractory pollutants it can serve as both a carbon source for microorganisms and an electron donor to produce the energy carrier molecule simultaneously the selection of an appropriate co substrate is crucial to ensure stable operation and the effectiveness of the pollutant treatment in mfc system four different types of co substrates acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide at concentration of 1000 mg cod l 1 were individually employed in this study to investigate the effect of co substrate types on the agf mfc system performances the agf mfc was initially operated under open circuit condition to evaluate their performance when there is no load in a circuit the open circuit voltages voc were nearly constant during the start up process and the stable voc of the mfc system were recorded the maximum voc of 754 mv 740 mv 731 mv and 720 mv across anode and cathode were attained for the agf mfc supplemented with co substrate of sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide respectively during the initiation phase of operation moreover the consumption of organic load in mfc operated under open circuit condition was also examined in open circuit the cod removal efficiencies of the mfc supplemented with sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide were 81 02 0 11 65 10 0 17 73 98 0 11 and 47 75 0 22 respectively fig 2 a displays the cod removal profile of agf mfc supported by different types of co substrates respectively low standard deviation had indicated the consistent removal of cod and stable operation of the system throughout this phase of study as shown in fig 2 a it was noticed that different types of co substrates contributed to different extent of cod removal the total cod removal efficiencies for afc mfc fed with sodium acetate phase ia sucrose phase ib glucose phase ic and carbamide phase id were 89 46 1 02 71 14 0 34 81 83 0 37 and 56 34 0 30 respectively the results have also shown that a large fraction of the cod was reduced in the anaerobic region a sharp increase in cod removal can be observed at s1 owing to the high cell density retainment and microbial viability at the bottom of the reactor fig a3 it was followed by uniform increment from s1 to s2 and s3 anaerobic oxidation of organic substrates in the wastewater was performed by the facultative anaerobes to stimulate biofilm formation 18 based on anova the difference between the four phases for the total cod removal efficiency was statistically significant p 0 05 the tukey post hoc test was further carried out by forming six groups of pairing among the co substrate choices acetate sucrose acetate glucose acetate carbamide sucrose glucose sucrose carbamide glucose carbamide to determine the significant differences between specific operating parameters tukey kramer post hoc test revealed that there was a significant difference for the six pairings p 0 05 this indicated the profound effect of co substrate on organic matter degradation and the mfc supplied with acetate significantly outperformed the other carbon sources in the removal capacity of organic matter in agf mfc system the effect of different co substrates types on the degradation of 50 mg l 1 o hydroxytoluene was investigated by supplementing different co substrates separately in the influent wastewater to evaluate the removal performance along the mfc system the total removal percentages of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc supplied with sodium acetate sucrose glucose and carbamide were 98 79 0 042 78 35 0 017 91 02 0 056 and 58 16 1 26 respectively the effluent o hydroxytoluene concentrations in agf mfc for all the four phases were as follows sodium acetate 0 606 0 021 mg l 1 glucose 4 496 0 030 mg l 1 sucrose 10 826 0 010 mg l 1 carbamide 20 952 0 609 mg l 1 from the results it can be observed that sodium acetate is the favourite carbon source of the mixed microbial culture it was also proven by anova that the effluent o hydroxytoluene concentration from the system supplied with sodium acetate was significantly lower p 0 05 than those supplied with glucose sucrose and carbamide in addition kinetic study was conducted on the degradation of o hydroxytoluene to compare the degradation rate of o hydroxytoluene in mfc system supplied with different types of co substrates table s1 presented the reaction rate constant k and regression coefficient r2 compatible with the o hydroxytoluene degradation the degradation of o hydroxytoluene was best fitted to the pseudo first order kinetic model with a high regression coefficient value where r2 0 9 for all phases these results are consistent with the finding of the previous study 12 which reported the degradation of phenol and co substrate acetate in an air cathode mfc followed the first order kinetic in this study the degradation kinetics of o hydroxytoluene were ranked in descending order where sodium acetate 0 1703 h 1 glucose 0 09 h 1 sucrose 0 0574 h 1 carbamide 0 0326 h 1 the highest consumption rate of sodium acetate further verified that sodium acetate is the most efficient co substrate in comparison to glucose sucrose and carbamide the presence of sodium acetate as a co metabolic substrate exhibited the highest o hydroxytoluene degradation kinetic constant k1 which was 1 89 times higher than glucose 2 97 times higher than sucrose and 5 22 times higher than carbamide overall sodium acetate was found to be the best co metabolic carbon source for the degradation of 50 mg l 1 o hydroxytoluene in this mfc system from fig 2 b it was clearly found that the concentration of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc declined sharply at s1 and then gradually declined in the subsequent sampling points s2 and s3 under anaerobic conditions further reduction in the concentration of o hydroxytoluene was also observed in the aerobic region of the bioreactor for all four types of organic co substrates degradation of o hydroxytoluene with exogenous substrate via co metabolism in the anaerobic region of agf mfc was predominately accounted for the removal of o hydroxytoluene the biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microorganisms in mfc systems is an endogenous metabolism process which occur within the living cell in the absence of compounds that could serve specifically as exogenous substrates 23 the attachment and growth of microbes on the bio media filters anodic packing materials promoted the biodegradation process in the system on the other hand activated carbon flakes acf in the cathodic set up had also contributed to the adsorption biodegradation and bio regeneration in agf mfc therefore it can be expected that adsorption biodegradation and bio regeneration were the biological processes contributing to the total removal of o hydroxytoluene in this system bio regeneration is the renewal of the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon by microorganisms for further adsorption and it contributes to the removal of o hydroxytoluene through the biological degradation of pollutants into non toxic substances 24 furthermore the externally connected circuit at the bottom electrode of the reactor ensured microbial enrichment at s1 19 meanwhile the accumulation of o hydroxytoluene was the highest at s1 as the influent wastewater would be the first in reaching s1 the synergistic effect of the biological pollutant removal processes and high microbial viability at s1 had promoted a significant reduction in the o hydroxytoluene concentration at s1 the performance of o hydroxytoluene degradation was corresponded to the cod removal in this study moreover the supplementation of sodium acetate as carbon source was the best in terms of cod removal and o hydroxytoluene degradation in agf mfc followed by glucose sucrose and carbamide sodium acetate glucose and sucrose are ordinary and inexpensive commodity chemicals which can be produced either biologically or chemically sodium acetate a hygroscopic sodium salt is the intermediate product of the tricarboxylic acid cycle which can be directly utilized by microorganisms as carbon source glucose and sucrose are two types of sugars glucose also called dextrose is the most abundant monosaccharide and also a subcategory of carbohydrates meanwhile sucrose is disaccharide or a molecule made of two monosaccharides in comparison to glucose and sucrose the small and simple short chain fatty acids of sodium acetate are more conducive to the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms 25 the highest cod removal efficiency fig 2 and ce table 2 obtained with acetate have further verified that acetate is more conducive to microbial catabolism as compared to glucose as well as sucrose in agf mfc system obviously the presence of sodium acetate favourably contributed to cod removal efficiency and concomitantly expediting the degradation of o hydroxytoluene this is because acetate can be converted into acetyl coa directly by microorganism for energy production with high atomic economy 26 in contrast the conversion of glucose and sucrose is much more complex because these molecules contain more carbon atoms 27 a molecule of sodium acetate contains two carbon atoms glucose has six carbon atoms hexose bonded together as a chain with additional atoms of oxygen and hydrogen whereas a sucrose molecule composes of twelve atoms of carbon in addition organic matter was initially transformed into small molecular organics which was then utilized by electroactive bacteria and other bacteria on the anode of mfcs 28 the organic carbon sources with different molecular weight and complexity of molecular structure possess different metabolic processes which would have indirect impact on the co metabolic degradation of phenolic compounds in mfc system compared with sodium acetate catabolism of glucose through glycolysis pathway presents low atomic economy ascribed to the release of carbon dioxide in pyruvate decarboxylation 26 this would eventually result a reduction in mfc performance both sucrose and glucose are typical fermentative carbon whereas acetate is non fermentative carbon source therefore the nature of carbon sources availability may also influence the microbial community distribution in mfc system 12 interestingly the use of carbamide as a carbon source has not been directly examined in previous study however the presence of carbamide showed partial degradation of o hydroxytoluene suggesting that carbamide did serve as carbon source in this study possible toxicity of breakdown intermediates of carbamide to the anaerobic microbes could be the reason that causes it could not be sufficiently assimilated by microbes 29 3 1 2 effect of carbon source concentrations based on the results obtained in phase i sodium acetate was selected as the best source of carbon for cod and pollutant removal herein the concentrations of acetate were varied 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 to evaluate the mfc performances fig 3 a shows the cod removal under different acetate concentrations similar to phase i the cod removal continuously improved as the wastewater moving up the reactor from influent to effluent the total cod removal efficiencies were 98 6 0 33 88 75 0 92 75 34 0 22 and 68 35 0 85 for acetate concentration of 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 respectively based on anova the influent co substrate loading was found to have significantly affected the cod removal efficiencies of agf mfc system p 0 05 highest cod removal was obtained with 500 mg l 1 sodium acetate whereby 95 98 of cod removal was contributed by the anodic region this suggested that co substrate limitation might have occurred and an influent co substrate concentration lower than 500 mg l 1 should be refrained to avoid restriction on microbial growth by carbon source scarcity the cod removal efficiencies were noted to have significantly declined when the influent co substrate loadings were further increased up to 3000 mg l 1 this phenomenon could be ascribed to excessive co substrate supply which had exceeded the working capability of the microbes by considering the overall cod removal performance co substrate loading with 1000 mg l 1 was the most suitable concentration of influent co substrate yet with efficient cod removal to be achieved in agf mfc this is because influent co substrate lower than 1000 mg l 1 became a limiting factor for microbial growth while influent co substrate higher than 1000 mg l 1 contributed to lower cod removal the results were in line with the findings of tan et al 30 where the excessively high co substrate loading would hinder the cod removal of mfc system besides the removal performance of o hydroxytoluene under different acetate concentrations was investigated during phase ii while other operating conditions were kept constant as shown in fig 3 b the concentration of o hydroxytoluene declined sharply at s1 followed by a continual decline in the following sampling points for all co substrate loadings the influent organic loading was found to have significant impact p 0 05 on the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc system according to anova the total removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in this system were ranked in the order as follows 1000 mg l 1 sodium acetate 98 71 0 02 500 mg l 1 sodium acetate 85 47 0 67 2000 mg l 1 sodium acetate 75 79 0 91 3000 mg l 1 sodium acetate 51 67 0 97 correspondingly the average effluent concentrations obtained were 0 65 0 08 mg l 1 7 28 0 34 mg l 1 12 12 0 47 mg l 1 and 24 18 0 46 mg l 1 respectively the post hoc test was further conducted by forming six groups of pairings among the sodium acetate loadings to determine significant difference between certain operational parameters however the outcome indicated that there was significant difference p 0 05 for all the six pairings these significant pairings indicated that the effects between all the influent co substrate on o hydroxytoluene were prominent yu et al 8 revealed that poorer capability of phenolic compounds degradation could be exhibited at considerably lower or higher influent co substrate loading in mfc a concentration of 500 mg l 1 was insufficient to support the expanded microbial community along the anodic region despite the high cod removal conversely the excessively high influent co substrate concentration 3000 mg l 1 showed significant decline in the removal of o hydroxytoluene this is because microbial growth rate was inhibited at high co substrate concentration as organic acids would accumulate in the microbial cells via fermentation process substrate inhibition would occur when the concentration of co substrate supply exceeds the optimal parameters which will in turn reduce the microbial growth rate within the system importantly the readily biodegradable organic matter is more preferable to be utilized by the microorganisms it would therefore reduce the necessity for o hydroxytoluene as a carbon source and consequently decreasing the removal capability of o hydroxytoluene based on the results obtained higher removal of o hydroxytoluene concentration can be attained with influent sodium acetate of 1000 mg l 1 the growth and metabolism demands of microorganisms will be significantly enhanced when adequate amount of carbon source was provided a moderate amount of co substrate will stimulate microbial activity thereby enhancing the removal efficiency of cresylic acid in agf mfc 3 1 3 effect of external loads the effect of external loads on agf mfc performance was evaluated by adopting different external loads rload under constant acetate loading of 1000 mg l 1 and initial o hydroxytoluene concentration of 50 mg l 1 based on the results obtained during phase ii the internal resistance r i of mfc with 1000 mg l 1 of acetate concentration was found to be approximately 230 ω the range of external loads used in this study was selected to include the value of r i 230 ω as well as values higher and lower than that of r i on account of that five external loads were employed which included 100 ω below r i 230 ω r i 500 ω above r i 1000 ω reference rload and 10 000 ω above reference rload each rload was kept constant in the mfc system for approximately 7 days before samples collection for cod analysis can be performed in order to achieve the steady state response the performance of cod removal at each rload was monitored within the period of a constant cell potential generation fig 4 a shows the cod removal profile of mfc system under different external loads the cod removal attained in mfc operated under different rload was statistically significant p 0 05 it was observed that the agf mfc achieved substantial cod removal efficiencies of 94 87 0 29 and 93 56 0 41 under lower rload of 100 ω and 230 ω respectively when the rload was increased to 500 ω and 1000 ω the cod removal efficiencies were noted to have reduced to 89 73 0 60 and 87 06 0 50 respectively meanwhile the lowest cod removal efficiency of 68 98 0 99 was recorded during the application of the highest rload of 10 000 ω the results suggested that the lower external load would lead to a higher cod removal this phenomenon can be attributed to higher anodic electron transfer rates and microbial metabolic activities in substrates utilization as lower external load can ease the transfer of electrons to the cathode it would be expected that a greater amount of electrons will be transferred from anode to cathode via the external circuit when the system was operated under low rload hence a higher electrogenic metabolism would have facilitated the organic matter degradation the ce was observed to be consistent with cod removal in this study following an increase in rload from 100 ω to 10 000 ω ce decreased from 12 85 to 8 57 table 2 this circumstance suggested the capacity of organic matter utilization for releasing electrons by electroactive bacteria was diminished because of the lower relative abundance of electricity producing bacterial communities on the anodic surface of mfc fig 4 b depicts the reduction in o hydroxytoluene concentration along the sampling points in agf mfc statistical analysis indicated that the external loads have significant influences p 0 05 on the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in the current mfc system the removal percentage of o hydroxytoluene was 88 8 0 07 when the system was operated with the lowest rload 100 ω when the external load was increased to 230 ω the removal percentage of o hydroxytoluene increased correspondingly and a complete removal of o hydroxytoluene 100 was achieved however it was observed that the removal percentages of o hydroxytoluene declined when the rload was further increased the removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene decreased to 77 11 1 83 when the external load was increased to 10 000 ω the difference in the effluent concentration of o hydroxytoluene was increasingly apparent particularly when the rload was increased up to 10 000 ω the post hoc test also revealed that the effluent o hydroxytoluene concentration in agf mfc operated with an external load of 230 ω was significantly lower p 0 05 compared to the one operated with 10 000 ω external load it is generally accepted that a lower electron flux in conjunction with a higher anode potential can be achieved with the application of a higher external load 14 conversely lower external load rload r i favours the dominancy of electrogenic microbes in the anodic region 17 in this study the cod removal was favoured by lowering the rload nevertheless the variation of o hydroxytoluene removal presented in this system was noticeably different from the organic matter degradation this phenomenon indicated the complications associated with the removal mechanisms of refractory cresylic compounds in agf mfc the removal of o hydroxytoluene in mfc system was found to have increased initially followed by further declination when the rload were increased from 100 ω to 10 000 ω as shown in fig 4 considering the removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene throughout phase iii the external load of 230 ω was the optimal external resistance for effective removal of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc a relatively higher removal efficiency of o hydroxytoluene was attained in this system when the rload was adjusted to 230 ω where the external resistance was approximately equal to the internal resistance 221 ω of agf mfc system rload r i this outcome was compatible with the findings observed by wen et al 14 where the best removal performances of antibiotics i e sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline were achieved with the application of a moderate rload 700 ω which correlates to the internal resistance of cw mfcs meanwhile the reduction in o hydroxytoluene removal efficiencies when rload ri is because fermentation and methanogenic bacteria communities can be dominant over electrogenic bacteria in the anodic biofilm at high applied resistance 17 apparently the abundance of non electroactive bacteria reduced the consumption of metabolites owing to the reduction of metabolic respiration rate and electron transfer reactions at the anodic region under condition with lower applied resistance rload ri competition as terminal electron acceptors may have existed between functional groups presented in recalcitrant organic pollutants and anode 31 this would eventually lead to the lower removal efficiency of cresylic acid in agf mfc 3 1 4 effect of aeration rates oxygen is an effective electron acceptor which is extensively utilized in mfc owing to its comparatively high redox potential easy availability being economically valuable and preferably with environmental sustainability 19 nevertheless an increased aeration demand is highly associated with higher energy consumption the effect of aeration rate on overall mfc performance was investigated during phase iv to determine the optimal aeration rate for wastewater treatment with concurrent bioelectricity generation in agf mfc to minimize energy wastage there are two pathways of oxygen reduction reaction orr at the cathodic region reduction via four electrons o2 4h 4e 2h2o and reduction of o2 to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 via two electrons o2 2h 2e h2o2 7 besides aeration rate variation has a different impact on the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc particularly at cathodic region the auxiliary aeration was initially adjusted to a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 and the dissolved oxygen do concentration was retained at 2 07 0 15 mg l 1 fig 6 e fig 6 a illustrated the cod removal under different cathodic aeration rates the total cod removal efficiency obtained was 87 15 where the anodic and cathodic region accounted for 78 29 and 8 86 respectively when the aeration rate was further increased to 50 ml min 1 and 400 ml min 1 the do concentration increased correspondingly up by 61 67 to 5 4 0 1 mg l 1 and by 68 01 to 6 47 0 15 mg l 1 respectively as compared to the cod removal during aeration rate of 5 ml min 1 higher cod removal efficiencies can be obtained at cathodic region when a higher aeration rates of 50 ml min 1 and 400 ml min 1 were introduced this would thus contribute to the higher total cod removal efficiencies of 88 80 and 94 50 with the anodic region accounted for 78 39 and 81 69 respectively meanwhile lowest cod removal efficiency 80 77 was obtained in the absence of auxiliary aeration at the cathodic region these results indicated that mfc can perform a higher removal efficiency under aeration condition rather than that without aeration statistical analysis proved that aeration rate significantly p 0 05 affects the total removal of cod in agf mfc this could be due to the production of metabolic intermediates from the degradation of o hydroxytoluene which are recalcitrant to anaerobic degradation the cod concentration was found to have declined sharply from influent to s1 followed by gradual degradation at s2 and s3 in the anaerobic region anova with tukey s post hoc test revealed that there were statistically significant differences between 400 ml min 1 and others p 0 05 whereas there were no significant difference for other three pairings on anaerobic cod removal p 0 05 this phenomenon is caused by the diffusion of oxygen into s3 region when an aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 was introduced to the cathodic region of agf mfc it can be further verified by the increased do concentration at s3 fig 6 e besides the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene in agf mfc were noticeably affected by the presence of auxiliary aeration at the cathodic region fig 6 b based on the control system without aeration the total removal of o hydroxytoluene was 87 67 0 20 following an increase in the aeration rate in mfc system the removal efficiencies of o hydroxytoluene increased correspondingly statistical analysis revealed that aeration rate significantly affected the removal percentages of o hydroxytoluene in this system p 0 05 the total removal of o hydroxytoluene in this system were 400 ml min 1 100 0 0014 50 ml min 1 98 7 0 098 5 ml min 1 93 15 0 94 control 87 76 0 20 significant differences p 0 05 were also observed in the effluent o hydroxytoluene among four different aeration rates with corresponding values of 0 0 65 0 048 3 43 0 47 and 6 12 0 11 mg l 1 respectively higher o hydroxytoluene removal efficiency can be achieved with higher cathodic aeration rate due to higher amount of dissolved oxygen available for the aerobic oxidation of the aromatic compounds moreover lowest percentage of o hydroxytoluene removal was attained in mfc system without auxiliary aeration as indicated in eqs 4 6 the available cathodic reaction potentials were considerably higher with auxiliary aeration than without aeration hydrogen gas is possible to be produced in mfc device when oxygen was kept out of the mfc system 32 but the collection and detection of hydrogen in mfc is not practical under open system conditions hence the enhanced redox reaction will lead to a faster electron transport and higher reactive energy for the reaction mechanisms furthermore higher aeration rate could provide more driving force for the contact enhancement between cathode and aerobic microbial circulation this would facilitate the synergistic effect between electrochemical and biological action which further improved the removal of cresylic compounds in agf mfc from fig 6 b it was found that the amount of o hydroxytoluene reduced at s1 and s3 under aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 was significantly higher compared to the amount of o hydroxytoluene reduced under the other aeration rate there were two reasons for such occurrences first higher aeration rate would contribute to a higher amount of oxygen which can be utilized as terminal electron acceptors at the cathodic region since s1 was externally connected to the cathode more terminal electron acceptors at cathodic region would stimulate microbial electron transfer from s1 to cathode which will cause an increase in the effective degradation of o hydroxytoluene at s1 second the high reduction of o hydroxytoluene at s3 suggested the production of anaerobic recalcitrant intermediates from o hydroxytoluene degradation before reaching s3 in agf mfc these anaerobic recalcitrant intermediates would then be degraded easily at s3 because there was oxygen intrusion into s3 from the cathodic region under an aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 meanwhile there was no oxygen diffusion to the anodic region for mfc under the rest of the controlled aeration rates in this study the cod removal is in line with the o hydroxytoluene removal in this study auxiliary aeration at the cathodic region was shown to be efficacious in promoting nutrient organic pollutants and cod removal in mfcs as well as bioelectricity generation 33 previous studies indicated that the microorganisms at the cathodic region could act as biocatalysts to promote direct electron transfer to final electron acceptor owing to direct involvement of cathodic microbes in the redox reactions 34 thus the optimization of aeration rate at the aerobic region is very important in achieving the greatest extent of microbial activities and biodegradation of organic matter

generation characteristics of agf mfc system under different operating conditions considering the concept of waste to energy recovery novel mfc technology was developed to accomplish simultaneous pollutants removal and bioelectricity generation from organic matter present in the wastewater by exploiting microbial metabolism to catalyse the electrochemical reactions bioelectricity generation in agf mfc is sensitive to the environmental changes despite the limited power generation the bioelectricity generation can be used to reflect the operational performance of mfc system and govern the microbial metabolism process therefore it is vitally important to evaluate the bioelectricity performance of agf mfc through the monitoring of output voltage and power generation 3 2 1 effect of co substrate types fig 2 c illustrated the average output voltage of agf mfc fed with four different types of carbon source species the low standard deviation indicated voltage stability condition was achieved in this system the output voltage of agf mfc system supplied with four different carbon sources were ranked in the following order sodium acetate 609 25 3 77 mv glucose 506 94 4 40 mv sucrose 394 41 3 05 mv carbamide 226 78 2 63 mv respectively the post hoc test attested that agf mfc system supplied with sodium acetate displayed significantly higher output voltage compared to the other three carbon source species p 0 05 a similar trend was observed in the power density of the mfc system fig 2 d in comparison with sucrose glucose and carbamide a significantly higher power density was observed in the system with sodium acetate p 0 05 likewise it was noted that the minimization of the internal resistance ri 224 40 ω can also be attained with sodium acetate this phenomenon was ascribed to the capacity strengthening of electroactive bacteria in transforming organic matter into bioelectricity by using sodium acetate as co substrate it can be affirmed with the highest ce 11 86 as shown in table 2 however there was no statistical difference in ce among different sources of carbon p 0 05 previous study conducted by yu et al 8 also indicated that acetate is the optimal co substrate for enhanced removal of 4 chlorophenol and 4 fold enhancement of power generation in mfc this priority could be explained by the relatively lower molecular weight of sodium acetate 82 03 g mol 1 than sucrose 342 3 g mol 1 and glucose 180 16 g mol 1 sucrose and glucose are a disaccharide and monosaccharide respectively which would impose difficulties on the direct metabolism of electroactive bacteria for bioelectricity generation particularly sucrose although carbamide possesses lowest molecular weight among all carbon choices the degradation metabolites of carbamide such as hydrazine may have an inhibitory effect on electroactive microorganisms in mfc 29 consequently the negatively affected electroactive bacteria could therefore hinder the bioelectricity generation overall sodium acetate is considered to be an optimum carbon source and has been widely applied in the treatment of numerous kind of pollutants such as antibiotics 35 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 36 and phenolic compounds 8 3 2 2 effect of carbon source concentrations the average output voltages of agf mfc under different carbon source concentrations were demonstrated in fig 3 c the output voltages remained stable throughout the phases of study which can be indicated by the small standard deviation according to anova there were significant differences in the output voltages among the four different carbon source concentrations p 0 05 the average voltages were 517 2 54 mv 500 mg l 1 609 2 2 99 mv 1000 mg l 1 554 2 2 98 mv 2000 mg l 1 and 325 01 3 02 mv 3000 mg l 1 respectively the amount of influent carbon source sodium acetate supplementation as well as the capability of anaerobic microorganisms in utilizing the co substrate plays a decisive role in the output voltages generation in mfc system generally a higher output voltage would be obtained with a higher concentration of co substrate in the present study the highest average voltage 609 20 mv as obtained with an influent sodium acetate concentration of 1000 mg l 1 besides it was also observed that the average voltages increased accordingly when the influent sodium acetate concentration was increased from 500 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 this is because the increment of sodium acetate concentration had led to a higher ionic conduction along the bioreactor system the high ionic strength might contribute to an increase in co substrate mass transfer to the microorganisms in the system which would expedite the co substrate degradation more effectively the succeeding higher ion exchange rate between anode and cathode by virtue of acetate oxidation under higher influent co substrate concentration will definitely drive more electrons and protons to travel to the anode externally as previously disclosed 37 thus higher output voltage will be generated it can be further verified by the electrical conductivity of the system where the conductivities were 5 63 ms cm 1 500 mg l 1 6 57 ms cm 1 1000 mg l 1 and 6 2 ms cm 1 2000 mg l 1 respectively however the output voltage declined slightly following an increase in sodium acetate concentration up to 2000 mg l 1 a significant decline in output voltage was observed when the sodium acetate concentration was further increased to 3000 mg l 1 it was in accordance with the cod removal obtained where the cod removal efficiencies decreased from 88 75 to 68 35 when the sodium acetate concentration was increased from 1000 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 such phenomenon could be ascribed to the suppression of microbial oxidation mechanism in mfc system the electroactive bacteria in mfc system was adversely affected by the excessive hydrogen ions produced during the oxidation of sodium acetate in the anodic region previous study 38 indicated that the electrochemical oxidation of sodium acetate engendered the acid production ch3coo 2h2o 2co2 7h 8e as presented in the equation 7 mol of hydrogen ions will be produced for each mole of acetate oxidized by anaerobic microbes which can give rise to a drop in ph within the biofilm microenvironment based on the power density curves fig 3 d the power densities showed the same manner as the output voltages of mfc where the power densities were 110 07 2 11 mw m 2 500 mg l 1 159 44 8 57 mw m 2 1000 mg l 1 103 23 2 09 mw m 2 2000 mg l 1 and 31 59 1 51 mw m 2 3000 mg l 1 respectively the internal resistances were in accordance with both the output voltages and power densities table 2 conversely ce was found to have increased as the influent cod concentration increased the utilization of electrons by non electroactive bacteria in the solution for other metabolic processes can potentially contribute to lower ce with higher cod removal 3 2 3 effect of external loads the application of rload is peculiarly important in mfc system especially in terms of bioelectricity generation fig 4 c and d presents the polarization and power density curves for agf mfc under different rload with a constant acetate loading of 1000 mg l 1 and initial o hydroxytoluene concentration of 50 mg l 1 the open circuit voltages voc of system were 754 7 mv 100 ω 755 mv 230 ω 755 1 mv 500 ω 753 4 mv 1000 ω and 754 8 mv 10 000 ω respectively anova revealed that there was no significant difference in their voc p 0 05 which indicated that the electrolyte properties were unaffected throughout the system operation contrariwise the mfcs with different rload exhibited massive differences in their output voltage and power production anova p 0 05 when the rload was increased stepwise from 100 to 10 000 ω the output voltage increased in accordance with ohm s law the mfc system operated with rload of 10 000 ω generated an average output voltage va of 724 67 mv which was remarkably higher than those generated under 100 230 500 and 1000 ω with average voltages of 224 05 382 55 517 56 and 616 23 mv respectively the external loads governed not only the potential difference between the anode and cathode but also the anodic electron transfer rate through an external circuit in mfc system in addition the changes in external resistance would also result in a change in the microbial community and population distribution in the anodic region thereby affecting the power generation and treatment efficiency of pollutants 39 from fig 4 d the highest maximum power density of 173 10 mw m 2 was noticed in the agf mfc system with rload of 230 ω followed by 100 169 69 mw m 2 500 168 12 mw m 2 1000 164 69 mw m 2 and 10 000 ω 160 73 mw m 2 as shown in table 2 the internal resistance obtained at peak power point ri under different rload increased in the following order where 230 ω ri 221 88 ω 100 ω ri 225 97 ω 500 ω ri 228 25 ω 1000 ω ri 231 65 ω 10 000 ω ri 237 83 ω moreover it is evident that the differences existing between the rload and ri have a direct influence on the maximum power density of mfc system the smallest difference of 3 66 between rload and ri was displayed with mfc operated under rload of 230 ω it was followed by 100 ω 57 54 500 ω 119 06 1000 ω 331 69 10 000 ω 4104 68 interestingly the relationships between the total differences between the rload and ri and the associated amount of maximum power density in mfc were directly proportional this can be absolutely affirmed with the order of maximum power density obtained in this study the mfc operated under rload of 230 ω which had the smallest ri and difference with its ri yielded the highest power production according to jacobi s maximum power transfer theorem maximum power will be obtained when external resistance equals the internal resistance of mfc system hence by having the rload 230 ω closer to the ri 221 88 ω highest power production 173 10 mw m2 and current production 483 65 ma m2 was yielded conversely lowest power production of 160 73 mw m2 with corresponding current density of 466 01 ma m2 was yielded under rload of 10 000 ω this phenomenon can be attributed to its high ri which restricted the flow of current through rload of 10 000 ω as high rload resulted in low current however it was observed that mfc with the lowest rload of 100 ω had a lower power production of 169 69 mw m2 with corresponding current density of 478 86 ma m2 compared to those obtained with rload 230 ω this is because a comparably high electron flow rate that exceeded the maximum sustainable charge transfer rate was attained when rload was low consequently the electrical potential of mfc would deteriorate rapidly and impose a limit on the current that may be delivered to the load therefore the electric current declined and led to a lower power production apart from that internal loss is also the possible contributing factor for limited electron transport taking place in low rload it can be verified through the slightly higher ri obtained with rload of 100 ω table 2 these findings ratified jacobi s law of maximum power transfer overall the findings implied that the cell design point rload ri should be regulated so that the mfc operation can be maintained in generating maximum power density the dynamic behaviour of agf mfc under rload variation was evaluated to compare the intensity obtained when the rload was step wise increased and decreased on this section the polarization test was performed by varying the resistors from 10 m ω to 1 ω using resistor box the reason of plotting more sample points in the dynamic polarization curves is to ensure the differences between forward and backward polarization can be easily identified all the polarization curves were measured after the mfc system has reached the steady state performance in this study rload of 230 1000 and 10 000 ω were chosen to perform dynamic polarization tests because there were statistically significant differences in power production between these three groups anova p 0 05 the polarization curves were plotted by varying rload in an increasing manner forward polarization followed by inverting it in a decreasing manner reverse polarization as shown in fig 5 there were three negative hysteresis loops remarked obviously it can be observed that the power production in the forward polarizations was higher than the reverse polarization this phenomenon could be ascribed to the establishment of different anodic microbial community under different rload this change in the microbial population could be the plausible factor causing a reduction in the power production after operated under high rload previous study 40 also indicated that mfc operated under different rload served as a selection force for different electroactive microorganisms which would thus induce differences in the anodic potentials subsequently these changes in the microbial distribution could affect the electrochemical activity of the anodic electroactive bacteria by altering the activation losses and internal resistance of the anode 40 however it was proven by tukey kramer post hoc test that significant difference only existed between the polarization curves of 10 000 ω forward scan and 10 000 ω reverse scan p 0 05 while there was no significant difference for another two forward reverse pairings p 0 05 lyon et al 41 revealed that the resulting microbial community did not resemble the communities established at the same rload when the rload was step wise increased and decreased thus the flexibility of the mfc system was demonstrated as different microbial community developed under different rload but resulted in similar power production in addition it is commonly known that mfc performance can be enhanced by minimizing the ohmic voltage losses activation overpotentials concentration overpotentials and coulombic losses three distinct regimes associated with the internal losses can be observed by referring to the dynamic polarization curves fig 5 based on fig 5 there was almost no voltage loss in the regime of activation losses this phenomenon suggested that varying the load in the circuit have no effect on the activation energy needed for an oxidation reduction reaction in mfc because the nature of the electrode remains unaltered contrariwise the dynamic polarization curves of agf mfc under rload of 10 000 ω exhibited the largest voltage deviation in the regime of ohmic losses this phenomenon disclosed that ohmic overpotential due to a combination of resistances from electrons transfer in the electric circuit and movement of ions through the electrolyte in the cell was the main factor that impacts the internal losses apart from that it was observed that there was only slight voltage deviation in the regime of concentration loss this circumstance implied that the decrease in reactant concentration at the surface of the electrodes as fuel is used does not significantly affect the internal resistance of this system similarly the dynamic polarization curves fig 5 also demonstrated that there were some losses in power production at the regime of ohmic losses the internal resistance of the mfcs at different rload was then determined from the slope of the ohmic linear range of the registered voltage current curves the mfc operated with step wise decreasing rload of 10 000 1000 and 230 ω had ohmic resistance rohmic of 254 47 2 12 235 57 5 07 and 225 72 3 58 ω respectively meanwhile the ohmic resistance obtained with step wise increasing rload of 230 1000 and 10 000 ω are 221 88 0 74 ω 231 65 3 70 ω and 237 83 7 65 ω respectively largest ohmic losses difference was displayed with rload of 10 000 ω followed by 1000 and 230 ω the ohmic losses could be partly minimized by reducing the rload from reference rload 1000 ω to maximum power point 230 ω likewise optimization of mfc operating conditions appropriate design of the interconnection between components in the system and the use of electrode and current collectors with high electrical conductivity can also reduce mass transfer limitations and performance losses 3 2 4 effect of aeration rates fig 6 c and d displayed the average output voltage and power density curves of agf mfc under different cathodic aeration rates based on statistical analysis the effect of different aeration rates on the bioelectricity generation performances of agf mfc system was significant p 0 05 initially the output voltage and power density at 5 ml min 1 aeration rate were 333 65 mv and 32 53 mw m 2 respectively when the aeration rate was increased by 10 fold to 50 ml min 1 it was noticed that both the output voltage and power density were significantly improved to 607 96 mv and 158 17 mw m 2 respectively correspondingly the ce increased slightly in accordance with the increase in aeration rate from 5 ml min 1 to 50 ml min 1 at the cathodic region table 2 furthermore there was no diffusion of oxygen to the anodic region occurred during these two phases of study the enhanced bioelectricity generation performances can be attributed to the elevated do concentration at the cathodic region thereby facilitating the ability of electrons to transfer externally from anode to cathode by increasing number of terminal electron acceptors o2 nevertheless further increase in the aeration rate up to 400 ml min 1 did not improve the output voltage and power density of the system in fact it has caused a reduction in the bioelectricity generation performances the output voltage and power density were declined to 572 39 mv and 116 99 mw m 2 respectively in the meantime the diffusion of air into s3 anodic region occurred this can be further verified by the do concentration at s3 1 77 ml min 1 as shown in the do profile fig 6 e these outcomes indicated that excessive aeration is not favourable for bioelectricity generation in a bio cathode single chamber membrane less mfc system there were two plausible factors that contribute to the reduction in power generation in this respect first excessive biofilm growth would cause the thickening of the biofilm on the cathode which will eventually lead to a limited active surface area for oxygen reduction reaction second higher aeration rates would generate more bubbles and bubble coalescence will certainly affect the mass transfer of mfc system thus resulting in a deterioration in the bioelectricity generation performance to further investigate the interaction between aeration and the performances of mfc system aeration at the cathodic region was removed during phase iv d from fig 6 it was observed that the organic matter consumption o hydroxytoluene degradation output voltages power generation and internal resistance were unfavourably affected without the presence of an adequate supply of oxygen this was well reflected in the prominent decline in cod removal percentage particularly at the cathodic region apart from that it was also observed that there was just a slight degradation of o hydroxytoluene at the non aerated cathodic region besides output voltage and power density decreased considerably to 253 46 mv and 17 28 mw m 2 respectively owing to the decline in the dissolved oxygen at the cathodic region these results suggested that the highest maximum power density was obtained at aeration rate of 50 ml min 1 the results showed that either lower or higher aeration rates had a negative impact on the power density post hoc tests revealed that there were significant differences between all the pairings of aeration rates p 0 05 the variation in the aeration rates is closely related to their internal resistance table 2 fig 6 d presented the polarization and power density curves of mfc system under different aeration rates it can be observed that the voltages declined linearly with current density this implied that the total internal loss of this mfc system is dominated by internal ohmic losses through the system which had eventually led to the lower voltage and power density generated in comparison to higher aeration rates 50 and 400 ml min 1 prominent open circuit loss due to reduction of electrical potential difference between two terminals of mfc system was observed in system with lower aeration rate of 5 ml min 1 and without aeration moreover a positive linear relationship between the output voltage and cathodic do concentration was presented in fig 6 f it was observed that the output voltage increased remarkably when the aeration rate was increased to 50 ml min 1 while the output voltage declined slightly when the aeration rate was further increased by 8 times to 400 ml min 1 contrariwise when the aeration rates of 0 5 50 and 400 ml min 1 were supplemented the concentration of dissolved oxygen increased remarkably from 0 88 mg l 1 to 2 07 5 4 and 6 47 mg l 1 respectively overall an aeration rate of 50 ml min 1 was considered as the optimal aeration rate for effective o hydroxytoluene degradation and bioelectricity generation in agf mfc therefore a sufficient do concentration should be supplemented at the cathodic region in order to optimize the overall system performance 3 3 degradation pathway fig 7 presents the proposed degradation pathway of ortho hydroxytoluene in agf mfc system the catabolic pathway of o hydroxytoluene was proposed based on the results obtained through gc ms analysis fig a1 possible but undetected intermediates were indicated in brackets initially the o hydroxytoluene was catabolized anaerobically via two main metabolic pathways one involves the side chain oxidation at the methyl group of o hydroxytoluene while the other utilizes the benzoyl coa reductase bcr to catalyse dehydroxylation of the hydroxyl substitute of o hydroxytoluene 42 side chain oxidation of o hydroxytoluene yields 1 hydroxybenzyl alcohol which further coverts to 1 hydroxybenzyl aldehyde and finally to 1 hydroxybenzoic acid the latter intermediates would then undergo ring oxidation to form 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid subsequently decarboxylation of 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid resulted in the formation of catechol catechol was presumed to be oxidized to its highly reactive quinone form through autoxidation with the assistance of enzymes such as tyrosinase horseradish peroxidase 43 ring cleavage of benzoquinone occurred with the aid of intradiol dioxygenases in the aerobic region leading to the formation of cis cis muconic acid ccma 44 lastly ccma was further degraded into succinic acid and ethanoic acid which was then transformed into carbon dioxide and water on the other hand hydroxylation of benzyl alcohol led to the substitution of hydroxyl group adjacent to the hydroxymethyl group namely 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol further oxidation of 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol yields 4 hydroxybenzyl aldehyde 4 hydroxybenzyl aldehyde was presumed to undergo hydroxylation reaction to form 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid it was then followed by decarboxylation or dihydroxylation eventuating in the formation of resorcinol phenol and hydroxyquinone aromatic ring cleavage and oxidation of these intermediates occurred forming maleic acid malic acid tartronic acid and fumaric acid these intermediates could be further degraded to simple organic acids such as oxalic acid and acetic acid which were generally transformed into water and carbon dioxide 4 conclusion the complete removal of refractory phenolic compounds has required a great effort to reduce water pollution this study succinctly demonstrated a high performance mfc system in complete removal of o hydroxytoluene with energy recovery the effects of carbon source availability and concentrations external loads rload and cathode conditions on the removal rate of ortho hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation in agf mfc were comprehensively evaluated sodium acetate was the most efficient co substrate which yielded the highest o hydroxytoluene removal via co metabolism and power generation optimal carbon source concentration 1000 mg l 1 significantly affected the microbial degradation of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation moreover the rload showed significant differences in both wastewater treatment and power generation p 0 05 the results ratified jacobi s law where maximum power generation was obtained when rload was close to internal resistance rload ri contrariwise lower performances were obtained when mfc was operated at higher rload ri or lower rload rload ri thus the rload should be adjusted as close as possible to its internal resistance to reduce the ohmic losses an optimum aeration rate was beneficial for the removal of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation because sufficient terminal electron acceptors would facilitate the anodic electrons transfer in sum the influencing parameters on the removal of o hydroxytoluene and bioelectricity generation in mfc should be optimized and regulated in real application for realizing more efficient removal of phenolic laden wastewater and energy recovery credit authorship contribution statement sing mei tan

12826,using anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs to treat swine wastewater is an effective method to recover bioenergy however due to the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen on microbial activities in swine wastewater some problems are evident such as low recovery efficiency and serious membrane fouling in this study biochar prepared from spent coffee grounds scg bc was added to anmbr to investigate its effect on the operation process results reported that methane yield rose from 0 227 lch4 g codremoved to 0 267 lch4 g codremoved along with a reduction in co2 being produced at 35 25 after adding scg bc it confirmed that in situ biogas upgrading was achieved as well the total volatile fatty acids declined to a low concentration of 194 87 51 82 mg l while ph remained steadily at 7 70 0 31 adding scg bc reduced irreversible membrane fouling by 34 69 microbial community analysis showed that scg bc increased the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea especially methanosarcina from 1 47 to 8 03 also anaerolinea and methanosaeta participating in direct interspecies electron transfer were enriched onto biochar they acted together to enhance the biogas production it can be concluded that anmbr with scg bc addition has good application prospects in recovering bioenergy from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

industry has become one of the fastest growing sectors in china with 47 3 of the world s swine production in 2020 mainly due to the rising demand by people for meat 1 at present large scale breeding is a crucial change in how the swine industry in china functions and single farms can now produce much more however the large scale swine factory has the problems of large wastewater discharge which comprises mixed solid and liquid many insect eggs and microorganisms and large amounts of heavy metals antibiotics and hormones 2 3 besides the swine wastewater produced contains a high level of organics nitrogen phosphorus potassium and other chemical pollutants 4 5 in general the traditional processes treating swine wastewater such as lagoon anaerobic digestion tank or three stage a o process can only remove less than 90 of chemical oxygen demand cod and the removal capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus is extremely limited subsequently this might cause a large amount of recyclable energy loss and long term environmental problems 6 in recent decades as environmental regulations become increasingly strict it is of importance to guarantee effluent quality of swine wastewater for a society much more concerned about what is happening to the environment moreover simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery has become a hotly debated topic the purpose is to drive the technical efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant as well as its profitability 7 anaerobic digestion ad consists of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis which is widely used to degrade swine wastewater and recover bioenergy presently including biogases such as h2s co2 h2 and ch4 and digestive fluid containing residual cod and other nutrients 8 11 however its poor efficiency in producing methane is a serious problem in practical application which is due to the slow growth of anaerobic microorganisms especially methanogens 12 13 microbial activity in the reactor is an important factor for the efficient operation of the anaerobic digestion process 14 15 anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr can effectively separate solid retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt through membrane modules and be applied to wastewater treatment in recent years in some cases anmbr achieved a high organic matter removal rate 81 95 and methane recovery rate 60 80 with a low sludge yield 0 05 0 22 gvss g codremoved 16 18 anmbrs can effectively improve the digestion performance but there are still some difficulties and challenges in them when treating swine wastewater on one hand the organic matter in swine wastewater is very high amount wise tang et al 18 found that the methanogenic capacity of anaerobic digestion becomes weak lower than 0 24 l g codremoved in swine wastewater with a high organic concentration 13 5 27 2 gcod l this is because the larger amount of organic matter in the substrate resulted in producing more volatile fatty acid which inhibited the growth of methanogens with the increase of organic load the contents of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers eps in the reactor also rose smp and eps are considered to be the main pollutants that trigger membrane fouling 20 on the other hand swine wastewater also contains a lot of ammonia nitrogen according to the research by yan et al 21 with the ammonia nitrogen shock of 4 5 gnh4 n l the methane production diminished rapidly which was 48 7 58 2 lower than before this was because methanogens are very sensitive to ammonia toxicity during methane production from intermediate products and their methanogenic performance decreases sharply with the impact of high concentration ammonia nitrogen in wastewater 22 23 some corresponding strategies were put forward such as controlling the anaerobic digestion temperature and prolonging hrt to overcome these problems the measures are widely used to enhance the performance of the reactor to a certain extent however they have the disadvantages of reducing the volume load and increasing operational costs 24 some researchers have focused on the use of various enhancers in anmbr including waste yeast iron calcium polyaluminum chloride zeolite and beans 25 30 among these materials iron and calcium can improve biogas production in the digestion process however they also introduce serious inorganic pollution problems beans damage the membrane module to some degree during fluidization 31 moreover these materials greatly increase the cost of reactors operations carbon based materials as anmbr performance enhancers play an important role in improving cod removal rate improving membrane flux and delaying the formation of filter cake layer these materials are also environmentally friendly as they are produced from agricultural wastes 32 sohn et al 20 found that the removal rates of cod and total organic carbon toc in anmbr significantly increased by 15 7 and 15 6 respectively after the addition of 5 g l powdered activated carbon pac a higher methane yield of about 3483 nmol l was achieved in the degradation of rapeseed oil while the methane yield of the control group without gac was lower than 3000 nmol l 33 by adding bamboo charcoal in anmbr to treat bamboo industrial wastewater the removal rate of cod increased by 5 as well as the content of smp and the resistance of filter cake layer abated 34 chen et al 35 found that the anmbr with the addition of biochar exhibited an enhancement of 4 6 in the cod removal rate when treating pharmaceutical wastewater it also improved the methane content in biogas production and effectively curtailed membrane fouling moreover some research showed that carbon based materials can strengthen the direct interspecies electron transfer diet process by enriching microbes that can directly produce or receive electrons such as geobacter metallireducens geobacter sulfurreducens and methanosaeta 36 thus the electron transfer of microorganisms does not need to pass through the intermediate media that easily cause energy loss such as conductive pili and hydrogen and greatly increases the conversion rate from organic matter to methane 24 this is also an important reason why carbon based materials can effectively promote anaerobic digestion and control membrane fouling of carbon based materials the specific surface area and conductivity of biochar are much lower than those of activated carbon yet it has been reported that biochar has the same ability to promote anaerobic digestion and enhance diet as activated carbon 37 although powdered activated carbon can promote anaerobic digestion it is a potential pollution source because the small particle pac increases the turbidity of the mixture it results in more membrane hole blockage and membrane surface abrasion 31 the specific gravity of granular activated carbon gac is higher than that of biochar which means that it takes more energy to mix gac with sludge into fluidization 38 furthermore terms of preparation cost biochar does not need an activation process which can undoubtedly reduce overheads 39 these are also the reasons why biochar has better prospects compared with activated carbon in the application of anaerobic digestion in conclusion biochar has good application potential as an enhancer in anmbr for treating swine wastewater it may affect methanogenic performance and membrane fouling by changing the microbial community structure and microbial interspecific cooperation these need to be further studied in this work spent coffee grounds biochar scg bc was introduced in anmbr acting as a performance enhancer the objectives were to i evaluate the digestion performance of anmbr system after the addition of spent coffee grounds biochar ii investigate membrane fouling behaviors and iii explore the impact of biochar on microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of biochar the spent coffee grounds were sourced from a local starbucks cafe in tianjin china first the collected waste coffee grounds were dried to constant weight in an oven at 105 c then the waste coffee residue was put into a muffle furnace to prepare biochar via pyrolyzation the spent coffee grounds were heated to 900 c at the rate of 5 c min and maintained for 2 h under oxygen limitation conditions 40 finally the produced biochar with a particle size of 0 15 0 178 mm was passed through an 80 mesh sieve to remove large particles and retained by a 100 mesh sieve to remove small particles the characteristics of scg bc are shown in supplementary material 2 2 anmbr set up and operation the anmbr system consists of anaerobic digestion reactor gas circulation equipment gas liquid replacement gas gathering device and membrane module shown in fig 1 the effective working volume of anmbr is 2 5 l and the total volume is 4 l the membrane information is shown in supplementary material the inoculated sludge of the reactor was taken from the sbr sludge of a sewage treatment plant in tianjin china the mlvss amount was 8 g l following the inoculated sludge was domesticated for two months to adapt to synthetic swine wastewater the experiments were divided into two stages the first was phase 1 p1 running for 50 days day 1 50 after acclimatization the second phase commenced on the 51st day when spent coffee grounds biochar was added into the reactor at the dose of 4 g l and the effect of biochar on anmbr was investigated this period p2 lasted from day 51 to 100 during the whole operation hrt was set at 8 3d the temperature was maintained at 35 1 c sludge was discharged regularly and the sludge residence time was 120d the biogas inside the reactor was extracted from the top gas space through the pump and transported to the aeration plate at the bottom of the reactor to activate the gas cycle the aeration process was intermittent for 1 min every 30 min with the flow of 1 l min the swine wastewater treated by the reactor was synthesized in the laboratory glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 were carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively the ratio of cod n p is 350 27 1 the swine wastewater quality indicators at different operation periods are shown in supplementary material to promote microbial growth and granular sludge formation 10 ml of trace element solution was added to each liter of synthetic swine wastewater the trace element solution is shown in supplementary material 2 3 analytical methods the cod concentration was analyzed using the rapid digestion spectrophotometric method shimadzu uv 2600 the concentrations of protein pn and polysaccharide ps were determined utilizing a modified folin ciocalteu colorimetry method 41 and phenol vitriolic acid colorimetry system 42 respectively volatile fatty acids vfa and biogas composition were measured by gas chromatograph perkin element gc590 usa and gas chromatograph perkin element gc500 usa respectively tmp was recorded by vacuum pressure gauge and paperless recorder the surface functional groups of biochar were detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is10 us the specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of carbon based materials were measured by brunauer emmett teller bet the morphology of the original and used biochar was analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem escan mira4 czech republic 2 4 membrane fouling resistance analysis in order to investigate the filtration characteristics of the membrane the membrane fouling resistance was measured by resistance in series model 20 1 j δp μr t where j is the permeate flux δp stands for the tmp and μ denotes the viscosity of the permeate the total resistance rt consists of four parts which are rc rm rp org and rp inorg it can be described as follows 2 r t r m r p org r p inorg r c where rm is the inherent resistance of the membrane rc rp org and rp inorg represent the resistance of the cake layer organic matter blockage and inorganic matter blockage respectively after the operation was completed the membrane module was taken out and rt with different flow in distilled water was measured next the membrane was rinsed with distilled water and wiped gently with a sponge to remove the cake layer the measured value at this stage was rm rp org rp inorg then the membrane was immersed in alkaline reagent 0 1 naclo solution for 24 h to remove any organic matter remaining in the membrane pore the measured value at this stage was rm rp inorg finally the membrane was soaked in an acidic reagent citric acid solution 10 g l for 4 h to remove inorganic pollutants from the membrane pores the measured value at his stage was rm 2 5 microbial analyses the four samples ss sp1 sp2 and bc for microbial analysis were the seed sludge the mixed sludge taken from the anmbr on day 45 and day 96 and the biomass taken from scg bc carriers on day 101 respectively the universal primer set 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 served to target both bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna v4 regions the axyprepdna gel extraction kit axygen usa helped to purify each sample the samples of this experiment were entrusted to shanghai majorbio shanghai china for high throughput sequencing data analysis was conducted on the majorbio bioinformatics date cloud platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal and biogas production fig 2 shows the cod removal efficiencies of anmbr system before and after the scg bc addition the cod removal rate during phase 1 without scg bc addition was 96 88 0 27 with the effluent concentration of 326 61 42 58 mg l in phase 2 after adding scg bc the cod removal rate was 98 85 0 13 when the effluent concentration was 109 73 35 43 mg l it can be seen that the effluent cod concentration diminished significantly after adding scg bc this be due to the abundant pore structure and large pore volume of scg bc see supplementary material which facilitated firstly the adsorption of undegraded organic matter and secondly the reduction of effluent cod concentration 43 44 meanwhile according to sem analysis of pure and used scg bc see supplementary material it can be observed that a large number of microorganisms grew and colonized onto the surface and pores of scg bc biochar provided a good environment for microorganisms in which to grow and raised microbial metabolic activity and its adaptability so this contributed to the cod removal rate 24 this also explained why the effluent from the anmbr in p2 maintained a low cod concentration the biogas production performance and ch4 yield of the anmbr system in p1 and p2 are illustrated in fig 3 before and after adding scg bc the ch4 production of anmbr was 593 10 33 75 ml d and 692 92 56 54 ml d while the co2 production was 89 26 8 96 ml d and 58 57 5 96 ml d respectively compared with p1 the ch4 production in p2 increased significantly by 16 83 while co2 production clearly decreased by 34 37 the methane yield reached 0 256 lch4 gcod in p2 which was 12 7 higher than 0 227 lch4 gcod in p1 the elevated ch4 production was due to the rapid decomposition of organic matter and more efficient microbial metabolism in the anaerobic digestion process enhanced by scg bc 21 as well the reduction of co2 production confirmed the in situ purification and upgrading of biogas due to the addition of scg bc the phenomenon can be explained in the following two ways on one hand biochar has a good adsorption effect on co2 and can reduce the loss of co2 45 on the other hand the ph value of anmbr modified by scg bc was slightly alkaline it may be because more inorganics were retained in the scg bc prepared at the higher pyrolysis temperature as a result base cation and carbonate in the scg bc increased while acidic functional groups decomposed 40 in this state co2 was transformed into bicarbonate carbonate and stored in the liquid phase which helped convert it into methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogens 46 specifically in the p2 phase it can be seen that ch4 and co2 production showed a gradual upward and downward trend respectively at the initial stage of scg bc addition after day 64 the methane production reached a relatively stable state with the ch4 and co2 production of 717 37 35 37 ml d and 57 79 5 67 ml d respectively compared to the scenario without scg bc they increased by 20 95 and decreased by 35 25 respectively this is close to the 17 6 increase in methane production mentioned in one recent study 47 the addition of scg bc led to more biogas production and enhanced biogas production structure this was because a large number of microorganisms adhere to the outer and inner surfaces of the biochar making better use of the adsorption capacity and conductivity 48 obviously the addition of scg bc had a good effect on improving the methanogenic capacity of the anmbr system the ch4 yield reached 0 269 lch4 gcod during the stable period of p2 which was increased by 18 50 compared with the yield of 0 227 lch4 gcod in phase p1 similarly kaur et al 49 found that wheat straw pellet biochar increased the ch4 yield in the digestion process by 24 however giwa et al 50 added biochar to the medium temperature continuous reactor and discovered the methane yield only increased by 5 these research studies revealed the different biogas production performance varied with the biochar properties and operation conditions of reactors in general when the yield of ch4 increases by more than 15 it means that biochar can significantly improve the energy recovery potential of anmbr 16 3 2 variations of ph and vfas vfas as important raw materials in methanogenic process affect the performance of ad the accumulation of vfas reduces the alkalinity and ph value thus inhibiting the methane production process 7 the ph and vfas of the anmbr system in the two phases are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 the ph values before and after scg bc addition were 6 76 0 28 and 7 70 0 31 respectively after scg bc addition the ph in phase 2 increased significantly and then stayed above 7 22 therefore scg bc helped restrict any decline in the ph level and improved the operational stability of the anmbr this was because scg bc possessed a large number of functional groups see supplementary material such as oh co carboxyl co and aromatic ch which could provide alkalinity 51 52 the total vfas tvfa concentrations before and after scg bc addition were 497 73 129 48 mg l and 194 87 51 82 mg l respectively the addition of scg bc greatly reduced the content of vfas in the anmbr at the beginning of p1 the main volatile acid was propionic acid as the operation continued pentanoic acid isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid also appeared in phase p2 with the addition of scg bc the content of tvfa on days 51 54 was lower than that in the phase p1 this may be due to the adsorption of volatile acids by scg bc on days 68 101 tvfa in the reactor reached a good concentration status this phenomenon can be interpreted in two possible ways first the microbial community varied duo the introduction of scg bc and the methanogenic microorganisms which could degrade vfas enriched second scg bc acted as an electronic catheter to strengthen diet because biochar could skip the electron carriers such as hydrogen to transfer electrons in this way microbial degradation of vfa was accelerated 53 in general adding the scg bc not only buffered ph but also reduced the concentration of vfa in the reactor so these contributed to keeping the stable operation and enhancing the anmbr system production of biogas 3 3 membrane fouling variations of transmembrane pressure tmp during the operation processes are shown in supplementary material it can be seen that the growth rate of tmp decreased after adding scg bc to further explore the effect of scg bc on membrane fouling the membrane resistance was analyzed fig 5 the proportion of each form of membrane resistance in the total resistance was very similar in the two operation stages however their values clearly varied after adding scg bc excluding the inherent resistance of the membrane rm the total value of other membrane resistance fell by 12 33 the resistance of the cake layer organic and inorganic fouling rc rp org and rp inorg dropped by 6 50 28 41 and 58 61 respectively clearly the resistance of the cake layer was dominant in these two phases judging by the rc value shown in fig 5 the addition of scg bc reduced the formation of a cake layer compared with the cake layer that can be removed by physical cleaning irreversible fouling caused by membrane pores blockage including organic matter and inorganic matter blockage was more difficult to be removed by physical cleaning however the addition of scg bc reduced irreversible fouling by 34 69 the reason for the decline in irreversible fouling was that the simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation of biochar greatly reduced the organic and inorganic pollutants in the reactor such as eps and smp and diminished the blocking of membrane pores 54 the conclusion can be further confirmed by the sem results of the membrane surface see supplementary material there were many pollutants on the surface of both two membranes however the membrane module used in p2 was smoother than the membrane module used in p1 and the membrane pores were purer it strongly suggested that scg bc had a positive effect on reducing membrane fouling especially the irreversible fouling in membrane pores 3 4 smp and eps in mixed sludge fig 6 illustrated the smp and eps contents in the anmbr system in two phases it was well known that smp and eps were the main factors guiding membrane fouling smp was the main contaminant forming the gel layer due to adhering to the membrane surface thus reducing the permeation flux of the membrane 55 additionally the secreted eps was conducive to the condensation between microorganisms and as a result promoted the formation of cake layer 19 20 the concentrations of smp and eps decreased by 28 58 and 49 36 respectively the main reason for the synchronous decline of smp and eps may be due to simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation of scg bc in addition scg bc improved ph and alkalinity of anmbr suppling a suitable environment for microorganisms to function well it reduced the secretion of eps as a protective secretion and meanwhile less cell lysis led to less smp accumulation 56 57 the decline in smp and eps helped to increase membrane flux and reduce membrane pollution the smpps smppn epsps and epspn decreased by 52 33 15 99 31 05 and 56 31 respectively furthermore the ratio of protein to polysaccharide pn ps of smp and eps was also an important factor affecting membrane fouling as shown in fig 6 the pn ps ratio of smp increased significantly after the addition of scg bc the smp with high protein ratio would produce better settleability through better hydrophobicity which helped to control membrane fouling especially irreversible fouling in membrane pores the pn ps ratio of eps in anmbr with scg bc was lower than anmbr without scg bc the smaller protein content resulted in the weaker hydrophobicity and the smaller viscosity of the sludge thus delaying the formation of the cake layer 58 combined with the membrane fouling analysis in section 3 3 it can be observed that the membrane fouling degree was positively correlated with the variety of smp and eps content with the decrease of smp and eps after scg bc addition both cake layer and the pore blockage were indeed inhibited therefore adding scg bc to anmbr proved to be an effective method for curtailing membrane fouling and increasing membrane flux 3 5 microbial community diversity analysis the alpha diversity index is shown in the supplementary material compared with the seed sludge sample of sp1 showed lower community richness by chao1 and ace value which meant some microorganisms were eliminated during the ad process after adding scg bc poorer community richness can be found from diversity indices meanwhile the lower shannon index and higher simpson index revealed a lower evenness it was evident that scg bc affected the environment of microorganisms and led to some microorganisms becoming enriched as the dominant species in anmbr it was worth noting that microorganisms attached to scg bc highlighted less community richness and evenness compared with other samples the percentages of archaea increased from 4 47 seed sludge to 17 79 sp1 and 23 64 sp2 at the same time methanogens accounted for more than 99 90 of the total number of archaea which was 2 91 higher than that of seed sludge see supplementary material the proportion of methanogens increased during the ad process indicating that functional methanogens were enhanced after adding scg bc the methanogens further increased and thus improved methane production shown in fig 3 the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities at phylum is illustrated in fig 7a the relative abundance of microorganisms varied significantly with the operation of anmbr among them phylum thermotogota the dominant strain in high temperature anaerobic digestion decreased from 3 10 to 0 11 except some special cases were temporarily classified as phyla bathyarchaeota and verstrateearchaeota most of the known methanogens belonged to phyla euryarchaeota and halobacterota 59 60 the phylum euryarchaeota increased significantly from 1 97 in the seed sludge to 13 91 in sp1 meanwhile the phylum halobacterota increased 1 63 fold the growth of these two phyla means that methanogenic microorganisms adapted to the operating conditions of the reactor and possessed good methanogenic capacity the predominant phyla in sp1 were chloroflexi 15 99 firmicutes 14 32 euryarchaeota 13 91 bacteroidota 10 09 and desulfobacterota 8 04 after the addition of scg bc the predominant phyla were actinobacteriota 16 10 euryarchaeota 13 62 bacteroidota 12 95 halobacterota 9 85 and chloroflexi 9 01 therefore it can be stated that the relative abundance of fermentation microorganisms changed significantly firmicutes bacteroidota proteobacteria and actinobacteriota phyla were the main fermentation microorganisms in the hydrolysis and acidogensis stage which were responsible for converting organic matter into volatile fatty acids h2 and co2 61 63 the total relative abundances of these microbial phyla increased by 11 65 this meant that the efficiency of the hydrolysis acidification stage was greatly improved and the substrate was degraded more efficiently among them the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 5 17 in sp1 to 1 78 in sp2 this was because proteobacteria was the dominant strain under acidic conditions but adding scg bc led to the increase of ph this subsequently limited the growth of proteobacteria additionally proteobacteria was the main bacteria causing membrane fouling the decline in its relative abundance played a positive role in controlling membrane fouling 57 the relative abundance of firmicutes was 45 67 lower than that before adding scg bc which indicated that the addition of scg bc had certain restrictions on its growth this may be because the existence of scg bc greatly improved the growth environment of microorganisms in the bioreactor making firmicutes lose its competitive advantage of strong tolerance 64 in contrast the relative abundance of actinobacteriota increased by 3 22 times after adding scg bc and replaced firmicutes as the main phylum in the hydrolysis and acidification stage this was effective in alleviating membrane fouling further actinobacteriota can easily decompose polysaccharide and protein matrix in anaerobic environment which contributed to the reduction of smp and eps helping to improve the reactor s stability 65 66 the relative abundance of chloroflexi phylum decreased from 15 99 to 9 01 after the addition of scg bc as is well known chloroflexi was involved in the degradation of various macromolecular organics including proteins and carbohydrates mainly in smp and eps produced by autotrophic microorganisms 67 68 it further proved that adding scg bc contributed to controlling the accumulation of smp and eps as for methanogenic microorganisms euryarchaeota maintained a stable level before and after adding scg bc the relative abundance of halobacterota increased from 3 71 to 9 85 a large increase in the relative abundance of methanogenic microorganisms not only can accelerate the consumption of intermediate products but also heighten the yield of methane interestingly most of the phyla euryarchaeota were hydrogentrophic methanogens while phyla halobacterota were mostly acetoclastic methanogens such as genus methanosarcina and genus methanosaeta thus it can be seen that the addition of scg bc enhanced the acetoclastic methanogenic pathway in summary the community structure in hydrolysis stage was optimized by adding scg bc which increased the organic matter degradation rate reduced membrane fouling and enhanced the methanogenic efficiency the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities at genus was illustrated in fig 7b as can be seen that methanobacterium was a hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea which was a dominant strain in the whole operation stage therefore the existence of scg bc in the anmbr wielded no significant effect on its relative abundance 13 49 13 80 propionibacterium can decompose polysaccharide into short chain fatty acids the lack of propionibacterium would cause the accumulation of the matrix to a certain extent resulting in a decline in reactor performance and the deterioration of effluent quality 57 propionibacterium was not detected in sp1 while its relative abundance rose to 1 79 in sp2 in the meantime the relative abundance of norank f propionibacteriaceae a fermentation bacterium that could produce vfas from polysaccharide also increased from 1 25 to 11 64 after adding scg bc this change may improve the degradation efficiency of substrate and the content of vfas in anmbr however a decrease in vfas content was noted in phase p2 see fig 4 this was attributed to methanosarcina methanosarcina is a new dominant genus with a relative abundance of 8 03 after scg bc addition not only can it convert co2 into methane but also carry out acetolactic methanogenesis 69 the growth of methanosarcina effectively consumed vfa in the reactor it may be due to the relative abundance of norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 which can stimulate propionic acid production activity decreasing by 19 70 70 meanwhile the relative abundance of blvii28 wastewater sludge group and desulfovibrio reported as acetogenic bacteria increased from 3 50 to 5 43 and from 2 28 to 4 38 respectively this change indicated a higher proportion of acetic acid in vfa and a faster rate of methane production from acetic acid not only did propionic acid remain at a low level but acetic acid was consumed rapidly so tvfa showed a small concentration when an increase in methane production can be simultaneously realized interestingly the increase total methanogens resulted in the decrease of the co2 output in biogas this is because almost all methanogens can produce methane through co2 reduction thus resulting in the in situ upgrading of biogas 46 by analyzing the microbial community attached onto scg bc it was found that several microbial genera were enriched namely methanobacterium propionibacterium methanosaeta smithella and anaerolinea of these methanosaeta and methanosarcina were indicative microorganisms of diet 71 however methanosarcina was not enriched on scg bc while in suspended sludge of sp2 and its relative abundance was 5 46 times that of sp1 this showed that the addition of scg bc enriched methanosarcina in the reactor and strengthened the acetolactic methanogenic pathway the relative abundance of methanosaeta on scg bc was 1 32 which was 88 57 higher than that of sp1 meanwhile anaerolinea was enriched on scg bc relative abundance was 1 90 which was 5 13 times more that of sp1 and 1 74 times more than that of sp2 therefore the addition of biochar promoted the syntrophic metabolism of anaerolineaceae and methanosaeta through diet 72 however some studies documented those indicative microorganisms accounted for only a small part of the microbial community these indicative microorganisms participate in diet and other microorganisms were enriched on conductive carbon materials 71 for example desulfovibrio and blvii28 wastewater sludge group detected may also participate in diet because they exhibit a syntrophic growth relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic microorganisms such as methanobacterium 73 74 interestingly their relative abundance revealed a positive correlation and they were enriched after adding scg bc similarly smithella one of the main methanogenic symbionts had a positive correlation with the abundance of methanogens it was enriched on the surface of scg bc with the relative abundance increasing from 0 67 to 1 52 these outcomes suggested that diet may occur not only between anaerolinea and methanosaeta but also between hydrolytic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanobacterium methanolinea methanospirillum and methanoculleus especially methanobacterium growing on scg bc 75 as an electron conductor scg bc transferred electrons for syntrophic microorganisms which improved two things the degradation efficiency and increased the yield of biomethane 4 conclusions in this work the effect of adding scg bc to assess the performance and membrane fouling of an anmbr treating swine wastewater was systematically investigated results strongly suggested that scg bc played an active role in buffering ph and alleviating vfa accumulation in the anmbr system further the introduction of scg bc clearly enhanced cod removal and methane production in the anmbr system in the meantime the in situ upgrading of biogas was achieved due to the addition of scg bc the analysis of the microbial community found that fermentation microorganisms such as propionibacteriaceae were enriched thereby accelerating the degradation of substrates meanwhile methanosarcina also increased in suspended sludge and this in turn improved the utilization of vfas and strengthened the methanogenic capacity of the anmbr the amounts of smp and eps significantly decreased after scg bc addition while irreversible blocking of membrane pores was effectively alleviated finally the anmbr system with scg bc addition performed excellently as far as biogas production was concerned

12826,using anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs to treat swine wastewater is an effective method to recover bioenergy however due to the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen on microbial activities in swine wastewater some problems are evident such as low recovery efficiency and serious membrane fouling in this study biochar prepared from spent coffee grounds scg bc was added to anmbr to investigate its effect on the operation process results reported that methane yield rose from 0 227 lch4 g codremoved to 0 267 lch4 g codremoved along with a reduction in co2 being produced at 35 25 after adding scg bc it confirmed that in situ biogas upgrading was achieved as well the total volatile fatty acids declined to a low concentration of 194 87 51 82 mg l while ph remained steadily at 7 70 0 31 adding scg bc reduced irreversible membrane fouling by 34 69 microbial community analysis showed that scg bc increased the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea especially methanosarcina from 1 47 to 8 03 also anaerolinea and methanosaeta participating in direct interspecies electron transfer were enriched onto biochar they acted together to enhance the biogas production it can be concluded that anmbr with scg bc addition has good application prospects in recovering bioenergy from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

industry has become one of the fastest growing sectors in china with 47 3 of the world s swine production in 2020 mainly due to the rising demand by people for meat 1 at present large scale breeding is a crucial change in how the swine industry in china functions and single farms can now produce much more however the large scale swine factory has the problems of large wastewater discharge which comprises mixed solid and liquid many insect eggs and microorganisms and large amounts of heavy metals antibiotics and hormones 2 3 besides the swine wastewater produced contains a high level of organics nitrogen phosphorus potassium and other chemical pollutants 4 5 in general the traditional processes treating swine wastewater such as lagoon anaerobic digestion tank or three stage a o process can only remove less than 90 of chemical oxygen demand cod and the removal capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus is extremely limited subsequently this might cause a large amount of recyclable energy loss and long term environmental problems 6 in recent decades as environmental regulations become increasingly strict it is of importance to guarantee effluent quality of swine wastewater for a society much more concerned about what is happening to the environment moreover simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery has become a hotly debated topic the purpose is to drive the technical efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant as well as its profitability 7 anaerobic digestion ad consists of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis which is widely used to degrade swine wastewater and recover bioenergy presently including biogases such as h2s co2 h2 and ch4 and digestive fluid containing residual cod and other nutrients 8 11 however its poor efficiency in producing methane is a serious problem in practical application which is due to the slow growth of anaerobic microorganisms especially methanogens 12 13 microbial activity in the reactor is an important factor for the efficient operation of the anaerobic digestion process 14 15 anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr can effectively separate solid retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt through membrane modules and be applied to wastewater treatment in recent years in some cases anmbr achieved a high organic matter removal rate 81 95 and methane recovery rate 60 80 with a low sludge yield 0 05 0 22 gvss g codremoved 16 18 anmbrs can effectively improve the digestion performance but there are still some difficulties and challenges in them when treating swine wastewater on one hand the organic matter in swine wastewater is very high amount wise tang et al 18 found that the methanogenic capacity of anaerobic digestion becomes weak lower than 0 24 l g codremoved in swine wastewater with a high organic concentration 13 5 27 2 gcod l this is because the larger amount of organic matter in the substrate resulted in producing more volatile fatty acid which inhibited the growth of methanogens with the increase of organic load the contents of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers eps in the reactor also rose smp and eps are considered to be the main pollutants that trigger membrane fouling 20 on the other hand swine wastewater also contains a lot of ammonia nitrogen according to the research by yan et al 21 with the ammonia nitrogen shock of 4 5 gnh4 n l the methane production diminished rapidly which was 48 7 58 2 lower than before this was because methanogens are very sensitive to ammonia toxicity during methane production from intermediate products and their methanogenic performance decreases sharply with the impact of high concentration ammonia nitrogen in wastewater 22 23 some corresponding strategies were put forward such as controlling the anaerobic digestion temperature and prolonging hrt to overcome these problems the measures are widely used to enhance the performance of the reactor to a certain extent however they have the disadvantages of reducing the volume load and increasing operational costs 24 some researchers have focused on the use of various enhancers in anmbr including waste yeast iron calcium polyaluminum chloride zeolite and beans 25 30 among these materials iron and calcium can improve biogas production in the digestion process however they also introduce serious inorganic pollution problems beans damage the membrane module to some degree during fluidization 31 moreover these materials greatly increase the cost of reactors operations carbon based materials as anmbr performance enhancers play an important role in improving cod removal rate improving membrane flux and delaying the formation of filter cake layer these materials are also environmentally friendly as they are produced from agricultural wastes 32 sohn et al 20 found that the removal rates of cod and total organic carbon toc in anmbr significantly increased by 15 7 and 15 6 respectively after the addition of 5 g l powdered activated carbon pac a higher methane yield of about 3483 nmol l was achieved in the degradation of rapeseed oil while the methane yield of the control group without gac was lower than 3000 nmol l 33 by adding bamboo charcoal in anmbr to treat bamboo industrial wastewater the removal rate of cod increased by 5 as well as the content of smp and the resistance of filter cake layer abated 34 chen et al 35 found that the anmbr with the addition of biochar exhibited an enhancement of 4 6 in the cod removal rate when treating pharmaceutical wastewater it also improved the methane content in biogas production and effectively curtailed membrane fouling moreover some research showed that carbon based materials can strengthen the direct interspecies electron transfer diet process by enriching microbes that can directly produce or receive electrons such as geobacter metallireducens geobacter sulfurreducens and methanosaeta 36 thus the electron transfer of microorganisms does not need to pass through the intermediate media that easily cause energy loss such as conductive pili and hydrogen and greatly increases the conversion rate from organic matter to methane 24 this is also an important reason why carbon based materials can effectively promote anaerobic digestion and control membrane fouling of carbon based materials the specific surface area and conductivity of biochar are much lower than those of activated carbon yet it has been reported that biochar has the same ability to promote anaerobic digestion and enhance diet as activated carbon 37 although powdered activated carbon can promote anaerobic digestion it is a potential pollution source because the small particle pac increases the turbidity of the mixture it results in more membrane hole blockage and membrane surface abrasion 31 the specific gravity of granular activated carbon gac is higher than that of biochar which means that it takes more energy to mix gac with sludge into fluidization 38 furthermore terms of preparation cost biochar does not need an activation process which can undoubtedly reduce overheads 39 these are also the reasons why biochar has better prospects compared with activated carbon in the application of anaerobic digestion in conclusion biochar has good application potential as an enhancer in anmbr for treating swine wastewater it may affect methanogenic performance and membrane fouling by changing the microbial community structure and microbial interspecific cooperation these need to be further studied in this work spent coffee grounds biochar scg bc was introduced in anmbr acting as a performance enhancer the objectives were to i evaluate the digestion performance of anmbr system after the addition of spent coffee grounds biochar ii investigate membrane fouling behaviors and iii explore the impact of biochar on microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of biochar the spent coffee grounds were sourced from a local starbucks cafe in tianjin china first the collected waste coffee grounds were dried to constant weight in an oven at 105 c then the waste coffee residue was put into a muffle furnace to prepare biochar via pyrolyzation the spent coffee grounds were heated to 900 c at the rate of 5 c min and maintained for 2 h under oxygen limitation conditions 40 finally the produced biochar with a particle size of 0 15 0 178 mm was passed through an 80 mesh sieve to remove large particles and retained by a 100 mesh sieve to remove small particles the characteristics of scg bc are shown in supplementary material 2 2 anmbr set up and operation the anmbr system consists of anaerobic digestion reactor gas circulation equipment gas liquid replacement gas gathering device and membrane module shown in fig 1 the effective working volume of anmbr is 2 5 l and the total volume is 4 l the membrane information is shown in supplementary material the inoculated sludge of the reactor was taken from the sbr sludge of a sewage treatment plant in tianjin china the mlvss amount was 8 g l following the inoculated sludge was domesticated for two months to adapt to synthetic swine wastewater the experiments were divided into two stages the first was phase 1 p1 running for 50 days day 1 50 after acclimatization the second phase commenced on the 51st day when spent coffee grounds biochar was added into the reactor at the dose of 4 g l and the effect of biochar on anmbr was investigated this period p2 lasted from day 51 to 100 during the whole operation hrt was set at 8 3d the temperature was maintained at 35 1 c sludge was discharged regularly and the sludge residence time was 120d the biogas inside the reactor was extracted from the top gas space through the pump and transported to the aeration plate at the bottom of the reactor to activate the gas cycle the aeration process was intermittent for 1 min every 30 min with the flow of 1 l min the swine wastewater treated by the reactor was synthesized in the laboratory glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 were carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively the ratio of cod n p is 350 27 1 the swine wastewater quality indicators at different operation periods are shown in supplementary material to promote microbial growth and granular sludge formation 10 ml of trace element solution was added to each liter of synthetic swine wastewater the trace element solution is shown in supplementary material 2 3 analytical methods the cod concentration was analyzed using the rapid digestion spectrophotometric method shimadzu uv 2600 the concentrations of protein pn and polysaccharide ps were determined utilizing a modified folin ciocalteu colorimetry method 41 and phenol vitriolic acid colorimetry system 42 respectively volatile fatty acids vfa and biogas composition were measured by gas chromatograph perkin element gc590 usa and gas chromatograph perkin element gc500 usa respectively tmp was recorded by vacuum pressure gauge and paperless recorder the surface functional groups of biochar were detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is10 us the specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of carbon based materials were measured by brunauer emmett teller bet the morphology of the original and used biochar was analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem escan mira4 czech republic 2 4 membrane fouling resistance analysis in order to investigate the filtration characteristics of the membrane the membrane fouling resistance was measured by resistance in series model 20 1 j δp μr t where j is the permeate flux δp stands for the tmp and μ denotes the viscosity of the permeate the total resistance rt consists of four parts which are rc rm rp org and rp inorg it can be described as follows 2 r t r m r p org r p inorg r c where rm is the inherent resistance of the membrane rc rp org and rp inorg represent the resistance of the cake layer organic matter blockage and inorganic matter blockage respectively after the operation was completed the membrane module was taken out and rt with different flow in distilled water was measured next the membrane was rinsed with distilled water and wiped gently with a sponge to remove the cake layer the measured value at this stage was rm rp org rp inorg then the membrane was immersed in alkaline reagent 0 1 naclo solution for 24 h to remove any organic matter remaining in the membrane pore the measured value at this stage was rm rp inorg finally the membrane was soaked in an acidic reagent citric acid solution 10 g l for 4 h to remove inorganic pollutants from the membrane pores the measured value at his stage was rm 2 5 microbial analyses the four samples ss sp1 sp2 and bc for microbial analysis were the seed sludge the mixed sludge taken from the anmbr on day 45 and day 96 and the biomass taken from scg bc carriers on day 101 respectively the universal primer set 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 served to target both bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna v4 regions the axyprepdna gel extraction kit axygen usa helped to purify each sample the samples of this experiment were entrusted to shanghai majorbio shanghai china for high throughput sequencing data analysis was conducted on the majorbio bioinformatics date cloud platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal and biogas production fig 2 shows the cod removal efficiencies of anmbr system before and after the scg bc addition the cod removal rate during phase 1 without scg bc addition was 96 88 0 27 with the effluent concentration of 326 61 42 58 mg l in phase 2 after adding scg bc the cod removal rate was 98 85 0 13 when the effluent concentration was 109 73 35 43 mg l it can be seen that the effluent cod concentration diminished significantly after adding scg bc this be due to the abundant pore structure and large pore volume of scg bc see supplementary material which facilitated firstly the adsorption of undegraded organic matter and secondly the reduction of effluent cod concentration 43 44 meanwhile according to sem analysis of pure and used scg bc see supplementary material it can be observed that a large number of microorganisms grew and colonized onto the surface and pores of scg bc biochar provided a good environment for microorganisms in which to grow and raised microbial metabolic activity and its adaptability so this contributed to the cod removal rate 24 this also explained why the effluent from the anmbr in p2 maintained a low cod concentration the biogas production performance and ch4 yield of the anmbr system in p1 and p2 are illustrated in fig 3 before and after adding scg bc the ch4 production of anmbr was 593 10 33 75 ml d and 692 92 56 54 ml d while the co2 production was 89 26 8 96 ml d and 58 57 5 96 ml d respectively compared with p1 the ch4 production in p2 increased significantly by 16 83 while co2 production clearly decreased by 34 37 the methane yield reached 0 256 lch4 gcod in p2 which was 12 7 higher than 0 227 lch4 gcod in p1 the elevated ch4 production was due to the rapid decomposition of organic matter and more efficient microbial metabolism in the anaerobic digestion process enhanced by scg bc 21 as well the reduction of co2 production confirmed the in situ purification and upgrading of biogas due to the addition of scg bc the phenomenon can be explained in the following two ways on one hand biochar has a good adsorption effect on co2 and can reduce the loss of co2 45 on the other hand the ph value of anmbr modified by scg bc was slightly alkaline it may be because more inorganics were retained in the scg bc prepared at the higher pyrolysis temperature as a result base cation and carbonate in the scg bc increased while acidic functional groups decomposed 40 in this state co2 was transformed into bicarbonate carbonate and stored in the liquid phase which helped convert it into methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogens 46 specifically in the p2 phase it can be seen that ch4 and co2 production showed a gradual upward and downward trend respectively at the initial stage of scg bc addition after day 64 the methane production reached a relatively stable state with the ch4 and co2 production of 717 37 35 37 ml d and 57 79 5 67 ml d respectively compared to the scenario without scg bc they increased by 20 95 and decreased by 35 25 respectively this is close to the 17 6 increase in methane production mentioned in one recent study 47 the addition of scg bc led to more biogas production and enhanced biogas production structure this was because a large number of microorganisms adhere to the outer and inner surfaces of the biochar making better use of the adsorption capacity and conductivity 48 obviously the addition of scg bc had a good effect on improving the methanogenic capacity of the anmbr system the ch4 yield reached 0 269 lch4 gcod during the stable period of p2 which was increased by 18 50 compared with the yield of 0 227 lch4 gcod in phase p1 similarly kaur et al 49 found that wheat straw pellet biochar increased the ch4 yield in the digestion process by 24 however giwa et al 50 added biochar to the medium temperature continuous reactor and discovered the methane yield only increased by 5 these research studies revealed the different biogas production performance varied with the biochar properties and operation conditions of reactors in general when the yield of ch4 increases by more than 15 it means that biochar can significantly improve the energy recovery potential of anmbr 16 3 2 variations of ph and vfas vfas as important raw materials in methanogenic process affect the performance of ad the accumulation of vfas reduces the alkalinity and ph value thus inhibiting the methane production process 7 the ph and vfas of the anmbr system in the two phases are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 the ph values before and after scg bc addition were 6 76 0 28 and 7 70 0 31 respectively after scg bc addition the ph in phase 2 increased significantly and then stayed above 7 22 therefore scg bc helped restrict any decline in the ph level and improved the operational stability of the anmbr this was because scg bc possessed a large number of functional groups see supplementary material such as oh co carboxyl co and aromatic ch which could provide alkalinity 51 52 the total vfas tvfa concentrations before and after scg bc addition were 497 73 129 48 mg l and 194 87 51 82 mg l respectively the addition of scg bc greatly reduced the content of vfas in the anmbr at the beginning of p1 the main volatile acid was propionic acid as the operation continued pentanoic acid isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid also appeared in phase p2 with the addition of scg bc the content of tvfa on days 51 54 was lower than that in the phase p1 this may be due to the adsorption of volatile acids by scg bc on days 68 101 tvfa in the reactor reached a good concentration status this phenomenon can be interpreted in two possible ways first the microbial community varied duo the introduction of scg bc and the methanogenic microorganisms which could degrade vfas enriched second scg bc acted as an electronic catheter to strengthen diet because biochar could skip the electron carriers such as hydrogen to transfer electrons in this way microbial degradation of vfa was accelerated 53 in general adding the scg bc not only buffered ph but also reduced the concentration of vfa in the reactor so these contributed to keeping the stable operation and enhancing the anmbr system production of biogas 3 3 membrane fouling variations of transmembrane pressure tmp during the operation processes are shown in supplementary material it can be seen that the growth rate of tmp decreased after adding scg bc to further explore the effect of scg bc on membrane fouling the membrane resistance was analyzed fig 5 the proportion of each form of membrane resistance in the total resistance was very similar in the two operation stages however their values clearly varied after adding scg bc excluding the inherent resistance of the membrane rm the total value of other membrane resistance fell by 12 33 the resistance of the cake layer organic and inorganic fouling rc rp org and rp inorg dropped by 6 50 28 41 and 58 61 respectively clearly the resistance of the cake layer was dominant in these two phases judging by the rc value shown in fig 5 the addition of scg bc reduced the formation of a cake layer compared with the cake layer that can be removed by physical cleaning irreversible fouling caused by membrane pores blockage including organic matter and inorganic matter blockage was more difficult to be removed by physical cleaning however the addition of scg bc reduced irreversible fouling by 34 69 the reason for the decline in irreversible fouling was that the simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation of biochar greatly reduced the organic and inorganic pollutants in the reactor such as eps and smp and diminished the blocking of membrane pores 54 the conclusion can be further confirmed by the sem results of the membrane surface see supplementary material there were many pollutants on the surface of both two membranes however the membrane module used in p2 was smoother than the membrane module used in p1 and the membrane pores were purer it strongly suggested that scg bc had a positive effect on reducing membrane fouling especially the irreversible fouling in membrane pores 3 4 smp and eps in mixed sludge fig 6 illustrated the smp and eps contents in the anmbr system in two phases it was well known that smp and eps were the main factors guiding membrane fouling smp was the main contaminant forming the gel layer due to adhering to the membrane surface thus reducing the permeation flux of the membrane 55 additionally the secreted eps was conducive to the condensation between microorganisms and as a result promoted the formation of cake layer 19 20 the concentrations of smp and eps decreased by 28 58 and 49 36 respectively the main reason for the synchronous decline of smp and eps may be due to simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation of scg bc in addition scg bc improved ph and alkalinity of anmbr suppling a suitable environment for microorganisms to function well it reduced the secretion of eps as a protective secretion and meanwhile less cell lysis led to less smp accumulation 56 57 the decline in smp and eps helped to increase membrane flux and reduce membrane pollution the smpps smppn epsps and epspn decreased by 52 33 15 99 31 05 and 56 31 respectively furthermore the ratio of protein to polysaccharide pn ps of smp and eps was also an important factor affecting membrane fouling as shown in fig 6 the pn ps ratio of smp increased significantly after the addition of scg bc the smp with high protein ratio would produce better settleability through better hydrophobicity which helped to control membrane fouling especially irreversible fouling in membrane pores the pn ps ratio of eps in anmbr with scg bc was lower than anmbr without scg bc the smaller protein content resulted in the weaker hydrophobicity and the smaller viscosity of the sludge thus delaying the formation of the cake layer 58 combined with the membrane fouling analysis in section 3 3 it can be observed that the membrane fouling degree was positively correlated with the variety of smp and eps content with the decrease of smp and eps after scg bc addition both cake layer and the pore blockage were indeed inhibited therefore adding scg bc to anmbr proved to be an effective method for curtailing membrane fouling and increasing membrane flux 3 5 microbial community diversity analysis the alpha diversity index is shown in the supplementary material compared with the seed sludge sample of sp1 showed lower community richness by chao1 and ace value which meant some microorganisms were eliminated during the ad process after adding scg bc poorer community richness can be found from diversity indices meanwhile the lower shannon index and higher simpson index revealed a lower evenness it was evident that scg bc affected the environment of microorganisms and led to some microorganisms becoming enriched as the dominant species in anmbr it was worth noting that microorganisms attached to scg bc highlighted less community richness and evenness compared with other samples the percentages of archaea increased from 4 47 seed sludge to 17 79 sp1 and 23 64 sp2 at the same time methanogens accounted for more than 99 90 of the total number of archaea which was 2 91 higher than that of seed sludge see supplementary material the proportion of methanogens increased during the ad process indicating that functional methanogens were enhanced after adding scg bc the methanogens further increased and thus improved methane production shown in fig 3 the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities at phylum is illustrated in fig 7a the relative abundance of microorganisms varied significantly with the operation of anmbr among them phylum thermotogota the dominant strain in high temperature anaerobic digestion decreased from 3 10 to 0 11 except some special cases were temporarily classified as phyla bathyarchaeota and verstrateearchaeota most of the known methanogens belonged to phyla euryarchaeota and halobacterota 59 60 the phylum euryarchaeota increased significantly from 1 97 in the seed sludge to 13 91 in sp1 meanwhile the phylum halobacterota increased 1 63 fold the growth of these two phyla means that methanogenic microorganisms adapted to the operating conditions of the reactor and possessed good methanogenic capacity the predominant phyla in sp1 were chloroflexi 15 99 firmicutes 14 32 euryarchaeota 13 91 bacteroidota 10 09 and desulfobacterota 8 04 after the addition of scg bc the predominant phyla were actinobacteriota 16 10 euryarchaeota 13 62 bacteroidota 12 95 halobacterota 9 85 and chloroflexi 9 01 therefore it can be stated that the relative abundance of fermentation microorganisms changed significantly firmicutes bacteroidota proteobacteria and actinobacteriota phyla were the main fermentation microorganisms in the hydrolysis and acidogensis stage which were responsible for converting organic matter into volatile fatty acids h2 and co2 61 63 the total relative abundances of these microbial phyla increased by 11 65 this meant that the efficiency of the hydrolysis acidification stage was greatly improved and the substrate was degraded more efficiently among them the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 5 17 in sp1 to 1 78 in sp2 this was because proteobacteria was the dominant strain under acidic conditions but adding scg bc led to the increase of ph this subsequently limited the growth of proteobacteria additionally proteobacteria was the main bacteria causing membrane fouling the decline in its relative abundance played a positive role in controlling membrane fouling 57 the relative abundance of firmicutes was 45 67 lower than that before adding scg bc which indicated that the addition of scg bc had certain restrictions on its growth this may be because the existence of scg bc greatly improved the growth environment of microorganisms in the bioreactor making firmicutes lose its competitive advantage of strong tolerance 64 in contrast the relative abundance of actinobacteriota increased by 3 22 times after adding scg bc and replaced firmicutes as the main phylum in the hydrolysis and acidification stage this was effective in alleviating membrane fouling further actinobacteriota can easily decompose polysaccharide and protein matrix in anaerobic environment which contributed to the reduction of smp and eps helping to improve the reactor s stability 65 66 the relative abundance of chloroflexi phylum decreased from 15 99 to 9 01 after the addition of scg bc as is well known chloroflexi was involved in the degradation of various macromolecular organics including proteins and carbohydrates mainly in smp and eps produced by autotrophic microorganisms 67 68 it further proved that adding scg bc contributed to controlling the accumulation of smp and eps as for methanogenic microorganisms euryarchaeota maintained a stable level before and after adding scg bc the relative abundance of halobacterota increased from 3 71 to 9 85 a large increase in the relative abundance of methanogenic microorganisms not only can accelerate the consumption of intermediate products but also heighten the yield of methane interestingly most of the phyla euryarchaeota were hydrogentrophic methanogens while phyla halobacterota were mostly acetoclastic methanogens such as genus methanosarcina and genus methanosaeta thus it can be seen that the addition of scg bc enhanced the acetoclastic methanogenic pathway in summary the community structure in hydrolysis stage was optimized by adding scg bc which increased the organic matter degradation rate reduced membrane fouling and enhanced the methanogenic efficiency the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities at genus was illustrated in fig 7b as can be seen that methanobacterium was a hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea which was a dominant strain in the whole operation stage therefore the existence of scg bc in the anmbr wielded no significant effect on its relative abundance 13 49 13 80 propionibacterium can decompose polysaccharide into short chain fatty acids the lack of propionibacterium would cause the accumulation of the matrix to a certain extent resulting in a decline in reactor performance and the deterioration of effluent quality 57 propionibacterium was not detected in sp1 while its relative abundance rose to 1 79 in sp2 in the meantime the relative abundance of norank f propionibacteriaceae a fermentation bacterium that could produce vfas from polysaccharide also increased from 1 25 to 11 64 after adding scg bc this change may improve the degradation efficiency of substrate and the content of vfas in anmbr however a decrease in vfas content was noted in phase p2 see fig 4 this was attributed to methanosarcina methanosarcina is a new dominant genus with a relative abundance of 8 03 after scg bc addition not only can it convert co2 into methane but also carry out acetolactic methanogenesis 69 the growth of methanosarcina effectively consumed vfa in the reactor it may be due to the relative abundance of norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 which can stimulate propionic acid production activity decreasing by 19 70 70 meanwhile the relative abundance of blvii28 wastewater sludge group and desulfovibrio reported as acetogenic bacteria increased from 3 50 to 5 43 and from 2 28 to 4 38 respectively this change indicated a higher proportion of acetic acid in vfa and a faster rate of methane production from acetic acid not only did propionic acid remain at a low level but acetic acid was consumed rapidly so tvfa showed a small concentration when an increase in methane production can be simultaneously realized interestingly the increase total methanogens resulted in the decrease of the co2 output in biogas this is because almost all methanogens can produce methane through co2 reduction thus resulting in the in situ upgrading of biogas 46 by analyzing the microbial community attached onto scg bc it was found that several microbial genera were enriched namely methanobacterium propionibacterium methanosaeta smithella and anaerolinea of these methanosaeta and methanosarcina were indicative microorganisms of diet 71 however methanosarcina was not enriched on scg bc while in suspended sludge of sp2 and its relative abundance was 5 46 times that of sp1 this showed that the addition of scg bc enriched methanosarcina in the reactor and strengthened the acetolactic methanogenic pathway the relative abundance of methanosaeta on scg bc was 1 32 which was 88 57 higher than that of sp1 meanwhile anaerolinea was enriched on scg bc relative abundance was 1 90 which was 5 13 times more that of sp1 and 1 74 times more than that of sp2 therefore the addition of biochar promoted the syntrophic metabolism of anaerolineaceae and methanosaeta through diet 72 however some studies documented those indicative microorganisms accounted for only a small part of the microbial community these indicative microorganisms participate in diet and other microorganisms were enriched on conductive carbon materials 71 for example desulfovibrio and blvii28 wastewater sludge group detected may also participate in diet because they exhibit a syntrophic growth relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic microorganisms such as methanobacterium 73 74 interestingly their relative abundance revealed a positive correlation and they were enriched after adding scg bc similarly smithella one of the main methanogenic symbionts had a positive correlation with the abundance of methanogens it was enriched on the surface of scg bc with the relative abundance increasing from 0 67 to 1 52 these outcomes suggested that diet may occur not only between anaerolinea and methanosaeta but also between hydrolytic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanobacterium methanolinea methanospirillum and methanoculleus especially methanobacterium growing on scg bc 75 as an electron conductor scg bc transferred electrons for syntrophic microorganisms which improved two things the degradation efficiency and increased the yield of biomethane 4 conclusions in this work the effect of adding scg bc to assess the performance and membrane fouling of an anmbr treating swine wastewater was systematically investigated results strongly suggested that scg bc played an active role in buffering ph and alleviating vfa accumulation in the anmbr system further the introduction of scg bc clearly enhanced cod removal and methane production in the anmbr system in the meantime the in situ upgrading of biogas was achieved due to the addition of scg bc the analysis of the microbial community found that fermentation microorganisms such as propionibacteriaceae were enriched thereby accelerating the degradation of substrates meanwhile methanosarcina also increased in suspended sludge and this in turn improved the utilization of vfas and strengthened the methanogenic capacity of the anmbr the amounts of smp and eps significantly decreased after scg bc addition while irreversible blocking of membrane pores was effectively alleviated finally the anmbr system with scg bc addition performed excellently as far as biogas production was concerned and controlled membrane fouling when treating swine wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

12827,this study investigated the treatment of amaranth wastewater by ozone o3 in a rotating zigzag bed rzb in which a high gravity environment was created to intensify o3 mass transfer and enhance the degradation of amaranth the degradation effect of amaranth was evaluated in terms of decolorization rate of the wastewater and removal rate of chemical oxygen demand under various operating conditions intermediate products of amaranth degradation were also investigated to elucidate the degradation mechanisms of amaranth results show that the degradation efficiency generally increased with increase in initial ph rotational speed of rzb initial o3 concentration gas flow rate but declined with increase in both liquid flow rate and initial amaranth concentration the decolorization rate of the wastewater reached 92 8 within a liquid retention time of several seconds in the rzb suggesting that rzb can significantly enhance the mass transfer rate of o3 into liquid and thus improve the degradation efficiency of amaranth keywords ozone oxidation rotating zigzag bed amaranth degradation 1 introduction azo dyes are the most popular dye series and account for more than 50 of industrial dyes 1 amaranth as a traditional azo dye has been commonly used in textile leather plastics cosmetics and food industries 2 azo dyes are usually highly toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic and thus pose severe threats to human and environment 3 thus it is important to remove these dyes before the effluents are discharged into the environment however these dyes with their intricate aromatic structures are recalcitrant to degradation by the conventional biological processes in wastewater treatment 3 4 ozone o3 oxidation technology has been extensively employed in the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds in recent years due to the high redox potential of o3 2 08 v and its ability to mineralize organic matter into carbon dioxide and water with little secondary pollution 5 7 nonetheless o3 oxidation process is significantly affected by the o3 liquid mass transfer rate owing to the low solubility of o3 in water 8 consequently reactors with high gas liquid mass transfer efficiency are sought in o3 oxidation processes high gravity technology is an efficient process intensification technique in which a simulated high gravity environment much larger than the gravitational acceleration on the earth is created 9 this technology is achievable by devices reactors which can generate great centrifugal force to mimic the high gravity environment and consequently enhance mixing and mass transfer efficiency a rotating zigzag bed rzb is a typical high gravity device with a zigzag rotor comprising a stationary disk and a rotating disk which is fixed on a shell and a shaft respectively stationary and rotational baffle rings are mounted on the stationary and rotating disks respectively and nested with a certain gap to form a zigzag flow channel for gas and liquid 10 gas stream enters tangentially into the outer edge of the rotor from a gas inlet and flows in a spiral upward and downward motion under the action of pressure to the center of the rotor and finally exits the rotor from gas outlet at the same time liquid stream flowing into the center of the rotor via liquid inlet is ejected from a rotational baffle ring under the action of centrifugal force to a stationary baffle ring where the liquid is captured and redistributed before it flows to the next rotational baffle the process is repeated until the liquid is ejected out of the rotor and finally discharged from liquid outlet 11 12 inside the rotor the liquid stream undergoes dispersion impingement and redistribution and the gas liquid mass transfer efficiency in the reactor can be intensified due to a huge and continually renewed gas liquid interface in comparison with the traditional rotating packed bed an rzb has a simple structure with no need of labyrinth seal between the end cover and the rotor and thus easy realization of feeding on the end cover for complex systems consequently rzb has wide application prospect in gas liquid mass transfer processes 12 13 this study therefore employed an rzb to enhance o3 liquid mass transfer effect in o3 oxidation treatment of the amaranth wastewater and hence improve the degradation efficiency of amaranth the degradation efficiency of amaranth was assessed according to decolorization rate of the wastewater and removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod under different operating conditions such as rotational speed of the rzb initial ph of the wastewater initial o3 concentration initial amaranth concentration liquid flow rate and gas flow rate products of the degradation were also analyzed to further ascertain the degradation extent of amaranth as well as to predict its possible degradation pathway 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and procedure amaranth purity 85 was supplied by shanghai mclean biochemical technology co ltd while both h2so4 ar and naoh ar were supplied by beijing chemical works china simulated amaranth wastewater was prepared by dissolving amaranth into deionized water followed by adjusting its ph to a preset value with 1 mol l naoh or 1 mol l h2so4 the ph was detected with a phsj 3f ph meter shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china the rzb used in this study has a two stage structure with a bottom rotor and a top rotor such a design aims to apply the rzb to complex reactions with two inlet liquid streams the specifications of the rzb are given in table 1 the experimental set up is demonstrated in fig 1 only the bottom rotor of the rzb was employed in the treatment of the amaranth wastewater by o3 oxidation the amaranth wastewater was pumped into the center of the bottom rotor of the rzb via the middle liquid inlet using a peristaltic pump inside the rotor the amaranth wastewater flowed outwards through the rotational and stationary baffles alternately meanwhile the o3 gas generated from o2 by a 3s a10 ozone generator tonglin high tech technology co ltd china was introduced into the outer edge of the bottom rotor of the rzb via the gas inlet as soon as the initial o3 concentration in the gas flow reached the desired level the gas stream then flowed inwards under the action of pressure into the center of the bottom rotor and subsequently flowed through the top rotor from the outer edge to the center the gas and liquid flows made a counter current contact in the bottom rotor bringing about the absorption of o3 into the liquid stream and degradation of amaranth by o3 finally the liquid and gas flows exited the reactor from the liquid and gas outlets respectively once a stable o3 concentration in the gas flow at the gas outlet was attained the liquid flow at the liquid outlet was sampled and analyzed immediately to determine amaranth concentration and cod 2 2 analytical methods the concentration of amaranth in the wastewater was determined by a dr6000 uv vis spectrophotometer hach corp usa at the wavelength of 521 nm and the decolorization rate of the wastewater was calculated with the amaranth concentrations before and after the wastewater was treated the wastewater cod was measured by a 5b 3a cod detector alliance technology co ltd china the intermediates of amaranth degradation were determined by the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms xevo g2 qtof waters usa the decolorization rate and cod removal rate are defined by the following eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d a ω 0 ω 1 ω 0 100 2 r cod cod 0 cod 1 cod 0 100 where d a represents the decolorization rate of the amaranth wastewater and ω 0 ω 1 represent the initial and final amaranth concentrations mg l respectively r cod represents the cod removal rate while cod 0 and cod 1 represent the initial and final cod mg l of the amaranth wastewater before and after treatment respectively the initial cod of the amaranth wastewater was 232 343 465 553 636 mg l at initial amaranth concentration of 200 300 400 500 600 mg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of rotational speed the influence of rotational speed of the rzb on degradation efficiency of amaranth is presented in fig 2 it can be seen that decolorization and cod removal rates increased from 58 7 and 2 38 to 92 8 and 14 6 respectively with a rising rotational speed from 200 to 1200 rpm a higher rotational speed imposed stronger shear force on the wastewater and thus split the wastewater into thinner films and smaller droplets resulting in faster renewal rate of gas liquid interface and larger gas liquid interfacial area these factors facilitated o3 mass transfer into the amaranth wastewater and thus brought about an increase in the degradation efficiency the results agree with the work of yang 10 who has also reported that higher rotational speed of rzb can greatly enhance gas liquid mass transfer efficiency due to the intensification of gas liquid mass transfer a high decolorization rate of 92 8 was achieved within several seconds of liquid retention time in the rzb which is much shorter than the time required for dye wastewater treatment in conventional facilities or apparatuses suggesting that rzb is an efficient device for fast decolorization of dye wastewater 3 2 effect of initial ph fig 3 presents the influence of initial ph on degradation efficiency of amaranth it is evident that both decolorization and cod removal rates gradually increased from 87 1 and 8 4 to 90 5 and 12 1 with a rising initial ph from 3 to 9 respectively and then sharply increased to 99 1 and 20 respectively when the initial ph further rose to 11 higher ph signifies more oh in the amaranth wastewater a factor that favors o3 decomposition to produce more oh 14 therefore the reaction rate between o3 and amaranth was elevated bringing on a higher degradation efficiency the sharp rise in both decolorization and cod removal rates at initial ph over 9 suggested that the production efficiency of oh increased greatly under such conditions thereby leading to a significantly enhanced treatment effect of the wastewater similar phenomena have also been observed by other researchers 15 3 3 effect of initial o3 concentration fig 4 reveals the effect of initial o3 concentration on degradation efficiency of amaranth both decolorization and cod removal rates steadily increased from 57 1 and 4 5 to 98 7 and 23 6 respectively with a rising initial o3 concentration from 10 to 40 mg l and afterwards remained almost constant with a further rise in initial o3 concentration as the o3 oxidation process is controlled by the o3 mass transfer rate into liquid higher inlet o3 concentration is supposed to bring about a larger driving force and hence enhance the mass transfer rate of o3 into the liquid phase as a result the reaction rate between o3 and amaranth was elevated bringing about a higher degradation efficiency when the inlet o3 concentration exceeded 40 mg l o3 absorption efficiency into the liquid stream reached the maximum and hence the observed degradation efficiency of amaranth kept almost unchanged 3 4 effect of initial amaranth concentration fig 5 demonstrates the effect of initial amaranth concentration on degradation efficiency of amaranth both decolorization and cod removal rates decreased from 99 3 and 22 8 to 45 1 and 7 3 with a rising initial amaranth concentration from 200 to 600 mg l respectively these results can be explained as follows because initial o3 concentration maintained at 30 mg l during this run of experiments the amount of oh in the wastewater produced by the decomposition of o3 remained fairly constant with the variation of the initial amaranth concentration although the absolute amount of degradation of amaranth increased the proportion of its degradation to the total amount decreased resulting in the decline in degradation efficiency of amaranth also the amount of intermediates by amaranth degradation in the wastewater augmented accordingly with increment in initial amaranth concentration thereby bringing on more intense competition for o3 and oh between the intermediates and amaranth which made the decolorization and cod removal rates decrease 3 5 effect of liquid flow rate the influence of liquid flow rate on degradation efficiency of amaranth is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that both decolorization and cod removal rates declined from 99 3 and 15 9 to 65 5 and 2 7 respectively with a rising liquid flow rate from 0 05 to 0 4 l min an elevation in liquid flow rate brought about rise in liquid holdup and gas liquid interfacial area which was favorable for o3 absorption even so the ratio of the absorbed o3 to amaranth still declined suggesting a decreasing oxidant supply for per unit of amaranth with increasing liquid flow rate thus leading to the decrease in both decolorization and cod removal rates 3 6 effect of gas flow rate fig 7 shows the influence of gas flow rate on degradation efficiency of amaranth both decolorization and cod removal rates increased from 84 4 and 13 9 to 92 95 and 17 9 respectively with a rising gas flow rate from 0 5 to 1 5 l min greater gas flow rate meant that more o3 was introduced into the reactor per unit time and thus absorbed by per unit liquid therefore at a fixed liquid flow rate there was increased amount of amaranth degraded by o3 per unit time bringing on higher degradation efficiency of amaranth and cod 3 7 degradation mechanism of amaranth 3 7 1 uv vis absorption spectrum analysis the simulated amaranth wastewater before and after o3 oxidation treatment was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer with wavelength from 200 to 800 nm the scanned results are shown in fig 8 the absorption peak intensity of amaranth wastewater after treatment decreased significantly at 521 nm it also decreased at both 280 and 330 nm while only slightly declined at 217 and 237 nm the characteristic absorption peak of azo bond which is the main chromophoric group of amaranth is at 521 nm while the characteristic peaks of naphthalene ring are at both 280 and 330 nm 16 the change in uv vis absorption spectra of amaranth wastewater before and after treatment indicates that o3 and oh attacked the azo bond of amaranth first leading to the breaking of n n and hence decolorization of the wastewater the structure of naphthalene ring was then attacked resulting in production of intermediates which were further degraded into smaller molecular substances and finally into co2 and h2o in the treatment of the amaranth wastewater the oxidizing agent might not be sufficient to completely degrade the intermediates and hence the observed higher decolorization rate as compared to cod removal rate 3 7 2 degradation mechanism and pathway the main intermediates of amaranth degradation by o3 oxidation process were determined by the lc ms characterization and are shown in table 2 the lc ms chart of amaranth degradation intermediates and their presumed molecular structures are present in fig 9 the chromophoric group n n was attacked by o3 and oh leading to decolorization of the wastewater the resulting aromatic amine compounds degraded into phenolic compounds which further broke down into short chain carboxylic acids based on the reported degradation mechanism and pathway of amaranth and other compounds in the literature 16 22 a possible degradation pathway of amaranth in this work is proposed and presented in fig 10 firstly the azo bond of amaranth was destroyed either directly by o3 or indirectly by oh to break down into two aromatic amines next the sulfonic acid groups and amino groups were eliminated and oh was inserted to form naphthalenediol which decomposed further through a series of reactions to form benzoic acid addition of oh into the benzoic acid led to formation of phenol and p phenol further oxidation converted p phenol into fumaric acid and the reaction continued to form fatty acid propionic acid which underwent further oxidation and degradation to finally form carbon dioxide and water 4 conclusions this study employed the o3 oxidation process in an rzb to degrade amaranth in wastewater under various process conditions results show that the degradation efficiency of amaranth generally increased with increase in initial o3 concentration initial ph rotational speed of rzb gas flow rate but declined with increase in both liquid flow rate and initial amaranth concentration intermediate products of the degradation were analyzed and the degradation mechanism as well as a possible degradation pathway was explored a decolorization rate of 92 8 was achieved within several seconds of liquid retention time in the rzb because rzb can significantly enhance the mass transfer rate of o3 into liquid and improve the degradation efficiency of amaranth it therefore provides a feasible process intensification technology for o3 oxidation treatment of amaranth wastewater and possibly other recalcitrant organic pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this work was supported by the national

12827,this study investigated the treatment of amaranth wastewater by ozone o3 in a rotating zigzag bed rzb in which a high gravity environment was created to intensify o3 mass transfer and enhance the degradation of amaranth the degradation effect of amaranth was evaluated in terms of decolorization rate of the wastewater and removal rate of chemical oxygen demand under various operating conditions intermediate products of amaranth degradation were also investigated to elucidate the degradation mechanisms of amaranth results show that the degradation efficiency generally increased with increase in initial ph rotational speed of rzb initial o3 concentration gas flow rate but declined with increase in both liquid flow rate and initial amaranth concentration the decolorization

the degradation efficiency of amaranth keywords ozone oxidation rotating zigzag bed amaranth degradation 1 introduction azo dyes are the most popular dye series and account for more than 50 of industrial dyes 1 amaranth as a traditional azo dye has been commonly used in textile leather plastics cosmetics and food industries 2 azo dyes are usually highly toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic and thus pose severe threats to human and environment 3 thus it is important to remove these dyes before the effluents are discharged into the environment however these dyes with their intricate aromatic

12828,the present review analyzed papers using adsorption that explore the removal of paraquat herbicide from aqueous effluents contamination and toxicology aspects of the paraquat are tackled as well analysis regarding the effects of process variables and textural proprieties on the paraquat adsorption is presented the reported works found that the best adsorbent was those of silicate and carbon nature which presented adsorption capacities above 400 mg g 1 unfortunately most works do not report the paraquat solution s ph or perform adsorption conditions optimization regarding the adsorption kinetics it was found that the pseudo second order is the proper model to represent several paraquat systems however mass transfer investigations are not presented classical isotherm models are the most employed such as langmuir and freundlich in addition the paraquat adsorption systems are of any thermic nature endothermic exothermic with the paraquat molecules binding due to physisorption last common mistakes in the reports knowledge gaps and future perspectives are discussed focusing on improving the adsorption works graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption paraquat ecotoxicology contamination data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is an irreplaceable and increasingly limited human resource drinking water essential for life is available in surface and underground waters the protection of these reservoirs is one of the greatest current challenges facing humanity 1 modern agriculture focused on super harvests has intensified the use of pesticides in recent years more than 1000 pesticides are currently aimed at different purposes 2 these products can easily contaminate groundwater by infiltration and flow without even accumulating in the soil through precipitation and irrigation often intensified by herbicide characteristics such as high water solubility and soil mobility these products can easily contaminate groundwater by infiltration and flow without even accumulating in the soil 3 the herbicide paraquat 1 1 dimethyl 4 4 bipyridyl dichloride became popular due to its high efficiency low cost and non selectivity in combating broadleaf weeds in the pre planting of tobacco crops cotton and rice 4 5 in addition it started to replace pesticides that became inefficient due to the resistance obtained by the plants caused mainly by the high use as is the case of glyphosate 6 7 paraquat fig 1 is 28 times more toxic than glyphosate 8 it is a highly water soluble polar compound with low vapor pressure and high binding capacity 9 10 paraquat has high adsorption in different soils so most of the compost becomes biologically unavailable recent studies have shown a greater affinity for clay particles than organic matter 11 in these cases the positively charged paraquat attracts the negative mineral charges whereas in the case of organic matter environmental factors such as ionic strength and solution ph influence these interactions in recent years paraquat has been detected in surface groundwater and wastewater worldwide 12 15 for humans it has high acute toxicity at an oral ld50 4 mg kg 1 and can easily penetrate the skin 16 it is considered highly toxic even at low concentrations 17 18 in the literature there are reports of deaths caused by poisoning via ingestion or skin exposure 19 20 paraquat has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that lead to parkinson s disease 21 23 it is also being reported that the paraquat affects the reactive oxygen species ros in the brain and the dysregulates biosynthesis of the cholesterol in human brains 24 25 in the case of mammals such as mice it also has been found that the paraquat affects the α synuclein an essential protein in brain function 26 also being able to cause organ damage in the lungs and kidneys 20 paraquat is currently banned in 50 countries including all of europe however most developing countries have not set restrictions on its use 15 27 28 for example in brazil the health surveillance agency anvisa banned its risk due to the high mutagenic power and studies related to parkinson s 29 in taiwan due to its intensive use mainly in rice fields the maximum level of the contaminant was limited to 0 01 mg l 1 30 therefore paraquat contamination in water is one of the global environmental issues facing which needs an immediate solution 31 the scientific community has been dedicating itself to improving new technologies to remove paraquat from the environment in the past few years in the literature it is possible to observe various methods such as electrochemical degradation 32 photocatalysis 33 separation using special membranes 34 35 biological degradation 36 37 and adsorption 38 39 from all those techniques there are several positive and negative points that the adsorption tends to overcome especially when aligned with waste material and the high efficiency nature of the process 40 due to this in recent years several adsorbents have been developed and applied in the removal of paraquat from aqueous media 1 41 42 these authors review did not find review papers regarding the application of adsorption in the removal of paraquat from the environment therefore it is observed that the great importance of this review added to the problem of paraquat and the current and future environmental challenges first through the extensive published database the detection of the presence of pesticides in different environments was explored secondly several studies analyzed the damage caused to the environment animals and humans by the presence of paraquat thirdly the adsorbents used for the removal of paraquat were thoroughly characterized fourthly the kinetic and isotherms of adsorption and the thermodynamic parameters of adsorption were explored allowing to establish the mechanism of paraquat adsorption last but not least knowledge gaps and future perspectives in uptaken of paraquat were given 2 detection of paraquat in the environmental samples the first application of the paraquat occurred decades ago in malaysia in rubber tree plantations since then its use has spread to different species plantations worldwide 43 44 the paraquat contaminates the water resources globally through easy vertical percolation in the soil 45 in spain it was detected in irrigation canals rivers and lakes samples at a concentration of 3 95 μg l 1 12 in thailand concentrations between 1 5 and 18 9 μg l 1 and 9 3 and 87 μg l 1 were detected in groundwater and surface water respectively 46 tsai lai 47 found that the maximum paraquat concentration in untreated wastewater was about 40 mg l 1 155 5 μmol l 1 further information regarding the paraquat concentration in water sources is scarce in the literature this lack of information may be related to the banning of paraquat in the european countries and china being noteworthy that these regions are major paraquat exporters 48 49 however despite the lack of information it is possible to expect the presence of paraquat worldwide due to the following facts i still high employed across several countries ii several countries tend to import above 5 tonnes of banned pesticides including paraquat fig 2 for example the united states and brazil tend to import 10 to 26 thousand tons annually from europe 49 50 therefore many other studies still need to be conducted to detect the contaminant s presence and mitigate these contaminated areas because it is very low concentrations detection is difficult so in recent years several sensors have been developed mainly aimed at detecting the paraquat zhang et al 51 developed a sensor based on tripodal pillar sand laghrib et al 52 verified the efficiency of electrochemical sensors for detecting paraquat in food samples tagne et al 53 developed an electroanalytical method with rice husk activated charcoal to detect the herbicide botta et al 54 used structured 3d laser engravings decorated with gold nanoparticle sers chips for ambient detection du et al 55 used a fluorescent sensor based on nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots zhang et al 56 successfully used a glassy carbon electrode decorated with nitrogen doped carbon dots coated with pillararene charoenkitamorn et al 57 developed a new gel based electrolyte raymundo pereira et al 58 and majdinasab et al 59 applied non enzymatic sensors incorporated in flexible and wearable gloves stavra et al 60 successfully determined several pesticides with a white light reflectance spectroscopy biosensor du wang 61 used nanomaterials sensors with the application of electrochemical techniques gao and collaborators 62 have employed the raman scattering with a microdroplet sensor to detect paraquat concentrations low as 2 10 9 m although detection technologies have advanced public agencies and specific environmental legislation still lack the commitment to detect and remediation environments contaminated with pesticides for example in taiwan the maximum paraquat contaminant level mcl was set at 0 01 mg l 1 0 039 μmol l 1 in addition the paraquat residue limits in food were recently changed to 0 2 mg kg 0 78 μmol l 1 30 3 toxicology of paraquat due to concern about the damage caused by paraquat in living organisms several studies mainly in the last 5 years were developed and several damages were found by the presence of paraquat in the organism fig 3 studies report deaths from ingestion and long term exposure 16 20 in humans the herbicide showed high toxicity in the liver brain kidneys heart adrenal glands and muscles 44 63 64 several studies have revealed that even at low levels of concentration paraquat causes severe lung damage transforming oxygen into free radicals and causing respiratory failure and death 44 64 66 in the literature it is possible to find 100 studies relating the presence of paraquat in the body to the development of parkinson s disease 22 67 71 chao fang 72 reported that a patient hospitalized for ingestion of paraquat had a pulmonary embolism fallahi dalfardi 73 reported early pulmonary fibrosis after accidental herbicide ingestion in a 19 year old girl there are few papers dealing with paraquat treatment in the human body paraquat extracorporeal removal could be the only patient s hope of remaining alive 74 the removal treatment combines hemoperfusion with an activated charcoal cartridge and flushing the digestion system after placing fuller s earth in the patient s stomach to capture unabsorbed paraquat the adsorption capacities of fuller s earth and activated carbon are about 60 fuller s earth and 100 mg g 1 activate carbon 75 and are not effective for urgent clinical treatment of paraquat poisoned patients the reported paraquat effects are summarized in fig 3 it can cause serious damage to animals 76 77 and plants 78 paraquat increased norepinephrine utilization in female mice s hippocampus and prefrontal cortex 79 80 the study by dwyer et al 81 revealed the induction of nigrostriatal pathology inflammatory changes and stress and trophic effects naspolini et al 82 reported glutamate neurotoxicity in rats amin et al 83 confirmed the occurrence of systemic and pulmonary inflammation in rats after inhalation for 16 days hamdaoui et al 84 reported changes in gene expression in the brain of pregnant mice offspring zhang et al 85 and wijerathna et al 86 found acute lung injury in rats regulating the polarization of alveolar macrophages through glycolysis li et al 87 confirmed that the herbicide even at low concentrations blocks the development of leydig cells at puberty disrupting the production of the hormone testosterone and toxicity in sh sy5y cells and the striatum of rats 88 89 and pancreatic lesions 90 91 ma et al 92 observed that the exposures caused metabolic destabilization in the liver of carp provoking hepatotoxicity soni et al 93 observed the blocking of the reproductive functions of japanese quails in rats oxidative stress complex inflammation behavioral changes and cortical mitochondrial dysfunction were observed 94 bora et al 95 verified the effect on c elegans and found that it affects lifespan and reproduction throughout generation through mitochondrial interruption while wang et al 96 observed that paraquat affects mitochondrial bioenergetics dopaminergic system expression and locomotor activity in zebrafish however there are no obvious therapeutic effects and the key to current treatment still needs to be discussed and improved in addition there is no significant advance for patients with advanced poisoning overall paraquat research has progressed but the toxic mechanism and treatment of paraquat toxicity still need further exploration 97 4 paraquat adsorption and main variables in this topic and forward the major variables that influence the adsorption capacity of paraquat are analyzed all the parameters discussed are based on the survey of several scientific reports related to the adsorption of paraquat the information regarding the experimental conditions temperature adsorbent dosage ph initial paraquat concentration adsorbent characteristics and adsorption capacity are listed in table 1 4 1 solution initial ph one of the main aspects of the adsorption is the ph since it can control the degree of ionization of the adsorbate and the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent 125 a summary of the important aspects of the reported ph works is shown in fig 4 it was found that 35 3 of the works do not report the initial ph of the solution this is a major drawback since this limits the reproducibility further application and interpretation of the adsorption system besides that the initial ph values ranged from 6 to 11 with the neutral values having 11 8 of the reported works iglesias et al 100 reported that the maximum adsorption capacity at ph 10 5 values above the phpzc of the goethite adsorbent phpzc 9 5 when the initial ph of the paraquat solution is lower than the phpzc of the adsorbent the surface will be positively charged so no attraction is expected as at a ph higher than the phpzc the surface is negatively charged and electrostatic attraction occurs with the charged pesticide centers positively 1 li et al 99 found that adsorption increased with increasing ph to 6 however from 10 onwards the adsorption capacity worsened the authors explain that the increase of carbonyl groups on the surface of the adsorbent carbon spheres caused dissociation and cationic targets could easily combine with the adsorbent similar behavior was obtained by huang et al 16 using oxidized cellulose nanofibers as an adsorbent the adsorbate and adsorbent interactions are better explained in section 4 5 the adsorption mechanism 4 2 adsorbent dosage effect in conjunction with the solution ph the dosage is another important factor the paraquat adsorption capacity regarding the dosage employed is depicted in fig 5 the first aspect is that the adsorption capacity does not show a specific trend with the dosage presenting high adsorption capacity at lower and higher dosage values in general lower dosages are expected to show higher adsorption capacity the adsorption tends to decrease for higher dosages this effect is directly related to the available sites for the adsorbate molecules 126 127 in these cases the lack of trend is related to two different aspects i the adsorbent employed in the paraquat removal have different origins being from silicates to carbonaceous groups and ii 83 3 of the reported works did not perform dosage test or optimization this leads to overdosage adsorbent waste and underperformance of the adsorbents due to the possible agglomeration of the molecules 128 4 3 kinetic parameters and models the main variables of the adsorption kinetics are the initial concentration and the time to reach the equilibrium these variables directly affect the adsorption process cost efficiency 129 the reports on the adsorption of paraquat cover a wide spectrum of types of materials and their adsorption conditions are very different ranging from initial concentrations from 1 to 500 mg l 1 according to table 2 therefore the use of a variable effective time teff min was proposed to condense the effects of the variables as homogeneously as possible thus allowing a fairer comparison the effective time is calculated as follows 1 t eff t e q e c 0 d 0 where te is the time to achieve the equilibrium min qe is the paraquat adsorption capacity in equilibrium relative to the initial concentration mg g 1 c0 is the highest initial paraquat concentration employed in the report mg l 1 d0 is the adsorbent dosage employed the estimated effective time for the reported works is presented in table 2 and fig 6 from the adsorption capacities and the effective times the data presented by shetty et al 111 huang et al 16 tsai et al 30 and zbair et al 114 showed the better performance with the highest adsorption capacities and lowest effective times meaning that these materials possess overall better performance being able to adsorb a decent paraquat quantity in a short period besides that the effective time shows indicate another trend where the adsorption of paraquat tends to be high with carbon based materials and lower with silica ones unfortunately most of these articles do not report the phpzc and the solution ph mentioned previously in the previous section 4 47 106 this makes it impossible to specify beyond the basic atom group differences besides that it should be noted that the adsorbent physical proprieties such as the total pore volume average pore diameter and specific surface area are not considered in calculating the effective time however the textural proprieties play an important role during the adsorption process since it interferes directly with the boundary layer surface and pore diffusion 132 133 concerning the kinetic models employed it was found that the pseudo second order model pso is the most suitable model for describing the adsorption of paraquat in several systems presenting high correlation coefficients and good statistical indicators 1 99 106 134 the studies conducted by tsai lai 47 kamble et al 109 and li et al 42 attribute that due to the kinetic model the mechanism that adsorption occurred through chemisorption however none of the studies were presented thermodynamic studies and proposal of reaction mechanism therefore it cannot be affirmed that such interaction happened this subject will be better addressed and discussed in section 4 5 respectively 4 4 temperature effect isotherm models and thermodynamics in addition to the other mentioned parameters the temperature is important as the ph during the adsorption process as the temperature can affect several of the adsorbate thermodynamic proprieties e g solubility activity and can also affect the adsorbent structure causing expansions that lead to more sites been available 135 besides that the adsorption equilibrium is relevant to the adsorption process it is possible to define whether the interactions occur in mono or multilayers through the isotherm models 136 furthermore the parameters from the isotherm models are employed to estimate thermodynamic parameters which are important aspects that indicate the spontaneity of the process and the thermal nature finally the information acquired using equilibrium isotherm helps scale the adsorption processes at the industrial scale 137 according to fig 7a most studies did not analyze the temperature variation in the adsorption process 1 41 42 107 109 performed at room temperature mostly close to 298 k or 303 k furthermore fig 7b shows that several adsorbents can remove paraquat at different temperatures indicating that temperature can enhance or diminish the overall adsorption capacity dehgani et al 98 and brigante and schulz 10 reported that the temperature enhances the adsorption capacity when employing bentonite modified with zero valent iron and mesoporous silica modified with titania respectively however other authors reported that the temperature caused a decrease in the adsorption capacity in different systems 16 30 104 105 134 besides the work reported by zbair et al 115 which employed carbonated jujube seeds is noteworthy these other works investigated the temperature effect in the paraquat adsorption employed silica based materials with the main difference being the presence of ferrous groups titanium oxide aluminum oxide or the silica quantities 16 30 104 105 this means that even small changes to similar materials cause different outcomes in the adsorption capacity the shape of the isotherm and even thermodynamic parameters regarding the equilibrium models employed for describing the adsorption isotherms it was found that 87 1 of the works showed that the langmuir model is suitable for explaining the paraquat uptake on different adsorbent materials based on these results it could be inferred that paraquat monolayers are adsorbed on the adsorbent s surface 41 98 109 on the other hand studies were reported by tongur ayranci 1 and tsai hsien 30 which obtained a better fit to the equilibrium data following the freundlich isotherm attributed to the paraquat uptake taking place in heterogeneous surfaces however it should be highlighted that most of these papers used linearized equations that are limited to these two models only limiting the correct interpretation of the equilibrium data it is possible to determine whether the adsorption process is spontaneous or not 138 through thermodynamic parameters the determination of the change in standard gibbs free energy δg0 kj mol 1 standard entropy change δs0 kj mol 1 k 1 and standard enthalpy change δh0 kj mol 1 are important variables to predict the performance and the adsorption mechanism being essential for the characterization and optimization of the process 139 studies involving the adsorption of paraquat and that have determined thermodynamic parameters are rarely reported in the literature from the 25 research papers found only 5 contain thermodynamic estimations furthermore from a brief evaluation of these works it was found that the methodology employed to determine the thermodynamic parameters differed or was outdated making it impossible to compare the reported data effectively therefore besides the work reported by rasaie et al 105 which agrees with the modern methodology 135 the thermodynamic parameters of the other reported works have been recalculated and are shown in fig 8 the first aspect to be observed is that all the adsorbents employed have a spontaneous nature for all the temperatures studied this means that the δg0 0 as the temperature of the system changes 140 in most cases the spontaneity of the process tends to increase with the temperature increase which indicates that the nature of the process is endothermic concerning δh it was found that most of the work showed an endothermic nature indicating that the increase of the system temperature enhances the paraquat adsorption with the increasing temperature the increased adsorption capacity is directly related to the adsorbate s increased diffusion in the adsorbent material s pores on the other hand there are reports of exothermic systems in which in this case the temperature can cause another side effect such as excess energy leading to the molecules being easily detached from the surface last most of the studies showed a positive standard entropy change indicating high affinity between the adsorbate with the adsorbent with the increase of solid solution randomness affinity with a characteristic increase in solid solution interface randomness 141 4 5 adsorption mechanism the charge present on the molecule defines the interactive nature between the surface of the adsorbent and paraquat herbicide however most papers do not furnish a clear adsorption mechanism between the adsorbent and paraquat in table 3 some adsorption mechanisms were described table 3 41 98 105 106 134 santos et al 4 indicated that the electrostatic interactions are physical corresponding to hydrogen bonds π π interactions and the van der walls forces on the other hand studies conducted by tsai lai 47 kamble et al 109 and li et al 42 suggested that the adsorption of paraquat occurs due to ionic bonding indicating that the chemisorption in the main mechanism it should be noted that these chemisorption claims are bold and without enough evidence since the authors are based only on the pseudo second order fit which is erroneously attributed to chemisorption 143 the specification and suggestion of the adsorption mechanism should be supported by different aspects such as functional groups of the adsorbent ph of the solution phpzc of the material and especially the enthalpy the adsorption process is physisorption if the δh0 is below 80 kj mol 1 143 on the other hand if δh0 is higher than 200 kj mol 1 it is expected that chemical sorption occurs 129 143 144 from the reported works in the last section it is possible to expect that the paraquat mechanism is classified as physisorption since the values were under 40 kj mol 1 considering the theory of the surface diffusion and pore volume models and the physical adsorption mechanism a general adsorption mechanism is proposed according to fig 9 first there is the mass transfer step i in this step the paraquat molecules move from the bulk solution through the boundary layer also denominated as film ii in the second phase occurs the pore diffusion attributed to the fickian diffusion and the surface diffusion iii the last stage occurs the adsorption which is considered an instantaneous effect 145 146 this instantaneous adsorption step is where the physical interactions occur where the paraquat can be adsorbed due to the hydrogen bonds π π interactions and possible stacking dipole dipole forces and n π interactions may also occur the dipole dipole and n π interactions are expected since the paraquat has 2 cations available however it also depends on the nature of the adsorbent for this mechanism to take place 4 6 textural proprieties and paraquat adsorption capacity besides the molecule proprieties and adsorption conditions the textural proprieties are an important factor in overall adsorption performance fig 10 was elaborated to understand the effect of the specific surface area and the average pore diameter in paraquat adsorption capacity it is possible to observe that the higher adsorption capacities tend to be found when the specific surface area and the average pore diameter are more equilibrated meaning that only one textural propriety is much higher than the other will not guarantee high adsorption capacities for example tongur and ayranci 1 have reported that the activated carbon cloth with a surface area of 1870 m2 g 1 presents an adsorption capacity of only 10 28 mg g 1 in the same way mueanpun et al 103 reported and activated carbon from water ferns with a specific surface area of 2848 m2 g 1 with an adsorption capacity of 20 mg g 1 for the average pore diameter there is also reported that the adsorbent pore is high with a low specific area this also leads to low adsorption capacity when employing biochar derived from swine manure tsai and collaborators 131 found that the material has an average pore diameter of 10 7 nm leading to an adsorption capacity of 3 24 mg g 1 following the same path brigante and schulz 10 also reported that the mesoporous silica modified with titania presents a higher average pore diameter of 7 77 nm with a low adsorption capacity of 15 429 mg g 1 regarding average proprieties zbair et al 114 reported that the carbonated jujube seeds have a specific surface area of 973 m2 g 1 and an average pore diameter of 3 93 leading to an experimental adsorption capacity of 425 mg g 1 thus developing a new adsorbent for removing paraquat should focus on average proprieties to ensure maximum adsorption capacity 5 reutilization of loaded adsorbent for adsorption at a large industrial scale the regeneration of the adsorbent is very important being necessary to desorb the loaded adsorbent and reutilize it 147 adsorbents that allow higher reuse will significantly decrease the cost for application on a large industrial scale 40 these desorption studies help study the contaminant s hydrology in environmental studies based on these desorption experiments it is possible to predict how solid samples liberated micropollutants into groundwater in these studies the higher the desorption rates will allow the higher the micropollutant amount to be freed into the aquatic environment 148 dehghani et al 142 concluded that the adsorbent graphene oxide mesoporous silica regenerated more effectively using 0 1 m naoh as the solvent maintaining 69 removal efficiency after four cycles li et al 42 used a mixture of hcl and methanol 1 20 v v as the solvent and verified that the adsorbent carbon tubes maintained 70 of its removal efficiency after five adsorption desorption cycles using the same solvent mixture li et al 99 observed that the adsorbent modified carbon spheres retained 80 of its initial adsorption capacity after five cycles showing that both adsorbents are promising in the treatment of effluent contaminated with paraquat on a large scale martwong and colleagues used a solution of 5 v v hcl diluted in ethanol where the efficiency decreased from 91 3 to 84 8 after 5 cycles 123 santos et al 4 used a solution of calcium chloride as a solvent for removing the herbicide in soil samples where after 4 washes the maximum removal obtained was 51 which is much higher than those found in the literature for the adsorption of paraquat in soils the observed differences may again be related to the soil samples higher clay and organic matter contents and the type of solvent used regeneration studies in the adsorption of paraquat are still scarce even more if we analyze it through other organic contaminants in the literature therefore more studies using other solvents in other types of adsorbents still need to be elaborated 6 common mistakes found knowledge gap and future perspectives the first aspect is that 41 of the works did not report the initial ph of the solution as previously mentioned section 4 1 this is a major downside for this work since it limits the further application of the adsorbent and makes difficult the interpretation of the mechanism of adsorption the second aspect is that 91 of the works did not report or perform adsorbent dosage optimization as mentioned in section 4 2 this is undesirable for the adsorption studies since this leads to two different problems i if the optimization was done and is not reported any further application of the adsorbent needs to be investigated once again thus diminishing the interest ii if the dosage optimization was not performed the adsorbent underperformed and the true potential is still unknown 149 the third aspect is that 76 of the works employed linear estimation of the parameters for the kinetics and isotherm models this methodology is outdated and has been demonstrated by several authors that it should be avoided the main reasons that the linear estimation should be avoided are i variables are changed to fit the linear form of the equation this forces the behavior to be different from the real one and ii linearized parameters tend to have higher variances than their nonlinear counterparts 149 150 the last aspect is the lack of isotherms in different temperatures to be employed in the thermodynamic estimations only 6 works from the 25 reported have conducted isotherm investigations at different temperatures overall it is highly recommended that the new paraquat adsorption works should inform the ph conduct dosage optimization employ nonlinear estimation of the isothermal and kinetic parameters and investigate the adsorption at different temperatures to ensure that the estimation of thermodynamic parameters is possible there is still much to be explored regarding the paraquat studies regarding the knowledge gap of the hundreds of adsorbents reported in the literature just a few focus on removing paraquat in addition to that there are still lacking several aspects in the adsorption of paraquat studies i the lack of application of mass transfer models to better understand the paraquat adsorption phenomena ii the lack of competitive adsorption studies to understand how the paraquat behaves in the presence of other herbicides ions and organic molecules iii lack of fixed bed adsorption investigations usually in the industrial large scale adsorption process the final application of the adsorption is performed using continuous adsorption also proper modeling should be done in conjunction with these experiments it should be noted that from all the reports found only one had conducted investigations regarding the paraquat adsorption in fixed bed using activated carbon from pinus eldarica stalks 151 iv economic analysis of the adsorbent is welcome since without them is impossible to know if the developed material is economical economically viable and if it can compete with other developed adsorbents regarding the future perspectives the remediation of areas contaminated by various pollutants and uncontrolled conditions such as ph success depends on hybrid processes therefore the paraquat adsorption process can be coupled with a fenton like 152 or photocatalytic advanced degradation methods 153 also other techniques such as catalytic 154 156 and in situ oxidation 1 157 electrochemical degradation 158 159 co precipitation 160 and biological decomposition 161 in this sense only the work of tongur ayranci 1 analyzed the pesticide adsorption using adsorption with electrosorption verifying that the techniques were mainly efficient in the removal of electrosorbed herbicides paraquat diquat and difenzoquat besides that there are still no studies reporting the application of neural networks and fuzzy inference systems to model and optimize herbicide adsorption these gaps described are intended to propose new work horizons for future researchers who will work with paraquat adsorption 7 conclusion updated studies show the paraquat s high toxic potentiality to living organisms the main damage is provoked to the lungs and potential risks of parkinson s disease thus the improvement in removing this herbicide is relevant from the health aspect the literature reports that there are high efficient adsorbents for paraquat uptake these adsorbents are mainly silicate materials zeolites bentonite with silicate and modified silicate and carbon materials carbon nanotubes and carbonated jujube seeds the pseudo second order model was a proper model for describing the paraquat adsorption on different systems the porous polycalix n arenes and the carbonated jujube seeds showed the highest adsorption capacity the effective time the langmuir model represented the most equilibrium data concerning the adsorption equilibrium followed by the freundlich model indicating that adsorption can take place on homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces regarding thermodynamics it was found that endothermic and exothermic systems with the standard enthalpy lower than 40 kj mol 1 however few studies explored the time necessary for regenerating the adsorbent and the number of new recycles of the adsorbent with good efficiency for paraquat uptake therefore since hundreds of materials have already been developed in the literature new adsorbents should be applied in the adsorption of paraquat furthermore economic analysis and adsorption mechanism studies must be carried out finally pesticide adsorption in a fixed bed column and applying more advanced modeling techniques will be useful for advancing and improving this process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments e c lima thanks to

12828,the present review analyzed papers using adsorption that explore the removal of paraquat herbicide from aqueous effluents contamination and toxicology aspects of the paraquat are tackled as well analysis regarding the effects of process variables and textural proprieties on the paraquat adsorption is presented the reported works found that the best adsorbent was those of silicate and carbon nature which presented adsorption capacities above 400 mg g 1 unfortunately most works do not report the paraquat solution s ph or perform adsorption conditions optimization regarding the adsorption kinetics it was found that the pseudo second order is the proper model to represent several paraquat systems however mass transfer investigations are not presented classical isotherm models are the most employed such as langmuir and freundlich in addition the paraquat adsorption systems are of any thermic nature endothermic exothermic with the paraquat molecules binding due to physisorption last common mistakes in the reports knowledge gaps and future perspectives are discussed focusing on improving the adsorption works graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption paraquat ecotoxicology contamination data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is an irreplaceable and increasingly limited human resource drinking water essential for life is available in surface and underground waters the protection of these reservoirs is one of the greatest current challenges facing humanity 1 modern agriculture focused on super harvests has intensified the use of pesticides in recent years more than 1000 pesticides are currently aimed at different purposes 2 these products can easily contaminate groundwater by infiltration and flow without even accumulating in the soil through precipitation and irrigation often intensified by herbicide characteristics such as high water solubility and soil mobility these products can easily contaminate groundwater by infiltration and flow without even accumulating in the soil 3 the herbicide paraquat 1 1 dimethyl 4 4 bipyridyl dichloride became popular due to its high efficiency low cost and non selectivity in combating broadleaf weeds in the pre planting of tobacco crops cotton and rice 4 5 in addition it started to replace pesticides that became inefficient due to the resistance obtained by the plants caused mainly by the high use as is the case of glyphosate 6 7 paraquat fig 1 is 28 times more toxic than glyphosate 8 it is a highly water soluble polar compound with low vapor pressure and high binding capacity 9 10 paraquat has high adsorption in different soils so most of the compost becomes biologically unavailable recent studies have shown a greater affinity for clay particles than organic matter 11 in these cases the positively charged paraquat attracts the negative mineral charges whereas in the case of organic matter environmental factors such as ionic strength and solution ph influence these interactions in recent years paraquat has been detected in surface groundwater and wastewater worldwide 12 15 for humans it has high acute toxicity at an oral ld50 4 mg kg 1 and can easily penetrate the skin 16 it is considered highly toxic even at low concentrations 17 18 in the literature there are reports of deaths caused by poisoning via ingestion or skin exposure 19 20 paraquat has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that lead to parkinson s disease 21 23 it is also being reported that the paraquat affects the reactive oxygen species ros in the brain and the dysregulates biosynthesis of the cholesterol in human brains 24 25 in the case of mammals such as mice it also has been found that the paraquat affects the α synuclein an essential protein in brain function 26 also being able to cause organ damage in the lungs and kidneys 20 paraquat is currently banned in 50 countries including all of europe however most developing countries have not set restrictions on its use 15 27 28 for example in brazil the health surveillance agency anvisa banned its risk due to the high mutagenic power and studies related to parkinson s 29 in taiwan due to its intensive use mainly in rice fields the maximum level of the contaminant was limited to 0 01 mg l 1 30 therefore paraquat contamination in water is one of the global environmental issues facing which needs an immediate solution 31 the scientific community has been dedicating itself to improving new technologies to remove paraquat from the environment in the past few years in the literature it is possible to observe various methods such as electrochemical degradation 32 photocatalysis 33 separation using special membranes 34 35 biological degradation 36 37 and adsorption 38 39 from all those techniques there are several positive and negative points that the adsorption tends to overcome especially when aligned with waste material and the high efficiency nature of the process 40 due to this in recent years several adsorbents have been developed and applied in the removal of paraquat from aqueous media 1 41 42 these authors review did not find review papers regarding the application of adsorption in the removal of paraquat from the environment therefore it is observed that the great importance of this review added to the problem of paraquat and the current and future environmental challenges first through the extensive published database the detection of the presence of pesticides in different environments was explored secondly several studies analyzed the damage caused to the environment animals and humans by the presence of paraquat thirdly the adsorbents used for the removal of paraquat were thoroughly characterized fourthly the kinetic and isotherms of adsorption and the thermodynamic parameters of adsorption were explored allowing to establish the mechanism of paraquat adsorption last but not least knowledge gaps and future perspectives in uptaken of paraquat were given 2 detection of paraquat in the environmental samples the first application of the paraquat occurred decades ago in malaysia in rubber tree plantations since then its use has spread to different species plantations worldwide 43 44 the paraquat contaminates the water resources globally through easy vertical percolation in the soil 45 in spain it was detected in irrigation canals rivers and lakes samples at a concentration of 3 95 μg l 1 12 in thailand concentrations between 1 5 and 18 9 μg l 1 and 9 3 and 87 μg l 1 were detected in groundwater and surface water respectively 46 tsai lai 47 found that the maximum paraquat concentration in untreated wastewater was about 40 mg l 1 155 5 μmol l 1 further information regarding the paraquat concentration in water sources is scarce in the literature this lack of information may be related to the banning of paraquat in the european countries and china being noteworthy that these regions are major paraquat exporters 48 49 however despite the lack of information it is possible to expect the presence of paraquat worldwide due to the following facts i still high employed across several countries ii several countries tend to import above 5 tonnes of banned pesticides including paraquat fig 2 for example the united states and brazil tend to import 10 to 26 thousand tons annually from europe 49 50 therefore many other studies still need to be conducted to detect the contaminant s presence and mitigate these contaminated areas because it is very low concentrations detection is difficult so in recent years several sensors have been developed mainly aimed at detecting the paraquat zhang et al 51 developed a sensor based on tripodal pillar sand laghrib et al 52 verified the efficiency of electrochemical sensors for detecting paraquat in food samples tagne et al 53 developed an electroanalytical method with rice husk activated charcoal to detect the herbicide botta et al 54 used structured 3d laser engravings decorated with gold nanoparticle sers chips for ambient detection du et al 55 used a fluorescent sensor based on nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots zhang et al 56 successfully used a glassy carbon electrode decorated with nitrogen doped carbon dots coated with pillararene charoenkitamorn et al 57 developed a new gel based electrolyte raymundo pereira et al 58 and majdinasab et al 59 applied non enzymatic sensors incorporated in flexible and wearable gloves stavra et al 60 successfully determined several pesticides with a white light reflectance spectroscopy biosensor du wang 61 used nanomaterials sensors with the application of electrochemical techniques gao and collaborators 62 have employed the raman scattering with a microdroplet sensor to detect paraquat concentrations low as 2 10 9 m although detection technologies have advanced public agencies and specific environmental legislation still lack the commitment to detect and remediation environments contaminated with pesticides for example in taiwan the maximum paraquat contaminant level mcl was set at 0 01 mg l 1 0 039 μmol l 1 in addition the paraquat residue limits in food were recently changed to 0 2 mg kg 0 78 μmol l 1 30 3 toxicology of paraquat due to concern about the damage caused by paraquat in living organisms several studies mainly in the last 5 years were developed and several damages were found by the presence of paraquat in the organism fig 3 studies report deaths from ingestion and long term exposure 16 20 in humans the herbicide showed high toxicity in the liver brain kidneys heart adrenal glands and muscles 44 63 64 several studies have revealed that even at low levels of concentration paraquat causes severe lung damage transforming oxygen into free radicals and causing respiratory failure and death 44 64 66 in the literature it is possible to find 100 studies relating the presence of paraquat in the body to the development of parkinson s disease 22 67 71 chao fang 72 reported that a patient hospitalized for ingestion of paraquat had a pulmonary embolism fallahi dalfardi 73 reported early pulmonary fibrosis after accidental herbicide ingestion in a 19 year old girl there are few papers dealing with paraquat treatment in the human body paraquat extracorporeal removal could be the only patient s hope of remaining alive 74 the removal treatment combines hemoperfusion with an activated charcoal cartridge and flushing the digestion system after placing fuller s earth in the patient s stomach to capture unabsorbed paraquat the adsorption capacities of fuller s earth and activated carbon are about 60 fuller s earth and 100 mg g 1 activate carbon 75 and are not effective for urgent clinical treatment of paraquat poisoned patients the reported paraquat effects are summarized in fig 3 it can cause serious damage to animals 76 77 and plants 78 paraquat increased norepinephrine utilization in female mice s hippocampus and prefrontal cortex 79 80 the study by dwyer et al 81 revealed the induction of nigrostriatal pathology inflammatory changes and stress and trophic effects naspolini et al 82 reported glutamate neurotoxicity in rats amin et al 83 confirmed the occurrence of systemic and pulmonary inflammation in rats after inhalation for 16 days hamdaoui et al 84 reported changes in gene expression in the brain of pregnant mice offspring zhang et al 85 and wijerathna et al 86 found acute lung injury in rats regulating the polarization of alveolar macrophages through glycolysis li et al 87 confirmed that the herbicide even at low concentrations blocks the development of leydig cells at puberty disrupting the production of the hormone testosterone and toxicity in sh sy5y cells and the striatum of rats 88 89 and pancreatic lesions 90 91 ma et al 92 observed that the exposures caused metabolic destabilization in the liver of carp provoking hepatotoxicity soni et al 93 observed the blocking of the reproductive functions of japanese quails in rats oxidative stress complex inflammation behavioral changes and cortical mitochondrial dysfunction were observed 94 bora et al 95 verified the effect on c elegans and found that it affects lifespan and reproduction throughout generation through mitochondrial interruption while wang et al 96 observed that paraquat affects mitochondrial bioenergetics dopaminergic system expression and locomotor activity in zebrafish however there are no obvious therapeutic effects and the key to current treatment still needs to be discussed and improved in addition there is no significant advance for patients with advanced poisoning overall paraquat research has progressed but the toxic mechanism and treatment of paraquat toxicity still need further exploration 97 4 paraquat adsorption and main variables in this topic and forward the major variables that influence the adsorption capacity of paraquat are analyzed all the parameters discussed are based on the survey of several scientific reports related to the adsorption of paraquat the information regarding the experimental conditions temperature adsorbent dosage ph initial paraquat concentration adsorbent characteristics and adsorption capacity are listed in table 1 4 1 solution initial ph one of the main aspects of the adsorption is the ph since it can control the degree of ionization of the adsorbate and the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent 125 a summary of the important aspects of the reported ph works is shown in fig 4 it was found that 35 3 of the works do not report the initial ph of the solution this is a major drawback since this limits the reproducibility further application and interpretation of the adsorption system besides that the initial ph values ranged from 6 to 11 with the neutral values having 11 8 of the reported works iglesias et al 100 reported that the maximum adsorption capacity at ph 10 5 values above the phpzc of the goethite adsorbent phpzc 9 5 when the initial ph of the paraquat solution is lower than the phpzc of the adsorbent the surface will be positively charged so no attraction is expected as at a ph higher than the phpzc the surface is negatively charged and electrostatic attraction occurs with the charged pesticide centers positively 1 li et al 99 found that adsorption increased with increasing ph to 6 however from 10 onwards the adsorption capacity worsened the authors explain that the increase of carbonyl groups on the surface of the adsorbent carbon spheres caused dissociation and cationic targets could easily combine with the adsorbent similar behavior was obtained by huang et al 16 using oxidized cellulose nanofibers as an adsorbent the adsorbate and adsorbent interactions are better explained in section 4 5 the adsorption mechanism 4 2 adsorbent dosage effect in conjunction with the solution ph the dosage is another important factor the paraquat adsorption capacity regarding the dosage employed is depicted in fig 5 the first aspect is that the adsorption capacity does not show a specific trend with the dosage presenting high adsorption capacity at lower and higher dosage values in general lower dosages are expected to show higher adsorption capacity the adsorption tends to decrease for higher dosages this effect is directly related to the available sites for the adsorbate molecules 126 127 in these cases the lack of trend is related to two different aspects i the adsorbent employed in the paraquat removal have different origins being from silicates to carbonaceous groups and ii 83 3 of the reported works did not perform dosage test or optimization this leads to overdosage adsorbent waste and underperformance of the adsorbents due to the possible agglomeration of the molecules 128 4 3 kinetic parameters and models the main variables of the adsorption kinetics are the initial concentration and the time to reach the equilibrium these variables directly affect the adsorption process cost efficiency 129 the reports on the adsorption of paraquat cover a wide spectrum of types of materials and their adsorption conditions are very different ranging from initial concentrations from 1 to 500 mg l 1 according to table 2 therefore the use of a variable effective time teff min was proposed to condense the effects of the variables as homogeneously as possible thus allowing a fairer comparison the effective time is calculated as follows 1 t eff t e q e c 0 d 0 where te is the time to achieve the equilibrium min qe is the paraquat adsorption capacity in equilibrium relative to the initial concentration mg g 1 c0 is the highest initial paraquat concentration employed in the report mg l 1 d0 is the adsorbent dosage employed the estimated effective time for the reported works is presented in table 2 and fig 6 from the adsorption capacities and the effective times the data presented by shetty et al 111 huang et al 16 tsai et al 30 and zbair et al 114 showed the better performance with the highest adsorption capacities and lowest effective times meaning that these materials possess overall better performance being able to adsorb a decent paraquat quantity in a short period besides that the effective time shows indicate another trend where the adsorption of paraquat tends to be high with carbon based materials and lower with silica ones unfortunately most of these articles do not report the phpzc and the solution ph mentioned previously in the previous section 4 47 106 this makes it impossible to specify beyond the basic atom group differences besides that it should be noted that the adsorbent physical proprieties such as the total pore volume average pore diameter and specific surface area are not considered in calculating the effective time however the textural proprieties play an important role during the adsorption process since it interferes directly with the boundary layer surface and pore diffusion 132 133 concerning the kinetic models employed it was found that the pseudo second order model pso is the most suitable model for describing the adsorption of paraquat in several systems presenting high correlation coefficients and good statistical indicators 1 99 106 134 the studies conducted by tsai lai 47 kamble et al 109 and li et al 42 attribute that due to the kinetic model the mechanism that adsorption occurred through chemisorption however none of the studies were presented thermodynamic studies and proposal of reaction mechanism therefore it cannot be affirmed that such interaction happened this subject will be better addressed and discussed in section 4 5 respectively 4 4 temperature effect isotherm models and thermodynamics in addition to the other mentioned parameters the temperature is important as the ph during the adsorption process as the temperature can affect several of the adsorbate thermodynamic proprieties e g solubility activity and can also affect the adsorbent structure causing expansions that lead to more sites been available 135 besides that the adsorption equilibrium is relevant to the adsorption process it is possible to define whether the interactions occur in mono or multilayers through the isotherm models 136 furthermore the parameters from the isotherm models are employed to estimate thermodynamic parameters which are important aspects that indicate the spontaneity of the process and the thermal nature finally the information acquired using equilibrium isotherm helps scale the adsorption processes at the industrial scale 137 according to fig 7a most studies did not analyze the temperature variation in the adsorption process 1 41 42 107 109 performed at room temperature mostly close to 298 k or 303 k furthermore fig 7b shows that several adsorbents can remove paraquat at different temperatures indicating that temperature can enhance or diminish the overall adsorption capacity dehgani et al 98 and brigante and schulz 10 reported that the temperature enhances the adsorption capacity when employing bentonite modified with zero valent iron and mesoporous silica modified with titania respectively however other authors reported that the temperature caused a decrease in the adsorption capacity in different systems 16 30 104 105 134 besides the work reported by zbair et al 115 which employed carbonated jujube seeds is noteworthy these other works investigated the temperature effect in the paraquat adsorption employed silica based materials with the main difference being the presence of ferrous groups titanium oxide aluminum oxide or the silica quantities 16 30 104 105 this means that even small changes to similar materials cause different outcomes in the adsorption capacity the shape of the isotherm and even thermodynamic parameters regarding the equilibrium models employed for describing the adsorption isotherms it was found that 87 1 of the works showed that the langmuir model is suitable for explaining the paraquat uptake on different adsorbent materials based on these results it could be inferred that paraquat monolayers are adsorbed on the adsorbent s surface 41 98 109 on the other hand studies were reported by tongur ayranci 1 and tsai hsien 30 which obtained a better fit to the equilibrium data following the freundlich isotherm attributed to the paraquat uptake taking place in heterogeneous surfaces however it should be highlighted that most of these papers used linearized equations that are limited to these two models only limiting the correct interpretation of the equilibrium data it is possible to determine whether the adsorption process is spontaneous or not 138 through thermodynamic parameters the determination of the change in standard gibbs free energy δg0 kj mol 1 standard entropy change δs0 kj mol 1 k 1 and standard enthalpy change δh0 kj mol 1 are important variables to predict the performance and the adsorption mechanism being essential for the characterization and optimization of the process 139 studies involving the adsorption of paraquat and that have determined thermodynamic parameters are rarely reported in the literature from the 25 research papers found only 5 contain thermodynamic estimations furthermore from a brief evaluation of these works it was found that the methodology employed to determine the thermodynamic parameters differed or was outdated making it impossible to compare the reported data effectively therefore besides the work reported by rasaie et al 105 which agrees with the modern methodology 135 the thermodynamic parameters of the other reported works have been recalculated and are shown in fig 8 the first aspect to be observed is that all the adsorbents employed have a spontaneous nature for all the temperatures studied this means that the δg0 0 as the temperature of the system changes 140 in most cases the spontaneity of the process tends to increase with the temperature increase which indicates that the nature of the process is endothermic concerning δh it was found that most of the work showed an endothermic nature indicating that the increase of the system temperature enhances the paraquat adsorption with the increasing temperature the increased adsorption capacity is directly related to the adsorbate s increased diffusion in the adsorbent material s pores on the other hand there are reports of exothermic systems in which in this case the temperature can cause another side effect such as excess energy leading to the molecules being easily detached from the surface last most of the studies showed a positive standard entropy change indicating high affinity between the adsorbate with the adsorbent with the increase of solid solution randomness affinity with a characteristic increase in solid solution interface randomness 141 4 5 adsorption mechanism the charge present on the molecule defines the interactive nature between the surface of the adsorbent and paraquat herbicide however most papers do not furnish a clear adsorption mechanism between the adsorbent and paraquat in table 3 some adsorption mechanisms were described table 3 41 98 105 106 134 santos et al 4 indicated that the electrostatic interactions are physical corresponding to hydrogen bonds π π interactions and the van der walls forces on the other hand studies conducted by tsai lai 47 kamble et al 109 and li et al 42 suggested that the adsorption of paraquat occurs due to ionic bonding indicating that the chemisorption in the main mechanism it should be noted that these chemisorption claims are bold and without enough evidence since the authors are based only on the pseudo second order fit which is erroneously attributed to chemisorption 143 the specification and suggestion of the adsorption mechanism should be supported by different aspects such as functional groups of the adsorbent ph of the solution phpzc of the material and especially the enthalpy the adsorption process is physisorption if the δh0 is below 80 kj mol 1 143 on the other hand if δh0 is higher than 200 kj mol 1 it is expected that chemical sorption occurs 129 143 144 from the reported works in the last section it is possible to expect that the paraquat mechanism is classified as physisorption since the values were under 40 kj mol 1 considering the theory of the surface diffusion and pore volume models and the physical adsorption mechanism a general adsorption mechanism is proposed according to fig 9 first there is the mass transfer step i in this step the paraquat molecules move from the bulk solution through the boundary layer also denominated as film ii in the second phase occurs the pore diffusion attributed to the fickian diffusion and the surface diffusion iii the last stage occurs the adsorption which is considered an instantaneous effect 145 146 this instantaneous adsorption step is where the physical interactions occur where the paraquat can be adsorbed due to the hydrogen bonds π π interactions and possible stacking dipole dipole forces and n π interactions may also occur the dipole dipole and n π interactions are expected since the paraquat has 2 cations available however it also depends on the nature of the adsorbent for this mechanism to take place 4 6 textural proprieties and paraquat adsorption capacity besides the molecule proprieties and adsorption conditions the textural proprieties are an important factor in overall adsorption performance fig 10 was elaborated to understand the effect of the specific surface area and the average pore diameter in paraquat adsorption capacity it is possible to observe that the higher adsorption capacities tend to be found when the specific surface area and the average pore diameter are more equilibrated meaning that only one textural propriety is much higher than the other will not guarantee high adsorption capacities for example tongur and ayranci 1 have reported that the activated carbon cloth with a surface area of 1870 m2 g 1 presents an adsorption capacity of only 10 28 mg g 1 in the same way mueanpun et al 103 reported and activated carbon from water ferns with a specific surface area of 2848 m2 g 1 with an adsorption capacity of 20 mg g 1 for the average pore diameter there is also reported that the adsorbent pore is high with a low specific area this also leads to low adsorption capacity when employing biochar derived from swine manure tsai and collaborators 131 found that the material has an average pore diameter of 10 7 nm leading to an adsorption capacity of 3 24 mg g 1 following the same path brigante and schulz 10 also reported that the mesoporous silica modified with titania presents a higher average pore diameter of 7 77 nm with a low adsorption capacity of 15 429 mg g 1 regarding average proprieties zbair et al 114 reported that the carbonated jujube seeds have a specific surface area of 973 m2 g 1 and an average pore diameter of 3 93 leading to an experimental adsorption capacity of 425 mg g 1 thus developing a new adsorbent for removing paraquat should focus on average proprieties to ensure maximum adsorption capacity 5 reutilization of loaded adsorbent for adsorption at a large industrial scale the regeneration of the adsorbent is very important being necessary to desorb the loaded adsorbent and reutilize it 147 adsorbents that allow higher reuse will significantly decrease the cost for application on a large industrial scale 40 these desorption studies help study the contaminant s hydrology in environmental studies based on these desorption experiments it is possible to predict how solid samples liberated micropollutants into groundwater in these studies the higher the desorption rates will allow the higher the micropollutant amount to be freed into the aquatic environment 148 dehghani et al 142 concluded that the adsorbent graphene oxide mesoporous silica regenerated more effectively using 0 1 m naoh as the solvent maintaining 69 removal efficiency after four cycles li et al 42 used a mixture of hcl and methanol 1 20 v v as the solvent and verified that the adsorbent carbon tubes maintained 70 of its removal efficiency after five adsorption desorption cycles using the same solvent mixture li et al 99 observed that the adsorbent modified carbon spheres retained 80 of its initial adsorption capacity after five cycles showing that both adsorbents are promising in the treatment of effluent contaminated with paraquat on a large scale martwong and colleagues used a solution of 5 v v hcl diluted in ethanol where the efficiency decreased from 91 3 to 84 8 after 5 cycles 123 santos et al 4 used a solution of calcium chloride as a solvent for removing the herbicide in soil samples where after 4 washes the maximum removal obtained was 51 which is much higher than those found in the literature for the adsorption of paraquat in soils the observed differences may again be related to the soil samples higher clay and organic matter contents and the type of solvent used regeneration studies in the adsorption of paraquat are still scarce even more if we analyze it through other organic contaminants in the literature therefore more studies using other solvents in other types of adsorbents still need to be elaborated 6 common mistakes found knowledge gap and future perspectives the first aspect is that 41 of the works did not report the initial ph of the solution as previously mentioned section 4 1 this is a major downside for this work since it limits the further application of the adsorbent and makes difficult the interpretation of the mechanism of adsorption the second aspect is that 91 of the works did not report or perform adsorbent dosage optimization as mentioned in section 4 2 this is undesirable for the adsorption studies since this leads to two different problems i if the optimization was done and is not reported any further application of the adsorbent needs to be investigated once again thus diminishing the interest ii if the dosage optimization was not performed the adsorbent underperformed and the true potential is still unknown 149 the third aspect is that 76 of the works employed linear estimation of the parameters for the kinetics and isotherm models this methodology is outdated and has been demonstrated by several authors that it should be avoided the main reasons that the linear estimation should be avoided are i variables are changed to fit the linear form of the equation this forces the behavior to be different from the real one and ii linearized parameters tend to have higher variances than their nonlinear counterparts 149 150 the last aspect is the lack of isotherms in different temperatures to be employed in the thermodynamic estimations only 6 works from the 25 reported have conducted isotherm investigations at different temperatures overall it is highly recommended that the new paraquat adsorption works should inform the ph conduct dosage optimization employ nonlinear estimation of the isothermal and kinetic parameters and investigate the adsorption at different temperatures to ensure that the estimation of thermodynamic parameters is possible there is still much to be explored regarding the paraquat studies regarding the knowledge gap of the hundreds of adsorbents reported in the literature just a few focus on removing paraquat in addition to that there are still lacking several aspects in the adsorption of paraquat studies i the lack of application of mass transfer models to better understand the paraquat adsorption phenomena ii the lack of competitive adsorption studies to understand how the paraquat behaves in the presence of other herbicides ions and organic molecules iii lack of fixed bed adsorption investigations usually in the industrial large scale adsorption process the final application of the adsorption is performed using continuous adsorption also proper modeling should be done in conjunction with these experiments it should be noted that from all the reports found only one had conducted investigations regarding the paraquat adsorption in fixed bed using activated carbon from pinus eldarica stalks 151 iv economic analysis of the adsorbent is welcome since without them is impossible to know if the developed material is economical economically viable and if it can compete with other developed adsorbents regarding the future perspectives the remediation of areas contaminated by various pollutants and uncontrolled conditions such as ph success depends on hybrid processes therefore the paraquat adsorption process can be coupled with a fenton like 152 or photocatalytic advanced degradation methods 153 also other techniques such as catalytic 154 156 and in situ oxidation 1 157 electrochemical degradation 158 159 co precipitation 160 and biological decomposition 161 in this sense only the work of tongur ayranci 1 analyzed the pesticide adsorption using adsorption with electrosorption verifying that the techniques were mainly efficient in the removal of electrosorbed herbicides paraquat diquat and difenzoquat besides that there are still no studies reporting the application of neural networks and fuzzy inference systems to model and optimize herbicide adsorption these gaps described are intended to propose new work horizons for future researchers who will work with paraquat adsorption 7 conclusion updated studies show the paraquat s high toxic potentiality to living organisms the main damage is provoked to the lungs and potential risks of parkinson s disease thus the improvement in removing this herbicide is relevant from the health aspect the literature reports that there are high efficient adsorbents for paraquat uptake these adsorbents are mainly silicate materials zeolites bentonite with silicate and modified silicate and carbon materials carbon nanotubes and carbonated jujube seeds the pseudo second order model was a proper model for describing the paraquat adsorption on different systems the porous polycalix n arenes and the carbonated jujube seeds showed the highest adsorption capacity the effective time the langmuir model represented the most equilibrium data concerning the adsorption equilibrium followed by the freundlich model indicating that adsorption can take place on homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces regarding thermodynamics it was found that endothermic and exothermic systems with the standard enthalpy lower than 40 kj mol 1 however few studies explored the time necessary for regenerating the adsorbent and the number of new recycles of the adsorbent with good efficiency for paraquat uptake therefore since hundreds of materials have already been developed in the literature new adsorbents should be applied in the adsorption of paraquat furthermore economic analysis and adsorption mechanism studies must be carried out finally pesticide adsorption in a fixed bed column and applying more advanced modeling techniques will be useful for advancing and improving this process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments e c lima thanks to

12829,flux decline measurements provided insight into the fouling behavior of ultrafiltration uf membranes for produced water pw treatment three uf membranes were compared in terms of the rate and the intensity of fouling the flux decline analysis showed the fouling transition from blocking mechanisms i e complete and intermediate blocking as well as standard blocking to cake formation occurs earlier for more permeable membranes lower trans membrane pressure tmp of 0 1 bar led to particle accumulation on the membrane surface leading to cake formation as the predominant fouling mechanism in higher tmp experiments standard and intermediate blocking followed by cake formation were found to be apparent fouling mechanisms overall for the membranes with higher permeabilities and for the filtrations with pre filtered feed faster transition to cake formation was observerd primarily due to crowd out effect by understanding membrane fouling and behavior it is possible to mitigate performance losses in membrane based technologies that could be used for the treatment of pw this study provides information to identify blocking rate and intensity in various conditions for uf membranes when treating pw graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fouling ultrafiltration produced water blocking mechanism cake formation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction produced water pw is the largest waste byproduct of oil and gas production but this wastewater stream can be partially treated and considered a valuable water resource pw is an oil in water emulsion that contains organic and inorganic constituents including a mixture of hydrocarbons dissolved minerals suspended and dissolved solids chemical compounds and dissolved gasses 1 globally the production of pw is estimated to be three times that of the oil production and this ratio is about 7 1 in the us since most of the oil wells are past peak production 2 to manage the pw the oil and gas business typically dispose of pw by injection into class ii salt water disposal wells while less than 10 is recycled or reused outside of the oil and gas industry 3 4 since pw management is becoming increasingly challenging 3 fit for purpose approaches are receiving more attention irrigation of non edible crops reuse for slickwater or water flood injection fracturing are the most immediate applications for recycle and reuse direct reuse in industry has been also proposed 5 6 several studies have investigated various treatment technologies to increase the reuse of pw 1 7 9 a variety of approaches are reported such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf electrodialysis ed 1 10 membrane distillation 9 11 14 adsorption sand filtration gas floatation electroflocculation 15 chemical precipitation and oxidation 7 membrane based separations are increasingly of interest because of potentially lower energy consumption modularity small footprint and reduced chemical consumption 16 particularly uf shows to be a promising method to pretreat pw in terms of oil grease and colloidal particulate removal 8 17 18 in some cases a primary pretreatment such as coagulation and sedimentation are used prior to uf to mitigate fouling 8 the major challenge facing the application of membranes for pw treatment is fouling which is due to the aggregation of unwanted particles on the surface or in the membrane pores several factors are affecting the intensity of membrane fouling and flux decline in treating pw water quality and operating conditions are particularly important considerations the major water characteristics that influence the intensity of fouling on the membrane surface are total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and oil and grease concentrations the particle size of suspended solids in the water is known to be also influential it is reported that the fouling intensity is strongly related to the membrane s pore geometry and surface charge 19 to date most of the membrane based pretreatments are focused on using mf membranes although colloidal particles viruses and bacteria can foul the membrane pores he et al 20 reported severe fouling in mf when the size of particles and the membrane s pores are approximately similar xiong et al 21 observed reduced fouling with mf after removing submicron particles 0 4 0 8 μm from pw overall fouling leads to reduced membrane permeability and consequently increased energy consumption permeability reduction generally occurs in two consecutive sections including concentration polarization cp in the boundary layer followed by particles buildup on the membrane surface 22 the latter would be more critical to focus on for uf because cp becomes concerning when the solute can be rejected by the membrane and it is considered reversible on the other hand fouling decreases the throughput of the membrane it can also reduce the lifetime of the membrane primarily as frequent cleaning with chemical agents will be required 23 mitigating the fouling has been always a subject of the research in the field of membranes either the feed should be pretreated to remove the foulants or the operating conditions should be optimized to mitigate the extent of the fouling one example is the concept of the critical flux presented by field et al 24 that is defined as the flux at which fouling starts to be significant the fouling and flux decline over time are not significant at fluxes lower than the critical flux this work evaluates both of these strategies to mitigate the fouling of uf membrane for the filtration of pw many studies have reported various modeling approaches to investigate membrane fouling especially for protein separation using mf and uf a classical fouling model developed by hermia has been proposed which defined four different fouling mechanisms complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking standard blocking and cake filtration 25 ho and zydney 26 also developed a mathematical model showing a smooth transition between two fouling mechanisms which is compatible with the experimental data in protein separation using mf bolton et al 27 extended the latter model to develop a combined fouling model for all the individual mechanisms for both constant pressure and constant flux in dead end flow mode duclos orsello et al 28 also developed a new model for internal and external fouling of bsa on mf to define characteristic time of individual fouling the mechanisms developed by hermia was used in this work whcih formed the basis for the present analysis that is discussed below in this study the mechanism and rate of fouling for the filtration of pw have been investigated with real pw and different uf membranes the data is evaluated for mechanistic understanding and to correlate predict fouling using the hermia model 25 the study also examined the effects of membrane pore size tmp and pre filtration on the membrane fouling behavior moreover fouling transition between various mechanisms has been investigated using flux decline analysis 2 modeling of membrane fouling hermia developed a simple but comprehensive model based upon the pore fouling mechanisms the complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking standard blocking and cake filtration modes of fouling are schematically illustrated in fig 1 overall the proposed model relates the cumulative permeate volume v to time t and a general equation to define this relationship is proposed in eq 1 in which different fouling mechanisms are represented by the blocking index n 1 d 2 t dv 2 k dt dv n where d2t dv2 is the resistance coefficient and dt dv is the reciprocal of the volumetric flow rate or the membrane resistance to obtain the blocking index from hermia model the equation should be first linearized as defined in eq 2 2 log d 2 t dv 2 log k nlog dt dv the experimental flux results can then be plotted and the value of n can be calculated using data fitting methodologies to identify the fouling mechanism 2 1 complete pore blocking complete pore blocking involves deposition of suspended particles or colloids on the membrane surface over time which ultimately leads to blocking membrane pores as shown in fig 1a in complete pore blocking the permeate flux decreases linearly and the blocked area decreases in proportion to the volume of the permeate as described below 3 a t a 0 σv where σ is defined as the blocking coefficient which is a function of physical properties of the foulant according to darcy s law q pa μr the permeate flow rate has a linear relation with the permeate volume for complete pore blocking 4 q t q 0 k b v where the permeate flow rate q is equal to dv dt substituting q in eq 4 with dv dt in eq 1 gives the hermia model for complete blocking with the blocking index equal to 2 5 d 2 t dv 2 k b dt dv 2 2 2 intermediate pore blocking in intermediate pore blocking some of the blocking particles settle over the previously collected particles as a result the membrane active area declines less severely than in complete pore blocking mode the reduction in the active area is assumed to be proportional to the fraction of the membrane surface that is blocked by particles 6 a t dt a t σ v t dt a t a 0 considering vt dt qtdt integration with respect to t gives the permeate flow equation as follows 7 1 q t 1 q 0 σ a 0 t substituting 1 q t in eq 7 with dt dv in eq 1 provides the fouling model for intermediate blocking with a blocking index of 1 8 d 2 t dv 2 k i dt dv 2 3 standard blocking standard blocking also known as the pore constriction refers to the reduction of the pore volume due to the accumulation of particles within the pores of the membrane the reduction in the volume of a cylindrical pore with the length of l due to the reduction of the pore radius dr is 9 ρ v p in ρ v p out ρ n 2 πrdr l where ρ and vp are the particle density and volume respectively and n indicates the number of pores on the membrane surface integration of eq 9 and substitution of r as a function of the permeate volume in poiseuille s equation for cylindrical systems gives the volumetric permeate flow rate for the standard blocking mechanism 10 q q 0 1 k s v 2 consequently combining the general flux model eq 1 with eq 10 leads to eq 11 shown below suggesting a blocking index of 3 2 11 d 2 t dv 2 k s dt dv 3 2 where 12 k s 2 k s q 0 1 2 2 4 cake filtration cake filtration is the result of accumulation of a continuous layer of fouling particles on the membrane surface this cake layer results in increasing the total membrane resistance toward the permeate flow the filtration resistance is defined as the summation of the membrane resistance r0 and cake resistance 13 r tot r 0 α w a where α is the specific cake resistance and w is the dry mass of the cake which is a function of the permeate volume and physical properties of the cake and is defined as 14 w v ρ f 1 mf where m represents as the mass ratio of the wet to dry cake whereas f is defined as dry solid fraction according to eqs 13 and 14 the following relationship can be derived 15 r tot r 0 1 k c q 0 v where kc is defined as the model constant in the cake filtration mechanism the permeate flow rate in the cake filtration mode is a function of permeate volume that can be obtained from darcy s law 16 q q 0 1 k c q 0 v by substitution q in eq 16 with dv dt in eq 1 the cake filtration equation can be written as below 17 d 2 t dv 2 k c based on eq 17 for the cake filtration mechanism the change in the membrane resistance with respect to the permeate volume remains constant and the blocking index is 0 cake filtration is expected to be the final stage of fouling when pore particle interactions are led to maximum pore blocking the blocking indices n and model constants k for various mechanisms are summarized in table 1 the initial permeate flux was calculated by extrapolating the smoothed flux data the criterion to identify the blocking index was based on calculating the slope for adjacent points with deviation of 0 2 for each blocking index e g the slopes equal to 1 3 and 1 7 were considered as standard blocking with n 1 5 the time to permeate derivatives in eq 2 are inversely proportional to the permeate flux j via the following relations 18 dt dv 1 ja 19 d 2 t dv 2 1 j 3 a 2 dj dt in this paper we seek to evaluate the fouling mechanisms for filtration of pw using uf membranes with different molecular weight cut offs mwcos the transition between various mechanisms during filtration has been observed in various filtration applications 28 30 31 but herein the rate and extent of fouling is evaluated for the filtration of samples of produced water from the permian basin texas the experimental data of flux versus time was used to derive the first dt dv and the second d2t dv2 derivatives of time over cumulative volume of the permeate the slope of the resulting curves identifies

hach turbidimeter 2100a conductivity was measured using the oakton conductivity meter 150 3 3 filtration experiments and methodology all the filtration experiments were performed in an 8050 amicon stirred cell emd millipore with an effective membrane area of 13 4 cm2 the schematic of the experimental setup used in this study is illustrated in fig 2 all experiments were carried out in dead end filtration mode a stainless steel pressure vessel was used to accommodate larger feed volumes for longer filtration tests constant transmembrane pressure tmp was applied using pressurized nitrogen a pressure transducer was used to accurately monitor the feed side pressure in the permeate side treated water was collected in a beaker placed over a balance which was connected to a computer to record the permeate weight over time via labview software the permeate flux j as a function of time t was calculated using eq 20 20 j m ρ w a t where m is the change in the permeate mass during a time period of t a is the active membrane filtration area and ρw is the density of permeate water in some of the experiments the pw was first pre filtered with a 0 45 μm filter to begin an experiment a clean membrane coupon was loaded into the membrane cell with the active layer facing the feed first the di water permeability test was performed at 1 bar for 30 min to compact the membrane the di water flux tests were followed by fouling experiments with pw as the feed pressurized to to the target pressure in all experiments 0 6 l of pw feed was used for the consistency and ease of interpretation of the results the sttirred cell was mixed at 500 rpm and the filtration continued until 500 g of the permeate was collected 4 results and discussion 4 1 pw analysis the major characteristics of our pw sample raw pw including tds tss and toc as well as some major heavy metal concentrations are summarized in table 3 9 tds concentration was measured using epa 160 1 suspended solids concentration was

scientific model icap 7600 asx 560 ion chromatography dionex ics 2000 grand island ny usa was used to measure ions including chloride and sulfate alkalinity by titration method has been applied to measure hydroxide and carbonate bicarbonate concentrations 32 the particle size distribution psd of the suspended solids for real produced water glass fiber filter permeate and uf permeate were measured and results are shown in fig 3 the pw sample showed two peaks at 1 and 4 μm with a slight peak at 128 nm after glass fiber filtration the permeate shows a peak at 0 45 μm which is very consistent with the rejection performance of glass fiber filter for suspended solids filtration since the larger particles 0 45 μm are retained by the glass fiber filter particles that permeated through the membrane show the maximum volume percentage in psd profile the filtered water with uf membrane almost shows no specific peak in the detection limit range of 64 4096 nm there is a sharp peak showing up at around 8000 nm which is an artifact of sample preparation or the analysis it should be also noted that this peak is at the borderline of the machine s detection limit presence of any particulates left in the sample holder or introduced to the water during the water handling could lead to this unexpected peak results suggest that particles above 0 45 μm are removed by the glass fiber filter and 100 kda uf membrane almost completely removed all the suspended particulates 4 2 fouling analysis tests fig 4a presents typical experimental data for the flux decline as a function of permeate volume for 10 100 and 500 kda pes membranes when treating raw pw at 0 5 bar tmp the initial flux for pes 500 kda is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the other two membranes owing to its larger pore size fig 4b displays dj dt versus the permeate volume dj dt is an absolute measure of the rate of flux decline results indicate that the rate of the flux decline is significantly more severe for the pes 500 kda membrane while pes 10 and 100 kda displayed almost similar rates of flux decline this finding is in agreement with the widely accepted notion that higher flux leads to faster flux decline in the membrane 31 the percentage reduction in flux at the end of the experiment was approximately 40 for the 500 kda membrane and 65 and 70 for the 10 and 100 kda membranes respectively the mathematical model and the determination of the fouling index are extremely sensitive to noisy data to analyze the flux decline behavior and apply the mathematical model provided in eq 2 the original data obtained from filtration experiments were smoothed using the minimizing the squared error approach fig 5 displays an example fitted line to the smoothed data points and the original flux data collected for pes 10 kda membrane only the smoothed data were used to calculate numerical values for the membrane resistance eq 18 and resistance coefficient eq 19 the second derivative of the time over volume d2t dv2 the hermia model was used for the flux decline analysis of the smoothed data obtained from pw filtrations fouling transitions that occurred during the filtration are highlighted by marked points in fig 6a which corresponds to a specific time and permeate volume in which the transition took place in fig 6a slopes of 1 or greater which are observed for the 10 and 100 kda membranes suggest blocking mechanisms complete intermediate or standard which are followed by slopes less than 1 indicating a transition to cake formation in the later stage of fouling this transition occurs almost immediately after starting the filtration with 500 kda membrane fig 6b displays the relationship between the membrane resistance vs cumulative permeate volume for these experiments the curves in 6b initially show an increasing slope followed by a period of decreasing slope the increased resistance of the membranes with smaller pore openings is reflected in the initial values shown in this figure it is evident that membranes with smaller pores display sharper slopes the dashed lines highlight the specific permeate volume at which the fouling mechanism switches from a blocking mechanism to cake formation based upon the change in curvature of the slope fig 6b this behavior has also been noted for mf of bovine serum albumin 28 overall the curvature analysis shown in fig 6b is in a good agreement with the detailed flux decline analysis that is summarized in table 4 based on fig 6a before elaborating on various fouling mechanisms observed in fig 6 it is critical to note that blocking mechanism is influenced by the concentration of the suspended solids the amount of solids retained and accumulated on the membrane surface and the flux through the membrane overall there are two important competing effects that should be considered on one hand when more particles reach the membrane surface simultaneously there is a greater chance for the particles to form a cake layer than migrating into the pores this is primarily due to the crowding out effect caused by the simultaneous arrival of particles with various sizes on the membrane surface 33 on the other hand at higher flux there will be a higher linear velocity at the pore entrance that leads to greater drag forces therefore particles with diameters smaller than the pore can potentially migrate more easily into the membrane pore given that the pore entrance is open for the penetration the flux decline analysis for pes 10 kda displays an initial blocking index of 1 5 which suggests standard blocking for a short period of time after approximately 5 ml of permeate was collected this fouling mechanism was followed by the intermediate pore blocking for a much longer period the peak of the curve in fig 6a occurs after collecting 74 ml of permeate at 2900 s of filtration showing fouling transition from blocking mechanism to cake formation when flux is roughly 60 of its initial value which based upon the analysis described in section 2 approximately 40 of the membrane active surface is blocked at this stage of filtration the negative slope point 4 to 5 does not correspond to any of the classical hermia fouling mechanisms and it can be translated to a transition region from blocking to cake formation 30 31 finally in the last stage of filtration the membrane resistance with respect to the permeate volume remained constant suggesting a fully formed cake on the surface of the membrane for the pes 100 kda a similar behavior was observed but the fouling transition from standard blocking to the intermediate blocking occurred after longer period larger pores of pes 100 kda membrane allows larger portion of suspended particles enter the pores and accumulate within the pores of the membrane the curve peak occurs when roughly 53 of the membrane active surface was blocked suggesting that the transition took place after a greater degree of fouling had occurred in contrast to pes 10 and 100 kda there was a very high initial permeate flux observed for pes 500 kda which resulted in an instant blocking index equal to 1 proceeded by a rapid transition to the cake formation the average permeate flux for pes 500 kda was one order of magnitude lager than pes 100 kda in the early stage of the filtration the blocking index in this case fell below 1 quickly because large number of particles with different sizes arrived at the membrane surface simultaneously due to higher flux provided by pes 500 kda as a result of the crowing out effect discussed earlier the particles immediately formed a cake layer therefore pes 500 kda membrane did not display any of the blocking mechanisms except the cake formation the same observation was reported for the fouling of polymethyl methacrylate in dead end microfiltration experiments earlier 33 all the pw feed was filtered before there was a fully formed cake suggesting that the pores were large enough to allow a considerable portion of the foulants to pass through the membrane in all these fouling experiments a transition from complete intermediate and standard blocking to cake formation can be observed except the case for pes 500 kda that the transition was rapid and not well defined a general observation is that the shift to cake formation takes place faster in more permeable membranes which is expected as higher permeation of the water leads to faster accumulation of the suspended particulates on the membrane surface in other words the rate of the flux decline is faster for more permeable membranes in early stages of filtration the same result for 75 kda and 2 kda cellulose acetate uf is also observed for the filtration of humic acid 31 4 3 effect of tmp pw filtration tests were carried out at various tmps and results are illustrated in fig 7 for these filtration tests pes 100 kda membrane was chosen as this membrane showed a variety of different fouling modes at low tmp suspended particles can rapidly accumulate on the membrane surface as the drag force is not large enough to push the particles permeate through the membrane similar behavior was also observed by hwang et al 33 who investigated the polymethyl methacrylate removal using mf over a range of tmp and concluded that cake filtration dominates at low filtration rates at higher pressures there is a greater tendency for suspended matter to penetrate the membrane and hence leading to the observation of other blocking mechanisms table 5 summarizes the fouling mechanisms transition time and permeate volume for the filtration tests performed at various tmps in the early stage of filtration at 0 5 and 1 bar standard blocking followed by intermediate blocking are the apparent fouling mechanisms with a subsequent shift to cake formation at higher tmp the transition to cake formation occurs later in terms of the permeate volume filtered more specific details of the effect of tmp on the fouling mechanism are summarized in table 5 4 4 effect of pw pre filtration to better understand the fouling pattern in pw filtration with uf we conducted more experiments with pre filtered water a glass microfiber filter gf with pore diameter of 0 47 μm and pes 100 kda membrane were used to pre filter the pw and the filtered water was then used for filtration with pes 10 kda as displayed in fig 8a these results are compared against the filtration with pes 10 kda without any pre filtration depending on the pore size of the filters pre filtration can remove a large portion of the suspended solids and lead to better performance in the subsequent filtration higher flux fig 8b displays the flux decline analysis for pes 10 kda filtration after pre filtration with gf and pes 100 kda fig 8a shows that the rapid initial permeate flux decline was reduced in pre filtered tests as compared to raw pw experiment which clearly indicates the impact of suspended solids on the fouling behavior the least reduction in permeate flux was observed for the filtration of prefiltered water with pes 100 kda therefore it is expected to have lower blocking rate compared to other tests when gf was used prior to pes 10 kda the blocking index at an early stage was less than 1 0 4 the blocking index for a the pre filtered pw sample with pes 100 kda was also small suggesting that in both cases the fouling mechanism is cake formation almost immediately after starting the filtration the small values 1 for the blocking index is also reported for high filtration rate experiments in other studies 33 34 the overview of the findings in fig 8 are summarized in table 6 figs 9a and b display similar behavior when a gf filter was used as a pre filter for the pes 100 kda membrane the initial flux is higher and there is an almost immediate transition to cake formation with no apparent blocking mechanisms based upon the curves in fig 9a there is an initial dramatic reduction in the flux for real pw test until approximately 100 ml of permeate is collected hence the blocking intensity is higher compared to the pre filtered test table 7 provides a summary of fouling analysis and more details of the flux decline analysis displayed in fig 9b the test without pre filtration lasted longer in the high blocking rate region indicating a more severe fouling compared to pre filtered test the peak value occured much earlier for pre filtered test after only 19 ml of collected permeate corresponded to 170 s compared to the real pw test which suggests that fouling transition to the cake formation happened at early stage of filtration for pre filtered test the values of j j0 at this point represent that only 5 of the membrane surface was covered by foulants in pre filtered test while more than half of the membrane surface area was blocked before fouling transition in raw pw test characterization of the fouled membranes is not a straightforward task foulants are soft and unstable and will deform during the membrane cutting into strips for cross sectional imaging to verify the fouling mechanisms identified by the hermia model two of the membranes that displayed very different fouling mechanisms pes 10 kda with untreated pw and pes 100 kda with gf filter pre filtered pw were considered for imaging fig 10 shows digital and electron microscopy images of these membranes as displayed pre filtration with gf filter significantly reduces the thickness of the cake formed on the membrane surface which results in higher flux and less severe flux decline compare figs s1 and s4 figs 10b and c display the cross sectional image of pes 10 kda in different magnifications we confirmed that darker shaded areas in the image display the areas and pores of the membrane that were fouled cake formation on the membrane surface and particle penetration inside the pores are obvious in this membrane which is in good agreement with the results in table 4 that suggests pore blocking mechanism for this membrane in contrast figs 10e and f display a lower extent of particle penetration within the membrane pores which verifies that standard blocking is not a dominant fouling mechanism in pes 100 kda membrane with pre filtration yet fig 10f illustrates particles cake deposition on the membrane surface and confirms that cake formation is the primary mechanism of flux decline in this experiment 4 5 implication of the findings we presented the viability of using blocking model proposed by hermia et al to discover the fouling mechanism in pw filtration with uf membranes fouling mechanisms identified in this work can be used to design pw treatment for recycle and reuse applications using uf membranes in general fouling is divided into two categories reversible and irreversible reversible fouling occurs when particles are loosely attached to the membranes surface which typically results in reduced membrane flux 23 35 cake filtration can largely be considered as reversible fouling 36 although compaction of the cake layer can transform it to irreversible fouling 37 physical in place cleaning approaches such as simple washing hydraulic cleaning or pneumatic methods can be used to remove the reversible cake foulants 23 on the other hand fouling within the porous structure of the membrane is widely considered irreversible which is more difficult to remove harsh chemical cleaning along with back pulse washing should be used to partially remove the foulants and recover the membrane permeability our results suggest that membranes with larger pores and higher flux are more suitable for such application for recycle and reuse applications removing very small particulates will not be necessary hence significant operating lower pressure and capital smaller membrane area and longer lifetime savings can be achieved when proper pore size is selected nonetheless more filtration tests at various operating conditions e g transmembrane pressure feed flow rate in tangential mode etc should be conducted to discover the most optimized filtration conditions for the treatment of such complex wastewater the final design of such filtration process requires a comprehensive research that investigates various in place cleaning approaches for recovering the membrane permeability one major challenge to design such process however is the fact that the produced water composition and chemistry is subject to spatial and temporal changes which make the design of such process more complex generally the primary mechanism of separation for such application is the size exclusion 38 therefore we expect that fouling modes in uf membranes are independent of the chemical characteristics of the membrane and the interactions between the particles and the membrane surface instead this separation will be influenced by the size and the shape of the suspended particulates based on hermia blocking model 25 size of the particles can contribute to different fouling mechanisms while shape of the particles influences the k value or fluid consistency index in each of the modes 25 for the complete pore blocking mechanism the particles with approximately the same size of the pores can seal particular pores and reduce membrane active area however in intermediate blocking there is a chance for particles to either deposit on previously deposited particles or occupy an open pore standard blocking occurs when smaller foulants penetrate through the membrane pores and stick to the walls causing smaller pore volume and flux rate cake filtration mechanism occurs when layers of the large particles build up on the membrane surface and elevate the membrane resistance toward mass transfer 5 conclusion dead end flow filtration tests were used to elucidate on the mechanism of fouling and analysis of the flux decline in uf of pw the hermia model was used to characterize the fouling mechanism with various blocking models the rate and the extent of fouling were assessed under different conditions including different pore sizes tmp and pre filtration overall results suggest that the absolute rate of flux decline was higher for more permeable membranes although percentage flux decline was similar or reversed blocking mechanisms were observed for 10 and 100 kda membranes followed by cake formation while the rapid particle accumulation on 500 kda membranes led to cake formation almost immediately in very low tmp experiments the smaller driving force also led to immediate cake formation at a very early stage of filtration complete pore blocking mode was not observed in any of the experiments we hypothesize that this is due to the interactions between the particles in pw which lets foulants to deposit on other particles rather than occupy free membrane surface nomenclature v permeate volume m3 vp particle volume m3 m permeate mass changes kg r pore radius m q volumetric permeate flow rate m3 s q0

12829,flux decline measurements provided insight into the fouling behavior of ultrafiltration uf membranes for produced water pw treatment three uf membranes were compared in terms of the rate and the intensity of fouling the flux decline analysis showed the fouling transition from blocking mechanisms i e complete and intermediate blocking as well as standard blocking to cake formation occurs earlier for more permeable membranes lower trans membrane pressure tmp of 0 1 bar led to particle accumulation on the membrane surface leading to cake formation as the predominant fouling mechanism in higher tmp experiments standard and intermediate blocking followed by cake formation were found to be apparent fouling mechanisms overall for the membranes with higher permeabilities and for the filtrations with pre filtered feed faster transition to cake formation was observerd primarily due to crowd out effect by understanding membrane fouling and behavior it is possible to mitigate performance losses in membrane based technologies that could be used for the treatment of pw this study provides information to identify blocking rate and intensity in various conditions for uf membranes when treating pw graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fouling ultrafiltration produced water blocking mechanism cake formation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction produced water pw is the largest waste byproduct of oil and gas production but this wastewater stream can be partially treated and considered a valuable water resource pw is an oil in water emulsion that contains organic and inorganic constituents including a mixture of hydrocarbons dissolved minerals suspended and dissolved solids chemical compounds and dissolved gasses 1 globally the production of pw is estimated to be three times that of the oil production and this ratio is about 7 1 in the us since most of the oil wells are past peak production 2 to manage the pw the oil and gas business typically dispose of pw by injection into class ii salt water disposal wells while less than 10 is recycled or reused outside of the oil and gas industry 3 4 since pw management is becoming increasingly challenging 3 fit for purpose approaches are receiving more attention irrigation of non edible crops reuse for slickwater or water flood injection fracturing are the most immediate applications for recycle and reuse direct reuse in industry has been also proposed 5 6 several studies have investigated various treatment technologies to increase the reuse of pw 1 7 9 a variety of approaches are reported such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf electrodialysis ed 1 10 membrane distillation 9 11 14 adsorption sand filtration gas floatation electroflocculation 15 chemical precipitation and oxidation 7 membrane based separations are increasingly of interest because of potentially lower energy consumption modularity small footprint and reduced chemical consumption 16 particularly uf shows to be a promising method to pretreat pw in terms of oil grease and colloidal particulate removal 8 17 18 in some cases a primary pretreatment such as coagulation and sedimentation are used prior to uf to mitigate fouling 8 the major challenge facing the application of membranes for pw treatment is fouling which is due to the aggregation of unwanted particles on the surface or in the membrane pores several factors are affecting the intensity of membrane fouling and flux decline in treating pw water quality and operating conditions are particularly important considerations the major water characteristics that influence the intensity of fouling on the membrane surface are total organic carbon toc total suspended solids tss and oil and grease concentrations the particle size of suspended solids in the water is known to be also influential it is reported that the fouling intensity is strongly related to the membrane s pore geometry and surface charge 19 to date most of the membrane based pretreatments are focused on using mf membranes although colloidal particles viruses and bacteria can foul the membrane pores he et al 20 reported severe fouling in mf when the size of particles and the membrane s pores are approximately similar xiong et al 21 observed reduced fouling with mf after removing submicron particles 0 4 0 8 μm from pw overall fouling leads to reduced membrane permeability and consequently increased energy consumption permeability reduction generally occurs in two consecutive sections including concentration polarization cp in the boundary layer followed by particles buildup on the membrane surface 22 the latter would be more critical to focus on for uf because cp becomes concerning when the solute can be rejected by the membrane and it is considered reversible on the other hand fouling decreases the throughput of the membrane it can also reduce the lifetime of the membrane primarily as frequent cleaning with chemical agents will be required 23 mitigating the fouling has been always a subject of the research in the field of membranes either the feed should be pretreated to remove the foulants or the operating conditions should be optimized to mitigate the extent of the fouling one example is the concept of the critical flux presented by field et al 24 that is defined as the flux at which fouling starts to be significant the fouling and flux decline over time are not significant at fluxes lower than the critical flux this work evaluates both of these strategies to mitigate the fouling of uf membrane for the filtration of pw many studies have reported various modeling approaches to investigate membrane fouling especially for protein separation using mf and uf a classical fouling model developed by hermia has been proposed which defined four different fouling mechanisms complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking standard blocking and cake filtration 25 ho and zydney 26 also developed a mathematical model showing a smooth transition between two fouling mechanisms which is compatible with the experimental data in protein separation using mf bolton et al 27 extended the latter model to develop a combined fouling model for all the individual mechanisms for both constant pressure and constant flux in dead end flow mode duclos orsello et al 28 also developed a new model for internal and external fouling of bsa on mf to define characteristic time of individual fouling the mechanisms developed by hermia was used in this work whcih formed the basis for the present analysis that is discussed below in this study the mechanism and rate of fouling for the filtration of pw have been investigated with real pw and different uf membranes the data is evaluated for mechanistic understanding and to correlate predict fouling using the hermia model 25 the study also examined the effects of membrane pore size tmp and pre filtration on the membrane fouling behavior moreover fouling transition between various mechanisms has been investigated using flux decline analysis 2 modeling of membrane fouling hermia developed a simple but comprehensive model based upon the pore fouling mechanisms the complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking standard blocking and cake filtration modes of fouling are schematically illustrated in fig 1 overall the proposed model relates the cumulative permeate volume v to time t and a general equation to define this relationship is proposed in eq 1 in which different fouling mechanisms are represented by the blocking index n 1 d 2 t dv 2 k dt dv n where d2t dv2 is the resistance coefficient and dt dv is the reciprocal of the volumetric flow rate or the membrane resistance to obtain the blocking index from hermia model the equation should be first linearized as defined in eq 2 2 log d 2 t dv 2 log k nlog dt dv the experimental flux results can then be plotted and the value of n can be calculated using data fitting methodologies to identify the fouling mechanism 2 1 complete pore blocking complete pore blocking involves deposition of suspended particles or colloids on the membrane surface over time which ultimately leads to blocking membrane pores as shown in fig 1a in complete pore blocking the permeate flux decreases linearly and the blocked area decreases in proportion to the volume of the permeate as described below 3 a t a 0 σv where σ is defined as the blocking coefficient which is a function of physical properties of the foulant according to darcy s law q pa μr the permeate flow rate has a linear relation with the permeate volume for complete pore blocking 4 q t q 0 k b v where the permeate flow rate q is equal to dv dt substituting q in eq 4 with dv dt in eq 1 gives the hermia model for complete blocking with the blocking index equal to 2 5 d 2 t dv 2 k b dt dv 2 2 2 intermediate pore blocking in intermediate pore blocking some of the blocking particles settle over the previously collected particles as a result the membrane active area declines less severely than in complete pore blocking mode the reduction in the active area is assumed to be proportional to the fraction of the membrane surface that is blocked by particles 6 a t dt a t σ v t dt a t a 0 considering vt dt qtdt integration with respect to t gives the permeate flow equation as follows 7 1 q t 1 q 0 σ a 0 t substituting 1 q t in eq 7 with dt dv in eq 1 provides the fouling model for intermediate blocking with a blocking index of 1 8 d 2 t dv 2 k i dt dv 2 3 standard blocking standard blocking also known as the pore constriction refers to the reduction of the pore volume due to the accumulation of particles within the pores of the membrane the reduction in the volume of a cylindrical pore with the length of l due to the reduction of the pore radius dr is 9 ρ v p in ρ v p out ρ n 2 πrdr l where ρ and vp are the particle density and volume respectively and n indicates the number of pores on the membrane surface integration of eq 9 and substitution of r as a function of the permeate volume in poiseuille s equation for cylindrical systems gives the volumetric permeate flow rate for the standard blocking mechanism 10 q q 0 1 k s v 2 consequently combining the general flux model eq 1 with eq 10 leads to eq 11 shown below suggesting a blocking index of 3 2 11 d 2 t dv 2 k s dt dv 3 2 where 12 k s 2 k s q 0 1 2 2 4 cake filtration cake filtration is the result of accumulation of a continuous layer of fouling particles on the membrane surface this cake layer results in increasing the total membrane resistance toward the permeate flow the filtration resistance is defined as the summation of the membrane resistance r0 and cake resistance 13 r tot r 0 α w a where α is the specific cake resistance and w is the dry mass of the cake which is a function of the permeate volume and physical properties of the cake and is defined as 14 w v ρ f 1 mf where m represents as the mass ratio of the wet to dry cake whereas f is defined as dry solid fraction according to eqs 13 and 14 the following relationship can be derived 15 r tot r 0 1 k c q 0 v where kc is defined as the model constant in the cake filtration mechanism the permeate flow rate in the cake filtration mode is a function of permeate volume that can be obtained from darcy s law 16 q q 0 1 k c q 0 v by substitution q in eq 16 with dv dt in eq 1 the cake filtration equation can be written as below 17 d 2 t dv 2 k c based on eq 17 for the cake filtration mechanism the change in the membrane resistance with respect to the permeate volume remains constant and the blocking index is 0 cake filtration is expected to be the final stage of fouling when pore particle interactions are led to maximum pore blocking the blocking indices n and model constants k for various mechanisms are summarized in table 1 the initial permeate flux was calculated by extrapolating the smoothed flux data the criterion to identify the blocking index was based on calculating the slope for adjacent points with deviation of 0 2 for each blocking index e g the slopes equal to 1 3 and 1 7 were considered as standard blocking with n 1 5 the time to permeate derivatives in eq 2 are inversely proportional to the permeate flux j via the following relations 18 dt dv 1 ja 19 d 2 t dv 2 1 j 3 a 2 dj dt in this paper we seek to evaluate the fouling mechanisms for filtration of pw using uf membranes with different molecular weight cut offs mwcos the transition between various mechanisms during filtration has been observed in various filtration applications 28 30 31 but herein the rate and extent of fouling is evaluated for the filtration of samples of produced water from the permian basin texas the experimental data of flux versus time was used to derive the first dt dv and the second d2t dv2 derivatives of time over cumulative volume of the permeate the slope of the resulting curves identifies the blocking mechanism the identification of the mechanisms and rate of fouling with different membranes was used to reach conclusions about the feasibility of using uf under optimized conditions for pw pretreatment 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials three different flat sheet hydrophilic polyethersulfone pes uf membranes with the nominal mwco of 10 100 and 500 kda were provided by emd millipore burlington ma the characteristics of the membranes used in this work are summarized in table 2 hydrophilic pes based uf membrane was chosen since it is one of the most widely used and

filtration mode a stainless steel pressure vessel was used to accommodate larger feed volumes for longer filtration tests constant transmembrane pressure tmp was applied using pressurized nitrogen a pressure transducer was used to accurately monitor the feed side pressure in the permeate side treated water was collected in a beaker placed over a balance which was connected to a computer to record the permeate weight over time via labview software the permeate flux j as a function of time t was calculated using eq 20 20 j m ρ w a t where m is the change in the permeate mass during a time period of t a is the active membrane filtration area and ρw is the density of permeate water in some of the experiments the pw was first pre filtered with a 0 45 μm filter to begin an experiment a clean

measured and results are shown in fig 3 the pw sample showed two peaks at 1 and 4 μm with a slight peak at 128 nm after glass fiber filtration the permeate shows a peak at 0 45 μm which is very consistent with the rejection performance of glass fiber filter for suspended solids filtration since the larger particles 0 45 μm are retained by the glass fiber filter particles that permeated through the membrane show the maximum volume percentage in psd profile the filtered water with uf membrane almost shows no specific peak in the detection limit range of 64 4096 nm there is a sharp peak showing up at around 8000 nm which is an artifact of sample preparation or the analysis it should be also noted that this peak is at the borderline of the machine s detection limit presence of any particulates left in the sample holder or introduced to the water during the water handling could lead to this unexpected peak results suggest that particles above 0 45 μm are removed by the glass fiber filter and 100 kda uf membrane almost completely removed all the suspended particulates 4 2 fouling analysis tests fig 4a presents typical experimental data for the flux decline as a function of permeate volume for 10 100 and 500 kda pes membranes when treating raw pw at 0 5 bar tmp the initial flux for pes 500 kda is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the other two membranes owing to its larger pore size fig 4b displays dj dt versus the permeate volume dj dt is an absolute measure of the rate of flux decline results indicate that the rate of the flux decline is significantly more severe for the pes 500 kda membrane while pes 10 and 100 kda displayed almost similar rates of flux decline this finding is in agreement with the widely accepted notion that higher flux leads to faster flux decline in the membrane 31 the percentage reduction in flux at the end of the experiment was approximately 40 for the 500 kda membrane and 65 and 70 for the 10 and 100 kda membranes respectively the mathematical model and the determination of the fouling index are extremely sensitive to noisy data to analyze the flux decline behavior and apply the mathematical model provided in eq 2 the original data obtained from filtration experiments were smoothed using the minimizing the squared error approach fig 5 displays an example fitted line to the smoothed data points and the original flux data collected for pes 10 kda membrane only the smoothed data were used to calculate numerical values for the membrane resistance eq 18 and resistance coefficient eq 19 the second derivative of the time over volume d2t dv2 the hermia model was used for the flux decline analysis of the smoothed data obtained from pw filtrations fouling transitions that occurred during the filtration are highlighted by marked points in fig 6a which corresponds to a specific time and permeate volume in which the transition took place in fig 6a slopes of 1 or greater which are observed for the 10 and 100 kda membranes suggest blocking mechanisms complete intermediate or standard which are followed by slopes less than 1 indicating a transition to cake formation in the later stage of fouling this transition occurs almost immediately after starting the filtration with 500 kda membrane fig 6b displays the relationship between the membrane resistance vs cumulative permeate volume for these experiments the curves in 6b initially show an increasing slope followed by a period of decreasing slope the increased resistance of the membranes with smaller pore openings is reflected in the initial values shown in this figure it is evident that membranes with smaller pores display sharper slopes the dashed lines highlight the specific permeate volume at which the fouling mechanism switches from a blocking mechanism to cake formation based upon the change in curvature of the slope fig 6b this behavior has also been noted for mf of bovine serum albumin 28 overall the curvature analysis shown in fig 6b is in a good agreement with the detailed flux decline analysis that is summarized in table 4 based on fig 6a before elaborating on various fouling mechanisms observed in fig 6 it is critical to note that blocking mechanism is influenced by the concentration of the suspended solids the amount of solids retained and accumulated on the membrane surface and the flux through the membrane overall there are two important competing effects that should be considered on one hand when more particles reach the membrane surface simultaneously there is a greater chance for the particles to form a cake layer than migrating into the pores this is primarily due to the crowding out effect caused by the simultaneous arrival of particles with various sizes on the membrane surface 33 on the other hand at higher flux there will be a higher linear velocity at the pore entrance that leads to greater drag forces therefore particles with diameters smaller than the pore can potentially migrate more easily into the membrane pore given that the pore entrance is open for the penetration the flux decline analysis for pes 10 kda displays an initial blocking index of 1 5 which suggests standard blocking for a short period of time after approximately 5 ml of permeate was collected this fouling mechanism was followed by the intermediate pore blocking for a much longer period the peak of the curve in fig 6a occurs after collecting 74 ml of permeate at 2900 s of filtration showing fouling transition from blocking mechanism to cake formation when flux is roughly 60 of its initial value which based upon the analysis described in section 2 approximately 40 of the membrane active surface is blocked at this stage of filtration the negative slope point 4 to 5 does not correspond to any of the classical hermia fouling mechanisms and it can be translated to a transition region from blocking to cake formation 30 31 finally in the last stage of filtration the membrane resistance with respect to the permeate volume remained constant suggesting a fully formed cake on the surface of the membrane for the pes 100 kda a similar behavior was observed but the fouling transition from standard blocking to the intermediate blocking occurred after longer period larger pores of pes 100 kda membrane allows larger portion of suspended particles enter the pores and accumulate within the pores of the membrane the curve peak occurs when roughly 53 of the membrane active surface was blocked suggesting that the transition took place after a greater degree of fouling had occurred in contrast to pes 10 and 100 kda there was a very high initial permeate flux observed for pes 500 kda which resulted in an instant blocking index equal to 1 proceeded by a rapid transition to the cake formation the average permeate flux for pes 500 kda was one order of magnitude lager than pes 100 kda in the early stage of the filtration the blocking index in this case fell below 1 quickly because large number of particles with different sizes arrived at the membrane surface simultaneously due to higher flux provided by pes 500 kda as a result of the crowing out effect discussed earlier the particles immediately formed a cake layer therefore pes 500 kda membrane did not display any of the blocking mechanisms except the cake formation the same observation was reported for the fouling of polymethyl methacrylate in dead end microfiltration experiments earlier 33 all the pw feed was filtered before there was a fully formed cake suggesting that the pores were large enough to allow a considerable portion of the foulants to pass through the membrane in all these fouling experiments a transition from complete intermediate and standard blocking to cake formation can be observed except the case for pes 500 kda that the transition was rapid and not well defined a general observation is that the shift to cake formation takes place faster in more permeable membranes which is expected as higher permeation of the water leads to faster accumulation of the suspended particulates on the membrane surface in other words the rate of the flux decline is faster for more permeable membranes in early stages of filtration the same result for 75 kda and 2 kda cellulose acetate uf is also observed for the filtration of humic acid 31 4 3 effect of tmp pw filtration tests were carried out at various tmps and results are illustrated in fig 7 for these filtration tests pes 100 kda membrane was chosen as this membrane showed a variety of different fouling modes at low tmp suspended particles can rapidly accumulate on the membrane surface as the drag force is not large enough to push the particles permeate through the membrane similar behavior was also observed by hwang et al 33 who investigated the polymethyl methacrylate removal using mf over a range of tmp and concluded that cake filtration dominates at low filtration rates at higher pressures there is a greater tendency for suspended matter to penetrate the membrane and hence leading to the observation of other blocking mechanisms table 5 summarizes the fouling mechanisms transition time and permeate volume for the filtration tests performed at various tmps in the early stage of filtration at 0 5 and 1 bar standard blocking followed by intermediate blocking are the apparent fouling mechanisms with a subsequent shift to cake formation at higher tmp the transition to cake formation occurs later in terms of the permeate volume filtered more specific details of the effect of tmp on the fouling mechanism are summarized in table 5 4 4 effect of pw pre filtration to better understand the fouling pattern in pw filtration with uf we conducted more experiments with pre filtered water a glass microfiber filter gf with pore diameter of 0 47 μm and pes 100 kda membrane were used to pre filter the pw and the filtered water was then used for filtration with pes 10 kda as displayed in fig 8a these results are compared against the filtration with pes 10 kda without any pre filtration depending on the pore size of the filters pre filtration can remove a large portion of the suspended solids and lead to better performance in the subsequent filtration higher flux fig 8b displays the flux decline analysis for pes 10 kda filtration after pre filtration with gf and pes 100 kda fig 8a shows that the rapid initial permeate flux decline was reduced in pre filtered tests as compared to raw pw experiment which clearly indicates the impact of suspended solids on the fouling behavior the least reduction in permeate flux was observed for the filtration of prefiltered water with pes 100 kda therefore it is expected to have lower blocking rate compared to other tests when gf was used prior to pes 10 kda the blocking index at an early stage was less than 1 0 4 the blocking index for a the pre filtered pw sample with pes 100 kda was also small suggesting that in both cases the fouling mechanism is cake formation almost immediately after starting the filtration the small values 1 for the blocking index is also reported for high filtration rate experiments in other studies 33 34 the overview of the findings in fig 8 are summarized in table 6 figs 9a and b display similar behavior when a gf filter was used as a pre filter for the pes 100 kda membrane the initial flux is higher and there is an almost immediate transition to cake formation with no apparent blocking mechanisms based upon the curves in fig 9a there is an initial dramatic reduction in the flux for real pw test until approximately 100 ml of permeate is collected hence the blocking intensity is higher compared to the pre filtered test table 7 provides a summary of fouling analysis and more details of the flux decline analysis displayed in fig 9b the test without pre filtration lasted longer in the high blocking rate region indicating a more severe fouling compared to pre filtered test the peak value occured much earlier for pre filtered test after only 19 ml of collected permeate corresponded to 170 s compared to the real pw test which suggests that fouling transition to the cake formation happened at early stage of filtration for pre filtered test the values of j j0 at this point represent that only 5 of the membrane surface was covered by foulants in pre filtered test while more than half of the membrane surface area was blocked before fouling transition in raw pw test characterization of the fouled membranes is not a straightforward task foulants are soft and unstable and will deform during the membrane cutting into strips for cross sectional imaging to verify the fouling mechanisms identified by the hermia model two of the membranes that displayed very different fouling mechanisms pes 10 kda with untreated pw and pes 100 kda with gf filter pre filtered pw were considered for imaging fig 10 shows digital and electron microscopy images of these membranes as displayed pre filtration with gf filter significantly reduces the thickness of the cake formed on the membrane surface which results in higher flux and less severe flux decline compare figs s1 and s4 figs 10b and c display the cross sectional image of pes 10 kda in different magnifications we confirmed that darker shaded areas in the image display the areas and pores of the membrane that were fouled cake formation on the membrane surface and particle penetration inside the pores are obvious in this membrane which is in good agreement with the results in table 4 that suggests pore blocking mechanism for this membrane in contrast figs 10e and f display a lower extent of particle penetration within the membrane pores which verifies that standard blocking is not a dominant fouling mechanism in pes 100 kda membrane with pre filtration yet fig 10f illustrates particles cake deposition on the membrane surface and confirms that cake formation is the primary mechanism of flux decline in this experiment 4 5 implication of the findings we presented the viability of using blocking model proposed by hermia et al to discover the fouling mechanism in pw filtration with uf membranes fouling mechanisms identified in this work can be used to design pw treatment for recycle and reuse applications using uf membranes in general fouling is divided into two categories reversible and irreversible reversible fouling occurs when particles are loosely attached to the membranes surface which typically results in reduced membrane flux 23 35 cake filtration can largely be considered as reversible fouling 36 although compaction of the cake layer can transform it to irreversible fouling 37 physical in place cleaning approaches such as simple washing hydraulic cleaning or pneumatic methods can be used to remove the reversible cake foulants 23 on the other hand fouling within the porous structure of the membrane is widely considered irreversible which is more difficult to remove harsh chemical cleaning along with back pulse washing should be used to partially remove the foulants and recover the membrane permeability our results suggest that membranes with larger pores and higher flux are more suitable for such application for recycle and reuse applications removing very small particulates will not be necessary hence significant operating lower pressure and capital smaller membrane area and longer lifetime savings can be achieved when proper pore size is selected nonetheless more filtration tests at various operating conditions e g transmembrane pressure feed flow rate in tangential mode etc should be conducted to discover the most optimized filtration conditions for the treatment of such complex wastewater the final design of such filtration process requires a comprehensive research that investigates various in place cleaning approaches for recovering the membrane permeability one major challenge to design such process however is the fact that the produced water composition and chemistry is subject to spatial and temporal changes which make the design of such process more complex generally the primary mechanism of separation for such application is the size exclusion 38 therefore we expect that fouling modes in uf membranes are independent of the chemical characteristics of the membrane and the interactions between the particles and the membrane surface instead this separation will be influenced by the size and the shape of the suspended particulates based on hermia blocking model 25 size of the particles can contribute to different fouling mechanisms while shape of the particles influences the k value or fluid consistency index in each of the modes 25 for the complete pore blocking mechanism the particles with approximately the same size of the pores can seal particular pores and reduce membrane active area however in intermediate blocking there is a chance for particles to either deposit on previously deposited particles or occupy an open pore standard blocking occurs when smaller foulants penetrate through the membrane pores and stick to the walls causing smaller pore volume and flux rate cake filtration mechanism occurs when layers of the large particles build up on the membrane surface and elevate the membrane resistance toward mass transfer 5 conclusion dead end flow filtration tests were used to elucidate on the mechanism of fouling and analysis of the flux decline in uf of pw the hermia model was used to characterize the fouling mechanism with various blocking models the rate and the extent of fouling were assessed under different conditions including different pore sizes tmp and pre filtration overall results suggest that the absolute rate of flux decline was higher for more permeable membranes although percentage flux decline was similar or reversed blocking mechanisms were observed for 10 and 100 kda membranes followed by cake formation while the rapid particle accumulation on 500 kda membranes led to cake formation almost immediately in very low tmp experiments the smaller driving force also led to immediate cake formation at a very early stage of filtration complete pore blocking mode was not observed in any of the experiments we hypothesize that this is due to the interactions between the particles in pw which lets foulants to deposit on other particles rather than occupy free membrane surface nomenclature v permeate volume m3 vp particle volume m3 m permeate mass changes kg r pore radius m q volumetric permeate flow rate m3 s q0
