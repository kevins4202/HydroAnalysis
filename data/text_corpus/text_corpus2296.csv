11480,soilless zucchini cucurbita pepo l crops were grown in two distinct cropping periods spring summer ss and autumn winter aw using irrigation water with different ca2 concentrations 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 mm the objectives of this study were to i mathematically correlate the accumulation of ca2 in the root environment with the respective ca2 water uptake ratio namely uptake concentration uc and ii determine the uc of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg under these conditions equations of the literature initially developed to predict nacl accumulation in a closed hydroponic system were further extended to fit experimental results the evolution of ca2 accumulation in the drainage exhibited a sigmoid pattern with time and the relationship between the concentration of ca2 in the root zone and the corresponding uptake ratio ca2 water was better described by curvilinear functions validation of the model showed a very good agreement between simulated and measured values increasing ca2 levels

the empirical model parameterized and tested in this work may serve as a tool to predict ca2 ion concentrations in the root environment of zucchini crops as relationships of the water absorbed by the crop finally the results showed that in soilless zucchini crops with zero discharge of fertigation effluents there is no compelling reason not to use irrigation water resources with ca2 concentration up to 3 mm keywords cucurbita pepo closed hydroponics growth yield photosynthesis 1 introduction recently for either environmental or economic purposes recycling of the nutrient solution ns in soilless cultivation systems is becoming a common practice in mediterranean greenhouses katsoulas et al 2015 however it is well known that the progress of ns recycling particularly when the source water is of poor quality may result in the accumulation of unwanted e g sodium or unused e g bivalent cations elements at higher levels than thresholds in the root zone solution with adverse effects on growth and yield bar yosef 2008 the accumulation of na and cl ions in the recycled solution is the most common problem in closed hydroponic systems and for this reason was the subject of several studies in the past stimulating the development of modelling tools sonneveld et al 1999 carmassi et al 2003 2005 kempkes and stanghellini 2003 savvas et al 2005 2007 bar yosef 2008 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 such models may either require several input parameters e g silberbush et al 2005 or simply correlate the accumulation of salt ions with a single variable e g savvas et al 2008 the latter model approach comprise mass balance models which relate salt accumulation in the recycled ns with the cumulative plant water consumption on the basis of an empirical relationship between ion to water uptake ratios namely uptake concentrations uc by the crop and their concentrations in the root zone these relationships may be described either by linear or exponential functions for a series of vegetables and flowers sonneveld et al 1999 carmassi et al 2005 for vegetables such as bean cucumber pepper tomato and melon linear relationships proved to be appropriate but in many cases exponential functions were better savvas et al 2005 2007 2008 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 although the problems of salinity in closed hydroponics originate mainly from nacl as already mentioned problems arising also from high ca2 ion concentrations in the raw water mediterranean types of irrigation water are rich in nacl but also in calcium bicarbonates katsoulas et al 2015 which can exceed the ca2 to water uptake ratio uc by the crop sonneveld and voogt 2009 in mediterranean soils hot and dry conditions enhance the release rates of ca2 ions to the soil solution and this in turn increase ca2 concentration in irrigation water resources often at excessive concentrations neocleous and savvas 2013 thus if there is no alternative source of fresh water to prepare ns mediterranean growers to cope with these difficulties frequently discharge all or a part of the drainage water thereby lowering the efficiency of recycling to reduce water and fertilizer consumption and subsequent environmental pollution varlagas et al 2010 therefore to minimize salt accumulation in soilless growing systems with recirculating ns specifically when the quality of irrigation water is suboptimal water often rich in na but also in ca2 implementation of efficient technologies and appropriate mathematical models is required katsoulas et al 2015 in author s previous work neocleous and savvas 2017 a generic empirical model on the basis of a mass balance equation simulating nacl accumulation in relation with water uptake in soilless zucchini crops was developed and successfully tested however model based predictions of ca2 accumulation in the root zone of closed hydroponic zucchini crops have not been addressed to date hence both model versions could be implemented in decision support systems dss for the better management of the ns in zucchini crops soilless zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l is an important cultivated crop in the mediterranean region and seems to give higher yield than conventional crops rouphael et al 2004 furthermore its small size and short growing cycle enables zucchini crops to be easily grown in liquid systems such as nutrient film technique nft a standard method of water and nutrient replenishment in nft type systems requires the preparation of a nutrient solution with composition based on mean uptake ratios of nutrients namely uptake concentrations ucs de kreij et al 1999 sonneveld and voogt 2009 savvas et al 2013 this solution is subsequently automatically blended with the ns that drains out of the root zone to form the outgoing irrigation solution savvas 2002 however to optimize nutritional schemes for crops growing in closed hydroponics in mediterranean countries ucs previously determined under northern european climates e g de kreij et al 1999 should be adapted to specific climatic conditions and peculiarities of irrigation water adams 2002 in view of the above the objectives of the current work were to i mathematically correlate the accumulation of ca2 in the root zone and the respective ca2 water uptake ratio namely uptake concentration uc using existing generic models initially developed to predict salt accumulation in a closed hydroponic system and ii determine ucs of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg under progressive accumulation of ca2 ions in the recycled solution and thus in the root zone finally plant tissue nutrient concentrations plant biomass production fruit yield and quality and parameters of photosynthesis were measured as crop response indices 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions two experiments were conducted in a multi span with arched roof polyethylene greenhouse n s oriented at the experimental farm of the agricultural research institute cyprus latitude 34 44 n longitude 33 19 e altitude 8 m a s l under natural light conditions the greenhouse was equipped with heating ventilation and cooling systems for greenhouse climate control the first experiment was set up from 4 april to 27 june 2016 spring summer crop ss and the second one from 14 september to 22 december 2016 autumn winter crop aw in both experiments seedlings of the green cultivar anita f1 seminis netherlands of zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l were transferred at the stage of two true leaves into twenty independent hydroponic circuits nutrient film technique nft gullies with continues and total recycling of the ns each of the nft gullies experimental units 6 0 m in length 0 25 m in width and 0 10 m in height accommodated 10 squash plants and the spacing resulted in a plant density of about 2 0 plants m 2 at the end of each gully a tank was used to collect and supply the recirculating ns while a reservoir tank was used to replenish nutrient and water losses from the system maintaining a constant recirculation volume neocleous and savvas 2015 2016 experimental treatments comprised four different ca2 concentrations i e 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 mm in the supplied ns table 1 which commenced immediately after transplanting up to the end of the experiments the replenishment ns with composition given in table 1 was automatically blended with the ns that drained out of the root zone to prepare the irrigation solution supplied to the plants no drainage water was discharged from the system and water losses were negligible due to full coverage of the channels external plant rows aimed as guard plants the plants were supported by a plastic string attached to base of the stem to an overhead wire at 2 20 m above plant row measurements were performed in the first experiment ss crop while the second experiment aw crop was commissioned to test the efficiency of the model to predict the course of ca2 accumulation in the root zone of zucchini squash 2 2 model outline the following equations initially developed to predict salt nacl accumulation in closed loop hydroponics sonneveld et al 1999 carmassi et al 2005 were further extended to correlate the accumulation of ca2 in the drainage solution and thus in the root zone ccas with the respective ca2 water uptake ratio ccau in zucchini crops 1 ccau Î±ccas b 2 ccau mccas in a closed hydroponic system with total recycling of the ns the only input of ca2 and water is through the fresh ns introduced into the system while the only removal is through plant uptake thus the ca2 water input ratio corresponds to the concentration of ca2 in the fresh ns ccaw whereas ca2 water removal corresponds to the uptake concentration uc mass of nutrient per volume of water absorbed of ca2 ccau by the crop hence the increase of the ccas relates to the increase of the water added to the system vw and to the difference between input and removal of ca2 ccaw ccau and conversely to the volume of the recycled solution vs this relationship is specified savvas et al 2005 like shown in formula 3 3 dccas dvw ccaw ccau vs replacing 1 and 2 in 3 the previous formula becomes 4 dccas dvw ccaw Î±ccas b vs 5 dccas dvw ccaw mccas vs with similar approaches and assumptions as used in simplified models for salt nacl accumulation in closed loop hydroponics savvas et al 2005 2008 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 values for Î± b and m were calculated by applying nonlinear regression analysis on experimental data using as models 1 and 2 subsequently formulas 4 and 5 were used to predict ca2 concentrations in the root environment ccas in relation to the cumulative water absorbed by the crop which amounts to vw savvas et al 2007 to statistically evaluate the performance of the model simulated and measured data from crops planted at different times were subjected to linear regression analysis 1 1 relationship 2 3 analyses samples of recycled and replenishment ns from each experimental unit were collected 0 20 40 60 and 80 days after treatment initiation dat and analyzed on the basis of macronutrient concentration i e n p k ca and mg the mean uptake concentration ucx mmol l 1 of the x macronutrient i e k ca2 mg2 no3 nh4 h2po4 was determined by measuring nutrient and water uptake from the system following neocleous and savvas 2015 like shown in formula 6 6 ucx vs cxin cxf vw cxadd vw where vs was the volume of the recycled solution in the experimental units l vw was the water volume added to the closed system l cxin cxf was the difference between initial and final concentration of the nutrient x in the recycled solution mmol l 1 cxadd was the concentration of the nutrient x in the ns used to replenish nutrients and water to the system mmol l 1 the uc of n was calculated summing over ammonium and nitrate concentrations the measurements in solution samples were then used to determine the removal of nutrients per volume unit of water absorbed from the recirculating ns this procedure is considered suitable to estimate crop nutrient uptake in nft culture pardossi et al 2004 on the same dates plants were harvested and used to determine tissue concentrations of selected macronutrients n p k ca and mg in leaves stems fruits and roots the extraction of p k ca and mg from dried and finely ground subsamples of plant material was performed using the wet digestion procedure by mixed acids hno3 hclo4 the nitrogen concentrations in plant tissues were determined after mineralization of plant material with sulfuric acid using the kjeldahl procedure mills and jones 1996 concentrations of k and na were determined by flame photometry afp 100 biotech engineering management co ltd london uk and the concentrations of ca and mg were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry shimadzu aa 700 shimadzu scientific instruments kyoto japan phosphorous was estimated based on phosphomolybdate method at 470 nm yellow complex and 680 nm blue complex in tissue and solution samples respectively using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1700 shimadzu scientific instruments kyoto japan nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 concentrations in solution samples were measured by uv vis spectroscopy at 210 and 653 nm respectively 2 4 measurements leaf gas exchange measurements i e net photosynthesis a stomatal conductance gs substomatal co2

same leaves chlorophyll fluorescence ratio fv fm os 30p opti sciences hudson nh usa electron transport rate etr baker 2008 and water potential Ïw wp4 t decagon devices pullman wa usa were also measured together with gas exchange measurements plant dry weight yield was determined in two plants per experimental unit at crop termination harvesting was performed when fruits reached marketable size over 10 cm length from 4 april to 27 june 2016 ss crop the total number of fruits and weight was determined in each unit to determine total fruit yield and mean fruit weight marketable were considered fruits with acceptable color and quality representative fruits i e fruits of good shape and size excluding outliers from each experimental unit were used for quality analysis analyses of soluble solids ph titratable acidity dry matter total phenolics ferric reducing antioxidant power frap assay and nitrate content were accomplished following procedures described by neocleous et al 2014 and neocleous and savvas 2015 ascorbic acid and sugar content of fruit glucose and fructose concentrations were determined using the reflectometer and reflectoquant test kits merck darmstadt germany the greenhouse air temperature and relative humidity ranged between 15 and 30 c avg 25 7 c in ss crop and 23 6 c in aw crop and 60 80 avg 66 5 respectively the average daily global radiation outside the greenhouse during the experimental period was 23 7 mj m 2 and 14 6 mj m 2 in the ss and aw experiments respectively 2 5 statistics randomized complete block designs were used for both greenhouse experiments experimental treatments comprised four different ca2 concentrations i e 1 5 mm 3 mm 4 5 mm and 6 mm in the irrigation water each replicated four times analysis of variance was performed using sas version 9 2 sas institute inc cary nc usa and figures were drawn using graphpad prism version 5 0 graphpad software san diego california usa regression analysis was conducted to establish relationships between measured data 3 results 3 1 changes in water consumption ec and ca2 concentrations in the root zone as shown in fig 1 the cumulative water consumed by zucchini squash was reduced avg 15 decrease at high ca2 concentrations in the supplied ns i e 4 5 and 6 mm particularly on the last sampling dates and overall the cumulative water consumption averaged 200 l plant ss crop the evolution of ca2 accumulation in the recycled solution with time is also given in fig 1 although the same accumulation pattern sigmoid pattern was observed clear differences in ca2 accumulation levels over the whole cultivation cycle were observed among treatments calcium concentrations progressively increased during experimental period with a more sharp increase up to 60 days after treatment initiation dat but on the last sampling date 80 dat accumulation rates were decreased with a tendency to stabilize to a maximal level according to the ns ca2 concentration fig 1 actually ca2 ions accumulated in the drainage at final concentrations up to 5 12 17 and 22 mm for the ca2 concentrations 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 mm in ns respectively the total salinity namely electrical conductivity ec of the recycled solution gradually increased with time in all treatments data not shown ranging between 1 7 3 0 ds m 1 1 5 mm ca2 2 0 4 7 ds m 1 3 mm ca2 2 3 5 6 ds m 1 4 5 mm ca2 and 2 6 7 2 ds m 1 6 mm ca2 accordingly ec mean values are shown in fig 1 3 2 model parameterization and validation the fig 2 reports the mean ca2 uptake concentrations uc during the whole growth cycle ss crop in relation to the concentrations of ca2 in the root zone solution measured data all data in plot were fit into exponential or linear functions described by eqs 1 and 2 respectively the mathematical representation is based on the assumption that at zero ca2 concentration in the root zone solution the uptake of ca2 would be logically zero no intercept statistical analysis revealed a higher coefficient of determination r2 of an exponential 0 904 than a linear 0 874 function and the best fit relationship is presented therefore using eq 1 as model equation Î± was 0 532 and b was 0 773 actually model calibration resulted in high r2 values which allows the use of prediction equations to simulate ca2 accumulation in closed hydroponic zucchini crops calibration constants Î± and b were further adopted in eq 4 to be solved according to butcher 1987 as suggested by savvas et al 2005 2007 which resulted in the presented curves fig 3 curves correspond to simulated ca2 concentrations in the root environment of zucchini squash by relating them to cumulative water uptake on the other hand symbols in fig 3 depict measured values collected during the second experimental season autumn winter aw crop a very good agreement was observed between simulated and measured values for a wide range of ca2 external concentrations and the whole cultivation cycle fig 3 fig 4 shows model predicted data eq 4 using the ss data set against measured data originate from the validation experiment aw crop the application of linear regression analysis between simulates and measures with all data in plot as indicated by the slope of the linear regression relationship and the coefficient of determination confirmed a very good agreement between the two and the capability of the model to predict ca2 accumulation in the second experimental season fig 4 3 3 uptake concentrations of macronutrients n p k ca and mg based on the removal of nutrient from ns and crop water uptake the effect of increasing external ca2 concentrations on the mean uptake concentrations ucs amount of nutrient absorbed per volume of water consumption of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg is shown in fig 5 the mean uc of ca was influenced by ns treatments particularly the uc of ca increased accordingly to its concentrations in the replenishment ns the mean uc of n similarly to that of ca at 6 mm ca2 was higher than at 1 5 mm ca2 following corresponding ns composition the uc of n at 3 and 4 5 mm ca2 was in between nevertheless the mean ucs of p k and mg remained unaffected by experimental treatments fig 5 reflecting applied ns concentrations overall the ucs of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg averaged 15 3 1 16 6 3 3 4 and 2 0 mm respectively fig 5 with slight differences when data were estimated for vegetative and reproductive phase data not shown 3 4 tissue nutrient concentrations the ca content was higher in leaves than stems and roots whereas fruits showed the lowest content table 2 however in all plant parts ca content increased with increasing ca2 concentrations in the applied ns treatments in leaves and fruits zucchini plants also accumulated higher amounts of nitrogen n concentrations but only at the high ca2 treatment the increase was significant p 5 while in stems and roots n remained unaffected by the applied treatments compared to the control concentrations of p and k in leaves were reduced at moderate and high ca2 ns concentrations while in stems high ca2 imposed a decrease in k content by contrast mg concentration in all plant parts remained unaffected by the applied treatments overall the mean concentrations of n p k ca and mg amounted to 49 9 7 7 65 0 49 6 and 12 9 mg g dw 1 in leaves 57 0 12 5 69 9 6 4 and 5 2 mg g dw 1 in fruits 31 2 8 4 87 4 17 5 and 7 1 mg g dw 1 in stems and 36 9 15 2 48 2 31 7 and 10 6 mg g dw 1 in roots respectively 3 5 plant growth fruit yield and photosynthesis as shown in fig 6 moderate and high ca2 concentrations i e 4 5 and 6 mm in the supplied nutrient solution ns restricted plant dry weight yield total fruit yield marketable yield and mean fruit weight in addition the fruit nitrate content was increased at high

not shown was not significant finally increasing ns ca2 concentration at 6 mm reduced net photosynthetic rate a Î¼mol co2 m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance gs mol h2o m 2 s 1 accordingly chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm ratio electron transport rate etr Î¼mol e m 2 s 1 and leaf water potential Ïw mpa were also reduced at high ca2 levels on the contrary substomatal co2 concentrations ci Î¼mol co2 mol 1 and transpiration rate e mmol h2o m 2 s 1 remained unaffected by the tested treatments table 3 4 discussion increasing ca2 in the supplied nutrient solution ns at moderate and high concentrations i e 4 5 and 6 mm increased total salinity namely electrical conductivity ec in the root zone solution at higher levels 4 2 and 5 5 ds m 1 respectively than recommended thresholds sonneveld and straver 1994 de pascale et al 2013 this was mainly due to the progressive accumulation of ca2 cations in the recycled ns fig 1 which exposed the plants to osmotic stress conditions osmotic effect de pascale et al 2013 as a result the ability of plants to take up water was reduced fig 1 thereby biomass production fruit yield and fruit mean weight were inhibited fig 6 munns 2002 in many crops the photosynthetic rate a and stomatal conductance gs of leaves decreases as leaf water potential Ïw becomes more negative due to increasing water stress thereby reducing growth lawlor 2002 parida and das 2005 indeed in this study lower Ïw showed a good correspondence with a inhibition table 3 however limitations in gs did not induce either proportional decrease in transpiration rates e or lower values of substomatal co2 concentration ci table 3 these results allow us to suggest that stomatal closure was not the main limitation to photosynthesis owing towards the appearance of limitation at chloroplast level in line with this consideration chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm ratio and electron transport rate etr as metabolic components affecting photosynthesis were reduced at high external ca2 concentrations table 3 thus decreases in a and etr coincide with the notion that plants were subjected to nonstomatal down regulation of photosynthesis sÃ¡nchez rodriguez et al 1997 flexas et al 1999 furthermore it is well known that one or more of the metallic micronutrients i e fe mn zn and cu are involved in the metabolism and electron transport system in photosynthesis gianquinto et al 2013 although the metallic micronutrients status in zucchini squash was not evaluated in the present the antagonistic effect of increased external concentrations of bivalent macronutrients e g ca2 on their uptake should be not ruled out adams 2002 summarizing the adverse effects of raised total salt concentrations of ions ec due to the accumulation of ca2 ions in the recycled ns resulted in water imbalances deficits with restrictions on the photosynthetic rate at chloroplast level reducing growth and total fruit yield ashraf and harris 2013 these results imply that zucchini is susceptible not only to nacl stress as reported by savvas et al 2009 but also to nutrient induced stress however the raised ec avg 3 2 ds m 1 in the recycled solution that was replenished with ns ca2 concentration 3 mm did not negatively affected plant growth and yield compared to the control treatment i e 1 5 mm ca2 this could be attributed to the much smaller ec increase than those of the other treatments plus the fact that high ec values are less detrimental under a progressive than an abrupt increase of root zone salinity savvas et al 2005 bar yosef 2008 taking additionally into consideration that calcium contributes to the functioning of root hydraulic conductance under salinity conditions water channels aquaporins silber and bar tal 2008 in this content in another cucurbit such as cucumber with similar threshold salinity values as zucchini sonneveld and straver 1994 bar yosef 2008 suggested an acceptable threshold ec values in the recycled solution of about 4 ds m 1 when the time of exposure to the threshold salinity was relatively short although higher salinity restricts plant growth it may be used to improve fruit quality in many greenhouse crops adams 2002 silber and bar tal 2008 sonneveld and voogt 2009 this was also true for zucchini squash as a result of nacl induced salinity rouphael et al 2006 however in the present study fruit quality remained unaffected by nutrient induced salinity which indicates that metabolic reactions associated with quality retention were efficient in all cases as cited in schnitzler and gruda 2002 environmental conditions were more relevant to the yield and quality of nft grown melons than changes in the composition of the nutrient solution on the other hand increased concentrations of nitrates in fruits at high ca2 treatments revealed increased nitrate ion no3 levels used to equalize ionic ns ca2 concentrations and may be considered as a drawback gianquinto et al 2013 the increase of ca2 concentration in the root zone of zucchini with time was small at the initial stages followed by a rapid increase up to 60 dat but thereafter the increase rate was diminished towards similar concentration values on the last sampling date 80 dat which renders a sigmoid ca2 accumulation pattern fig 1 a similar pattern has been observed for na and cl accumulation in many soilless greenhouse crops such as flowers sonneveld et al 1999 and vegetables savvas et al 2005 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 so as zucchini neocleous and savvas 2017 these results show that as the concentration of corresponding ions e g ca2 na increases in the root zone of zucchini their uc i e ion to water uptake ratio also increases sonneveld and voogt 2009 under these conditions higher ca2 concentrations in the irrigation water induced higher ca2 concentrations in the root environment which entailed to higher ca uc by the crop however at a certain time point in the growth cycle the input ratios of ca2 to water into the system and the ucs of ca2 by the crop were balanced which resulted in almost no further increase of ca2 concentration in the recycled solution fig 1 in view of the above similarities the prediction equations for salt nacl accumulation in a closed hydroponic system were further extended to simulate ca2 accumulation in commercial hydroponic zucchini crops the relationship resulting from regression analysis of the concentration of ca2 in the root zone of zucchini on the uptake concentration of ca2 by the crop was better described by exponential than linear functions fig 2 as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 substituting the estimated values for Î± and b in 1 renders the following equation 7 ccau 0 532ccas 0 773 r2 0 904 where ccau uptake concentrations of ca2 ccas concentrations of ca2 in the closed system Î± and b crop specific model parameters actually model calibration resulted in very high r2 value which allows the use of prediction equations to simulate ca2 accumulation in closed hydroponic zucchini crops cv anita f1 to test the validity of the model modelled values estimates obtained solving 4 as model equation using the runge kutta numerical method according to savvas et al 2005 were then compared to measured data from independent zucchini crops aw crop fig 3 as suggested by carmassi et al 2005 with all data in plot fig 4 linear regression analysis between simulates and measures confirmed a very good correspondence of the two as indicated by the near unity slope so as the high regression coefficient of the relationship fig 4 thus the model may be considered efficient over the entire zucchini crop cycle and a wide range of external ca2 concentrations and growing conditions summarizing our data suggest the salt nacl accumulation empirical model previously developed for many greenhouse crops sonneveld and voogt 2009 so as in zucchini squash neocleous and savvas 2017 provided with the appropriate calibration parameters could be further extended to simulate ca2 accumulation in commercial hydroponic zucchini crops in relation to cumulative plant water uptake the ucs i e nutrient to water uptake ratio can be used as a rough basis for the addition of fertilizers to the irrigation water in recirculation systems adams 2002 the mean ucs of macronutrients determined in the present study are shown in fig 5 these results show that the uc of ca2 by the crop increased progressively as the concentration of ca2 in the ns increased in parallel enhanced mean uc of n revealed increased concentrations of no3 n in the supplied ns used to balance commensurate increases of ca2 the relationship between the concentrations of ca2 and n in the external solution and their uptake by the plants reveals both that nutrient uptake varies with the nutrient level in the root zone solution and that the plants exerts little control on the absorption of the nutrient concerned at high external concentrations sonneveld 2002 sonneveld and voogt 2009 however the mean ucs of p k and mg remained unaffected by the tested treatments with a good correspondence to the ns composition fig 5 table 1 which implies that competitive uptake phenomena were of minor importance this could be ascribed to i the greater ability of the plants to absorb nutrients provided that a continues supply prevents depletion savvas 2002 under a continuous supply of a nutrient solution sufficiently ensured adams 2002 sonneveld 2002 ii the protective role of ca2 to cell membranes overcame any depressing effects of raised ca2 concentrations in the ns on other cations silber and bar tal 2008 and iii the higher efficiency of the crop to absorb monovalent ions such as nitrates no3 potassium k and phosphates h2po4 rather than polyvalent ions savvas 2002 savvas et al 2013 noteworthy similar mean ucs for macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg in zucchini crops have been observed in authors previous work under a progressive salinity nacl built up in a completely closed system neocleous and savvas 2017 which reinforce the adaptation of the present results as a tool for the establishment of nutrient solution compositions for closed zucchini crops under mediterranean climates the nutrient status of the crop table 2 reveals that i the rates of nutrient absorption and translocation is closely associated to the nutrient ucs and their concentrations in the root zone sonneveld and voogt 2009 and ii nutritional disturbances were rather of minor importance than osmotic effects table 2 also shows that a close relationship existed between the external ca2 concentration and the ca content in different plant parts of zucchini rouphael and colla 2009 whereas smaller p k or no effects mg were observed on the other major nutrients hence mg contents indicate that zucchini plants maintained its absorption and translocation mechanisms under a wide range of external ca2 concentrations furthermore plant tissue analysis showed that high ca treatment increased organically bound n in the aerial plant parts owing to enhanced n assimilation processes following nitrate ion no3 levels elevation in the replenishment nutrient solution however this was not the case in roots which let us assume that under these conditions nitrate reduction was more profound in the shoot part of zucchini cv anita f1 noteworthy Îº ca2 molar ratio proved to be more important for k transport to the leaves of zucchini than the absolute k concentration in the ns which coincide with previous results neocleous and savvas 2015 5 conclusions existing empirical models capable of predicting salt nacl accumulation in closed loop irrigation systems were further extended and provided with appropriate calibration constants to simulate ca2 concentrations in the root environment of zucchini crops as relationships of the cumulative plant water uptake the mean uptake ratios of nutrients i e n p k ca and mg and water denoted as uptake concentrations ucs were determined within a wide range of ca2 concentrations in the root zone and may be used as a rough basis for the establishment of nutrient solution compositions for closed zucchini crops under mediterranean climates photosynthesis plant growth yield and water uptake were restricted above a nutrient induced ec value in the recycled solution of 3 2 ds m 1 related to osmotic potential effects avg 15 decrease up to 5 5 ds m 1 however water resources containing up to 3 mm ca2 can be safely used in closed hydroponic crops of zucchini raised ca2 level up to 12 mm in terms of growth yield and quality of the produce the above results may be used as a tool in modelling the crop recirculation system in areas where low quality water is usually used for irrigation

the empirical model parameterized and tested in this work may serve as a tool to predict ca2 ion concentrations in the root environment of zucchini crops as relationships of the water absorbed by the crop finally the results showed that in soilless zucchini crops with zero discharge of fertigation effluents there is no compelling reason not to use irrigation water resources with ca2 concentration

studies in the past stimulating the development of modelling tools sonneveld et al 1999 carmassi et al 2003 2005 kempkes and stanghellini 2003 savvas et al 2005 2007 bar yosef 2008 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 such models may either require several input parameters e g silberbush et al 2005 or simply correlate the accumulation of salt ions with a single variable e g savvas et al 2008 the latter model approach comprise mass balance models which relate salt accumulation in the recycled ns with the cumulative plant water consumption on the basis of an empirical relationship between ion to water uptake ratios namely uptake concentrations uc by the crop and their concentrations in the root zone these relationships may be described either by linear or exponential functions for a series of vegetables and flowers sonneveld et al 1999 carmassi et al 2005 for vegetables such as bean cucumber pepper tomato and melon linear relationships proved to be appropriate but in many cases exponential functions were better savvas et al 2005 2007 2008 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 although the problems of salinity in closed hydroponics originate mainly from nacl as already mentioned problems arising also from high ca2 ion concentrations in the raw water mediterranean types of irrigation water are rich in nacl but also in calcium bicarbonates katsoulas et al 2015 which can exceed the ca2 to water uptake ratio uc by the crop sonneveld and voogt 2009 in mediterranean soils hot and dry conditions enhance the release rates of ca2 ions to the soil solution and this in turn increase ca2 concentration in irrigation water resources often at excessive concentrations neocleous and savvas 2013 thus if there is no alternative source of fresh water to prepare ns mediterranean growers to cope with these difficulties frequently discharge all or a part of the drainage water thereby lowering the efficiency of recycling to reduce water and fertilizer consumption and subsequent environmental pollution varlagas et al 2010 therefore to minimize salt accumulation in soilless growing systems with recirculating ns specifically when the quality of irrigation water is suboptimal water often rich in na but also in ca2 implementation of efficient technologies and appropriate mathematical models is required katsoulas et al 2015 in author s previous work neocleous and savvas 2017 a generic empirical model on the basis of a mass balance equation simulating nacl accumulation in relation with water uptake in soilless zucchini crops was developed and successfully tested however model based predictions of ca2 accumulation in the root zone of closed hydroponic zucchini crops have not been addressed to date hence both model versions could be implemented in decision support systems dss for the better management of the ns in zucchini crops soilless zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l is an important cultivated crop in the mediterranean region and seems to give higher yield than conventional crops rouphael et al 2004 furthermore its small size and short growing cycle enables zucchini crops to be easily grown in liquid systems such as nutrient film technique nft a standard method of water and nutrient replenishment in nft type systems requires the preparation of a nutrient solution with composition based on mean uptake ratios of nutrients namely uptake concentrations ucs de kreij et al 1999 sonneveld and voogt 2009 savvas et al 2013 this solution is subsequently automatically blended with the ns that drains out of the root zone to form the outgoing irrigation solution savvas 2002 however to optimize nutritional schemes for crops growing in closed hydroponics in mediterranean countries ucs previously determined under northern european climates e g de kreij et al 1999 should be adapted to specific climatic conditions and peculiarities of irrigation water adams 2002 in view of the above the objectives of the current work were to i mathematically correlate the accumulation of ca2 in the root zone and the respective ca2 water uptake ratio namely uptake concentration uc using existing generic models initially developed to predict salt accumulation in a closed hydroponic system and ii determine ucs of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg under progressive accumulation of ca2 ions in the recycled solution and thus in the root zone finally plant tissue nutrient concentrations plant biomass production fruit yield and quality and parameters of photosynthesis were measured as crop response indices 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions two experiments were conducted in a multi span with arched roof polyethylene greenhouse n s oriented at the experimental farm of the agricultural research institute cyprus latitude 34 44 n longitude 33 19 e altitude 8 m a s l under natural light conditions the greenhouse was equipped with heating ventilation and cooling systems for greenhouse climate control the first experiment was set up from 4 april to 27 june 2016 spring summer crop ss and the second one from 14 september to 22 december 2016 autumn winter crop aw in both experiments seedlings of the green cultivar anita f1 seminis netherlands of zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l were transferred at the stage of two true leaves into twenty independent hydroponic circuits nutrient film technique nft gullies with continues and total recycling of the ns each of the nft gullies experimental units 6 0 m in length 0 25 m in width and 0 10 m in height accommodated 10 squash plants and the spacing resulted in a plant density of about 2 0 plants m 2 at the end of each gully a tank was used to collect and supply the recirculating ns while a reservoir tank was used to replenish nutrient and water losses from the system maintaining a constant recirculation volume neocleous and savvas 2015 2016 experimental treatments comprised four different ca2 concentrations i e 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 mm in the supplied ns table 1 which commenced immediately after transplanting up to the end of the experiments the replenishment ns with composition given in table 1 was automatically blended with the ns that drained out of the root zone to prepare the irrigation solution supplied to the plants no drainage water was discharged from the system and water losses were negligible due to full coverage of the channels external plant rows aimed as guard plants the plants were supported by a plastic string attached to base of the stem to an overhead wire at 2 20 m above plant row measurements were performed in the first experiment ss crop while the second experiment aw crop was commissioned to test the efficiency of the model to predict the course of ca2 accumulation in the root zone of zucchini squash 2 2 model outline the following equations initially developed to predict salt nacl accumulation in closed loop hydroponics sonneveld et al 1999 carmassi et al 2005 were further extended to correlate the accumulation of ca2 in the drainage solution and thus in the root zone ccas with the respective ca2 water uptake ratio ccau in zucchini crops 1 ccau Î±ccas b 2 ccau mccas in a closed hydroponic system with total recycling of the ns the only input of ca2 and water is through the fresh ns introduced into the system while the only removal is through plant uptake thus the ca2 water input ratio corresponds to the concentration of ca2 in the fresh ns ccaw whereas ca2 water removal corresponds to the uptake concentration uc mass of nutrient per volume of water absorbed of ca2 ccau by the crop hence the increase of the ccas relates to the increase of the water added to the system vw and to the difference between input and removal of ca2 ccaw ccau and conversely to the volume of the recycled

savvas 2016 values for Î± b and m were calculated by applying nonlinear regression analysis on experimental data using as models 1 and 2 subsequently formulas 4 and 5 were used to predict ca2 concentrations in the root environment ccas in relation to the cumulative water absorbed by the crop which amounts to vw savvas et al 2007 to statistically evaluate the performance of the model simulated and measured data from crops planted at different times were subjected to linear regression analysis 1 1 relationship 2 3 analyses samples of recycled and replenishment ns from each

mmol l 1 of the x macronutrient i e k ca2 mg2 no3 nh4 h2po4 was determined by measuring nutrient and water uptake from the system following neocleous and savvas 2015 like shown in formula 6 6 ucx vs cxin cxf vw cxadd vw where vs was the volume of the recycled solution in the experimental units l vw was the water volume added to the closed system l cxin cxf was the difference between initial and final concentration of the nutrient x in the recycled solution mmol l 1 cxadd was the concentration of the nutrient x in the ns used to replenish nutrients and water to the system mmol l 1 the uc of n was calculated summing over ammonium and nitrate concentrations the measurements in solution samples were then used to determine the removal of nutrients per volume unit of water absorbed from the recirculating ns this procedure is considered suitable to estimate crop nutrient uptake in nft culture pardossi et al 2004 on the same dates plants were harvested and used to determine tissue

considered fruits with acceptable color and quality representative fruits i e fruits of good shape and size excluding outliers from each experimental unit were used for quality analysis analyses of

2014 and neocleous and savvas 2015 ascorbic acid and sugar content of fruit glucose and fructose concentrations were determined using the reflectometer and reflectoquant test kits merck darmstadt germany the greenhouse air temperature and relative humidity ranged between 15 and 30 c avg 25 7 c in ss crop and 23 6 c in aw crop and 60 80 avg 66 5 respectively the average daily global radiation outside the greenhouse during the experimental period was 23 7 mj m 2 and 14 6 mj m 2 in the ss and aw experiments respectively 2 5 statistics randomized complete block designs were used for both greenhouse experiments experimental treatments comprised four different ca2 concentrations i e 1 5 mm 3 mm 4 5 mm and 6 mm in the irrigation water each replicated four times analysis of variance was performed using sas version 9 2 sas institute inc cary nc usa and figures were drawn using graphpad prism version 5 0 graphpad software san diego california usa regression analysis was conducted to establish relationships between measured data 3 results 3 1 changes in water consumption ec and ca2 concentrations in the root zone as shown in fig 1 the cumulative water consumed by zucchini squash was reduced avg 15 decrease at high ca2 concentrations in the supplied ns i e 4 5 and 6 mm particularly on the last sampling dates and overall the cumulative water consumption averaged 200 l plant ss crop the evolution of ca2 accumulation in the recycled solution with time is also given in fig 1 although the same accumulation pattern sigmoid pattern was observed clear differences in ca2 accumulation levels over the whole cultivation cycle were observed among treatments calcium concentrations progressively increased during experimental period with a more sharp increase up to 60 days after treatment initiation dat but on the last sampling date 80 dat accumulation rates were decreased with a tendency to stabilize to a maximal level according to the ns ca2 concentration fig 1 actually ca2 ions accumulated in the drainage at final concentrations up to 5 12 17 and 22 mm for the ca2 concentrations 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 mm in ns respectively the total salinity namely electrical conductivity ec of the recycled solution gradually increased with time in all treatments data not shown ranging between 1 7 3 0 ds m 1 1 5 mm ca2 2 0 4 7 ds m 1 3 mm ca2 2 3 5 6 ds m 1 4 5 mm ca2 and 2 6 7 2 ds m 1 6 mm ca2 accordingly ec mean values are shown in fig 1 3 2 model parameterization and validation the fig 2 reports the mean ca2 uptake concentrations uc during the whole growth cycle ss crop in relation to the concentrations of ca2 in the root zone solution measured data all data in plot were fit into exponential or linear functions described by eqs 1 and 2 respectively the mathematical representation is based on the assumption that at zero ca2 concentration in the root zone solution the uptake of ca2 would be logically zero no intercept statistical analysis revealed a higher coefficient of determination r2 of an exponential 0 904 than a linear 0 874 function and the best fit relationship is presented therefore using eq 1 as model equation Î± was 0 532 and b was 0 773 actually model calibration resulted in high r2 values which allows the use of prediction equations to simulate ca2 accumulation in closed hydroponic zucchini crops calibration constants Î± and b were further adopted in eq 4 to be solved according to butcher 1987 as suggested by savvas et al 2005 2007 which resulted in the presented curves fig 3 curves correspond to simulated ca2 concentrations in the root environment of zucchini squash by relating them to cumulative water uptake on the other hand symbols in fig 3 depict measured values collected during the second experimental season autumn winter aw crop a very good agreement was observed between simulated and measured values for a wide range of ca2 external concentrations and the whole cultivation cycle fig 3 fig 4 shows model predicted data eq 4 using the ss data set against measured data originate from the validation experiment aw crop the application of linear regression analysis between simulates and measures with all data in plot as indicated by the slope of the linear regression relationship and the coefficient of determination confirmed a very good agreement between the two and the capability of the model to predict ca2 accumulation in the second experimental season fig 4 3 3 uptake concentrations of macronutrients n p k ca and mg based on the removal of nutrient from ns and crop water uptake the effect of increasing external ca2 concentrations on the mean uptake concentrations ucs amount of nutrient absorbed per volume of water consumption of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg is shown in fig 5 the mean uc of ca was influenced by ns treatments particularly the uc of ca increased accordingly to its concentrations in the replenishment ns the mean uc of n similarly to that of ca at 6 mm ca2 was higher than at 1 5 mm ca2 following corresponding ns composition the uc of n at 3 and 4 5 mm ca2 was in between nevertheless the mean ucs of p k and mg remained unaffected by experimental treatments fig 5 reflecting applied ns concentrations overall the ucs of macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg averaged 15 3 1 16 6 3 3 4 and 2 0 mm respectively fig 5 with slight differences when data were estimated for vegetative and reproductive phase data not shown 3 4 tissue nutrient concentrations the ca content was higher in leaves than stems and roots whereas fruits showed the lowest content table 2 however in all plant parts ca content increased with increasing ca2 concentrations in the applied ns treatments in leaves and fruits zucchini plants also accumulated higher amounts of nitrogen n concentrations but only at the high ca2 treatment the increase was significant p 5 while in stems and roots n remained unaffected by the applied treatments compared to the control concentrations of p and k in leaves were reduced at moderate and high ca2 ns concentrations while in stems high ca2 imposed a decrease in k content by contrast mg concentration in all plant parts remained unaffected by the applied treatments overall the mean concentrations of n p k ca and mg amounted to 49 9 7 7 65 0 49 6 and 12 9 mg g dw 1 in leaves 57 0 12 5 69 9 6 4 and 5 2 mg g dw 1 in fruits 31 2 8 4 87 4 17 5 and 7 1 mg g dw 1 in stems and 36 9 15 2 48 2 31 7 and 10 6 mg g dw 1 in roots respectively 3 5 plant growth fruit yield and photosynthesis as shown in fig 6 moderate and high ca2 concentrations i e 4 5 and 6 mm in the supplied nutrient solution ns restricted plant dry weight yield total fruit yield marketable yield and mean fruit weight in addition the fruit nitrate content was increased at high

fluorescence fv fm ratio electron transport rate etr Î¼mol e m 2 s 1 and leaf water potential Ïw mpa were also reduced at high ca2 levels on the contrary substomatal co2 concentrations ci Î¼mol co2 mol 1 and transpiration rate e mmol h2o m 2 s 1 remained unaffected by the tested treatments table 3 4 discussion increasing ca2 in the supplied nutrient solution ns at moderate and high concentrations i e 4 5 and 6 mm increased total salinity namely electrical conductivity ec in the root zone solution at higher levels 4 2 and 5 5 ds m 1 respectively than recommended thresholds sonneveld and straver 1994 de pascale et al 2013 this was mainly due to the progressive accumulation of ca2 cations in the recycled ns fig 1 which exposed the plants to osmotic stress conditions osmotic effect de pascale et al 2013 as a result the ability of plants to take up water was reduced fig 1 thereby biomass production fruit yield and fruit mean weight were inhibited fig 6 munns 2002 in many crops the photosynthetic rate a and stomatal conductance gs of leaves decreases as leaf water potential Ïw becomes more negative due to increasing water stress thereby reducing growth lawlor 2002 parida and das 2005 indeed in this study lower Ïw showed a good correspondence with a inhibition table 3 however limitations in gs did not induce either proportional decrease in transpiration rates e or lower values of substomatal co2 concentration ci table 3 these results allow us to suggest that stomatal closure was not the main limitation to photosynthesis owing towards the appearance of limitation at chloroplast level in line with this consideration chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm ratio and electron transport rate etr as metabolic components affecting photosynthesis were reduced at high external ca2 concentrations table 3 thus decreases in a and etr coincide with the notion that plants were subjected to nonstomatal down regulation of photosynthesis sÃ¡nchez rodriguez et al 1997 flexas et al 1999 furthermore it is well known that one or more of the metallic micronutrients i e fe mn zn and cu are involved in the metabolism and electron transport system in photosynthesis gianquinto et al 2013 although the metallic micronutrients status in zucchini squash was not evaluated in the present the antagonistic effect of increased external concentrations of bivalent macronutrients e g ca2 on their uptake should be not ruled out adams 2002 summarizing the adverse effects of raised total salt concentrations of ions ec due to the accumulation of ca2 ions in the recycled ns resulted in water imbalances deficits with restrictions on the photosynthetic rate at chloroplast level reducing growth and total fruit yield ashraf and harris 2013 these results imply that zucchini is susceptible not only to nacl stress as reported by savvas et al 2009 but also to nutrient induced stress however the raised ec avg 3 2 ds m 1 in the recycled solution that was replenished with ns ca2 concentration 3 mm did not negatively affected plant growth and yield compared to the control treatment i e 1 5 mm ca2 this could be attributed to the much smaller ec increase than those of the other treatments plus the fact that high ec values are less detrimental under a progressive than an abrupt increase of root zone salinity savvas et al 2005 bar yosef 2008 taking additionally into consideration that calcium contributes to the functioning of root hydraulic conductance under salinity conditions water channels aquaporins silber and bar tal 2008 in this content in another cucurbit such as cucumber with similar threshold salinity values as zucchini sonneveld and straver 1994 bar yosef 2008 suggested an acceptable threshold ec values in the recycled solution of about 4 ds m 1 when the time of exposure to the threshold salinity was relatively short although higher salinity restricts plant growth it may be used to improve fruit quality in many greenhouse crops adams 2002 silber and bar tal 2008 sonneveld and voogt 2009 this was also true for zucchini squash as a result of nacl induced salinity rouphael et al 2006 however in the present study fruit quality remained unaffected by nutrient induced salinity which indicates that metabolic reactions associated with quality retention were efficient in all cases as cited in schnitzler and gruda 2002 environmental conditions were more relevant to the yield and quality of nft grown melons than changes in the composition of the nutrient solution on the other hand increased concentrations of nitrates in fruits at high ca2 treatments revealed increased nitrate ion no3 levels used to equalize ionic ns ca2 concentrations and may be considered as a drawback gianquinto et al 2013 the increase of ca2 concentration in the root zone of zucchini with time was small at the initial stages followed by a rapid increase up to 60 dat but thereafter the increase rate was diminished towards similar concentration values on the last sampling date 80 dat which renders a sigmoid ca2 accumulation pattern fig 1 a similar pattern has been observed for na and cl accumulation in many soilless greenhouse crops such as flowers sonneveld et al 1999 and vegetables savvas et al 2005 varlagas et al 2010 neocleous and savvas 2016 so as zucchini neocleous and savvas 2017 these results show that as the concentration of corresponding ions e g ca2 na increases in the root zone of zucchini their uc i e ion to water uptake ratio also increases sonneveld and voogt 2009 under these conditions higher ca2 concentrations in the irrigation water induced higher ca2 concentrations in the root environment which entailed to higher ca uc by the crop however at a certain time point in the growth cycle the input ratios of ca2 to water into the system and the ucs of ca2 by the crop were balanced which resulted in almost no further increase of ca2 concentration in the recycled solution fig 1 in view of the above similarities the prediction equations for salt nacl accumulation in a closed hydroponic system were further extended to simulate ca2 accumulation in commercial hydroponic zucchini crops the relationship resulting from regression analysis of the concentration of ca2 in the root zone of zucchini on the uptake concentration of ca2 by the crop was better described by exponential than linear functions fig 2 as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 substituting the estimated values for Î± and b in 1 renders the following equation 7 ccau 0 532ccas 0 773 r2 0 904 where ccau uptake concentrations of ca2 ccas concentrations of ca2 in the closed system Î± and b crop specific model parameters actually model calibration resulted in very high r2 value which allows the use of prediction equations to simulate ca2 accumulation in closed hydroponic zucchini crops cv anita f1 to test the validity of the model modelled values estimates obtained solving 4 as model equation using the runge kutta numerical method according to savvas et al 2005 were then compared to measured data from independent zucchini crops aw crop fig 3 as suggested by carmassi et al 2005 with all data in plot fig 4 linear regression analysis between simulates and measures confirmed a very good correspondence of the two as indicated by the near unity slope so as the high regression coefficient of the relationship fig 4 thus the model may be considered efficient over the entire zucchini crop cycle and a wide range of external ca2 concentrations and growing conditions summarizing our data suggest the salt nacl accumulation empirical model previously developed for many greenhouse crops sonneveld and voogt 2009 so as in zucchini squash neocleous and savvas 2017 provided with the appropriate calibration parameters could be further extended to simulate ca2 accumulation in commercial hydroponic zucchini crops in relation to cumulative plant water uptake the ucs i e nutrient to water uptake ratio can be used as a rough basis for the addition of fertilizers to the irrigation water in recirculation systems adams 2002 the mean ucs of macronutrients determined in the present study are shown in fig 5 these results show that the uc of ca2 by the crop increased progressively as the concentration of ca2 in the ns increased in parallel enhanced mean uc of n revealed increased concentrations of no3 n in the supplied ns used to balance commensurate increases of ca2 the relationship between the concentrations of ca2 and n in the external solution and their uptake by the plants reveals both that nutrient uptake varies with the nutrient level in the root zone solution and that the plants exerts little control on the absorption of the nutrient concerned at high external concentrations sonneveld 2002 sonneveld and voogt 2009 however the mean ucs of p k and mg remained unaffected by the tested treatments with a good correspondence to the ns composition fig 5 table 1 which implies that competitive uptake phenomena were of minor importance this could be ascribed to i the greater ability of the plants to absorb nutrients provided that a continues supply prevents depletion savvas 2002 under a continuous supply of a nutrient solution sufficiently ensured adams 2002 sonneveld 2002 ii the protective role of ca2 to cell membranes overcame any depressing effects of raised ca2 concentrations in the ns on other cations silber and bar tal 2008 and iii the higher efficiency of the crop to absorb monovalent ions such as nitrates no3 potassium k and phosphates h2po4 rather than polyvalent ions savvas 2002 savvas et al 2013 noteworthy similar mean ucs for macronutrients i e n p k ca and mg in zucchini crops have been observed in authors previous work under a progressive salinity nacl built up in a completely closed system neocleous and savvas 2017 which reinforce the adaptation of the present results as a tool for the establishment of nutrient solution compositions for closed zucchini crops under mediterranean climates the nutrient status of the crop table 2 reveals that i the rates of nutrient absorption and translocation is closely associated to the nutrient ucs and their concentrations in the root zone sonneveld and voogt 2009 and ii nutritional disturbances were rather of minor importance than osmotic effects table 2 also shows that a close relationship existed between the external ca2 concentration and the ca content in different plant parts of zucchini rouphael and colla 2009 whereas smaller p k or no effects mg were observed on the other major nutrients hence mg contents indicate that zucchini plants maintained its absorption and translocation mechanisms under a wide range of external ca2 concentrations furthermore plant tissue analysis showed that high ca treatment increased organically bound n in the aerial plant parts owing to enhanced n assimilation processes following nitrate ion no3 levels elevation in the replenishment nutrient solution however this was not the case in roots which let us assume that under these conditions nitrate reduction was more profound in the shoot part of zucchini cv anita f1 noteworthy Îº ca2 molar ratio proved to be more important for k transport to the leaves of zucchini than the absolute k concentration in the ns which coincide with previous results neocleous and savvas 2015 5 conclusions existing empirical models capable of predicting salt nacl accumulation in closed loop irrigation systems were further extended and provided with appropriate calibration constants to simulate ca2 concentrations in the root environment of zucchini crops as relationships of the cumulative plant water uptake the mean uptake ratios of nutrients i e n p k ca and mg and water denoted as uptake concentrations ucs were determined within a wide range of ca2 concentrations in the root zone and may be used as a rough basis for the establishment of nutrient solution compositions for closed zucchini crops under mediterranean climates photosynthesis plant growth yield and water uptake were restricted above a nutrient induced ec value in the recycled solution of 3 2 ds m 1 related to osmotic potential effects avg 15 decrease up to 5 5 ds m 1 however water resources containing up to 3 mm ca2 can be safely used in closed hydroponic crops of zucchini raised ca2 level up to 12 mm in terms of growth yield and quality of the produce the above results may be used as a tool in modelling the crop recirculation system in areas where low quality water is usually used for irrigation 
11481,the upper tarim river basin contributing about 85 of the total inflow to the mainstream tarim river is heavily influenced by climate change and human interferences this study is the first integrated assessment of agriculture and water management under climate change scenarios for this arid river basin in central asia it aims to analyze changes in river discharge of the upper tarim under 28 climate projections for 3 representative concentration pathways rcp and the a1b scenario and 30 combinations of changes in land use agricultural area and water saving measures considered as adaptation strategies headwater discharge simulations of two hydrological models swim g and wasa are used to drive a hydrological model of the lowland area swim oasis taking account irrigation and river transmission losses the projections show that the river discharge of the upper tarim river is likely to increase in a warmer climate if the agricultural area is reduced to the level as in 1998 even without any water saving measures if the agricultural area increases to the 2010 level strong water saving measures must be applied to ensure sufficient water inflow to the mainstream tarim under all climate scenarios if agricultural area continues to expand there is a risk of decreasing river discharge at the end of this century under the rcp2 6 scenario the uncertainty of the projections is large especially in the far future and it is mainly related to the climate and hydrological models keywords climate change adaptation agricultural water saving measures tarim swim wasa 1 introduction within the climate change research community increasing attention has been given to adaptation to a changing climate arnell 2010 however it is still less common to assess the consequences of land use change adapted water management and climate scenarios together in addition most adaptation studies kirby et al 2014 kling et al 2014 tu 2009 assessed the impacts of potential changes and only a few studies specifically addressed the actual or planned adaptation measures to cope with climate change impacts arnell 2010 one of the few examples is the combined bottom up and top down assessment of climate change adaptation by bhave et al 2014 who selected three adaptation options prioritized by stakeholders and projected impacts on streamflow under four climate projections for the kangsabati river catchment in india these adaptation studies reported in literature usually consider a small number of land use change or management scenarios and each climate scenario is combined with only one change in either land use or management a combination of different land use and management options is rare in climate impact assessments applications and comparisons of modelling results from more than one impact model are also rare in climate adaptation analysis however the uncertainty related to impact models e g hydrological models can be comparable to that related to climate models for some specific basins velazquez et al 2013 vetter et al 2015 though most often the latter dominates vetter et al 2016 since water planning and operation decisions are affected by large uncertainties related to both climate scenarios and impact models climate adaptation studies should examine not only various climate scenarios but also the application of several impact models to evaluate uncertainty and to produce robust results central asia is highly vulnerable to water scarcity due to the arid climate and intensive irrigated agriculture attention has already been paid to the vulnerability to climate change and the adaptation measures in this region aleksandrova et al 2014 the tarim river is the largest endorheic river in china it receives water from four mountainous tributaries the aksu hotan yarkand and kaidu rivers and dries up in the taklamakan desert the length of the river decreased by about 770 km about 35 of the total length from 1990s to 2009 mainly due to the intensive irrigation and increased population in the river oases along the tributaries and the mainstream tarim river chen et al 2009 consequently the whole oasis ecosystem of the tarim was adversely affected by the strong decrease in river runoff downstream xu et al 2008 the project sumario sustainable management of river oases along the tarim river china http www sumario de 2011 2016 funded by the german

achieve this goal the first question to answer is how much water would be available for the tarim river oases in the future accounting for climate change agriculture and water management options as the upper three tributaries aksu hotan and yarkand contribute about 85 of the total water inflow to the tarim river gou et al 2010 the future discharge from these tributaries is a key factor to determine the total water availability in the mainstream despite the importance of analyzing the future water resources in the tarim river studies focusing on this topic for the region are limited several published studies analyzed the historical trends changes and impacts for the tarim river or its tributaries fu et al 2012 krysanova et al 2015 xu et al 2013 recently keilholz et al 2015 projected the impacts of climate and land use changes on groundwater in a middle reach of the tarim river fang et al 2015 projected the impacts of climate change on streamflow of the kaidu river yu et al 2015 analyzed the impacts of irrigation and water saving measures on discharge in the main tarim river in the period 2006 2008 specifically for the upper tarim liu et al 2013 projected changes in runoff using a distributed macro scale hydrological model under the a1b a2 and b1 scenarios however their modeling didn t consider any glacier changes in the headwaters or water uses in the lowland area a more advanced hydrological modeling was presented by duethmann et al 2016 who investigated impacts of climate change on glaciers and discharge in headwater catchments of the aksu river using an ensemble of different emission scenarios climate models and parameters of the hydrological model to our best knowledge none of the previous studies could provide a robust projection on streamflow for the entire upper tarim including both agricultural water use and climate impacts in the assessment to fill this gap our study is the first comprehensive climate impact and adaptation assessment on the water availability at the alar station the last gauge station of the upper tarim river based on a large number of climate agricultural and water management scenarios including the real planned measures for simplicity we will use agricultural scenarios instead of agricultural and water management scenarios as a short term in the following text in addition we applied simulation results from two glaciohydrological models for headwaters to investigate the uncertainty related to hydrological models the main objectives of this study are 1 to project river discharge of the upper tarim river at the alar station under various climate projections 2 to quantify the effects of various agricultural scenarios in combination with climate change on discharge 3 to find robust adaptation measures for the near medium and far future and 4 to analyze the uncertainty of projected impacts related to the climate models hydrological models and agricultural scenarios 2 study area the tarim river basin is mainly located in the northwest of china with parts of the headwater areas in kyrgyzstan and pakistan the mainstream of the tarim river begins at the confluence of three tributaries the aksu yarkand and hotan rivers fig 1 a the hydrologically active catchment area i e without endorheic lakes and rivers not reaching the mainstream until the alar station is defined here as the upper tarim basin with a total drainage area of 184 567 km2 the upper tarim river can be divided into two parts according to different topographic climatic and hydrological conditions the five headwaters in the mountains until the gauges xiehela shaliguilanke kaqun wuluwati and tongguziluoke and the lowland area between the headwater stations and the alar station in the taklamakan desert fig 1a the headwaters of the three tributaries are mainly fed by snow and glacier melting in the mountains and are hardly influenced by human activities the headwaters of the aksu river have the largest discharge at 255 6 m3 s on average in the period from 1957 to 2005 while the headwaters of the yarkand and the hotan rivers provide smaller amount of water resources 208 6 and 142 8 m3 s on average xie et al 2007 in the lowland area there is little water generation due to extremely low rainfall 30 60 mm year and high potential evaporation 2000 3000 mm year xu et al 2008 bare soil is the dominant land cover type but there are large oases along the rivers covered by irrigated cropland forest and grassland the irrigation water is important not only for agriculture but also for the whole oasis ecosystem all natural vegetation depends on groundwater which is recharged by seepage from streams water delivery canals and irrigated fields zhong et al 2009 hence a large amount of irrigation water is used by both crops and natural vegetation in the oases in addition so called river transmission losses i e evaporation and percolation in rivers are important processes especially for rivers in arid regions hughes 2008 as a result the water use in oases and river transmission losses lead to a reduction of river discharge between the headwaters and the alar station downstream the inflows from the hotan and yarkand rivers to the tarim are gauged by the stations xiaota and heiniyazi near the outlet of these rivers respectively for the aksu river no discharge data is available at the outlet for this study however the gauge station xidaqiao provides the discharge information at the confluence of the two headwaters toshkan and kumarik rivers as the most upstream gauge of the tarim river the alar station monitors the inflow of all three tributaries i e the available water amounts entering the main tarim river which this study focuses on in the past 53 years 1957 2009 the average inflow to the tarim river was about 140 m3 s including 73 water from the aksu 24 from the hotan and 3 from the yarkand gou et al 2010 due to large river transmission losses and water use in the oases only the aksu river maintains a permanent inflow to the tarim river the hotan river contributes to the tarim only during the flooding season july september regarding the yarkand river there was no water runoff into the tarim river since 1985 except during two extreme floods in 1994 and 2005 the 270 km river reach downstream is dry for most years the total annual streamflow from all headwater stations tended to increase in the period 1956 2009 see appendix a the increase is mainly due to the increase of discharge in the aksu headwaters and this is explained by climatic changes duethmann et al 2016 despite the increasing trend in the headwater flow the annual streamflow at the alar station shows a decreasing trend indicating an increasing trend of water use in the oases mainly due to the increasing water demand for the expansion of irrigated area in this region deng et al 2013 since the headwaters and the lowland area are so different in terms of hydrological processes and human influences we divided our model domain into two parts 1 headwater regions modelled by two glaciohydrological models and 2 the lowland area modelled by one hydrological model considering irrigation water use and river transmission loss simulation results for the headwater regions are shown in wortmann 2017 and duethmann et al 2016 using the simulated headwater discharge as input this study focuses on the lowland area and projects the discharge at the alar station as the water availability from the entire upper tarim basin 2 1 the agricultural conditions in the lowland area the agricultural water use is the major focus of this study abstractions in this sector account for about 95 of the total water use in the tarim river basin in order to understand the recent historical agricultural changes in the lowland areas we analyzed data from the following statistical yearbooks the xinjiang statistical yearbooks xjsyb 1990 2012 for local counties and the bingtuan statistical yearbooks btsyb 1990 2012 for the agricultural divisions from the xinjiang production and construction corps from 1989 to 2011 fig 2 shows the historical development of the total cultivated area including cropland forest and orchard a and the distribution of crops b d in the oases of three tributary basins in general the total cultivated area was increasing continuously in the recent 20 years and the expansion became drastic between 2004 and 2009 in the aksu and yarkand river basins the increase in area is a result of population growth increase in agricultural profitability the local afforestation programs pushing for the establishment of orchards and insufficient restriction measures of agricultural land expansion feike et al 2015 the distribution of crops is different among these three river basins in the asku basin cotton is the dominant crop accounting for about 50 of the total agricultural area since 2000 in the hotan basin winter wheat and maize are the main crops and their areas are relatively constant after 2000 in the yarkand river basin cotton winter wheat and maize are the dominant crops covering 60 80 of the total area rice which requires more water compared to other crops is mainly planted in the aksu basin and its area gradually declined in the last decade an increasing trend of the forest and orchard areas is found in all three river basins especially after 2000 due to the local afforestation programs 2 2 irrigation practices according to zhong et al 2009 surface irrigation is still the most widespread and important method accounting for over 80 of the irrigation area in the xinjiang province however the areas using water saving irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation spray irrigation and low pressure pipeline delivery irrigation increased rapidly over the last decade the drip irrigation is the most popular water saving technology applied in 64 of the total water saving irrigation area in xinjiang by the end of 2004 water is mainly delivered through canals from rivers to farmland however the water seepage in traditional canals is very high accounting for 50 60 of the total water withdrawal in canals with sandy soils the seepage can be as high as 70 as a result the conventional irrigation efficiency cie which is defined as the efficiency of the total process of irrigation from the source of water to the point where the water becomes available in the root zone of plants merwe et al 1997 is rather low ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 depending on region in general the cie in the aksu basin is higher than in the other two basins in order to avoid waste of water and enhance the irrigation management each county in the aksu basin and the agricultural division set up an irrigation instruction regulating the irrigation schedule and quotas wang 2006 these instructions consider that irrigation is required not only during the main growing season may to september but also during winter and early spring to achieve salt leaching and soil moisture conservation for example the instruction for the awati county lists the irrigation schedule and quotas for winter wheat maize rice cotton with surface irrigation cotton with drip irrigation beet oil plant other economic plants orchard vegetables forest and grassland as the dominant and important crop cotton should be irrigated five times a year the five irrigation periods are 20th feb 10th mar before sowing 11th jun 20th jun squaring stage 11th jul 21th jul flowering stage 10th aug 20th aug boll stage and 25th aug 5th sep boll opening stage with irrigation quotas of 1200 975 975 975 975 m3 ha respectively in total 5100 m3 water is needed to irrigate one hectare of cotton per year for cotton with drip irrigation there are twelve irrigation periods in total including one irrigation before sowing of 1350 m3 ha in march and eleven irrigations of 300 m3 ha each during the growing season compared to the surface irrigation for cotton the drip irrigation requires longer irrigation duration but less water per day for winter wheat one summer irrigation from august to september and one autumn irrigation from october to november are required before the crop starts to grow the total irrigation quota per year ranges from 4500 to 6000 m3 ha for all crops except for rice which requires 13500 m3 ha note that the irrigation quota in the instruction refer only to water that reaches the root zone of crop taking into account the low cie in the three basins the average irrigation water demands are around 11 300 m3 ha 1 and 14 300 m3 ha 1 in the north and south xinjiang respectively deng 2010 2 3 the governmental plan for the tarim river basin in 2001 the government of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region gxuar and the ministry of water resources of p r china mwrc approved a planning report for immediate comprehensive improvement to the tarim river basin gxuar and mwrc 2002 this plan aims to ensure the ecological water demand in the main tarim river until 2010 by adopting a quota system to fix the water use in the three tributaries and between the upper middle and lower reaches of the tarim river specifically for our study area the tarim river at the alar station should receive 4 6 billion m3 year ca 146 m3 s under average climatic conditions according to this plan this represents the median streamflow for the historical discharge from 1957 to 1998 to achieve this goal different measures were carried out such as improvements of the transportation canals use of water saving irrigation technologies restriction of agricultural area to the field area from 1998 construction of reservoirs in the headwaters increase in groundwater exploration and restoration of the main tarim river bed thevs 2011 however the objective of the plan could not be achieved until 2010 the average water flow at alar decreased by about 26 m3 s in the period from 2001 to 2009 while the average inflow from the five headwaters increased by about 86 m3 s compared to the average inflow amount in the last 50 years hence liu et al 2010 suggested to restrict the expansion of irrigated area in the three tributary basins and to restore the hotan and yarkand river beds downstream in their opinion it is only viable to increase the irrigated area in the hotan basin while the irrigated areas in the other two basins should be reduced to the level of 1998 3 methods and data fig 3 shows the flowchart of the models as well as the major input data this study uses results of two glaciohydrological models simulating the five highly glacier covered headwaters as input the models and their results are briefly described in section 3 1 with more detailed presentations given in duethmann et al 2016 and wortmann 2017 the two headwater models enable us to account for the uncertainty introduced by glaciohydrological impact models the lowland area was simulated by the model swim oasis section 3 2 and is calibrated using the same reference data watch and aphrodite as the two headwater models the same climate scenarios were used in both headwater models and the lowland model section 3 3 presents how water use was calculated based on the irrigation instructions for agricultural scenarios the uncertainty sources were quantified using the anova method section 3 4 and the input data are introduced in sections 3 5 3 7 3 1 the headwater modelling the results of two glaciohydrological models wasa water availability in semi arid environments and swim g soil and water integrated model glacier dynamics were used wasa is a semi distributed glaciohydrological model that simulates snow and glacier cover as well as the catchment hydrology at a daily time step gÃ¼ntner and bronstert 2004 the spatial structure is based on catchments subcatchments and 200 m elevation zones the spatial variability of snow within an elevation zone is represented by a snow depletion curve liston 2004 snow is further redistributed from higher to lower elevation zones if simulated snow outside a glacier accumulates above a given snow water equivalent threshold glacier area and surface elevation changes are simulated using the Î´h approach by huss et al 2010 and updated annually glaciers are considered individually and discretized into 50 m elevation bands based on the simulated mass balance of the glacier thickness changes in each elevation band are calculated using predefined functions derived from observed glacier thickness changes of the ak shirak massif located at the western border of the aksu basin in the period 1977 1999 surazakov and aizen 2006 the glacier area is reduced if the thickness change in an elevation band is higher than the remaining ice thickness snow and glacier melt are calculated using a temperature index approach hock 2003 a detailed model description can be found in duethmann et al 2016 swim g is the glaciohydrological version of the semi distributed ecohydrological model swim soil and water integrated model krysanova et al 1998 it was used to simulate both individual glaciers and the catchment hydrology of the five headwaters in a tightly integrated approach wortmann 2017 it relies on computational units that disaggregate complex terrain into parts of similar elevation aspect and hydrological subbasin glaciological response units as opposed to gridded fully distributed or empirical approaches immerzeel et al 2011 huss et al 2010 the units are conceptually similar and computationally equal to the hydrological response units hrus the mass balance is evaluated considering snow accumulation based on threshold temperature as well as avalanching and an enhanced degree day melting approach the latter includes aspect and terrain shading debris melt out and sublimation like most hydrological processes the glacier processes are computed daily for each unit and ice is routed laterally between them according to an adapted glen s flow law approach marshall et al 2011 the swim g and wasa models were successfully calibrated and validated for the five headwater gauges at the daily time step against river discharge glacier area hypsometery and mass balance swim g and against river discharge and glacier mass balance wasa since glacier mass balance data during the simulation period were only available in the aksu basin we derived assumptions based on icesat data which are available for a more recent period for the hotan and yarkand basins both models successfully reproduced daily river discharge in all five headwaters daily nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse between 0 60 0 85 absolute bias less than 15 in the calibration period and nse between 0 70 0 80 absolute bias less than 15 in the validation period the details of the calibration validation procedure and results are reported in duethmann et al 2016 and wortmann 2017 results of the impact assessment for the headwaters show an initial increase in river discharge in the first scenario period 2011 2040 by 20 30 at the ensemble median similar to the changes that have already been observed subsequent changes are strongly scenario dependent and show increasing discharge in the hotan and yarkand in all periods 30 50 at the ensemble median glacier area loss over the 21 st century is limited to ca 20 under the rcp2 6 scenario but as high as 75 in the higher end scenarios while glaciers are generally on the decline causing an eventual decrease in melt water by the end of the century precipitation is also projected to increase in the region the wasa and swim g models indicated that this increase is able to partially counterbalance melt water losses in downstream discharge the full results for the headwaters are published in duethmann et al 2016 and wortmann 2017 3 2 the swim oasis model the swim oasis model is a version of swim adapted to the arid oasis environment of the taklamakan desert with a simple irrigation module and a river transmission loss module huang et al 2015 in the irrigation module the hrus are discretized by subbasins land use soil types and the boundaries of the administrative units i e counties or the agricultural divisions the hrus belonging to a certain administrative unit receive the abstracted water from a specific river reach the actual daily abstraction for each administrative unit is estimated to be the minimum value of either the calculated daily water demand and the discharge of the linked river reach the abstracted water is separated into two parts based on the cie irrigation water which is applied to irrigated fields and the conveyance loss in the transportation systems between the river and field the irrigation water is directly applied to the agricultural hrus as precipitation while the conveyance loss is applied to other hrus within the same administrative unit to consider water use by natural vegetation both the irrigation water and conveyance loss are included in the hydrological cycle and are not lost from the water balance there are four control volumes in the swim oasis model the soil surface the root zone of soil the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer the water balance for the soil surface and soil column includes precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface runoff and percolation the water balance for the shallow aquifer includes groundwater recharge capillary rise to the soil profile percolation to the deep aquifer and return flow to the river the module representing crops and natural vegetation applies a simplified epic approach williams et al 1984 in the swim oasis for simulating arable crops and other vegetation types vegetation in the model affects the hydrological cycle through the land cover specific retention coefficient which influences surface runoff and through the leaf area index lai which influences transpiration there are two approaches applied for the estimation of river transmission losses in the wet period summer the swim oasis model estimates the infiltration losses as a product of hydraulic conductivity travel time wetted perimeter and length of river channel and the evaporation losses as the product of potential evaporation river channel length and surface channel width since the river cross section characteristics may change significantly during the dry period winter a more empirical approach was used for this period the mean river channel width is estimated from the inflow to the considered subbasin after leopold 1994 the river transmission losses are then derived from the linear regression equation used by lane 1990 the swim oasis model was compared with the weap model water evaluation and planning sei 2005 for simulating the downstream discharge of the aksu river huang et al 2015 the weap model only considers water withdrawal from rivers without simulation of further hydrological processes while the swim oasis model includes mathematical description of the full hydrological cycle and can simulate river transmission losses recharge of the shallow aquifer and groundwater return flow the swim oasis results show that the summer peaks are better comparable with observations than the weap results due to inclusion of river transmission losses the winter low flows simulated by swim are higher than those simulated by weap due to groundwater contribution to streamflow resulting in a better representation of the observed flows in winter the results indicated that the swim oasis model is capable to simulate irrigation water movement and reproduce satisfactorily the monthly discharge of the aksu river more details about the swim oasis model and its results can be found in huang et al 2015 3 3 calculation of water demand for agricultural scenarios in our study the annual and monthly irrigation demands were estimated using the local irrigation instructions before application of the swim oasis model this was preferred over using standard approaches from other models e g by filling soil layers up to field capacity as in the swat model soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2005 or by estimation of difference between the crop specific potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation as in the watergap3 model aus der beek et al 2011 this was done for the following reasons firstly the surface irrigation technology surface flooding is prevailing in the study area secondly there is a need to irrigate in winter and spring before the growing season to achieve salt leaching and soil moisture maintenance thirdly the ultimate objective of the study is to simulate discharge at alar and the standard approaches cannot estimate the actual water use in our basins correctly also dechmi et al 2012 found for their study area in spain that it was not appropriate to simulate streamflow using the standard approach in the swat model and they defined the amount of irrigation water using data on irrigation operations instead the estimation based on the irrigation instructions needs data on the irrigation schedule irrigation quotas the irrigation area and the cie as there is no detailed information about the daily irrigation practices we assumed that the irrigation quota is evenly distributed in each irrigation period given the irrigation area area ha and the daily irrigation quota quota m3 ha for each crop the daily irrigation demand of each administrative unit id m3 can be calculated using eq 1 1 i d j i 1 13 a r e a i j q u o t a i j where j indicates the administrative unit and i is the crop type then the monthly midj and annual aidj irrigation demands for each river basin can be summed by the daily values the monthly share is obtained by the ratio of midj to aidj finally the total annual water demand tadj is calculated using eq 2 2 t a d j a i d j c j where c is the cie of administrative unit j this calculation method has proven to be reliable to estimate the annual water use and monthly variations in our previous study for the aksu basin huang et al 2015 3 4 evaluation of uncertainty from different sources in this study we applied the anova method to partition simulated variances into different contributing sources bosshard et al 2013 vetter et al 2015 we investigated the following sources climate models cm agricultural scenarios as and hydrological models hm the anova method not only provides information about the impact of the uncertainty from these three major sources on river discharge but also their interaction terms cm as as hm cm hm and cm as hm to avoid the bias caused by different sample sizes of the sources the anova was implemented for a number of subsamples each of which includes two agricultural scenarios two climate models and two hydrological simulations the obtained estimates were then averaged for more explanation of the method and equations please refer to vetter et al 2015 3 5 data for hydrological model setup calibration and validation in order to keep consistence with the headwater modeling the swim oasis model was set up using the srtm digital elevation model srtmv4 90m jarvis et al 2007 to delineate the watersheds soil data were derived from the harmonized world soils database fao et al 2012 land cover information was taken from the chinese land use map for year 2000 there is almost no observed climate data available in the mountainous areas especially in the hotan and yarkand river basins therefore we had to use reanalysis data with coarse resolutions for the entire upper tarim basin temperature mean minimum and maximum air humidity and solar radiation data available from the watch project at 0 5 arc degree for the period 1957 2001 wfd era40 weedon et al 2011 was used table 1 the precipitation data was taken from aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation version v1101 yatagai et al 2012 which is considered more reliable than the watch precipitation data because it used data from more observation stations as a basis the discharge data was obtained from different sources in different temporal resolutions and for different periods see table 1 for all headwater gauges the daily discharge was available from the hydrological yearbook but only until 1987 or 1988 and for several recent years e g 2007 2010 for the gauge stations in the aksu river and the alar station the long term monthly discharge 1957 2003 2004 was available from wang 2006 for the outlet station xiaota at the hotan river daily discharge from 1964 to 1988 was available while there was only monthly discharge available for heiniyazi at the yarkand river the observed annual water abstraction data was available for different time slices in each river basin in the aksu river basin the annual abstraction data was estimated by the water amount in the main cannels from 1984 to 2005 wang 2006 the long term mean annual abstraction data 1971 2003 for the hotan river basin was taken from huang and shen 2010 and the annual abstraction data from 1982 to 1999 for the yarkand river basin was obtained from xinjiang tarim river basin management bureau the monthly abstraction data which was used to calculate the shares of monthly water demand and the cie were available only for 1998 for the aksu wang 2006 for 2000 2003 for the yarkand and for 2002 for the hotan and were extrapolated for other years as it is shown above the data availability in our study area is inconsistent in time there were only a few overlaps in periods between the availability of the observed discharge data and water abstraction data so we had only short periods to calibrate and validate the hydrological models see section 4 1 the data problems will be discussed in more detail in section 5 3 6 climate scenarios there were four climate projections of regional climate models rcms available for this study they are three cclm cosmo climate local model rockel et al 2008 projections for rcps representative concentration pathways 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 driven by the gcm general circulation model mpi esm lr and one a1b scenario generated by the rcm remo jacob 2001 driven by the gcm echam5 mannig et al 2013 the spatial resolution of the cclm and remo outputs are 0 44 and 0 11 respectively the set of rcm projections was extended by including 24 gcm projections cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 miroc esm miroc esm chem and mri cgcm3 representing 3 rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 this ensemble enabled us to analyze uncertainties related to climate models the spatial resolution of the gcm outputs are between 1 12 and 3 75 the historical simulations of all climate models cover a period from 1960 1961 to 2000 and the climate projections start from 2001 2006 and end in 2099 the gcm rcm outputs were downscaled upscaled to a resolution of 0 5 and bias corrected to the watch and aphrodite data for the period 1960 2000 using the quantile mapping method gudmundsson et al 2012 in addition we use a trend adaptation approach to preserve the trend similar to hempel et al 2013 the reference period is 1971 2000 and three scenario periods were selected for the near 2011 2040 medium 2041 2070 and far 2071 2099 future appendix b shows the list of projections and their climate change signals in each scenario period 3 7 agricultural scenarios in 1998 when the government improvement plan gxuar and mwrc 2002 was proposed the water resource conditions in this year were considered as an important reference as a result more management data was available for this year especially for the aksu basin in addition liu et al 2010 suggested to consider the agricultural area in 1998 as an objective for the future control of cropland therefore we developed a reference scenario based on agricultural and management data in 1998 and the water flows simulated using this scenario were considered as corresponding to the governmental objective based on this reference scenario a number of combinations of agricultural scenarios were developed see table 2 in this study we used the irrigation instructions for the awati county to estimate the irrigation demands for the whole study area for the following reasons first the irrigation instructions were only available for the counties in the aksu basin wang 2006 in this study and the irrigation quota and schedule are similar across counties in aksu second the awati county is the closest county to the hotan and yarkand river basins this allows to assume that the differences among them are not significant there are five major scenario conditions related to agriculture area crop distribution cie drip irrigation ratio and river transmission losses and each of them has 2 3 options or sub scenarios as in table 2 the latter four scenario conditions are related to water saving measures the first major scenario condition is related to agricultural area and the sub scenario a0 means no changes in agricultural area referring to the agricultural area as in 1998 reference sub scenario a1 assumes a significant increase in cropland by 100 in the aksu and yarkand and 40 in the hotan corresponding to the actual changes between 1998 and 2010 fig 2 i e to arable land area in 2010 since the irrigated area has been still growing after 2010 the third sub scenario a2 considers a further increase by 150 in the yarkand and 60 in the hotan no further changes were considered in the aksu because the headwater discharge tends to decrease in the far future under climate scenarios duethmann et al 2016 the second scenario condition is related to crop distribution and includes two sub scenarios c0 assumes no changes in crop distribution as in 1998 reference and c1 corresponding to crop distribution as in 2010 no additional sub scenarios were included as the influence of crop distribution is not significant as was shown in our previous study huang et al 2015 the third scenario condition considers an improvement of leakage proofing of canals between river and fields the current cie is between 0 37 and 0 49 in the three basins meaning that only 37 49 percent of extracted water reaches the root zones according to the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china the aim is to increase the cie in xinjiang province to 0 53 by the end of 2015 and to 0 57 in 2020 hence the sub scenarios include e0 with cie as in 1998 reference e1 with cie equal to 0 53 and e2 with cie equal to 0 57 the fourth scenario condition accounts for the ratio of the drip irrigation area to the whole irrigation area as the surface irrigation was prevailing in 1998 and previous decades we designed three sub scenarios d0 with no drip irrigation as in 1998 reference d1 assuming the drip irrigated area of 25 of total and d2 of 50 of total the last scenario condition considers the potential reduction of river transmission losses in the hotan and yarkand rivers by restoration of the riverbeds the reference sub scenario r0 assumes that there are no changes in the transmission loss coefficient according to liu et al 2010 the restoration of the middle tarim riverbed saved about 30 of water amount from alar so we assumed the potential reduction of river transmission losses by 15 and 30 for the hotan and yarkand rivers in scenarios r1 and r2 respectively for the aksu river no reduction of river transmission losses is considered as the river is short and well regulated in total there are a maximum of 162 combinations of the agricultural and water management scenarios the combination of all first sub scenarios named as a0c0e0d0r0 denotes the reference scenario in addition we selected 30 combinations to study the impacts of individual and combined measures appendix c for example scenario a1c1e2d2r2 means an increase in irrigated area by 100 in the aksu and yarkand basins and 40 in the hotan basin crop distribution as in 2010 cie of 0 57 application of the drip irrigation method at about 50 of area and reduction in river transmission losses of about 30 in the hotan and yarkand rivers 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation due to the different temporal availability of climate discharge and water abstraction data table 1 the swim oasis model was calibrated only for the period from 1984 to 1988 using the observed headwater discharges and abstraction information as input the reason for using the observed headwater discharge is to avoid errors from the simulated headwater discharge and calibrate the river transmission losses correctly however due to a lack of observed discharge data after 1989 swim oasis could only be validated for the period 1989 2000 at the alar station using the simulated headwater discharge by the swim g or wasa models as input fig 4 shows the observed and simulated monthly discharges at the gauges xiaota hotan xidaqiao aksu heiniyazi yarkand and alar tarim during the calibration period in general the simulation results for the hotan river are in good agreement with the observed discharge nse is 0 96 the seasonal dynamics of the aksu river discharge is also well simulated with nse of 0 92 but the total amount is slightly underestimated the discharge of the yarkand river is overestimated for the year 1988 for this river with very low mean observed discharge of 1 33 m3 s discharge is very sensitive to any human interferences a slight underestimation of the abstraction can increase discharge at the river outlet significantly overall the simulated discharge at alar is acceptable with nse of 0 77 and an underestimation of about 15 which is mainly due to the underestimation of the aksu river discharge fig 5 shows the validation results of the monthly discharge at alar for the period 1989 2000 using the simulated headwater discharges from wasa and swim g models separately since the abstraction data and the swim oasis model are the same the differences between the validation runs are associated with the simulated headwater discharges by the two models in general both combinations of the hydrological models could generate average monthly discharge at alar satisfactory see graphs on the right with nse larger than 0 8 and bias within the range of 10 however both combinations of models slightly underestimate discharge in june and july probably due to the share of monthly water demand which was derived from the data from some certain years see section 3 5 a reasonable simulation of average monthly discharge is important for this study as the mean annual and monthly discharges over the reference and scenario periods were used for climate impact analysis 4 2 potential change in river discharges under climate change to assess the impacts of pure climate change the swim oasis model was run with the simulated headwater discharges from the swim g and wasa models under the same climate projections and the agricultural reference scenario a0c0e0d0r0 the simulated results for the reference period were considered as the reference discharge or the government objective changes are calculated between this reference discharge and the simulated discharge in the future the upper three graphs in fig 6 show the relative changes in annual mean discharge at alar for the three scenario periods under the a1b scenario from remo and three rcp scenarios from cclm all results show that there would be an increase in discharge at alar throughout the century except for the wasa swim oasis results under the a1b scenario in the far future period 2071 2099 the increase in discharge is mainly due to increase in melting water under a warmer climate and increase in precipitation especially in the hotan and yarkand headwaters see appendix b however the increase in the far future is less prominent than in the near and medium future probably due to glaciers shrinkage in the headwater basins in general the combination of wasa and swim oasis generates greater increase than the swim g and swim oasis models in the near future but lower increase or a decrease in the far future it shows that the differences between the two glaciohydrological models lead to discrepancies in the projection of water resources for this semi arid region especially in the far future in addition to the total annual relative changes we also compared the seasonal distribution of the total annual changes fig 7 simulated by two combinations of hydrological models under two scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the increase in discharge is dominant in four months from june to september there is hardly any increase in march april and november the projected increase in discharge during summer the high flow period would be especially beneficial for the main tarim river because the river water can only reach the downstream tarim when the discharge at alar exceeds 400 m3 s for more than 20 days chen et al 2009 4 3 potential changes in river discharges under both agricultural and climate scenarios the results in section 4 2 show that the objectives of the governmental plan could be achieved under the warming climate if the agricultural area would return to the extent of 1998 even without any water saving measures however the historical trend of the agricultural area in this region shows that it is almost impossible or very difficult to reduce the agricultural area to the level as in 1998 fig 2 the local people extended agricultural area whenever they had more water available in the rivers hence it is interesting to know what happens if the agricultural area would stay at the level of 2010 scenario a1c0e0d0r0 the lower three graphs in fig 6 show the relative changes in the annual mean discharge at alar under four rcm climate projections and the agricultural scenario a1c0e0d0r0 the agricultural area as in 2010 leads to a significant reduction of discharge up to 50 under all climate scenarios except the remo a1b scenario in the medium future and the cclm rcp8 5 scenario in the far future this indicates that the increase in the headwater discharges cannot compensate the increase in the irrigation water demand caused by an extended cropland and the objective of the governmental plan can be hardly achieved if the agricultural area remains as in 2010 without any saving water measures fig 8 shows a comparison of the effects of different combinations of agricultural scenarios under all four rcm projections shown as vertical bars comparing the single moderate water saving measures we can see that change in crop distribution scenario a1c1e0d0r0 leads to minor changes of only 2 5 in river discharge compared to scenario a1c0e0d0r0 improvement of the cie scenario a1c0e1d0r0 substantially reduces the irrigation water demand and leads to a positive change saving about 15 50 water in the near future and 6 30 water in the far future the effect of this measure is less significant in the last period probably due to lower water availability in rivers in this period see fig 6 the other two moderate measures an increase of drip irrigation area scenario a1c0e0d1r0 and a reduction of river transmission losses scenario a1c0e0d0r1 lead to savings of about 2 15 and 4 5 of water in the near future and 2 3 and 4 7 of water in the far future correspondingly when all moderate measures scenario a1c1e1d1r1 are combined the effect is strong and mostly positive changes in river discharge are projected if all strong measures e g scenario a1c1e2d2r2 were applied in combination the governmental objective would always be achieved no matter which rcm climate scenario would be realized however if the agricultural area increases further scenarios a2c1e1d1r1 and a2c1e2d2r2 there is still a risk of water reduction in the tarim in the far future especially if the moderate measures are applied finally we compared the results driven by three cclm projections with the ones driven by 24 projections from gcms for the three rcps fig 9 shows selected results for four agricultural scenarios reference scenario a0c0e0d0r0 scenario a1c0e0d0r0 scenario a1c1e1d1r2 and scenario a2c1e2d2r2 in general the results driven by the cclm projections are always within 25 to 75 percentiles of the projections driven by the gcms the results from the combination of wasa and swim oasis models usually have larger ranges i e higher uncertainty than the ones from the swim g swim oasis models and they often project more negative changes in river discharge in the medium and far future there is also larger uncertainty in the projections under the higher rcp scenarios compared to the results driven by the cclm outputs the ensemble results under all 24 gcm projections show a high risk of decreases in river discharge for example positive changes were projected under the cclm rcp8 5 scenario and the agricultural scenarios a1c1e1d1r1 and a2c1e2d2r2 but about half of the ensemble results driven by the gcm rcp8 5 scenarios show negative changes simulated by the wasa and swim oasis models this is likely due to the lower temperature increase projected by cclm as compared to the mean of the selected gcms in addition it indicates that even the strong water saving measures suggested in this study cannot ensure water resources availability in the tarim river at the end of this century due to uncertainty in future climate it should also be noticed that the uncertainty of projections under the high rcp scenarios is much larger than that under the lower ones hence it would be more difficult to make management decisions based on such large uncertainties from the high rcp scenarios 4 4 quantifying different sources contributing to projection uncertainty as shown in section 4 3 the uncertainty in projected results caused by climate models including both rcm and gcms hydrological models and agricultural scenarios is substantial fig 10 illustrates the contribution of different sources to the overall uncertainty of the projected changes in three scenario periods for each rcp scenario in general the relative uncertainty caused by climate models increases with rcp forcing in the near future the agricultural scenarios explain more than 40 of the total uncertainty and the climate models contribute to about 30 the hydrological models contribute only about 10 indicating that the hydrological simulations for the headwaters are relatively robust in the medium future the uncertainty caused by the agricultural scenarios is reduced by 15 20 while the uncertainties caused by the climate and hydrological models increase by about 7 10 in the far future the agricultural scenarios become even less important and the climate and hydrological models play major roles in the uncertainty of the projections note that the absolute uncertainty caused by the agricultural scenarios remains the same in all three periods and rcp scenarios and the total absolute uncertainty increases in the medium and far future and in higher rcps due to the increasing uncertainty related to the climate models and hydrological models 5 discussion a novelty of this study is the application of multiple climate projections and agricultural scenarios and two combinations of hydrological models in the climate adaptation assessment the agricultural scenarios include not only changes in agricultural areas but also the water saving measures proposed by the government plan and previous studies these scenarios are based on the current trends and assumptions but they can be modified under the rapid economic and technological developments of the region however we should notice that this study only assessed the impacts on river discharge and further efforts are required to assess the influence on the oasis environment and social economic development for example a reduction of agricultural area to the level of 1998 is the most effective measure to ensure the discharge quota at alar but it may harm the local farmers interests this is also related to the change of crop distributions as both crop water demand and the economic interests should be considered the improvement of cie use of drip irrigation and restoration of river bed could reduce agricultural water use and river transmission losses but they could also reduce groundwater recharge and the ecological water use in the oases areas and riparian zones zhong et al 2009 as a result the whole oasis ecosystem could be negatively affected in addition drip irrigation as well as other deficit irrigation methods using the highly mineralized river water could lead to degradation of soil quality such water saving technologies must be combined with flood irrigation after the growing season to reduce salt accumulation in the soil profile chen et al 2010 at present the aksu river is the most important water source for the tarim river but its discharge is likely to decrease under a warming climate mainly due to the retreat of glaciers duethmann et al 2016 an interesting finding of this study is that the increase in discharge at alar is mainly due to the increase in the headwater discharges of the hotan and yarkand rivers in the future described in section 3 1 and wortmann 2017 despite the rapid glacier and snow melting under higher temperatures the increase in precipitation in the mountainous regions is prominent under higher rcp scenarios see appendix b if the water demand can be controlled properly and the river transmission losses are reduced the hotan and yarkand rivers can become more important water sources to the tarim river in the future another important finding of this study is that there is no high risk to have less annual water in the tarim river under high rcp scenarios these results are consistent with the pure climate impact study by liu et al 2013 under the a1b a2 and b1 scenarios especially at the end of this century however the stakeholders should not be too optimistic as the low rcp scenarios may be more likely to realize after the climate change conference in paris under the rcp2 6 scenario the discharge at alar is likely to decrease at the end of this century under more than half of the projections by both combinations of hydrological models the rcm scenarios are usually considered to be more precise and reliable than the gcm scenarios for the regional climate impact studies elguindi et al 2011 however the high resolution rcm scenarios remo in this study could not provide much better spatial information than the gcm scenarios because they were upscaled and bias corrected using the reanalysis data 0 5 in order to make use of the rcm scenarios in the future reliable observed climate data would be helpful to correct the rcm data at a finer resolution moreover the resolution of the applied rcms is still very coarse for such a complex high mountain region and even finer resolution of the rcm projects are preferred in the future due to lack of the observed climate data in our study the simulation of water generation is afflicted with high uncertainties the large differences in the projections between the two glaciohydrological models are attributed not only to their different methods of calculating snow and glacier processes but also to the equifinality problem caused by the uncertainty of precipitation data glacier mass balance data and calibration parameters in general the wasa model simulates stronger snow and glacier melt in the near future than the swim g model and it leads to a faster glacier retreat as a result there is less glacier storage available and less glacier melt occurs in the wasa simulations for the medium and far future more detailed discussion on these two models is available in wortmann 2017 the lack of sufficient observed discharge data spatially and in time makes the calibration and validation procedure for the lowland area complicated as well the models for all headwaters could be calibrated and validated only for periods before 1987 1988 but the swim oasis model had to be validated in 1990s when the better quality water abstraction data was available the simulation error at alar is caused by headwater and the oasis model as well as abstraction data however it is impossible to attribute these errors without better information on observed discharge and abstraction amount there was also lack of irrigation data for such a large scale study we had only the irrigation instructions for the aksu basin and assumed that the irrigation quota and schedule for the awati county could be also applied for the hotan and yarkand basins this assumption is questionable because these three basins have different geographic and climatic conditions we compared the estimated water demand and the actual water withdrawal from 1989 to 2002 for the hotan and yarkand basins using available data the biases were 8 and 13 respectively which is still acceptable however the availability of local irrigation information would increase the robustness of the climate and agricultural impact study in these two basins in addition we should notice that in reality the irrigation quota from the instructions may not match the crop water demand in this study we did not aim to evaluate the simulated water demand at a daily time step as well as annual crop yields in order to better simulate the daily water demand and crop yields the calculation of irrigation demands using standard approaches would be more appropriate than the method based on irrigation instructions however in such a case the effects of flooding irrigations especially for soil leaching before sawing and moisture maintenance would be poorly represented and the simulated discharge could not be directly compared to the government quota 6 conclusions this study presents a first comprehensive analysis of climate and adaptation measures impacts on water resources at alar the last gauge of the upper tarim river using headwater discharge of two combinations of hydrological models 28 climate projections and 30 agricultural scenarios the results provide not only a basis for creating optimal plans of sustainable development for the upper tarim river but also valuable information on water availability to the downstream water users in addition the study shows that simulation models can serve as tools to provide comprehensive information for local climate adaptation policy making the projected results show that the river discharge at alar is likely to increase in a warmer climate if the agricultural area is reduced to the level as in 1998 without water saving measures there would be more water under higher rcp forcing scenarios than under the lower ones due to increased glacier melting and increased precipitation the agricultural area as in 2010 would directly lead to greater demands of irrigation water and would reduce water availability in the main tarim river if the agricultural area as in 2010 is kept in the future strong water saving measures must be applied to ensure continued water inflow to the tarim under all climate scenarios however if the area continues to expand a decrease in river discharge in the upper tarim at the end of this century under the rcp2 6 scenario can be expected hence the expansion of agricultural area should be strictly controlled or combined with water saving measures that are even stronger than the ones considered in this study the uncertainty of the projection results is much larger in the far than in the near future which is mainly caused by the climate and headwater models in high rcp forcing scenarios the significant differences in the projections between the two headwater models confirm that the uncertainty from hydrological models should not be ignored in climate impact studies for this region more and better observation data is required to improve the model parameterization to reduce the overall uncertainty of the model chain in the lowland area additional information on discharge and irrigation practices would be helpful to improve the model reliability for simulations in arid regions future studies should also consider other potential impacts on the oasis environment and socio economic issues acknowledgements this work is supported

11481,the upper tarim river basin contributing about 85 of the total inflow to the mainstream tarim river is heavily influenced by climate change and human interferences this study is the first integrated assessment of agriculture and water management under climate change scenarios for this arid river basin in central asia it aims to analyze changes in river discharge of the upper tarim under 28 climate projections for 3 representative concentration pathways rcp and the a1b scenario and 30 combinations of changes in land use agricultural area and water saving measures considered as adaptation strategies headwater discharge simulations of two hydrological models swim g and wasa are used to drive a hydrological model of the lowland area swim oasis taking account irrigation and river transmission losses the projections show that the river discharge of the upper tarim river is likely to increase in a warmer climate if the agricultural area is reduced to the level as in 1998 even without any water saving measures if the agricultural area increases to the 2010 level strong water saving measures must be applied to ensure sufficient water inflow to the mainstream tarim under all climate scenarios if agricultural area continues to expand there is a risk of decreasing river discharge at the end of this century under the rcp2 6 scenario the uncertainty of the projections is large especially in the far future and it is mainly related to the climate and hydrological models keywords climate change adaptation agricultural water saving measures tarim swim wasa 1 introduction within the climate change research community increasing attention has been given to adaptation to a changing climate arnell 2010 however it is still less common to assess the consequences of land use change adapted water management and climate scenarios together in addition most adaptation studies kirby et al 2014 kling et al 2014 tu 2009 assessed the impacts of potential changes and only a few studies specifically addressed the actual or planned adaptation measures to cope with climate change impacts arnell 2010 one of the few examples is the combined bottom up and top down assessment of climate change adaptation by bhave et al 2014 who selected three adaptation options prioritized by stakeholders and projected impacts on streamflow under four climate projections for the kangsabati river catchment in india these adaptation studies reported in literature usually consider a small number of land use change or management scenarios and each climate scenario is combined with only one change in either land use or management a combination of different land use and management options is rare in climate impact assessments applications and comparisons of modelling results from more than one impact model are also rare in climate adaptation analysis however the uncertainty related to impact models e g hydrological models can be comparable to that related to climate models for some specific basins velazquez et al 2013 vetter et al 2015 though most often the latter dominates vetter et al 2016 since water planning and operation decisions are affected by large uncertainties related to both climate scenarios and impact models climate adaptation studies should examine not only various climate scenarios but also the application of several impact models to evaluate uncertainty and to produce robust results central asia is highly vulnerable to water scarcity due to the arid climate and intensive irrigated agriculture attention has already been paid to the vulnerability to climate change and the adaptation measures in this region aleksandrova et al 2014 the tarim river is the largest endorheic river in china it receives water from four mountainous tributaries the aksu hotan yarkand and kaidu rivers and dries up in the taklamakan desert the length of the river decreased by about 770 km about 35 of the total length from 1990s to 2009 mainly due to the intensive irrigation and increased population in the river oases along the tributaries and the mainstream tarim river chen et al 2009 consequently the whole oasis ecosystem of the tarim was adversely affected by the strong decrease in river runoff downstream xu et al 2008 the project sumario sustainable management of river oases along the tarim river china http www sumario de 2011 2016 funded by the german ministry for education and research aimed to find a sustainable development strategy for the tarim river region that would maintain both ecosystem services and economic benefits rumbaur et al 2015 to achieve this goal the first question to answer is how much water would be available for the tarim river oases in the future accounting for climate change agriculture and water management options as the upper three tributaries aksu hotan and yarkand contribute about 85 of the total water inflow to the tarim river gou et al 2010 the future discharge from these tributaries is a key factor to determine the total water availability in the mainstream despite the importance of analyzing the future water resources in the tarim river studies focusing on this topic for the region are limited several published studies analyzed the historical trends changes and impacts for the tarim river or its tributaries fu et al 2012 krysanova et al 2015 xu et al 2013 recently keilholz et al 2015 projected the impacts of climate and land use changes on groundwater in a middle reach of the tarim river fang et al 2015 projected the impacts of climate change on streamflow of the kaidu river yu et al 2015 analyzed the impacts of irrigation and water saving measures on discharge in the main tarim river in the period 2006 2008 specifically for the upper tarim liu et al 2013 projected changes in runoff using a distributed macro scale hydrological model under the a1b a2 and b1 scenarios however their modeling didn t consider any glacier changes in the headwaters or water uses in the lowland area a more advanced hydrological modeling was presented by duethmann et al 2016 who investigated impacts of climate change on glaciers and discharge in headwater catchments of the aksu river using an ensemble of different emission scenarios climate models and parameters of the hydrological model to our best knowledge none of the previous studies could provide a robust projection on streamflow for the entire upper tarim including both agricultural water use and climate impacts in the assessment to fill this gap our study is the first comprehensive climate impact and adaptation assessment on the water availability at the alar station the last gauge station of the upper tarim river based on a large number of climate agricultural and water management scenarios including the real planned measures for simplicity we will use agricultural scenarios instead of agricultural and water management scenarios as a short term in the following text in addition we applied simulation results from two glaciohydrological models for headwaters to investigate the uncertainty related to hydrological models the main objectives of this study are 1 to project river discharge of the upper tarim river at the alar station under various climate projections 2 to quantify the effects of various agricultural scenarios in combination with climate change on discharge 3 to find robust adaptation measures for the near medium and far future and 4 to analyze the uncertainty of projected impacts related to the climate models hydrological models and agricultural scenarios 2 study area the tarim river basin is mainly located in the northwest of china with parts of the headwater areas in kyrgyzstan and pakistan the mainstream of the tarim river begins at the confluence of three tributaries the aksu yarkand and hotan rivers fig 1 a the hydrologically active catchment area i e without endorheic lakes and rivers not reaching the mainstream until the alar station is defined here as the upper tarim basin with a total drainage area of 184 567 km2 the upper tarim river can be divided into two parts according to different topographic climatic and hydrological conditions the five headwaters in the mountains until the gauges xiehela shaliguilanke kaqun wuluwati and tongguziluoke and the lowland area between the headwater stations and the alar station in the taklamakan desert fig 1a the headwaters of the three tributaries are mainly fed by snow and glacier melting in the mountains and are hardly influenced by human activities the headwaters of the aksu river have the largest discharge at 255 6 m3 s on average in the period from 1957 to 2005 while the headwaters of the yarkand and the hotan rivers provide smaller amount of water resources 208 6 and 142 8 m3 s on average xie et al 2007 in the lowland area there is little water generation due to extremely low rainfall 30 60 mm year and high potential evaporation 2000 3000 mm year xu et al 2008 bare soil is the dominant land cover type but there are large oases along the rivers covered by irrigated cropland forest and grassland the irrigation water is important not only for agriculture but also for the whole oasis ecosystem all natural vegetation depends on groundwater which is recharged by seepage from streams water delivery canals and irrigated fields zhong et al 2009 hence a large amount of irrigation water is used by both crops and natural vegetation in the oases in addition so called river transmission losses i e evaporation and percolation in rivers are important processes especially for rivers in arid regions hughes 2008 as a result the water use in oases and river transmission losses lead to a reduction of river discharge between the headwaters and the alar station downstream the inflows from the hotan and yarkand rivers to the tarim are gauged by the stations xiaota and heiniyazi near the outlet of these rivers respectively for the aksu river no discharge data is available at the outlet for this study however the gauge station xidaqiao provides the discharge information at the confluence of the two headwaters toshkan and kumarik rivers as the most upstream gauge of the tarim river the alar station monitors the inflow of all three tributaries i e the available water amounts entering the main tarim river which this study focuses on in the past 53 years 1957 2009 the average inflow to the tarim river was about 140 m3 s including 73 water from the aksu 24 from the hotan and 3 from the yarkand gou et al 2010 due to large river transmission losses and water use in the oases only the aksu river maintains a permanent inflow to the tarim river the hotan river contributes to the tarim only during the flooding season july september regarding the yarkand river there was no water runoff into the tarim river since 1985 except during two extreme floods in 1994 and 2005 the 270 km river reach downstream is dry for most years the total annual streamflow from all headwater stations tended to increase in the period 1956 2009 see appendix a the increase is mainly due to the increase of discharge in the aksu headwaters and this is explained by climatic changes duethmann et al 2016 despite the increasing trend in the headwater flow the annual streamflow at the alar station shows a decreasing trend indicating an increasing trend of water use in the oases mainly due to the increasing water demand for the expansion of irrigated area in this region deng et al 2013 since the headwaters and the lowland area are so different in terms of hydrological processes and human influences we divided our model domain into two parts 1 headwater regions modelled by two glaciohydrological models and 2 the lowland area modelled by one hydrological model considering irrigation water use and river transmission loss simulation results for the headwater regions are shown in wortmann 2017 and duethmann et al 2016 using the simulated headwater discharge as input this study focuses on the lowland area and projects the discharge at the alar station as the water availability from the entire upper tarim basin 2 1 the agricultural conditions in the lowland area the agricultural water use is the major focus of this study abstractions in this sector account for about 95 of the total water use in the tarim river basin in order to understand the recent historical agricultural changes in the lowland areas we analyzed data from the following statistical yearbooks the xinjiang statistical yearbooks xjsyb 1990 2012 for local counties and the bingtuan statistical yearbooks btsyb 1990 2012 for the agricultural divisions from the xinjiang production and construction corps from 1989 to 2011 fig 2 shows the historical development of the total cultivated area including cropland forest and orchard a and the distribution of crops b d in the oases of three tributary basins in general the total cultivated area was increasing continuously in the recent 20 years and the expansion became drastic between 2004 and 2009 in the aksu and yarkand river basins the increase in area is a result of population growth increase in agricultural profitability the local afforestation programs pushing for the establishment of orchards and insufficient restriction measures of agricultural land expansion feike et al 2015 the distribution of crops is different among these three river basins in the asku basin cotton is the dominant crop accounting for about 50 of the total agricultural area since 2000 in the hotan basin winter wheat and maize are the main crops and their areas are relatively constant after 2000 in the yarkand river basin cotton winter wheat and maize are the dominant crops covering 60 80 of the total area rice which requires more water compared to other crops is mainly planted in the aksu basin and its area gradually declined in the last decade an increasing trend of the forest and orchard areas is found in all three river basins especially after 2000 due to the local afforestation programs 2 2 irrigation practices according to zhong et al 2009 surface irrigation is still the most widespread and important method accounting for over 80 of the irrigation area in the xinjiang province however the areas using water saving irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation spray irrigation and low pressure pipeline delivery irrigation increased rapidly over the last decade the drip irrigation is the most popular water saving technology applied in 64 of the total water saving irrigation area in xinjiang by the end of 2004 water is mainly delivered through canals from rivers to farmland however the water seepage in traditional canals is very high accounting for 50 60 of the total water withdrawal in canals with sandy soils the seepage can be as high as 70 as a result the conventional irrigation efficiency cie which is defined as the efficiency of the total process of irrigation from the source of water to the point where the water becomes available in the root zone of plants merwe et al 1997 is rather low ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 depending on region in general the cie in the aksu basin is higher than in the other two basins in order to avoid waste of water and enhance the irrigation management each county in the aksu basin and the agricultural division set up an irrigation instruction regulating the irrigation schedule and quotas wang 2006 these instructions consider that irrigation is required not only during the main growing season may to september but also during winter and early spring to achieve salt leaching and soil moisture conservation for example the instruction for the awati county lists the irrigation schedule and quotas for winter wheat maize rice cotton with surface irrigation cotton with drip irrigation beet oil plant other economic plants orchard vegetables forest and grassland as the dominant and important crop cotton should be irrigated five times a year the five irrigation periods are 20th feb 10th mar before sowing 11th jun 20th jun squaring stage 11th jul 21th jul flowering stage 10th aug 20th aug boll stage and 25th aug 5th sep boll opening stage with irrigation quotas of 1200 975 975 975 975 m3 ha respectively in total 5100 m3 water is needed to irrigate one hectare of cotton per year for cotton with drip irrigation there are twelve irrigation periods in total including one irrigation before sowing of 1350 m3 ha in march and eleven irrigations of 300 m3 ha each during the growing season compared to the surface irrigation for cotton the drip irrigation requires longer irrigation duration but less water per day for winter wheat one summer irrigation from august to september and one autumn irrigation from october to november are required before the crop starts to grow the total irrigation quota per year ranges from 4500 to 6000 m3 ha for all crops except for rice which requires 13500 m3 ha note that the irrigation quota in the instruction refer only to water that reaches the root zone of crop taking into account the low cie in the three basins the average irrigation water demands are around 11 300 m3 ha 1 and 14 300 m3 ha 1 in the north and south xinjiang respectively deng 2010 2 3 the governmental plan for the tarim river basin in 2001 the government of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region gxuar and the ministry of water resources of p r china mwrc approved a planning report for immediate comprehensive improvement to the tarim river basin gxuar and mwrc 2002 this plan aims to ensure the ecological water demand in the main tarim river until 2010 by adopting a quota system to fix the water use in the three tributaries and between the upper middle and lower reaches of the tarim river specifically for our study area the tarim river at the alar station should receive 4 6 billion m3 year ca 146 m3 s under average climatic conditions according to this plan this represents the median streamflow for the historical discharge from 1957 to 1998 to achieve this goal different measures were carried out such as improvements of the transportation canals use of water saving irrigation technologies restriction of agricultural area to the field area from 1998 construction of reservoirs in the headwaters increase in groundwater exploration and restoration of the main tarim river bed thevs 2011 however the objective of the plan could not be achieved until 2010 the average water flow at alar decreased by about 26 m3 s in the period from 2001 to 2009 while the average inflow from the five headwaters increased by about 86 m3 s compared to the average inflow amount in the last 50 years hence liu et al 2010 suggested to restrict the expansion of irrigated area in the three tributary basins and to restore the hotan and yarkand river beds downstream in their opinion it is only viable to increase the irrigated area in the hotan basin while the irrigated areas in the other two basins should be reduced to the level of 1998 3 methods and data fig 3 shows the flowchart of the models as well as the major input data this study uses results of two glaciohydrological models simulating the five highly glacier covered headwaters as input the models and their results are briefly described in section 3 1 with more detailed presentations given in duethmann et al 2016 and wortmann 2017 the two headwater models enable us to account for the uncertainty introduced by glaciohydrological impact models the lowland area was simulated by the model swim oasis section 3 2 and is calibrated using the same reference data watch and aphrodite as the two headwater models the same climate scenarios were used in both headwater models and the lowland model section 3 3 presents how water use was calculated based on the irrigation instructions for agricultural scenarios the uncertainty sources were quantified using the anova method section 3 4 and the input data are introduced in sections 3 5 3 7 3 1 the headwater modelling the results of two glaciohydrological models wasa water availability in semi arid environments and swim g soil and water integrated model glacier dynamics were used wasa is a semi distributed glaciohydrological model that simulates snow and glacier cover as well as the catchment hydrology at a daily time step gÃ¼ntner and bronstert 2004 the spatial structure is based on catchments subcatchments and 200 m elevation zones the spatial variability of snow within an elevation zone is represented by a snow depletion curve liston 2004 snow is further redistributed from higher to lower elevation zones if simulated snow outside a glacier accumulates above a given snow water equivalent threshold glacier area and surface elevation changes are simulated using the Î´h approach by huss et al 2010 and updated annually glaciers are considered individually and discretized into 50 m elevation bands based on the simulated mass balance of the glacier thickness changes in each elevation band are calculated using predefined functions derived from observed glacier thickness changes of the ak shirak massif located at the western border of the aksu basin in the period 1977 1999 surazakov and aizen 2006 the glacier area is reduced if the thickness change in an elevation band is higher than the remaining ice thickness snow and glacier melt are calculated using a temperature index approach hock 2003 a detailed model description can be found in duethmann et al 2016 swim g is the glaciohydrological version of the semi distributed ecohydrological model swim soil and water integrated model krysanova et al 1998 it was used to simulate both individual glaciers and the catchment hydrology of the five headwaters in a tightly integrated approach wortmann 2017 it relies on computational units that disaggregate complex terrain into parts of similar elevation aspect and hydrological subbasin glaciological response units as opposed to gridded fully distributed or empirical approaches immerzeel et al 2011 huss et al 2010 the units are conceptually similar and computationally equal to the hydrological response units hrus the mass balance is evaluated considering snow accumulation based on threshold temperature as well as avalanching and an enhanced degree day melting approach the latter includes aspect and terrain shading debris melt out and sublimation like most hydrological processes the glacier processes are computed daily for each unit and ice is routed laterally between them according to an adapted glen s flow law approach marshall et al 2011 the swim g and wasa models were successfully calibrated and validated for the five headwater gauges at the daily time step against river discharge glacier area hypsometery and mass balance swim g and against river discharge and glacier mass balance wasa since glacier mass balance data during the simulation period were only available in the aksu basin we derived assumptions based on icesat data which are available for a more recent period for the hotan and yarkand basins both models successfully reproduced daily river discharge in all five headwaters daily nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse between 0 60 0 85 absolute bias less than 15 in the calibration period and nse between 0 70 0 80 absolute bias less than 15 in the validation period the details of the calibration validation procedure and results are reported in duethmann et al 2016 and wortmann 2017 results of the impact assessment for the headwaters show an initial increase in river discharge in the first scenario period 2011 2040 by 20 30 at the ensemble median similar to the changes that have already been observed subsequent changes are strongly scenario dependent and show increasing discharge in the hotan and yarkand in all periods 30 50 at the ensemble median glacier area loss over the 21 st century is limited to ca 20 under the rcp2 6 scenario but as high as 75 in the higher end scenarios while glaciers are generally on the decline causing an eventual decrease in melt water by the end of the century precipitation is also projected to increase in the region the wasa and swim g models indicated that this increase is able to partially counterbalance melt water losses in downstream discharge the full results for the headwaters are published in duethmann et al 2016 and wortmann 2017 3 2 the swim oasis model the swim oasis model is a version of swim adapted to the arid oasis environment of the taklamakan desert with a simple irrigation module and a river transmission loss module huang et al 2015 in the irrigation module the hrus are discretized by subbasins land use soil types and the boundaries of the administrative units i e counties or the agricultural divisions the hrus belonging to a certain administrative unit receive the abstracted water from a specific river reach the actual daily abstraction for each administrative unit is estimated to be the minimum value of either the calculated daily water demand and the discharge of the linked river reach the abstracted water is separated into two parts based on the cie irrigation water which is applied to irrigated fields and the conveyance loss in the transportation systems between the river and field the irrigation water is directly applied to the agricultural hrus as precipitation while the conveyance loss is applied to other hrus within the same administrative unit to consider water use by natural vegetation both the irrigation water and conveyance loss are included in the hydrological cycle and are not lost from the water balance there are four control volumes in the swim oasis model the soil surface the root zone of soil the shallow aquifer and the deep aquifer the water balance for the soil surface and soil column includes precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface runoff and percolation the water balance for the shallow aquifer includes groundwater recharge capillary rise to the soil profile percolation to the deep aquifer and return flow to the river the module representing crops and natural vegetation applies a simplified epic approach williams et al 1984 in the swim oasis for simulating arable crops and other vegetation types vegetation in the model affects the hydrological cycle through the land cover specific retention coefficient which influences surface runoff and through the leaf area index lai which influences transpiration there are two approaches applied for the estimation of river transmission losses in the wet period summer the swim oasis model estimates the infiltration losses as a product of hydraulic conductivity travel time wetted perimeter and length of river channel and the evaporation losses as the product of potential evaporation river channel length and surface channel width since the river cross section characteristics may change significantly during the dry period winter a more empirical approach was used for this period the mean river channel width is estimated from the inflow to the considered subbasin after leopold 1994 the river transmission losses are then derived from the linear regression equation used by lane 1990 the swim oasis model was compared with the weap model water evaluation and planning sei 2005 for simulating the downstream discharge of the aksu river huang et al 2015 the weap model only considers water withdrawal from rivers without simulation of further hydrological processes while the swim oasis model includes mathematical description of the full hydrological cycle and can simulate river transmission losses recharge of the shallow aquifer and groundwater return flow the swim oasis results show that the summer peaks are better comparable with observations than the weap results due to inclusion of river transmission losses the winter low flows simulated by swim are higher than those simulated by weap due to groundwater contribution to streamflow resulting in a better representation of the observed flows in winter the results indicated that the swim oasis model is capable to simulate irrigation water movement and reproduce satisfactorily the monthly discharge of the aksu river more details about the swim oasis model and its results can be found in huang et al 2015 3 3 calculation of water demand for agricultural scenarios in our study the annual and monthly irrigation demands were estimated using the local irrigation instructions before application of the swim oasis model this was preferred over using standard approaches from other models e g by filling soil layers up to field capacity as in the swat model soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2005 or by estimation of difference between the crop specific potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation as in the watergap3 model aus der beek et al 2011 this was done for the following reasons firstly the surface irrigation technology surface flooding is prevailing in the study area secondly there is a need to irrigate in winter and spring before the growing season to achieve salt leaching and soil moisture maintenance thirdly the ultimate objective of the study is to simulate discharge at alar and the standard approaches cannot estimate the actual water use in our basins correctly also dechmi et al 2012 found for their study area in spain that it was not appropriate to simulate streamflow using the standard approach in the swat model and they defined the amount of irrigation water using data on irrigation operations instead the estimation based on the irrigation instructions needs data on the irrigation schedule irrigation quotas the irrigation area and the cie as there is no detailed information about the daily irrigation practices we assumed that the irrigation quota is evenly distributed in each irrigation period given the irrigation area area ha and the daily irrigation quota quota m3 ha for each crop the daily irrigation demand of each administrative unit id m3 can be calculated using eq 1 1 i d j i 1 13 a r e a i j q u o t a i j where j indicates the administrative unit and i is the crop type then the monthly midj and annual aidj irrigation demands for each river basin can be summed by the daily values the monthly share is obtained by the ratio of midj to aidj finally the total annual water demand tadj is calculated using eq 2 2 t a d j a i d j c j where c is the cie of administrative unit j this calculation method has proven to be reliable to estimate the annual water use and monthly variations in our previous study for the aksu basin huang et al 2015 3 4 evaluation of uncertainty from different sources in this study we applied the anova method to partition simulated variances into different contributing sources bosshard et al 2013 vetter et al 2015 we investigated the following sources climate models cm agricultural scenarios as and hydrological models hm the anova method not only provides information about the impact of the uncertainty from these three major sources on river discharge but also their interaction terms cm as as hm cm hm and cm as hm to avoid the bias caused by different sample sizes of the sources the anova was implemented for a number of subsamples each of which includes two agricultural scenarios two climate models and two hydrological simulations the obtained estimates were then averaged for more explanation of the method and equations please refer to vetter et al 2015 3 5 data for hydrological model setup calibration and validation in order to keep consistence with the headwater modeling the swim oasis model was set up using the srtm digital elevation model srtmv4 90m jarvis et al 2007 to delineate the watersheds soil data were derived from the harmonized world soils database fao et al 2012 land cover information was taken from the chinese land use map for year 2000 there is almost no observed climate data available in the mountainous areas especially in the hotan and yarkand river basins therefore we had to use reanalysis data with coarse resolutions for the entire upper tarim basin temperature mean minimum and maximum air humidity and solar radiation data available from the watch project at 0 5 arc degree for the period 1957 2001 wfd era40 weedon et al 2011 was used table 1 the precipitation data was taken from aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation version v1101 yatagai et al 2012 which is considered more reliable than the watch precipitation data because it used data from more observation stations as a basis the discharge data was obtained from different sources in different temporal resolutions and for different periods see table 1 for all headwater gauges the daily discharge was available from the hydrological yearbook but only until 1987 or 1988 and for several recent years e g 2007 2010 for the gauge stations in the aksu river and the alar station the long term monthly discharge 1957 2003 2004 was available from wang 2006 for the outlet station xiaota at the hotan river daily discharge from 1964 to 1988 was available while there was only monthly discharge available for heiniyazi at the yarkand river the observed annual water abstraction data was available for different time slices in each river basin in the aksu river basin the annual abstraction data was estimated by the water amount in the main cannels from 1984 to 2005 wang 2006 the long term mean annual abstraction data 1971 2003 for the hotan river basin was taken from huang and shen 2010 and the annual abstraction data from 1982 to 1999 for the yarkand river basin was obtained from xinjiang tarim river basin management bureau the monthly abstraction data which was used to calculate the shares of monthly water demand and the cie were available only for 1998 for the aksu wang 2006 for 2000 2003 for the yarkand and for 2002 for the hotan and were extrapolated for other years as it is shown above the data availability in our study area is inconsistent in time there were only a few overlaps in periods between the availability of the observed discharge data and water abstraction data so we had only short periods to calibrate and validate the hydrological models see section 4 1 the data problems will be discussed in more detail in section 5 3 6 climate scenarios there were four climate projections of regional climate models rcms available for this study they are three cclm cosmo climate local model rockel et al 2008 projections for rcps representative concentration pathways 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 driven by the gcm general circulation model mpi esm lr and one a1b scenario generated by the rcm remo jacob 2001 driven by the gcm echam5 mannig et al 2013 the spatial resolution of the cclm and remo outputs are 0 44 and 0 11 respectively the set of rcm projections was extended by including 24 gcm projections cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 miroc esm miroc esm chem and mri cgcm3 representing 3 rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 this ensemble enabled us to analyze uncertainties related to climate models the spatial resolution of the gcm outputs are between 1 12 and 3 75 the historical simulations of all climate models cover a period from 1960 1961 to 2000 and the climate projections start from 2001 2006 and end in 2099 the gcm rcm outputs were downscaled upscaled to a resolution of 0 5 and bias corrected to the watch and aphrodite data for the period 1960 2000 using the quantile mapping method gudmundsson et al 2012 in addition we use a trend adaptation approach to preserve the trend similar to hempel et al 2013 the reference period is 1971 2000 and three scenario periods were selected for the near 2011 2040 medium 2041 2070 and far 2071 2099 future appendix b shows the list of projections and their climate change signals in each scenario period 3 7 agricultural scenarios in 1998 when the government improvement plan gxuar and mwrc 2002 was proposed the water resource conditions in this year were considered as an important reference as a result more management data was available for this year especially for the aksu basin in addition liu et al 2010 suggested to consider the agricultural area in 1998 as an objective for the future control of cropland therefore we developed a reference scenario based on agricultural and management data in 1998 and the water flows simulated using this scenario were considered as corresponding to the governmental objective based on this reference scenario a number of combinations of agricultural scenarios were developed see table 2 in this study we used the irrigation instructions for the awati county to estimate the irrigation demands for the whole study area for the following reasons first the irrigation instructions were only available for the counties in the aksu basin wang 2006 in this study and the irrigation quota and schedule are similar across counties in aksu second the awati county is the closest county to the hotan and yarkand river basins this allows to assume that the differences among them are not significant there are five major scenario conditions related to agriculture area crop distribution cie drip irrigation ratio and river transmission losses and each of them has 2 3 options or sub scenarios as in table 2 the latter four scenario conditions are related to water saving measures the first major scenario condition is related to agricultural area and the sub scenario a0 means no changes in agricultural area referring to the agricultural area as in 1998 reference sub scenario a1 assumes a significant increase in cropland by 100 in the aksu and yarkand and 40 in the hotan corresponding to the actual changes between 1998 and 2010 fig 2 i e to arable land area in 2010 since the irrigated area has been still growing after 2010 the third sub scenario a2 considers a further increase by 150 in the yarkand and 60 in the hotan no further changes were considered in the aksu because the headwater discharge tends to decrease in the far future under climate scenarios duethmann et al 2016 the second scenario condition is related to crop distribution and includes two sub scenarios c0 assumes no changes in crop distribution as in 1998 reference and c1 corresponding to crop distribution as in 2010 no additional sub scenarios were included as the influence of crop distribution is not significant as was shown in our previous study huang et al 2015 the third scenario condition considers an improvement of leakage proofing of canals between river and fields the current cie is between 0 37 and 0 49 in the three basins meaning that only 37 49 percent of extracted water reaches the root zones according to the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china the aim is to increase the cie in xinjiang province to 0 53 by the end of 2015 and to 0 57 in 2020 hence the sub scenarios include e0 with cie as in 1998 reference e1 with cie equal to 0 53 and e2 with cie equal to 0 57 the fourth scenario condition accounts for the ratio of the drip irrigation area to the whole irrigation area as the surface irrigation was prevailing in 1998 and previous decades we designed three sub scenarios d0 with no drip irrigation as in 1998 reference d1 assuming the drip irrigated area of 25 of total and d2 of 50 of total the last scenario condition considers the potential reduction of river transmission losses in the hotan and yarkand rivers by restoration of the riverbeds the reference sub scenario r0 assumes that there are no changes in the transmission loss coefficient according to liu et al 2010 the restoration of the middle tarim riverbed saved about 30 of water amount from alar so we assumed the potential reduction of river transmission losses by 15 and 30 for the hotan and yarkand rivers in scenarios r1 and r2 respectively for the aksu river no reduction of river transmission losses is considered as the river is short and well regulated in total there are a maximum of 162 combinations of the agricultural and water management scenarios the combination of all first sub scenarios named as a0c0e0d0r0 denotes the reference scenario in addition we selected 30 combinations to study the impacts of individual and combined measures appendix c for example scenario a1c1e2d2r2 means an increase in irrigated area by 100 in the aksu and yarkand basins and 40 in the hotan basin crop distribution as in 2010 cie of 0 57 application of the drip irrigation method at about 50 of area and reduction in river transmission losses of about 30 in the hotan and yarkand rivers 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation due to the different temporal availability of climate discharge and water abstraction data table 1 the swim oasis model was calibrated only for the period from 1984 to 1988 using the observed headwater discharges and abstraction information as input the reason for using the observed headwater discharge is to avoid errors from the simulated headwater discharge and calibrate the river transmission losses correctly however due to a lack of observed discharge data after 1989 swim oasis could only be validated for the period 1989 2000 at the alar station using the simulated headwater discharge by the swim g or wasa models as input fig 4 shows the observed and simulated monthly discharges at the gauges xiaota hotan xidaqiao aksu heiniyazi yarkand and alar tarim during the calibration period in general the simulation results for the hotan river are in good agreement with the observed discharge nse is 0 96 the seasonal dynamics of the aksu river discharge is also well simulated with nse of 0 92 but the total amount is slightly underestimated the discharge of the yarkand river is overestimated for the year 1988 for this river with very low mean observed discharge of 1 33 m3 s discharge is very sensitive to any human interferences a slight underestimation of the abstraction can increase discharge at the river outlet significantly overall the simulated discharge at alar is acceptable with nse of 0 77 and an underestimation of about 15 which is mainly due to the underestimation of the aksu river discharge fig 5 shows the validation results of the monthly discharge at alar for the period 1989 2000 using the simulated headwater discharges from wasa and swim g models separately since the abstraction data and the swim oasis model are the same the differences between the validation runs are associated with the simulated headwater discharges by the two models in general both combinations of the hydrological models could generate average monthly discharge at alar satisfactory see graphs on the right with nse larger than 0 8 and bias within the range of 10 however both combinations of models slightly underestimate discharge in june and july probably due to the share of monthly water demand which was derived from the data from some certain years see section 3 5 a reasonable simulation of average monthly discharge is important for this study as the mean annual and monthly discharges over the reference and scenario periods were used for climate impact analysis 4 2 potential change in river discharges under climate change to assess the impacts of pure climate change the swim oasis model was run with the simulated headwater discharges from the swim g and wasa models under the same climate projections and the agricultural reference scenario a0c0e0d0r0 the simulated results for the reference period were considered as the reference discharge or the government objective changes are calculated between this reference discharge and the simulated discharge in the future the upper three graphs in fig 6 show the relative changes in annual mean discharge at alar for the three scenario periods under the a1b scenario from remo and three rcp scenarios from cclm all results show that there would be an increase in discharge at alar throughout the century except for the wasa swim oasis results under the a1b scenario in the far future period 2071 2099 the increase in discharge is mainly due to increase in melting water under a warmer climate and increase in precipitation especially in the hotan and yarkand headwaters see appendix b however the increase in the far future is less prominent than in the near and medium future probably due to glaciers shrinkage in the headwater basins in general the combination of wasa and swim oasis generates greater increase than the swim g and swim oasis models in the near future but lower increase or a decrease in the far future it shows that the differences between the two glaciohydrological models lead to discrepancies in the projection of water resources for this semi arid region especially in the far future in addition to the total annual relative changes we also compared the seasonal distribution of the total annual changes fig 7 simulated by two combinations of hydrological models under two scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the increase in discharge is dominant in four months from june to september there is hardly any increase in march april and november the projected increase in discharge during summer the high flow period would be especially beneficial for the main tarim river because the river water can only reach the downstream tarim when the discharge at alar exceeds 400 m3 s for more than 20 days chen et al 2009 4 3 potential changes in river discharges under both agricultural and climate scenarios the results in section 4 2 show that the objectives of the governmental plan could be achieved under the warming climate if the agricultural area would return to the extent of 1998 even without any water saving measures however the historical trend of the agricultural area in this region shows that it is almost impossible or very difficult to reduce the agricultural area to the level as in 1998 fig 2 the local people extended agricultural area whenever they had more water available in the rivers hence it is interesting to know what happens if the agricultural area would stay at the level of 2010 scenario a1c0e0d0r0 the lower three graphs in fig 6 show the relative changes in the annual mean discharge at alar under four rcm climate projections and the agricultural scenario a1c0e0d0r0 the agricultural area as in 2010 leads to a significant reduction of discharge up to 50 under all climate scenarios except the remo a1b scenario in the medium future and the cclm rcp8 5 scenario in the far future this indicates that the increase in the headwater discharges cannot compensate the increase in the irrigation water demand caused by an extended cropland and the objective of the governmental plan can be hardly achieved if the agricultural area remains as in 2010 without any saving water measures fig 8 shows a comparison of the effects of different combinations of agricultural scenarios under all four rcm projections shown as vertical bars comparing the single moderate water saving measures we can see that change in crop distribution scenario a1c1e0d0r0 leads to minor changes of only 2 5 in river discharge compared to scenario a1c0e0d0r0 improvement of the cie scenario a1c0e1d0r0 substantially reduces the irrigation water demand and leads to a positive change saving about 15 50 water in the near future and 6 30 water in the far future the effect of this measure is less significant in the last period probably due to lower water availability in rivers in this period see fig 6 the other two moderate measures an increase of drip irrigation area scenario a1c0e0d1r0 and a reduction of river transmission losses scenario a1c0e0d0r1 lead to savings of about 2 15 and 4 5 of water in the near future and 2 3 and 4 7 of water in the far future correspondingly when all moderate measures scenario a1c1e1d1r1 are combined the effect is strong and mostly positive changes in river discharge are projected if all strong measures e g scenario a1c1e2d2r2 were applied in combination the governmental objective would always be achieved no matter which rcm climate scenario would be realized however if the agricultural area increases further scenarios a2c1e1d1r1 and a2c1e2d2r2 there is still a risk of water reduction in the tarim in the far future especially if the moderate measures are applied finally we compared the results driven by three cclm projections with the ones driven by 24 projections from gcms for the three rcps fig 9 shows selected results for four agricultural scenarios reference scenario a0c0e0d0r0 scenario a1c0e0d0r0 scenario a1c1e1d1r2 and scenario a2c1e2d2r2 in general the results driven by the cclm projections are always within 25 to 75 percentiles of the projections driven by the gcms the results from the combination of wasa and swim oasis models usually have larger ranges i e higher uncertainty than the ones from the swim g swim oasis models and they often project more negative changes in river discharge in the medium and far future there is also larger uncertainty in the projections under the higher rcp scenarios compared to the results driven by the cclm outputs the ensemble results under all 24 gcm projections show a high risk of decreases in river discharge for example positive changes were projected under the cclm rcp8 5 scenario and the agricultural scenarios a1c1e1d1r1 and a2c1e2d2r2 but about half of the ensemble results driven by the gcm rcp8 5 scenarios show negative changes simulated by the wasa and swim oasis models this is likely due to the lower temperature increase projected by cclm as compared to the mean of the selected gcms in addition it indicates that even the strong water saving measures suggested in this study cannot ensure water resources availability in the tarim river at the end of this century due to uncertainty in future climate it should also be noticed that the uncertainty of projections under the high rcp scenarios is much larger than that under the lower ones hence it would be more difficult to make management decisions based on such large uncertainties from the high rcp scenarios 4 4 quantifying different sources contributing to projection uncertainty as shown in section 4 3 the uncertainty in projected results caused by climate models including both rcm and gcms hydrological models and agricultural scenarios is substantial fig 10 illustrates the contribution of different sources to the overall uncertainty of the projected changes in three scenario periods for each rcp scenario in general the relative uncertainty caused by climate models increases with rcp forcing in the near future the agricultural scenarios explain more than 40 of the total uncertainty and the climate models contribute to about 30 the hydrological models contribute only about 10 indicating that the hydrological simulations for the headwaters are relatively robust in the medium future the uncertainty caused by the agricultural scenarios is reduced by 15 20 while the uncertainties caused by the climate and hydrological models increase by about 7 10 in the far future the agricultural scenarios become even less important and the climate and hydrological models play major roles in the uncertainty of the projections note that the absolute uncertainty caused by the agricultural scenarios remains the same in all three periods and rcp scenarios and the total absolute uncertainty increases in the medium and far future and in higher rcps due to the increasing uncertainty related to the climate models and hydrological models 5 discussion a novelty of this study is the application of multiple climate projections and agricultural scenarios and two combinations of hydrological models in the climate adaptation assessment the agricultural scenarios include not only changes in agricultural areas but also the water saving measures proposed by the government plan and previous studies these scenarios are based on the current trends and assumptions but they can be modified under the rapid economic and technological developments of the region however we should notice that this study only assessed the impacts on river discharge and further efforts are required to assess the influence on the oasis environment and social economic development for example a reduction of agricultural area to the level of 1998 is the most effective measure to ensure the discharge quota at alar but it may harm the local farmers interests this is also related to the change of crop distributions as both crop water demand and the economic interests should be considered the improvement of cie use of drip irrigation and restoration of river bed could reduce agricultural water use and river transmission losses but they could also reduce groundwater recharge and the ecological water use in the oases areas and riparian zones zhong et al 2009 as a result the whole oasis ecosystem could be negatively affected in addition drip irrigation as well as other deficit irrigation methods using the highly mineralized river water could lead to degradation of soil quality such water saving technologies must be combined with flood irrigation after the growing season to reduce salt accumulation in the soil profile chen et al 2010 at present the aksu river is the most important water source for the tarim river but its discharge is likely to decrease under a warming climate mainly due to the retreat of glaciers duethmann et al 2016 an interesting finding of this study is that the increase in discharge at alar is mainly due to the increase in the headwater discharges of the hotan and yarkand rivers in the future described in section 3 1 and wortmann 2017 despite the rapid glacier and snow melting under higher temperatures the increase in precipitation in the mountainous regions is prominent under higher rcp scenarios see appendix b if the water demand can be controlled properly and the river transmission losses are reduced the hotan and yarkand rivers can become more important water sources to the tarim river in the future another important finding of this study is that there is no high risk to have less annual water in the tarim river under high rcp scenarios these results are consistent with the pure climate impact study by liu et al 2013 under the a1b a2 and b1 scenarios especially at the end of this century however the stakeholders should not be too optimistic as the low rcp scenarios may be more likely to realize after the climate change conference in paris under the rcp2 6 scenario the discharge at alar is likely to decrease at the end of this century under more than half of the projections by both combinations of hydrological models the rcm scenarios are usually considered to be more precise and reliable than the gcm scenarios for the regional climate impact studies elguindi et al 2011 however the high resolution rcm scenarios remo in this study could not provide much better spatial information than the gcm scenarios because they were upscaled and bias corrected using the reanalysis data 0 5 in order to make use of the rcm scenarios in the future reliable observed climate data would be helpful to correct the rcm data at a finer resolution moreover the resolution of the applied rcms is still very coarse for such a complex high mountain region and even finer resolution of the rcm projects are preferred in the future due to lack of the observed climate data in our study the simulation of water generation is afflicted with high uncertainties the large differences in the projections between the two glaciohydrological models are attributed not only to their different methods of calculating snow and glacier processes but also to the equifinality problem caused by the uncertainty of precipitation data glacier mass balance data and calibration parameters in general the wasa model simulates stronger snow and glacier melt in the near future than the swim g model and it leads to a faster glacier retreat as a result there is less glacier storage available and less glacier melt occurs in the wasa simulations for the medium and far future more detailed discussion on these two models is available in wortmann 2017 the lack of sufficient observed discharge data spatially and in time makes the calibration and validation procedure for the lowland area complicated as well the models for all headwaters could be calibrated and validated only for periods before 1987 1988 but the swim oasis model had to be validated in 1990s when the better quality water abstraction data was available the simulation error at alar is caused by headwater and the oasis model as well as abstraction data however it is impossible to attribute these errors without better information on observed discharge and abstraction amount there was also lack of irrigation data for such a large scale study we had only the irrigation instructions for the aksu basin and assumed that the irrigation quota and schedule for the awati county could be also applied for the hotan and yarkand basins this assumption is questionable because these three basins have different geographic and climatic conditions we compared the estimated water demand and the actual water withdrawal from 1989 to 2002 for the hotan and yarkand basins using available data the biases were 8 and 13 respectively which is still acceptable however the availability of local irrigation information would increase the robustness of the climate and agricultural impact study in these two basins in addition we should notice that in reality the irrigation quota from the instructions may not match the crop water demand in this study we did not aim to evaluate the simulated water demand at a daily time step as well as annual crop yields in order to better simulate the daily water demand and crop yields the calculation of irrigation demands using standard approaches would be more appropriate than the method based on irrigation instructions however in such a case the effects of flooding irrigations especially for soil leaching before sawing and moisture maintenance would be poorly represented and the simulated discharge could not be directly compared to the government quota 6 conclusions this study presents a first comprehensive analysis of climate and adaptation measures impacts on water resources at alar the last gauge of the upper tarim river using headwater discharge of two combinations of hydrological models 28 climate projections and 30 agricultural scenarios the results provide not only a basis for creating optimal plans of sustainable development for the upper tarim river but also valuable information on water availability to the downstream water users in addition the study shows that simulation models can serve as tools to provide comprehensive information for local climate adaptation policy making the projected results show that the river discharge at alar is likely to increase in a warmer climate if the agricultural area is reduced to the level as in 1998 without water saving measures there would be more water under higher rcp forcing scenarios than under the lower ones due to increased glacier melting and increased precipitation the agricultural area as in 2010 would directly lead to greater demands of irrigation water and would reduce water availability in the main tarim river if the agricultural area as in 2010 is kept in the future strong water saving measures must be applied to ensure continued water inflow to the tarim under all climate scenarios however if the area continues to expand a decrease in river discharge in the upper tarim at the end of this century under the rcp2 6 scenario can be expected hence the expansion of agricultural area should be strictly controlled or combined with water saving measures that are even stronger than the ones considered in this study the uncertainty of the projection results is much larger in the far than in the near future which is mainly caused by the climate and headwater models in high rcp forcing scenarios the significant differences in the projections between the two headwater models confirm that the uncertainty from hydrological models should not be ignored in climate impact studies for this region more and better observation data is required to improve the model parameterization to reduce the overall uncertainty of the model chain in the lowland area additional information on discharge and irrigation practices would be helpful to improve the model reliability for simulations in arid regions future studies should also consider other potential impacts on the oasis environment and socio economic issues acknowledgements this work is supported

11482,multifunctional ecosystem of narrow grasslands located between croplands and streams slowly disappears from the agricultural landscape in poland despite its importance to reduce the impact of land based nutrients on freshwater ecosystems we studied the effects of five extensive grasslands on nitrate and phosphate reduction in the catchment scale during our 4 year monitoring we did not observe the saturation effect in case of the two buffer zones that were receiving high nitrate load via subsurface flow highest nitrate concentration exceeded twice the level of 50 mg no3 l which is considered a threshold level of water pollution status by the eu nitrates directive concentrations above 100 mg no3 l were reduced by 68 and 99 passing through the 25 m and 45 m of grassland respectively the efficiency of buffer zone to mitigate phosphate losses varied depending on the input load the results obtained for high concentrations above 1 5 mg po4 l showed 81 and 76 effectiveness of 45 m and 47 m grassland respectively however the release of phosphates was reported as well and occurred at the buffer zones characterized by low inflow p concentrations when assimilation decomposition processes dominated ecotone p dynamics the analysis of nutrient retention in vegetation showed that harvesting of grassland removed 131 kg n ha yr and 19 4 kg p ha yr furthermore the amount of nitrate and phosphate removed by buffer zones were statistically and positively correlated r 0 62 p 0 05 and r 0 52 p 0 05 for no3 and po4 respectively with the biodiversity expressed as shannon index which underlines the importance of marginal parts of buffer zones keywords riparian buffer zone nitrogen phosphorus vegetation shallow groundwater diffuse pollution 1 introduction riparian buffer zones ecotones and vegetative filter strips are situated on the main pathways of nutrient cycle between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems their buffering capacity and ability to control pollution exchange between ecosystems are particularly important when considering the reduction on non point agricultural source of pollution which is well recognized as a direct reason for the degradation of water bodies and coastal zones lowrance et al 1984 mander et al 2005 doskkey et al 2010 stutter et al 2012 furthermore the buffer zones play a crucial role in the ecosystems providing unique habitats for a variety of organisms thus securing the biodiversity and maintaining the energy flow between the ecosystems naiman et al 1989 mccracken et al 2012 understanding the cause and effect relationships that regulate the functioning of riparian buffer zone is needed for the optimal formation and management of riparian buffer zones this knowledge may be used in the regulation of the processes of ecosystems which according to the theory of ecohydrology zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2014 allows us to increase the capacity resilience and ability of flexible reaction of ecosystems on progressive human antropopression and climate change the water flux which drives the exchange of nutrients reaches the ecotones via surface runoff and subsurface flow parn et al 2012 soluble phosphates and nitrates as a mobile fraction of subsurface flow create an important contribution to the surface water degradation process holman et al 2008 mittelstet et al 2011 robinson 2015 subsurface flow efficiency of riparian buffer zones in the reduction of nitrogen is well described in the literature e g doskkey et al 2010 young and briggs 2005 mayer et al 2007 reported mean nitrogen removal effectiveness reaching 76 6 in the meta analysis performed for 65 individual riparian buffers with different vegetation however there is limited data on the efficiency of ecotones for groundwater coming from heavily fertilized cropland hefting et al 2006 yamada et al 2007 balestrini et al 2011 most of the research concerning efficiency of buffer zones in phosphorus reduction is primarily focused on the analysis of the role of buffer zone for inhibiting transport of phosphorus compounds from the surface runoff and recognizing sedimentation process uusi kamppa 2005 syversen 2005 hoffmann et al 2009 dunn et al 2011 meanwhile the effectiveness of buffer zone to reduce phosphate in shallow groundwater is not well documented schilling and jacobson 2014 aguiar et al 2015 some researchers have suggested that riparian zones are ineffective in removing dissolved phosphorus or even they may release retained phosphorus into water carlyle and hill 2001 hoffmann et al 2006 based on the optimistic results of various studies there are an increasing number of guidelines and also legal regulations toward implementation of buffer zones as an effective and best management practice to buffer aquatic ecosystems against nutrient losses from agricultural landscape e g fsa 2010 holsten et al 2012 nevertheless the widespread use of these buffer zones is still challenged by socio economic factors buckley et al 2012 mainly because of the agricultural land needed to be transformed back to its natural state this conflict of interest is well visible in poland where the transformation of extensive to intensive agriculture is shaping a new type of agricultural landscape in the times of extensive faming narrow grasslands located between croplands and streams used to be an important part of agricultural landscape providing areas for pastures fodder e g hay or simply being a communication network yet the currently growing industrialization and intensification of agriculture is putting a great pressure on the remaining ecotones firstly more and more grassland are being transformed and incorporated into the neighboring croplands secondly the intensive animal husbandry is no longer supplied by organic fodder collected from grassy areas of ecotones therefore there is little interest in preserving ecological structure of those natural buffer zones however considering the ecological importance of ecotones their removal from agricultural landscape deprives local water bodies from the important antipollution barriers the aim of the research was to prove the utility of extensive grasslands as an effective barrier to intercept the lost agricultural nutrients transported through the shallow groundwater streams into water bodies we monitored five buffer zones that consist of a grassland strip with tall herb fringe or swamp non forest communities directly adjacent to streams at the temperate lowland pilica river catchment in central poland the effectiveness in nitrate and phosphorus reduction from shallow subsurface flow were analyzed based on 4 years monitoring results the analysis of species composition was included in the study to determine whether biodiversity of ecotones affects their effectiveness in reducing pollution the primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the usage of buffer zones as an effective tool to reduce the transfer of non point pollution and to place it in the catalog of actions aimed at improving water quality in the pilica river catchment and preventing further eutrophication of sulejÃ³w reservoir frÄtczak and izydorczyk 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the following five case studies located within the pilica river catchment in central poland were chosen to best represent the biological and geological characteristic of the region fig 1 radonia two sites r and d kÅudzice l tresta t and kaÅek k the width of buffer zones varied from 8 m to 77 m depending on the location table 1 the sampling sites covered the buffer zone between the cropland and first order streams or small drainage ditch l site the chosen grasslands were established more than 15 years ago previously they were regularly fertilized and mowed or grazed before establishing the sampling sites local surveys and observation were carried out to obtain the information about the past and present use of the ecotones currently only the biomass was regularly removed from grasslands 2 3 times a year no additional agricultural activities were reported to take place on the monitoring sites additionally all buffer zones included a narrow marginal part located in the immediate vicinity of the watercourse excluded from the agricultural management and composed of tall forbs or swamp non forest communities neighboring croplands were used in the cultivation of plants barley rye oat corn or triticale according to the farmers declarations the croplands were mostly fertilized with mineral fertilizers mainly nitrogen fertilizers 150 kg ha and occasionally with cattle manure 40 tons ha nevertheless over our 4 year research duration the discharge of poultry litter slurry and domestic sewage was also noted the hydrogeological and morphological characteristic was presented in table 1 geological cross sections of four out of five research sites showed little variation typically at the crop field borders the first layer with a thickness of 0 3 0 5 m is made of soil which can be found above a uniform layer of permeable tracks fine sands grits and coarse sand additionally peat layers have been found close to the streams at k and t sites only d site is characterized by the presence of clay and silt lenses occurring between layer of soil and permeable tracks fine sands the groundwater level in inlet sections fluctuated between 0 25 m and 1 97 m below ground level bgl while in outlet sections 0 15 1 73 m bgl the region receives an average annual rainfall of about 600 mm szczeÅniak and piniewski 2015 in 2011 2014 the values of total annual rain or snow precipitation reached 563 mm 480 mm 592 mm and 818 mm respectively the mean annual temperature reaches 8 6 c typically the snow cover would last for 2 months 50 days on an average 2 2 groundwater monitoring the piezometers paired cropland buffer for groundwater monitoring were installed in january 2011 by professional company specialized in hydrogeological research at first the topographic analysis and geological boreholes were done for preliminary assessment of groundwater flow patterns the piezometers were made of high density polyethylene pipes Ã¸50 mm eijkelkamp and installed in holes drilled using a machine auger fixed on a lightweight trolley the piezometers length ranged from 2 1 to 3 0 m and they were perforated throughout 1 m from the bottom finally piezometers were leveled additionally lithology granulometric estimation and thickness was determined by visual inspection of soil material collected by auger during installation based on this geological cross sections were done groundwater samples were collected monthly from february 2011 until september 2014 within 44 months during each sampling at first the water level was manually measured using electric contact meter kll mini seba hydrometrie next 3 well volumes were pumped out with the electric groundwater pump gigant whale 12 vdc to removed standing water prior to collection of the water samples immediately after piezometers had fully recharged the water samples were taken and temperature conductivity and ph were measured in situ ysi professional plus model 10e1744 and model pro10102030 water samples were transported to the laboratory in 250 ml bottles in ice boxes and were filtered immediately after arrival through whatman gf c filters analysis of dissolved forms of nitrogen and phosphorus was performed with use of ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 which enable the quality and quantity analysis of cations with ion pac cs15 column nh4 and anions with the ion pac as14a column no2 no3 2 po4 3 the method detection limit was 1 Î¼g l and the limit of quantification was 10 Î¼g l we analyzed the efficiency of the riparian buffer zone located in the stream valley by assessing the reduction level of inflow concentration of phosphate and nitrate nitrate phosphate removal nr pr were calculated as difference between their concentrations at the entry point cin wells installed on cropland border din lin rin tin and kin and at the exit point cout wells installed near streams bank dout lout rout tout and kout nitrate phosphate removal effectiveness nre pre were calculated from the formula nre pre 1 cout cin 100 multi annual monitoring was carried out considering the groundwater division into a good 50 mg no3 l and 1 mg po4 l and bad status 50 mg no3 l and 1 mg po4 l the thresholds were set according to polish water legislation dz u 2008 nr 143 poz 896 regulation of the minister of environment of 23 july 2008 on the criteria and method of evaluation of groundwater condition additional surface water samples were collected from the adjacent streams our study showed no statistically significant p 0 05 correlation between the concentration of studied nutrients in groundwater outflow from buffer zones and stream water thus we assumed that the obtained removal efficiency is not significantly disturbed by the external impact of stream water 2 3 species composition of vegetation to determine the species composition of vegetation series of phytosociological relevÃ©s were obtained using the braun blanquet method by applying a cover abundance scale barkman et al 1964 where each scale degree correspond to the range of cover as following 5 75 100 4 50 75 3 25 50 2 5 25 1 5 numerous individuals and 5 few individuals the relevÃ©s were located near the piezometers in the middle of each vegetation patches that included in the ecotone in the buffer zone characterized by a width of 45 m relevÃ©s were taken in the grassland and in swamp non forest communities or tall herb fringe directly adjacent to the watercourse whereas in the narrow ecotones relevÃ©s were taken in the community reaching the watercourse the area of relevÃ©s in all cases was 25 m2 total number of 35 relevÃ©s where taken for calculation for further calculations of the biodiversity data from the l site were not used as the grassland was mown twice just before performing the study data on vegetation were collected each time in consecutive years of research quantitative data derived from relevÃ©s were used in calculations and the degrees of cover were converted into average percentage cover according to the following rule 5 87 5 4 62 5 3 37 5 2 17 5 1 5 0 5 van der maarel 1979 based on the calculated abundance we assessed the sum of average percentage of coverage of highly effective species in nutrient trapping attributed to phragmites australis phalaris arundinacea and urtica dioica izydorczyk et al 2015 and biodiversity of patches using shannon index odum 1982 according to the following formula h Ïpi ln pi where pi the ratio of abundance of the i th species to the sum of abundance of the remaining species in the community abundance of species was attributed to their average coverage percentage 2 4 biomass productivity and n and p uptake in the vegetation measurements of aboveground biomass of the vegetation and concentration of the nutrients in plant tissues were performed to analyze the nutrient uptake by plants accumulation of nutrients was calculated as the multiplication of biomass and the concentration of nutrients found in plant tissues recalculated per ha sampling campaign was conducted over four consecutive years from 2011 to 2014 plant material was harvested at three periods at the turn of may and june end of july and again at the turn of september and october samples were obtained from the plots of 0 44 m2 each time the samples were collected from new and undisturbed areas of the plots the collected biomass was transported in drafty linen bags in the laboratory samples were first dried at room temperature prior to portioning into smaller pieces later small pieces were dried in the oven at a temperature of 70 c for 48 h and then at a temperature of 105 c for one more hour finally the biomass was weighted in case of the samples collected from mown grasslands the annual amount of biomass was calculated as the sum of spring and autumn samples weights dried material was homogenized by fractionation and was used for further nutrient analysis total nitrogen n content was measured following the kjeldhal method using skalar device total phosphorus p content was determined by flow colorimetry skalar device however the samples were mineralized prior to analysis 2 5 statistical analysis to determine the difference in nitrate and phosphate concentrations between cropland and buffer zone input and output statistical comparisons using a two sample t test with a significance level of p 0 05 were performed to detect the possible relationships between the analyzed variables pearson correlation was used with a significance level of p 0 05 all statistical analysis were performed using statistica version 9 3 results 3 1 nitrate concentration studied buffer zones were charged with different nitrate inflow concentrations the lowest value was reported at the entrance to the widest buffer zone at the k site where the multi year average was found to be 4 1 mg no3 l good water status in terms of nitrates 50 mg no3 l was observed also for the 45 m zone at the t site tin multi year average 11 5 mg no3 l and for the narrowest buffer zone at the d site din multi year average 39 6 mg no3 l in case of the r site nitrate levels at the entrance indicated strong water pollution with an average value of 105 2 no3 l whereas the maximum measured value was 242 9 no3 l yet the highest values were reported at l site which was characterized with very high concentrations lin multi year average 136 8 mg no3 l maximum value 283 7 mg no3 l fig 2 a the observed temporal variability indicated correspondence between the occurrence of extreme inflow nitrate values and agricultural activity according to our results the maximum values were observed after spring or autumn fertilization during tillage period in three cases nitrate outflow concentrations measured on the waterfront edges of the ecotones showed very low values averaging 0 34 0 35 and 0 62 mg no3 l for kout tout and rout piezometers respectively fig 2a at the d site the outflow nitrate concentrations reached up to 59 5 mg no3 l yet with a still relatively low average value of 14 3 mg no3 l meanwhile the samples taken from the lout piezometer were characterized with an average value of 46 6 no3 l reaching occasionally even 213 45 mg no3 l 3 2 nitrate removal efficiency to analyze the efficiency of nutrient removal we used student s t test and compared the statistical significance between the inflow and outflow concentrations in the buffer zones according to our results during the 4 year period of the study a statistically significant difference was observed in case of concentration of nitrates in all analyzed piezometers paired table 2 the multi year average nitrate removal effectiveness nre of individual buffer zones ranged from 61 to 99 fig 2b the narrowest area 7 7 m d site with an inflow concentration of 40 mg no3 l was characterized by the nre at 61 the effectiveness of a three times wider buffer zone at the l site was at a similar level of 68 however the most important issue was the average amount of nitrate removed nr which reached 90 2 mg no3 l the highest nre 99 was observed in the 45 m r site moreover in r site the highest nr also was found 104 6 mg no3 l in case of this buffer zone it is important to note the stability of obtained results the buffer zone at the t site has a similar width as the r site however an important difference between them is the range of nutrient inflow concentration in case of tin this concentration is 10 fold lower than that reported for rin the buffer zone t with nr of 11 16 mg no3 l showed nre at the level of 91 the widest buffer zone k site showed the reduction of nitrates at level of 73 nre and 3 77 mg no3 l nr low nr was a result of low inflow concentrations reaching the zone 4 11 mg no3 l nevertheless during the monitoring period the captured inflow peak concentrations of 48 6 mg no3 l and 25 0 mg no3 l were found to be still reduced by 100 and 97 respectively indicating the capability of the site to reduce also elevated no3 loads 3 3 phosphate concentration in case of phosphate concentrations in water reaching the buffer zones division based on water quality thresholds can be made as well good water quality is classified to contain less than 1 mg po4 l while all the water exceeding this limit is considered to be polluted good water quality in terms of phosphates was found in three buffer zones multi year average inflow concentration accounted for 0 46 mg po4 l 0 59 po4 l 0 66 mg po4 l at lin din and kin respectively fig 3 a the poor bad status was reported at two buffer zones through 2 69 mg po4 l rin and up to the highest average concentration of 3 89 mg po4 l in tin piezometer analysis of the phosphate concentrations after passing the buffer zones has shown that in all transects multi year average levels were below the concentration of 1 mg po4 l fig 3a the highest average values were demonstrated on tout and accounted for 0 76 mg po4 l 3 4 efficiency of phosphates removal studied buffer zones were characterized by high efficiency in reducing phosphate pollution in case of high inflow concentrations fig 3b the highest phosphate removal effectiveness pre was calculated for the r site the concentration reduction by 81 corresponded to the removal of 2 37 mg po4 l the highest phosphate removal rp was observed at the t site concentration was decreased by 3 12 mg po4 l which accounted for 76 of inflow concentration in case of the buffer zones where inflow concentrations were low d l and k sites outflow phosphate concentrations were also found at a low level fig 3a moreover periodic release of phosphates from the buffer zones was recorded as well the highest release 142 was observed at l site what corresponds with 0 10 mg po4 l of multiyear average pr the buffer zone at k site with pr 0 05 mgpo4 l showed the pre averaging 49 whereas at d site pre reached the similar level 43 but the ecotone maintained positive pr of 0 05 mgpo4 l nevertheless the use of student s t test to test the level of significance of inflow and outflow concentrations in l and k sites showed no statistically significant difference table 2 3 5 factor influence on nutrient efficiency variations in efficiency did not follow a seasonal pattern at any of the buffer zones with exemption of the l site the lack of seasonal changes was confirmed by lack of significant correlation between temperature and nr nre pr and pre in case of the l site the temporal changes were the result of groundwater level fluctuations which was due to the drainage ditch management we found positive correlation between water level and nr nre 0 67 and 0 62 p 0 05 respectively and negative with pre 0 38 p 0 05 decrease in the groundwater level of more than 140 cm reduced nre to 50 correlation analysis showed also significant relationship between efficiency and groundwater level for the d site 0 39 and 0 38 p 0 05 for nr and pre respectively for all sites considered together the efficiency was positively related to nutrients inputs fig 4 table 3 but at the site scale the correlation analysis showed different relationship in the nitrate case we found strong correlation between nitrate inflow concentration and nr for all wider sites r t and k sites and nre for three sites d t and k sites more consistent results were observed between pre and influent concentration where all sites represent significant relationships pr was unrelated to inflow concentrations only in d site 3 6 aboveground biomass and n and p uptake among grasslands the highest productivity was reported in the widest buffer zone at the k site where the multi year average value of biomass was 1018 g m2 lower values were reported in samples collected from the grasslands at the l t and r site and accounted for 803 g m2 591 g m2 and 445 g m2 respectively in the community of common reed at the k site we found an average biomass of 951 g m2 in swamp non forest communities of reed canary grass with nettle at the d site average biomass was 775 g m2 whereas at the r site it was 645 g m2 in case of poorly developed tall herb fringe zone at the t site the average biomass was 354 g m2 biomass of the aboveground parts of plants collected from grasslands tall herb fringe communities and swamp non forest communities showed large variability not only between the zones but primarily within the zone itself in each year table 4 the growing season in 2014 was characterized by very favorable hydro meteorological conditions for plant growth with the highest biomass values reported considering the n and p uptake calculated as a product of biomass and percentage content of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant tissues during the vegetative period the highest multi year average values for grasslands reported at the k site reached the level of 202 kg n ha and 33 6 kg p ha table 4 approximately 139 kg n ha and 26 7 kg p ha were reported in samples collected at the t site whereas for samples collected from grasslands at the l and r sites it was 135 kg n ha 101 kg n ha 21 0 kg p ha and 13 1 kg p ha respectively common reed community at the k site was characterized by the highest average values of accumulated nitrogen 135 kg n ha and phosphorus 18 2 kg p ha slightly lower values were observed in samples collected from swamp non forest communities of reed canary grass in which the average values ranged from 115 kg n ha and 14 8 kg p ha for r site to 133 kg n ha and 18 5 kg p ha for d site in nitrophilic community at the buffer zone at the t site the following values were reported 88 kg n ha and 10 6 kg p ha nitrogen and phosphorus uptake was related to the biomass production pearson correlation coefficient 0 89 and 0 81 respectively n 30 p 0 05 3 7 floristic diversity of the zones in terms of botanical composition the analyzed zones differed primarily in the number of occurring species and biodiversity table 4 the least diverse areas were the narrowest d site and the widest k site in these sites species such as phragmites australis phalaris arundinacea and urtica dioica commonly accepted as effective in capturing nutrients were found to be predominant analysis between the efficiency of the buffer zone in the reduction of nitrates and phosphates and the floral diversity demonstrates an increase in nutrient removal with increasing biodiversity for both pollutants in addition phosphate removal effectiveness also increased table 5 there was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of high effective species and efficiency of the zone table 5 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen removal and n saturation effect the study provided evidence of functioning of ecotones under continuously high nitrogen input although literature data demonstrated high removal efficiency also for elevated concentration of nitrate balestrini et al 2011 messer et al 2012 few studies showed that chronic high nitrate loading can finally exceed the buffering capacity of the buffer zone consequently decreasing removal efficiency thus lower nitrate removal efficiency at higher nitrate loading could be observed especially in the riparian forest zone hanson et al 1994 sabater et al 2003 hefting et al 2006 as indicated by literature data decreased efficiency of riparian buffer zones can be explained as inhibitory effect of declining carbon availability hill et al 2014 or low ph hefting et al 2006 or by interfering carbon to nitrogen ratio chen et al 2017 the occurrence of above mentioned factors can significantly alter denitrification process which is considered to be the most important driver of nitrogen cycle in the environment seitzinger et al 2006 reduction of oxidized nitrogen is possible due to the oxidation of electron donor thus availability of organic carbon source of electrons is considered to be the major limiting factor of denitrification process seitzinger et al 2006 following that the ratio between organic carbon and nitrogen expressed as c n ratio becomes more important driver than high nitrate loading decrease in c n ratio provokes incomplete reduction of nitrates with nitrites or n2o as a product chen et al 2017 two out of five monitored sites were permanently exposed to high nitrate inflow concentration with the average annual values exceeding more than twofold the level of 50 mg no3 l which is considered as the threshold level of polluted water according by the eu nitrates directive although the multi year average nitrate inflow concentration was similar 105 2 39 5 mg no3 l and 136 8 42 13 mg no3 l r and l sites respectively the analyzed buffer zones showed different nitrate removal effectiveness nre measured for r site was very consistent reaching 98 1 throughout 44 months of research all year round exposure on high nitrate input did not affect effectiveness of site r showing no signs of nitrogen saturation similarly ullah and zinati 2006 showed that in riparian forested soils denitrification potential can sustain even prolonged elevated nitrate loadings without suffering nitrogen saturation however 4 years monitoring period could be too short and future results may be altered due to the potential decrease of denitrification rate when carbon availability for denitrification becomes limited hill et al 2014 for example analyzed patterns of nitrate removal for 18 year period and showed decline of nitrate removal efficiency especially in the sand layer located 20 m from the river bank at depth of 3 4 m these data suggest that the potential for nitrogen saturation in riparian zones may increase nitrate outputs to adjacent streams in areas that receive chronic high groundwater nitrate loading meanwhile l site was characterized by highly variable effectiveness 62 9 29 which followed a sinusoidal seasonal distribution reaching peak efficiencies up to 99 in warm seasons and dropping to the level of 15 30 in the wintertime nre showed no correlation with groundwater temperatures whereas seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level was positively correlated it has to be noted that high changes in groundwater level were caused by the proximity of receiving drainage ditch which was part of drainage network operated by local farmers according to seasonal needs of land management the relationship between nre and water level confirms the fact that denitrification can be the main process responsible in the nitrate reduction water saturated soils provide suboxic condition in which denitrification occurs seitzinger et al 2006 difference in ecotone s widths between r 45 m and l 25 m site is not necessarily a decisive factor for efficiency disparity several studies show that narrow buffer zones can be highly effective as well borin and bigon 2002 found a decrease in no3 n concentration from 6 17 mg l to 1 17 mg l after passing through 5 m wide grass strip likewise balestrini et al 2011 showed above 90 removal of 29 mg n no3 l within vegetated buffer zone consisted of a row of planted walnuts 3 5 m and an herbaceous strip 3 m 4 2 phosphates retention or release effective sorption and desorption processes can be considered as a major driver of riparian buffer zones efficiency in the retention of phosphates via subsurface flow subsurface phosphorus dynamics acts as a balance of concentrations between reactive dissolved phosphorus and particle bound phosphorus in the soil matrix withers and jarvie 2008 and depends on many factors records et al 2016 soils rich in binding constituents fe al ca etc contribute to the reduction of phosphorus losses as it was observed for the l site despite the high nitrate pollution of groundwater 137 mg no3 l phosphate concentration reported was at a low level 0 46 mg po4 l which can be associated with a high content of iron ore in the soil profile soils poor in binding constituents have higher rates of p leaching both in case of mineral and organic soil evans et al 2004 in addition the abundance of organic matter in soil can increase the amount of mobile form of p zamuner et al 2008 by the interaction of negatively charged functional groups with positively charged fe or al von wandruszka 2006 despite this the whole interaction between organic matter and p is more complicated and the adsorption of organic groups with cations can result in both the increase and decrease of adsorption potential fink et al 2016 our 4 year study reveals the correlation between concentration of phosphates entering the buffer zones and their retention efficiency and therefore we analyzed our results under two scenarios high and low concentration of phosphates significant correlation between influent and effluent concentrations of phosphates p 0 05 were found for highly polluted shallow groundwater in r and t sites 2 69 mg po4 l and 3 89 mg po4 l respectively where obtained pre represents highest values 81 23 and 76 17 respectively these results indicate the strong relationship between influent concentration of phosphates and removal effectiveness of buffer zones however excess of high concentrations in the buffer zone can be associated with a potential risk of exceeding the critical phosphate saturation degree psd which could be a potential factor of subsurface flow recontamination as indicated by schoumans and chardon 2015 moreover in same study schoumans and chardon 2015 showed that about 43 of the agricultural land in the netherlands surpasses the critical psd value and consequently this area may contribute to the p pollution of surface water in our case high input of phosphates to buffer zones may potentially result in exceeding the sorption capacity of riparian buffer zones and decrease their retention abilities to the minimum nevertheless during the 4 year study in r and t sites there was no incident of exceeding the threshold of buffer zones capacity on the other hand as shown by the results of the d l and k sites the buffer zones can occasionally release phosphates to water especially when inflow concentrations of phosphates are low based on the knowledge regarding mechanisms of p transfer between soil and water schroeder and kovar 2008 stutter et al 2009 roberts et al 2012 in case of low p concentrations in the water soils commonly release phosphates into the solution what results from the key mechanism of sorption concentration gradient if entering water is attributed with low concentrations soil tends to release phosphorus into the surrounding waters reddy et al 1999 however in our case the release of phosphorus from the buffer zone area resulted more from the functioning of the zone itself rather than the incoming agricultural nutrient streams it was a consequence of the phosphorus cycle that was predominantly driven by accumulation decomposition of the biomass rather than the dynamics of water exchange in addition the biogeochemical conditions in the soil matrix may be modified by hydrological disturbances the occurrence of interchanging drying and rewetting periods can contribute to the oxygen depletion and change in the redox potential which stimulate p release fonseca et al 2011 however there was no correlation found between water level fluctuations and phosphate removal efficiency under the study period likewise in order to consider stable chemical conditions of shallow groundwater during the 4 year study no correlation was found within the factors such as ph dissolved oxygen or conductivity additionally temporal pattern of reduction was not observed either the lack of correlation confirms that the most probable mechanism of phosphates control was a rapid sorption via reversible surface tension attraction known as a physical bounding reddy and delaune 2008 although the contribution of buffer zones width to the effectiveness in reduction of surface runoff pollution has been well studied e g lee et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 the subsurface labile pollution removal still needs to be explored especially with respect to phosphates there are only a few articles regarding the subsurface ecotone performance for p removal therefore the importance of zone width has not been clearly defined yet borin et al 2004 showed that the most effective removal performance took place at a very short distance of buffer entrance that accounted for 75 of total ecotone effectiveness results presented by aguiar et al 2015 showed that effectiveness of riparian buffer zones is largely controlled by the width of the buffer zone and type of the vegetation their results confirmed that in the grass dominated buffer zones the highest reduction ratio was observed within first 12 meters but only wider 60 m zone allowed the reduction at the level of 52 9 however at the same time 99 9 efficiency in phosphorus removal from shallow groundwater was found in 60 m forested buffer zone what only shows the complexity of the ecotones performance mechanisms during our study no correlation between width of the buffer zone and the efficiency of phosphates removal was observed our results in case of phosphates seem to support the hypothesis that soil conditions and its geochemistry have higher contribution to the reduction of phosphates concentration than a buffer zone width 4 3 species composition of plants versus their nutrient uptake and efficiency of buffer zone grasslands are a special type of buffer zones in the landscape of river valleys and watercourses which efficiently absorb phosphorus and nitrogen compounds in the form of natural and mineral fertilizers high efficiency results from a well developed spatial distribution of the grass root system and thus large sorption of plants uusi kamppa 2005 another factor affecting high efficiency of grassland is sodding the surface for the whole year and a long vegetation of grass during which they accumulate biogenic substances to form the biomass in a review paper parn et al 2012 indicate that riparian communities formed by grass and herbs can accumulate approximately 20 70 kg n ha and 4 8 kg p ha in their biomass for comparison riparian forests can accumulate nitrogen from 30 kg ha up to 170 kg ha and phosphorus from 4 5 kg ha to 13 kg ha parn et al 2012 in addition hefting et al 2005 based on their study conducted in six european countries showed a higher n uptake in forested buffers compared to herbaceous ones however they noted higher n uptake values than those reported by parn et al 2012 nutrient uptake varied from 83 kg n ha to 146 kg n ha in herbaceous sites our results confirm these findings averaging the obtained values for all sampling sites the value of n uptake was 131 kg ha and in case of phosphorus it was 19 5 kg ha raty et al 2010 reported lower values of plant uptake in vegetated buffer zone in finland which varied 19 72 kg n ha and 2 4 10 2 kg p ha however these studies were conducted within the area characterized by a shorter growing season higher efficiency of forest zones is primarily associated with larger and deeper root zone of trees ranalli and macalady 2010 on the other hand plants on periodically flooded areas such as grassland and swamp non forest communities adjacent to watercourses are most often formed by species that accompany mycorrhiza for example phragmites australis phalaris arundinacea deschampsia caespitosa and species of carex genus sumorok et al 2008 the microbiological activity of the rhizosphere promotes nutrient absorption by the host plants azcÃ³n aguilar and barea 1992 linderman 2000 miller 2000 thus mycorrhiza enables plants to increase their water uptake capacity even by 1000 fold and their range of influence is larger another advantage of herbaceous buffer zones is that they can be periodically harvested which allows to remove the accumulated nutrients from ecosystem christen and dalgaard 2013 in their review showed that harvestable amounts of p for grasses in buffer zones are between 10 kg p ha and 15 kg p ha however kelly et al 2007 reported that harvesting grass strip with domination of smooth brome removed 62 kg p ha to increase the efficiency of the nutrients removal mowing should take place before the first frosts when a part of n and p accumulated in the aboveground biomass is translocated to the belowground parts of plants raty et al 2010 when harvesting is not performed and plants are left for the winter during the process of freezing and thawing the nutrients accumulated in the above ground parts of the plants are transformed into soluble forms and subsequently part of these nutrients may be transported by surface runoff to water ecosystems non mowing zones can change a buffer zone into a rich source of nutrients leaching of p as a result of the decay of biomass plants in unharvested not mown riverside part of buffer zone may be the main cause of p release recorded in k site however vegetation through the supply of organic matter has a significant indirect role on n removal by simulating denitrification activity hefting et al 2005 in case of areas of high contamination with nitrates and low organic matter content one should therefore apply the appropriate management of plant biomass with the possibility of leaving part of organic material to decay as shown above nutrient retention in vegetation is an important process responsible for mitigation of nutrient leaching however it is also a short term immobilization process seasonal changes of biomass may affect the efficiency of buffer zone in nutrient removal borin et al 2004 yet such a seasonality was not observed in our results similarly to sabater et al 2003 in the studied buffer zones under specific conditions plants uptake of nutrients might be balanced or exceeded by removing nitrate through denitrification and phosphates sorption in soil the important finding in the study was the observation that biodiversity affects the efficiency of the buffer zone more than the proportion of species widely recognized as those that accumulate most nitrogen and phosphorus urtica dioica phalaris arundinacea and phragmites australis the vegetation biodiversity itself has two separate components the number of species present species richness and their relative abundances dominance or evenness magurran and mcgill 2011 thus the zones dominated by one or two even highly productive species as observed in the communities of phalaris arundinacea or phragmites australis will be less efficient in reducing pollution than the zone formed by numerous species but of a smaller contribution such structure is attributed to meadows and tall forbs tall herb fringe communities forming marginal parts of extensive grasslands similarly the greatest utilization of nutrients was found in case of higher plant species diversity thereby lowering the leaching loss of soil nitrogen in native undisturbed grassland tilman et al 1996 this confirms the hypothesis of tilman and downing 1994 that biodiversity is a key factor that regulates the functioning of the ecosystem plant diversity stimulates the richness of soil microbial communities and controls the rate of ecosystem n cycling zak et al 2003 furthermore the abundance of different species results in multiple processes being initiated in the ecosystem what in turns further enhances the multi functionality of the ecosystem hector and bagchi 2007 jing et al 2015 5 conclusion over 4 years of the research studied ecotones did not show any signs of sorption capacity depletion as a result no clear decline of removal efficiency was observed even when exposed for the prolonged input of high nutrient leakages above 200 mg no3 l and 10 mg po4 l even though those buffer zones were subjected to elevated load before the beginning of the monitoring this demonstrates a high caring capacity of the studied ecosystems a factor increasing the efficiency of zones is the diversity of plant species which was naturally formed during succession therefore it is important to take legal action to prevent conversion of extensive grasslands into croplands the high potential of the buffer zones for reduction of agriculturally elevated nutrient input was successfully demonstrated during our 4 year monitoring campaign based on the results we recommended widespread establishment and above all protection of the existing buffer zones as an effective tool to be implemented for pilica river catchment such a solution will also aim for further decrease of the nutrient input to sulejow reservoir that is predominantly charged with pilica river however an increase in non point pollution associated with agricultural activity expressed by both high concentrations of nutrients as well as expansion of agricultural land imposes us to search for ways to increase the efficiency of riparian buffer zones for interrupting nutrient transfer from cropland to the surface water strengthening the efficiency of buffer zones is possible through the construction of additional elements such as biogeochemical barriers based on limestone kirkkala et al 2012 izydorczyk et al 2013 denitrifying barriers schipper et al 2010 bednarek et al 2010 or the enrichment of soil in p binding materials uusi kÃ¤mppÃ¤ et al 2012 the potential of this

11482,multifunctional ecosystem of narrow grasslands located between croplands and streams slowly disappears from the agricultural landscape in poland despite its importance to reduce the impact of land based nutrients on freshwater ecosystems we studied the effects of five extensive grasslands on nitrate and phosphate reduction in the catchment scale during our 4 year monitoring we did not observe the saturation effect in case of the two buffer zones that were receiving high nitrate load via subsurface flow highest nitrate concentration exceeded twice the level of 50 mg no3 l which is considered a threshold level of water pollution status by the eu nitrates directive concentrations above 100 mg no3 l were reduced by 68 and 99 passing through the 25 m and 45 m of grassland respectively the efficiency of buffer zone to mitigate phosphate losses varied depending on the input load the results obtained for high concentrations above 1 5 mg po4 l showed 81 and 76 effectiveness of 45 m and 47 m grassland respectively however the release of phosphates was reported as well and occurred at the buffer zones characterized by low inflow p concentrations when assimilation decomposition processes dominated ecotone p dynamics the analysis of nutrient retention in vegetation showed that harvesting of grassland removed 131 kg n ha yr and 19 4 kg p ha yr furthermore the amount of nitrate and phosphate removed by buffer zones were statistically and positively correlated r 0 62 p 0 05 and r 0 52 p 0 05 for no3 and po4 respectively with the biodiversity expressed as shannon index which underlines the importance of marginal parts of buffer zones keywords riparian buffer zone nitrogen phosphorus vegetation shallow groundwater diffuse pollution 1 introduction riparian buffer zones ecotones and vegetative filter strips are situated on the main pathways of nutrient cycle between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems their buffering capacity and ability to control pollution exchange between ecosystems are particularly important when considering the reduction on non point agricultural source of pollution which is well recognized as a direct reason for the degradation of water bodies and coastal zones lowrance et al 1984 mander et al 2005 doskkey et al 2010 stutter et al 2012 furthermore the buffer zones play a crucial role in the ecosystems providing unique habitats for a variety of organisms thus securing the biodiversity and maintaining the energy flow between the ecosystems naiman et al 1989 mccracken et al 2012 understanding the cause and effect relationships that regulate the functioning of riparian buffer zone is needed for the optimal formation and management of riparian buffer zones this knowledge may be used in the regulation of the processes of ecosystems which according to the theory of ecohydrology zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2014 allows us to increase the capacity resilience and ability of flexible reaction of ecosystems on progressive human antropopression and climate change the water flux which drives the exchange of nutrients reaches the ecotones via surface runoff and subsurface flow parn et al 2012 soluble phosphates and nitrates as a mobile fraction of subsurface flow create an important contribution to the surface water degradation process holman et al 2008 mittelstet et al 2011 robinson 2015 subsurface flow efficiency of riparian buffer zones in the reduction of nitrogen is well described in the literature e g doskkey et al 2010 young and briggs 2005 mayer et al 2007 reported mean nitrogen removal effectiveness reaching 76 6 in the meta analysis performed for 65 individual riparian buffers with different vegetation however there is limited data on the efficiency of ecotones for groundwater coming from heavily fertilized cropland hefting et al 2006 yamada et al 2007 balestrini et al 2011 most of the research concerning efficiency of buffer zones in phosphorus reduction is primarily focused on the analysis of the role of buffer zone for inhibiting transport of phosphorus compounds from the surface runoff and recognizing sedimentation process uusi kamppa 2005 syversen 2005 hoffmann et al 2009 dunn et al 2011 meanwhile the effectiveness of buffer zone to reduce phosphate in shallow groundwater is not well documented schilling and jacobson 2014 aguiar et al 2015 some researchers have suggested that riparian zones are ineffective in removing dissolved phosphorus or even they may release retained phosphorus into water carlyle and hill 2001 hoffmann et al 2006 based on the optimistic results of various studies there are an increasing number of guidelines and also legal regulations toward implementation of buffer zones as an effective and best management practice to buffer aquatic ecosystems against nutrient losses from agricultural landscape e g fsa 2010 holsten et al 2012 nevertheless the widespread use of these buffer zones is still challenged by socio economic factors buckley et al 2012 mainly because of the agricultural land needed to be transformed back to its natural state this conflict of interest is well visible in poland where the transformation of extensive to intensive agriculture is shaping a new type of agricultural landscape in the times of extensive faming narrow grasslands located between croplands and streams used to be an important part of agricultural landscape providing areas for pastures fodder e g hay or simply being a communication network yet the currently growing industrialization and intensification of agriculture is putting a great pressure on the remaining ecotones firstly more and more grassland are being transformed and incorporated into the neighboring croplands secondly the intensive animal husbandry is no longer supplied by organic fodder collected from grassy areas of ecotones therefore there is little interest in preserving ecological structure of those natural buffer zones however considering the ecological importance of ecotones their removal from agricultural landscape deprives local water bodies from the important antipollution barriers the aim of the research was to prove the utility of extensive grasslands as an effective barrier to intercept the lost agricultural nutrients transported through the shallow groundwater streams into water bodies we monitored five buffer zones that consist of a grassland strip with tall herb fringe or swamp non forest communities directly adjacent to streams at the temperate lowland pilica river catchment in central poland the effectiveness in nitrate and phosphorus reduction from shallow subsurface flow were analyzed based on 4 years monitoring results the analysis of species composition was included in the study to determine whether biodiversity of ecotones affects their effectiveness in reducing pollution the primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the usage of buffer zones as an effective tool to reduce the transfer of non point pollution and to place it in the catalog of actions aimed at improving water quality in the pilica river catchment and preventing further eutrophication of sulejÃ³w reservoir frÄtczak and izydorczyk 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the following five case studies located within the pilica river catchment in central poland were chosen to best represent the biological and geological characteristic of the region fig 1 radonia two sites r and d kÅudzice l tresta t and kaÅek k the width of buffer zones varied from 8 m to 77 m depending on the location table 1 the sampling sites covered the buffer zone between the cropland and first order streams or small drainage ditch l site the chosen grasslands were established more than 15 years ago previously they were regularly fertilized and mowed or grazed before establishing the sampling sites local surveys and observation were carried out to obtain the information about the past and present use of the ecotones currently only the biomass was regularly removed from grasslands 2 3 times a year no additional agricultural activities were reported to take place on the monitoring sites additionally all buffer zones included a narrow marginal part located in the immediate vicinity of the watercourse excluded from the agricultural management and composed of tall forbs or swamp non forest communities neighboring croplands were used in the cultivation of plants barley rye oat corn or triticale according to the farmers declarations the croplands were mostly fertilized with mineral fertilizers mainly nitrogen fertilizers 150 kg ha and occasionally with cattle manure 40 tons ha nevertheless over our 4 year research duration the discharge of poultry litter slurry and domestic sewage was also noted the hydrogeological and morphological characteristic was presented in table 1 geological cross sections of four out of five research sites showed little variation typically at the crop field borders the first layer with a thickness of 0 3 0 5 m is made of soil which can be found above a uniform layer of permeable tracks fine sands grits and coarse sand additionally peat layers have been found close to the streams at k and t sites only d site is characterized by the presence of clay and silt lenses occurring between layer of soil and permeable tracks fine sands the groundwater level in inlet sections fluctuated between 0 25 m and 1 97 m below ground level bgl while in outlet sections 0 15 1 73 m bgl the region receives an average annual rainfall of about 600 mm szczeÅniak and piniewski 2015 in 2011 2014 the values of total annual rain or snow precipitation reached 563 mm 480 mm 592 mm and 818 mm respectively the mean annual temperature reaches 8 6 c typically the snow cover would last for 2 months 50 days on an average 2 2 groundwater monitoring the piezometers paired cropland buffer for groundwater monitoring were installed in january 2011 by professional company specialized in hydrogeological research at first the topographic analysis and geological boreholes were done for preliminary assessment of groundwater flow patterns the piezometers were made of high density polyethylene pipes Ã¸50 mm eijkelkamp and installed in holes drilled using a machine auger fixed on a lightweight trolley the piezometers length ranged from 2 1 to 3 0 m and they were perforated throughout 1 m from the bottom finally piezometers were leveled additionally lithology granulometric estimation and thickness was determined by visual inspection of soil material collected by auger during installation based on this geological cross sections were done groundwater samples were collected monthly from february 2011 until september 2014 within 44 months during each sampling at first the water level was manually measured using electric contact meter kll mini seba hydrometrie next 3 well volumes were pumped out with the electric groundwater pump gigant whale 12 vdc to removed standing water prior to collection of the water samples immediately after piezometers had fully recharged the water samples were taken and temperature conductivity and ph were measured in situ ysi professional plus model 10e1744 and model pro10102030 water samples were transported to the laboratory in 250 ml bottles in ice boxes and were filtered immediately after arrival through whatman gf c filters analysis of dissolved forms of nitrogen and phosphorus was performed with use of ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 which enable the quality and quantity analysis of cations with ion pac cs15 column nh4 and anions with the ion pac as14a column no2 no3 2 po4 3 the method detection limit was 1 Î¼g l and the limit of quantification was 10 Î¼g l we analyzed the efficiency of the riparian buffer zone located in the stream valley by assessing the reduction level of inflow concentration of phosphate and nitrate nitrate phosphate removal nr pr were calculated as difference between their concentrations at the entry point cin wells installed on cropland border din lin rin tin and kin and at the exit point cout wells installed near streams bank dout lout rout tout and kout nitrate phosphate removal effectiveness nre pre were calculated from the formula nre pre 1 cout cin 100 multi annual monitoring was carried out considering the groundwater division into a good 50 mg no3 l and 1 mg po4 l and bad status 50 mg no3 l and 1 mg po4 l the thresholds were set according to polish water legislation dz u 2008 nr 143 poz 896 regulation of the minister of environment of 23 july 2008 on the criteria and method of evaluation of groundwater condition additional surface water samples were collected from the adjacent streams our study showed no statistically significant p 0 05 correlation between the concentration of studied nutrients in groundwater outflow from buffer zones and stream water thus we assumed that the obtained removal efficiency is not significantly disturbed by the external impact of stream water 2 3 species composition of vegetation to determine the species composition of vegetation series of phytosociological relevÃ©s were obtained using the braun blanquet method by applying a cover abundance scale barkman et al 1964 where each scale degree correspond to the range of cover as following 5 75 100 4 50 75 3 25 50 2 5 25 1 5 numerous individuals and 5 few individuals the relevÃ©s were located near the piezometers in the middle of each vegetation patches that included in the ecotone in the buffer zone characterized by a width of 45 m relevÃ©s were taken in the grassland and in swamp non forest communities or tall herb fringe directly adjacent to the watercourse whereas in the narrow ecotones relevÃ©s were taken in the community reaching the watercourse the area of relevÃ©s in all cases was 25 m2 total number of 35 relevÃ©s where taken for calculation for further calculations of the biodiversity data from the l site were not used as the grassland was mown twice just before performing the study data on vegetation were collected each time in consecutive years of research quantitative data derived from relevÃ©s were used in calculations and the degrees of cover were converted into average percentage cover according to the following rule 5 87 5 4 62 5 3 37 5 2 17 5 1 5 0 5 van der maarel 1979 based on the calculated abundance we assessed the sum of average percentage of coverage of highly effective species in nutrient trapping attributed to phragmites australis phalaris arundinacea and urtica dioica izydorczyk et al 2015 and biodiversity of patches using shannon index odum 1982 according to the following formula h Ïpi ln pi where pi the ratio of abundance of the i th species to the sum of abundance of the remaining species in the community abundance of species was attributed to their average coverage percentage 2 4 biomass productivity and n and p uptake in the vegetation measurements of aboveground biomass of the vegetation and concentration of the nutrients in plant tissues were performed to analyze the nutrient uptake by plants accumulation of nutrients was calculated as the multiplication of biomass and the concentration of nutrients found in plant tissues recalculated per ha sampling campaign was conducted over four consecutive years from 2011 to 2014 plant material was harvested at three periods at the turn of may and june end of july and again at the turn of september and october samples were obtained from the plots of 0 44 m2 each time the samples were collected from new and undisturbed areas of the plots the collected biomass was transported in drafty linen bags in the laboratory samples were first dried at room temperature prior to portioning into smaller pieces later small pieces were dried in the oven at a temperature of 70 c for 48 h and then at a temperature of 105 c for one more hour finally the biomass was weighted in case of the samples collected from mown grasslands the annual amount of biomass was calculated as the sum of spring and autumn samples weights dried material was homogenized by fractionation and was used for further nutrient analysis total nitrogen n content was measured following the kjeldhal method using skalar device total phosphorus p content was determined by flow colorimetry skalar device however the samples were mineralized prior to analysis 2 5 statistical analysis to determine the difference in nitrate and phosphate concentrations between cropland and buffer zone input and output statistical comparisons using a two sample t test with a significance level of p 0 05 were performed to detect the possible relationships between the analyzed variables pearson correlation was used with a significance level of p 0 05 all statistical analysis were performed using statistica version 9 3 results 3 1 nitrate concentration studied buffer zones were charged with different nitrate inflow concentrations the lowest value was reported at the entrance to the widest buffer zone at the k site where the multi year average was found to be 4 1 mg no3 l good water status in terms of nitrates 50 mg no3 l was observed also for the 45 m zone at the t site tin multi year average 11 5 mg no3 l and for the narrowest buffer zone at the d site din multi year average 39 6 mg no3 l in case of the r site nitrate levels at the entrance indicated strong water pollution with an average value of 105 2 no3 l whereas the maximum measured value was 242 9 no3 l yet the highest values were reported at l site which was characterized with very high concentrations lin multi year average 136 8 mg no3 l maximum value 283 7 mg no3 l fig 2 a the observed temporal variability indicated correspondence between the occurrence of extreme inflow nitrate values and agricultural activity according to our results the maximum values were observed after spring or autumn fertilization during tillage period in three cases nitrate outflow concentrations measured on the waterfront edges of the ecotones showed very low values averaging 0 34 0 35 and 0 62 mg no3 l for kout tout and rout piezometers respectively fig 2a at the d site the outflow nitrate concentrations reached up to 59 5 mg no3 l yet with a still relatively low average value of 14 3 mg no3 l meanwhile the samples taken from the lout piezometer were characterized with an average value of 46 6 no3 l reaching occasionally even 213 45 mg no3 l 3 2 nitrate removal efficiency to analyze the efficiency of nutrient removal we used student s t test and compared the statistical significance between the inflow and outflow concentrations in the buffer zones according to our results during the 4 year period of the study a statistically significant difference was observed in case of concentration of nitrates in all analyzed piezometers paired table 2 the multi year average nitrate removal effectiveness nre of individual buffer zones ranged from 61 to 99 fig 2b the narrowest area 7 7 m d site with an inflow concentration of 40 mg no3 l was characterized by the nre at 61 the effectiveness of a three times wider buffer zone at the l site was at a similar level of 68 however the most important issue was the average amount of nitrate removed nr which reached 90 2 mg no3 l the highest nre 99 was observed in the 45 m r site moreover in r site the highest nr also was found 104 6 mg no3 l in case of this buffer zone it is important to note the stability of obtained results the buffer zone at the t site has a similar width as the r site however an important difference between them is the range of nutrient inflow concentration in case of tin this concentration is 10 fold lower than that reported for rin the buffer zone t with nr of 11 16 mg no3 l showed nre at the level of 91 the widest buffer zone k site showed the reduction of nitrates at level of 73 nre and 3 77 mg no3 l nr low nr was a result of low inflow concentrations reaching the zone 4 11 mg no3 l nevertheless during the monitoring period the captured inflow peak concentrations of 48 6 mg no3 l and 25 0 mg no3 l were found to be still reduced by 100 and 97 respectively indicating the capability of the site to reduce also elevated no3 loads 3 3 phosphate concentration in case of phosphate concentrations in water reaching the buffer zones division based on water quality thresholds can be made as well good water quality is classified to contain less than 1 mg po4 l while all the water exceeding this limit is considered to be polluted good water quality in terms of phosphates was found in three buffer zones multi year average inflow concentration accounted for 0 46 mg po4 l 0 59 po4 l 0 66 mg po4 l at lin din and kin respectively fig 3 a the poor bad status was reported at two buffer zones through 2 69 mg po4 l rin and up to the highest average concentration of 3 89 mg po4 l in tin piezometer analysis of the phosphate concentrations after passing the buffer zones has shown that in all transects multi year average levels were below the concentration of 1 mg po4 l fig 3a the highest average values were demonstrated on tout and accounted for 0 76 mg po4 l 3 4 efficiency of phosphates removal studied buffer zones were characterized by high efficiency in reducing phosphate pollution in case of high inflow concentrations fig 3b the highest phosphate removal effectiveness pre was calculated for the r site the concentration reduction by 81 corresponded to the removal of 2 37 mg po4 l the highest phosphate removal rp was observed at the t site concentration was decreased by 3 12 mg po4 l which accounted for 76 of inflow concentration in case of the buffer zones where inflow concentrations were low d l and k sites outflow phosphate concentrations were also found at a low level fig 3a moreover periodic release of phosphates from the buffer zones was recorded as well the highest release 142 was observed at l site what corresponds with 0 10 mg po4 l of multiyear average pr the buffer zone at k site with pr 0 05 mgpo4 l showed the pre averaging 49 whereas at d site pre reached the similar level 43 but the ecotone maintained positive pr of 0 05 mgpo4 l nevertheless the use of student s t test to test the level of significance of inflow and outflow concentrations in l and k sites showed no statistically significant difference table 2 3 5 factor influence on nutrient efficiency variations in efficiency did not follow a seasonal pattern at any of the buffer zones with exemption of the l site the lack of seasonal changes was confirmed by lack of significant correlation between temperature and nr nre pr and pre in case of the l site the temporal changes were the result of groundwater level fluctuations which was due to the drainage ditch management we found positive correlation between water level and nr nre 0 67 and 0 62 p 0 05 respectively and negative with pre 0 38 p 0 05 decrease in the groundwater level of more than 140 cm reduced nre to 50 correlation analysis showed also significant relationship between efficiency and groundwater level for the d site 0 39 and 0 38 p 0 05 for nr and pre respectively for all sites considered together the efficiency was positively related to nutrients inputs fig 4 table 3 but at the site scale the correlation analysis showed different relationship in the nitrate case we found strong correlation between nitrate inflow concentration and nr for all wider sites r t and k sites and nre for three sites d t and k sites more consistent results were observed between pre and influent concentration where all sites represent significant relationships pr was unrelated to inflow concentrations only in d site 3 6 aboveground biomass and n and p uptake among grasslands the highest productivity was reported in the widest buffer zone at the k site where the multi year average value of biomass was 1018 g m2 lower values were reported in samples collected from the grasslands at the l t and r site and accounted for 803 g m2 591 g m2 and 445 g m2 respectively in the community of common reed at the k site we found an average biomass of 951 g m2 in swamp non forest communities of reed canary grass with nettle at the d site average biomass was 775 g m2 whereas at the r site it was 645 g m2 in case of poorly developed tall herb fringe zone at the t site the average biomass was 354 g m2 biomass of the aboveground parts of plants collected from grasslands tall herb fringe communities and swamp non forest communities showed large variability not only between the zones but primarily within the zone itself in each year table 4 the growing season in 2014 was characterized by very favorable hydro meteorological conditions for plant growth with the highest biomass values reported considering the n and p uptake calculated as a product of biomass and percentage content of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant tissues during the vegetative period the highest multi year average values for grasslands reported at the k site reached the level of 202 kg n ha and 33 6 kg p ha table 4 approximately 139 kg n ha and 26 7 kg p ha were reported in samples collected at the t site whereas for samples collected from grasslands at the l and r sites it was 135 kg n ha 101 kg n ha 21 0 kg p ha and 13 1 kg p ha respectively common reed community at the k site was characterized by the highest average values of accumulated nitrogen 135 kg n ha and phosphorus 18 2 kg p ha slightly lower values were observed in samples collected from swamp non forest communities of reed canary grass in which the average values ranged from 115 kg n ha and 14 8 kg p ha for r site to 133 kg n ha and 18 5 kg p ha for d site in nitrophilic community at the buffer zone at the t site the following values were reported 88 kg n ha and 10 6 kg p ha nitrogen and phosphorus uptake was related to the biomass production pearson correlation coefficient 0 89 and 0 81 respectively n 30 p 0 05 3 7 floristic diversity of the zones in terms of botanical composition the analyzed zones differed primarily in the number of occurring species and biodiversity table 4 the least diverse areas were the narrowest d site and the widest k site in these sites species such as phragmites australis phalaris arundinacea and urtica dioica commonly accepted as effective in capturing nutrients were found to be predominant analysis between the efficiency of the buffer zone in the reduction of nitrates and phosphates and the floral diversity demonstrates an increase in nutrient removal with increasing biodiversity for both pollutants in addition phosphate removal effectiveness also increased table 5 there was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of high effective species and efficiency of the zone table 5 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen removal and n saturation effect the study provided evidence of functioning of ecotones under continuously high nitrogen input although literature data demonstrated high removal efficiency also for elevated concentration of nitrate balestrini et al 2011 messer et al 2012 few studies showed that chronic high nitrate loading can finally exceed the buffering capacity of the buffer zone consequently decreasing removal efficiency thus lower nitrate removal efficiency at higher nitrate loading could be observed especially in the riparian forest zone hanson et al 1994 sabater et al 2003 hefting et al 2006 as indicated by literature data decreased efficiency of riparian buffer zones can be explained as inhibitory effect of declining carbon availability hill et al 2014 or low ph hefting et al 2006 or by interfering carbon to nitrogen ratio chen et al 2017 the occurrence of above mentioned factors can significantly alter denitrification process which is considered to be the most important driver of nitrogen cycle in the environment seitzinger et al 2006 reduction of oxidized nitrogen is possible due to the oxidation of electron donor thus availability of organic carbon source of electrons is considered to be the major limiting factor of denitrification process seitzinger et al 2006 following that the ratio between organic carbon and nitrogen expressed as c n ratio becomes more important driver than high nitrate loading decrease in c n ratio provokes incomplete reduction of nitrates with nitrites or n2o as a product chen et al 2017 two out of five monitored sites were permanently exposed to high nitrate inflow concentration with the average annual values exceeding more than twofold the level of 50 mg no3 l which is considered as the threshold level of polluted water according by the eu nitrates directive although the multi year average nitrate inflow concentration was similar 105 2 39 5 mg no3 l and 136 8 42 13 mg no3 l r and l sites respectively the analyzed buffer zones showed different nitrate removal effectiveness nre measured for r site was very consistent reaching 98 1 throughout 44 months of research all year round exposure on high nitrate input did not affect effectiveness of site r showing no signs of nitrogen saturation similarly ullah and zinati 2006 showed that in riparian forested soils denitrification potential can sustain even prolonged elevated nitrate loadings without suffering nitrogen saturation however 4 years monitoring period could be too short and future results may be altered due to the potential decrease of denitrification rate when carbon availability for denitrification becomes limited hill et al 2014 for example analyzed patterns of nitrate removal for 18 year period and showed decline of nitrate removal efficiency especially in the sand layer located 20 m from the river bank at depth of 3 4 m these data suggest that the potential for nitrogen saturation in riparian zones may increase nitrate outputs to adjacent streams in areas that receive chronic high groundwater nitrate loading meanwhile l site was characterized by highly variable effectiveness 62 9 29 which followed a sinusoidal seasonal distribution reaching peak efficiencies up to 99 in warm seasons and dropping to the level of 15 30 in the wintertime nre showed no correlation with groundwater temperatures whereas seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level was positively correlated it has to be noted that high changes in groundwater level were caused by the proximity of receiving drainage ditch which was part of drainage network operated by local farmers according to seasonal needs of land management the relationship between nre and water level confirms the fact that denitrification can be the main process responsible in the nitrate reduction water saturated soils provide suboxic condition in which denitrification occurs seitzinger et al 2006 difference in ecotone s widths between r 45 m and l 25 m site is not necessarily a decisive factor for efficiency disparity several studies show that narrow buffer zones can be highly effective as well borin and bigon 2002 found a decrease in no3 n concentration from 6 17 mg l to 1 17 mg l after passing through 5 m wide grass strip likewise balestrini et al 2011 showed above 90 removal of 29 mg n no3 l within vegetated buffer zone consisted of a row of planted walnuts 3 5 m and an herbaceous strip 3 m 4 2 phosphates retention or release effective sorption and desorption processes can be considered as a major driver of riparian buffer zones efficiency in the retention of phosphates via subsurface flow subsurface phosphorus dynamics acts as a balance of concentrations between reactive dissolved phosphorus and particle bound phosphorus in the soil matrix withers and jarvie 2008 and depends on many factors records et al 2016 soils rich in binding constituents fe al ca etc contribute to the reduction of phosphorus losses as it was observed for the l site despite the high nitrate pollution of groundwater 137 mg no3 l phosphate concentration reported was at a low level 0 46 mg po4 l which can be associated with a high content of iron ore in the soil profile soils poor in binding constituents have higher rates of p leaching both in case of mineral and organic soil evans et al 2004 in addition the abundance of organic matter in soil can increase the amount of mobile form of p zamuner et al 2008 by the interaction of negatively charged functional groups with positively charged fe or al von wandruszka 2006 despite this the whole interaction between organic matter and p is more complicated and the adsorption of organic groups with cations can result in both the increase and decrease of adsorption potential fink et al 2016 our 4 year study reveals the correlation between concentration of phosphates entering the buffer zones and their retention efficiency and therefore we analyzed our results under two scenarios high and low concentration of phosphates significant correlation between influent and effluent concentrations of phosphates p 0 05 were found for highly polluted shallow groundwater in r and t sites 2 69 mg po4 l and 3 89 mg po4 l respectively where obtained pre represents highest values 81 23 and 76 17 respectively these results indicate the strong relationship between influent concentration of phosphates and removal effectiveness of buffer zones however excess of high concentrations in the buffer zone can be associated with a potential risk of exceeding the critical phosphate saturation degree psd which could be a potential factor of subsurface flow recontamination as indicated by schoumans and chardon 2015 moreover in same study schoumans and chardon 2015 showed that about 43 of the agricultural land in the netherlands surpasses the critical psd value and consequently this area may contribute to the p pollution of surface water in our case high input of phosphates to buffer zones may potentially result in exceeding the sorption capacity of riparian buffer zones and decrease their retention abilities to the minimum nevertheless during the 4 year study in r and t sites there was no incident of exceeding the threshold of buffer zones capacity on the other hand as shown by the results of the d l and k sites the buffer zones can occasionally release phosphates to water especially when inflow concentrations of phosphates are low based on the knowledge regarding mechanisms of p transfer between soil and water schroeder and kovar 2008 stutter et al 2009 roberts et al 2012 in case of low p concentrations in the water soils commonly release phosphates into the solution what results from the key mechanism of sorption concentration gradient if entering water is attributed with low concentrations soil tends to release phosphorus into the surrounding waters reddy et al 1999 however in our case the release of phosphorus from the buffer zone area resulted more from the functioning of the zone itself rather than the incoming agricultural nutrient streams it was a consequence of the phosphorus cycle that was predominantly driven by accumulation decomposition of the biomass rather than the dynamics of water exchange in addition the biogeochemical conditions in the soil matrix may be modified by hydrological disturbances the occurrence of interchanging drying and rewetting periods can contribute to the oxygen depletion and change in the redox potential which stimulate p release fonseca et al 2011 however there was no correlation found between water level fluctuations and phosphate removal efficiency under the study period likewise in order to consider stable chemical conditions of shallow groundwater during the 4 year study no correlation was found within the factors such as ph dissolved oxygen or conductivity additionally temporal pattern of reduction was not observed either the lack of correlation confirms that the most probable mechanism of phosphates control was a rapid sorption via reversible surface tension attraction known as a physical bounding reddy and delaune 2008 although the contribution of buffer zones width to the effectiveness in reduction of surface runoff pollution has been well studied e g lee et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 the subsurface labile pollution removal still needs to be explored especially with respect to phosphates there are only a few articles regarding the subsurface ecotone performance for p removal therefore the importance of zone width has not been clearly defined yet borin et al 2004 showed that the most effective removal performance took place at a very short distance of buffer entrance that accounted for 75 of total ecotone effectiveness results presented by aguiar et al 2015 showed that effectiveness of riparian buffer zones is largely controlled by the width of the buffer zone and type of the vegetation their results confirmed that in the grass dominated buffer zones the highest reduction ratio was observed within first 12 meters but only wider 60 m zone allowed the reduction at the level of 52 9 however at the same time 99 9 efficiency in phosphorus removal from shallow groundwater was found in 60 m forested buffer zone what only shows the complexity of the ecotones performance mechanisms during our study no correlation between width of the buffer zone and the efficiency of phosphates removal was observed our results in case of phosphates seem to support the hypothesis that soil conditions and its geochemistry have higher contribution to the reduction of phosphates concentration than a buffer zone width 4 3 species composition of plants versus their nutrient uptake and efficiency of buffer zone grasslands are a special type of buffer zones in the landscape of river valleys and watercourses which efficiently absorb phosphorus and nitrogen compounds in the form of natural and mineral fertilizers high efficiency results from a well developed spatial distribution of the grass root system and thus large sorption of plants uusi kamppa 2005 another factor affecting high efficiency of grassland is sodding the surface for the whole year and a long vegetation of grass during which they accumulate biogenic substances to form the biomass in a review paper parn et al 2012 indicate that riparian communities formed by grass and herbs can accumulate approximately 20 70 kg n ha and 4 8 kg p ha in their biomass for comparison riparian forests can accumulate nitrogen from 30 kg ha up to 170 kg ha and phosphorus from 4 5 kg ha to 13 kg ha parn et al 2012 in addition hefting et al 2005 based on their study conducted in six european countries showed a higher n uptake in forested buffers compared to herbaceous ones however they noted higher n uptake values than those reported by parn et al 2012 nutrient uptake varied from 83 kg n ha to 146 kg n ha in herbaceous sites our results confirm these findings averaging the obtained values for all sampling sites the value of n uptake was 131 kg ha and in case of phosphorus it was 19 5 kg ha raty et al 2010 reported lower values of plant uptake in vegetated buffer zone in finland which varied 19 72 kg n ha and 2 4 10 2 kg p ha however these studies were conducted within the area characterized by a shorter growing season higher efficiency of forest zones is primarily associated with larger and deeper root zone of trees ranalli and macalady 2010 on the other hand plants on periodically flooded areas such as grassland and swamp non forest communities adjacent to watercourses are most often formed by species that accompany mycorrhiza for example phragmites australis phalaris arundinacea deschampsia caespitosa and species of carex genus sumorok et al 2008 the microbiological activity of the rhizosphere promotes nutrient absorption by the host plants azcÃ³n aguilar and barea 1992 linderman 2000 miller 2000 thus mycorrhiza enables plants to increase their water uptake capacity even by 1000 fold and their range of influence is larger another advantage of herbaceous buffer zones is that they can be periodically harvested which allows to remove the accumulated nutrients from ecosystem christen and dalgaard 2013 in their review showed that harvestable amounts of p for grasses in buffer zones are between 10 kg p ha and 15 kg p ha however kelly et al 2007 reported that harvesting grass strip with domination of smooth brome removed 62 kg p ha to increase the efficiency of the nutrients removal mowing should take place before the first frosts when a part of n and p accumulated in the aboveground biomass is translocated to the belowground parts of plants raty et al 2010 when harvesting is not performed and plants are left for the winter during the process of freezing and thawing the nutrients accumulated in the above ground parts of the plants are transformed into soluble forms and subsequently part of these nutrients may be transported by surface runoff to water ecosystems non mowing zones can change a buffer zone into a rich source of nutrients leaching of p as a result of the decay of biomass plants in unharvested not mown riverside part of buffer zone may be the main cause of p release recorded in k site however vegetation through the supply of organic matter has a significant indirect role on n removal by simulating denitrification activity hefting et al 2005 in case of areas of high contamination with nitrates and low organic matter content one should therefore apply the appropriate management of plant biomass with the possibility of leaving part of organic material to decay as shown above nutrient retention in vegetation is an important process responsible for mitigation of nutrient leaching however it is also a short term immobilization process seasonal changes of biomass may affect the efficiency of buffer zone in nutrient removal borin et al 2004 yet such a seasonality was not observed in our results similarly to sabater et al 2003 in the studied buffer zones under specific conditions plants uptake of nutrients might be balanced or exceeded by removing nitrate through denitrification and phosphates sorption in soil the important finding in the study was the observation that biodiversity affects the efficiency of the buffer zone more than the proportion of species widely recognized as those that accumulate most nitrogen and phosphorus urtica dioica phalaris arundinacea and phragmites australis the vegetation biodiversity itself has two separate components the number of species present species richness and their relative abundances dominance or evenness magurran and mcgill 2011 thus the zones dominated by one or two even highly productive species as observed in the communities of phalaris arundinacea or phragmites australis will be less efficient in reducing pollution than the zone formed by numerous species but of a smaller contribution such structure is attributed to meadows and tall forbs tall herb fringe communities forming marginal parts of extensive grasslands similarly the greatest utilization of nutrients was found in case of higher plant species diversity thereby lowering the leaching loss of soil nitrogen in native undisturbed grassland tilman et al 1996 this confirms the hypothesis of tilman and downing 1994 that biodiversity is a key factor that regulates the functioning of the ecosystem plant diversity stimulates the richness of soil microbial communities and controls the rate of ecosystem n cycling zak et al 2003 furthermore the abundance of different species results in multiple processes being initiated in the ecosystem what in turns further enhances the multi functionality of the ecosystem hector and bagchi 2007 jing et al 2015 5 conclusion over 4 years of the research studied ecotones did not show any signs of sorption capacity depletion as a result no clear decline of removal efficiency was observed even when exposed for the prolonged input of high nutrient leakages above 200 mg no3 l and 10 mg po4 l even though those buffer zones were subjected to elevated load before the beginning of the monitoring this demonstrates a high caring capacity of the studied ecosystems a factor increasing the efficiency of zones is the diversity of plant species which was naturally formed during succession therefore it is important to take legal action to prevent conversion of extensive grasslands into croplands the high potential of the buffer zones for reduction of agriculturally elevated nutrient input was successfully demonstrated during our 4 year monitoring campaign based on the results we recommended widespread establishment and above all protection of the existing buffer zones as an effective tool to be implemented for pilica river catchment such a solution will also aim for further decrease of the nutrient input to sulejow reservoir that is predominantly charged with pilica river however an increase in non point pollution associated with agricultural activity expressed by both high concentrations of nutrients as well as expansion of agricultural land imposes us to search for ways to increase the efficiency of riparian buffer zones for interrupting nutrient transfer from cropland to the surface water strengthening the efficiency of buffer zones is possible through the construction of additional elements such as biogeochemical barriers based on limestone kirkkala et al 2012 izydorczyk et al 2013 denitrifying barriers schipper et al 2010 bednarek et al 2010 or the enrichment of soil in p binding materials uusi kÃ¤mppÃ¤ et al 2012 the potential of this nature based solution should be used in the development of sustainable agriculture funding this paper is an outcome of the ekorob project ecotones for reducing diffuse pollution life08 env pl 000519

11483,energy exchanges and turbulent fluxes were simultaneously measured using eddy covariance technique over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies during two growth seasons in an arid region of northwest china canopy conductance g c and decoupling coefficient Ï were calculated to evaluate differences of fluxes and controlling factors over the two types of canopies atmosphere over grapevine canopy was drier higher evaporative demand and aerodynamical transfer than maize canopy because air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed over grapevine were higher seasonal averaged net radiation r n and soil heat flux g over maize canopy was higher and lower respectively than grapevine resulting in that averaged available energy r n g was higher for maize than grapevine canopies with 125 0 and 85 6 w m 2 in 2009 and 121 9 and 99 5 w m 2 in 2010 respectively energy partitioning of available energy to latent heat flux Î»et was higher for maize than grapevine canopies with seasonal averaged ratio of 79 8 and 75 0 for maize and 62 3 and 59 8 for grapevine for both years respectively seasonal averaged bowen ratio Î² was lower for maize than grapevine canopies with 0 26 and 0 72 respectively g c for maize canopy was higher than grapevine varying nearly from 1 to above 30 mm s 1 and from 0 to above 15 mm s 1 respectively Ï of maize canopy was higher than grapevine with averaged values of 0 52 and 0 30 respectively suggesting that there was a stronger coupling between grapevine canopy and the above air the slope of linear regression between evapotranspiration et and r n were higher for maize canopy indicating that maize et was mostly controlled by r n the relationship between the priestley taylor coefficient Î± and g c fits an exponential increase for both types of crop canopies suggesting that grapevine et was more controlled by g c because most grapevine g c was lower than the threshold of 15 mm s 1 the slope of linear regression between Î± and leaf area index lai 2 8 m2 m 2 was higher for maize canopy indicating that maize et was more sensitive to lai below the threshold these results are important for water management and agricultural sustainable development across similar croplands in arid regions keywords energy partitioning evapotranspiration canopy conductance decoupling coefficient canopy structure 1 introduction mass and energy transfer in terrestrial ecosystem is a complex process and has significant influence on global climate change baldocchi et al 2001 there were a number of studies examining water and heat fluxes for different underlying surfaces e g forests grassland and farmland baldocchi and meyers 1998 ding et al 2013 li et al 2005 they found that a main factor that affects fluxes of mass and energy was the roughness of underlying surface which is greatly decided by the structure of canopy therefore understanding how different canopies respond to meteorological conditions and what is the difference of physical and physiological regulations are necessary for characterizing and quantifying the governing processes of water and heat fluxes for different terrestrial surfaces and important for modelling terrestrial biosphere atmosphere interactions baldocchi 1994 denmead 1969 mcginn and king 1990 the transfer of water vapor and heat is controlled by the magnitude distribution and orientation of the crop canopy maize and grapevine herbal and woody crops respectively have different canopy structures and morphologies the two kinds of canopies have different traits leaf size and shape crown architecture canopy height and cover etc specifically maize has a maximum leaf area index lai of 6 0 m2 m 2 while grapevine has a maximum lai of 2 5 m2 m 2 lai of 3 0 m2 m 2 can be used as a threshold of canopy fully covering soil surface allen et al 1998 thus we distinguish two canopy types according to maximum lai and define closed and sparse canopies for maize and grapevine respectively the different canopy structures result in different functions and evapotranspiration et transfer of vapor from crop canopy to atmosphere crop et is important for computing crop water requirements for both irrigated and rainfed agriculture maize and grapevine are main cereal and commercial crops respectively in arid area of northwest china their water requirements are different and maize et is higher than grapevine ding et al 2013 li et al 2008 water scarcity in this area has brought about great stress on agricultural development kang et al 2004 thus how to arrange the planting patterns with different canopy structures influences local agricultural and social sustainability comparative study of water and heat fluxes of different canopy types is necessary for understanding and quantifying governing factors for different underlying surfaces and canopy structures baldocchi 1994 previous studies in this area analysed and modelled maize et variations ding et al 2013 li et al 2016 and investigated evaporative fraction et and carbon flux in vineyard li et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 guo et al 2014 however there are not yet studies that compared energy partitioning and

rearranged penman monteith equation to better quantify the relative control of available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux vapor pressure deficit and physiological resistance the priestley taylor pt coefficient which eliminated the weather influence and normalized et using equilibrium evaporation is usually used to evaluate the effect from different underlying canopy types lei and yang 2010 priestley and taylor 1972 shuttleworth and calder 1979 we use the approach as the framework for the quantitative description of controlling factors of crop et in this study the scientific questions addressed in this study are 1 what are the differences of energy components and energy partitioning over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies in northwest china 2 what are the differences of physical and physiological controlling factors for the two kinds of canopies in the area we hypothesize that a closed maize canopy has higher r n g and Î»et than sparse grapevine canopy due to smoother surface and higher lai and b grapevine one of woody crops was more controlled by physiological resistance therefore the main objectives of this paper were to compare the differences of mass and energy transfers and et and examine physical and physiological controlling factors over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental arrangement two experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 at maize field and grapevine yard respectively in the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university ding et al 2010 2013 guo et al 2014 the experimental site is located in wuwei city gansu province n37 52 e102 50 altitude 1581 m a typical continental temperate climate zone with mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and pan evaporation of 2000 mm maize field and grapevine yard had the same altitude and precipitation with the experimental station and the distance between them was close 3 0 km an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp usa at a height of 2 0 m above a standard grass surface 100 m from the experimental maize field was used to measure solar radiation and precipitation the accumulated precipitation was 93 5 mm and 54 3 mm during the whole growth seasons of maize and grapevine in 2009 and 2010 respectively monthly accumulated precipitation was 8 95 21 39 48 87 and 14 3 mm from june to september in 2009 25 9 6 13 6 11 1 97 and 14 19 mm from may to september in 2010 daily precipitation p was shown in fig 1 c maize was sown in the experimental field with a north south length of 700 m and an east west width of 300 m on april 21 and may 2 and harvested on september 28 and 26 in 2009 and 2010 respectively maximum crop height of maize was 3 0 m soil surface was partly covered with strips of plastic film with a width of 100 cm and 20 cm inserted into soil on each edge the bare soil where maize was not sown between plastic film strips was 65 cm maize seed was sown through 5 0 cm diameter holes in the plastic film with a row spacing of 50 cm and a plant spacing of 23 8 cm actual ground covered fraction was 0 5 in 2009 and 0 6 in 2010 respectively which was defined as one minus the ratio of the summed surface areas of bare soil and holes to ground area for the 0 1 0 m soil depth the soil type was silt loam with a bulk density of 1 38 g cm 3 a field capacity of 0 30 m3 m 3 and a wilting point of 0 12 m3 m 3 over the entire growing season maize was border irrigated four times for the two years irrigation scheduling was presented in table 1 the grapevine yard was established in 1999 over an area of 400 ha grapevines vitis vinifera l cv merlot were planted at a spacing of 1 m between vines and 2 7 m between rows oriented east west the vines were trained to have two trunks at the surface of the ground shoots were trained to a vertical plane by three wires supported by a 1 5 m high trellis system as a vertical shoot positional training system i e maximum crop height of grapevine was 1 5 m soil was a light sandy loam with a mean bulk density of 1 47 g cm 3 to a depth of 1 0 m with a field capacity of 0 35 m3 m 3 and a wilting point of 0 17 m3 m 3 the vineyard was furrow irrigated with a 0 3 m deep trapeziform furrow on the south side of each vine row with surface and bottom widths of 1 0 and 0 9 m respectively the vineyard was irrigated four times during the growing season of 2009 and 2010 respectively irrigation scheduling was presented in table 1 the irrigation volume in each event was expressed as average for the entire vineyard area but inter furrow strips remained dry indicating that the irrigation intensity was higher where the vine roots were growing 2 2 flux measurements fluxes over maize and grapevine canopies were measured by two eddy covariance ec systems each ec system was installed in the center of experimental field of maize and grapevine north west wind is the predominant wind direction in this region and fetch length was adequate for ec measurement the sensors were installed 3 5 m and 2 2 m above the ground level for maize and grapevine canopies respectively the two ec systems had the same 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc utah usa and temperature and humidity sensor of measuring air temperature and relative humidity hmp45c vaisala inc helsinki finland a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific inc utah usa was instrumented over maize canopy and an open path h2o and co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc nebraska usa over grapevine canopy the two ec systems were intercalibrated before the experiment flux measurements were taken with a sampling frequency of 10 hz based on the covariance of the 10 hz air temperature and specific humidity with vertical wind velocity the latent heat flux in 30 min durations was computed using the eddy covariance methodology with the carboeurope recommendations using the edire software http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire more detailed instrumentation and fluxes corrections were described in ding et al 2010 2013 and guo et al 2014 daily and seasonal averaged air temperature and vpd were presented and summed in fig 1 and table 2 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively net radiation r n was measured by a net radiometer nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux delft netherlands were installed at a soil depth of 8 0 cm under both the plastic film and bare soil for maize field and both the ditch and ridge for grapevine soil temperature above each soil heat flux plate was measured using thermocouples at depths of 0 0 cm 2 0 cm and 6 0 cm soil water content swc from 0 to 10 0 cm was measured using soil moisture reflectometers envirosmart sentek sensor technologies sa australia for maize and soil moisture probes cs616 campbell scientific inc utah usa for grapevine all sensors were connected to a data logger

soil temperature and moisture above the transducers giambelluca et al 2009 2 3 other measurements lai is defined as green leaf area per unit ground area maize lai was manually measured and grape lai was estimated by using the relationship between leaf area and the number of shoots on each vine trunk because it was difficult for manual measurement of leaf area zhang et al 2012 specifically ten maize plants were randomly selected to measure lai at intervals of 10 days during the growing season leaf area was calculated by summing the rectangular area of each leaf leaf length maximum width multiplied by a shape factor of 0 74 a conversion factor obtained by analyzing the ratio of the rectangular area to the actual area measured by an am300 leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd uk

grapevine leaf area was determined every 3 7 days each time the number of shoots on each vine trunk was counted three shoots of each trunk were randomly chosen and all leaves on each shoot were classified into three categories by size and counted three leaves were collected to determine the average individual area of leaves in each category 2 4 parameters calculation and data analysis we

degree of stomatal control on Î»et the sensitivity of Î»et to gc was developed by mcnaughton and jarvis jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 through introducing a decoupling coefficient Ï which varies between 0 for perfect coupling with atmosphere and 1 0 for complete isolation when g a there is a high efficiency of heat and vapor transferring through the underlying

comparison of air temperature over maize and grapevine canopies daily air temperature over grapevine was slightly higher than that of maize for both years indicating that air was drier over grapevine canopy table 2 presented seasonal averaged air temperature was 18 5 and 19 3 c in 2009 and 19 2 and 20 2 c in 2010 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively vpd for both canopies varied in similar trends but maize canopy generally had a lower value varying from 0 to 1 8 kpa while grapevine canopy from 0 7 to 3 5 kpa fig 1b seasonal averaged vpd was 0 80 and 1 86 kpa in 2009 and 0 95 and 1 93 kpa in 2010 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively table 2 vpd represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere allen et al 1998 campbell and norman 1998 higher vpd over grapevine canopy indicated larger evaporative demand which might be due to different supply of vapor from underlying vegetation since the two experimental fields located on same climate zone li et al 2009 kool et al 2016 seasonal averaged u over maize canopy was lower than that of grapevine canopy with 1 07 and 1 45 m s 1 in 2009 and 1 38 and 1 58 m s 1 in 2010 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively table 2 so g a over grapevine canopy was higher than that of maize canopy because g a was proportional to u from eq 3 which suggested that grapevine canopy had a higher aerodynamical transfer for vapor these results indicated that grapevine canopy was rougher or had a larger roughness length resulting in a larger g a campbell and norman 1998 swc at the 0 1 0 m layer varied greatly during the whole growth seasons of maize and grapevine in 2009 and 2010 the variability of swc depended on precipitation and irrigation scheduling irrigation quota and timing fig 1c and table 1 lai of maize presented a greater variability than grapevine fig 1d maize lai was a bell shaped curve reaching the top of 4 5 m2 m 2 on august grapevine lai started from nearly 1 0 m2 m 2 keeping constant about 3 0 m2 m 2 except a sudden drop in early july due to pruning during the beginning stage lai of both maize and grapevine was low and there was only a very small difference between them maize canopy has higher lai than grapevine canopy since late june grapevine lai reached maximum during the late season stage while maize lai began to decrease 3 2 comparisons of energy components and energy partitioning energy balance closure ratio is a valuable index for evaluating the data quality of flux measurements fig 2 showed that energy balance closure ratios were above 0 7 over both canopies for both years which were similar with the previous studies ding et al 2010 li et al 2008 energy closure ratio was 0 78 from 8 experimental stations including forest grassland farmland of chinaflux li et al 2005 the possible reasons for the imbalanced energy have been discussed by many studies such as sampling problems a lack of consideration of canopy heat storage and other energy sources and sinks ding et al 2010 li et al 2008 twine et al 2000 some researchers suggested the energy balance gap should be closed and others did not recommend the forced closure baldocchi et al 2001 ding et al 2010 twine et al 2000 in this study two intercalibrated ec systems were used to measure energy components for two canopies which provided a common foundation for comparing flux measurements here we did not close the energy balance gap because our objective was to compare energy components and energy partitioning for two kinds of canopies r n is largely determined by solar radiation and is affected by surface albedo allen et al 1998 r n from the two types of canopy was close during the beginning and the end stages of growing seasons where soil surface was not fully covered and lai were not so comparable to each other fig 3 a soil surface in maize field was fully covered while grapevine yard was partial covered during the mid season stage thus r n over grapevine canopy was lower than that over maize canopy due to greater surface albedo green vegetation canopy has an albedo of about 0 20 0 25 while it is 0 18 0 35 for a dry bare soil campbell and norman 1998 jacobs and van pul 1990 presented that albedo of maize ranged within 0 18 0 22 pieri and gaudillÃ¨re 2003 indicated that leaf albedo of grapevine is constantly near 0 28 so higher leaf and soil albedo from sparse grapevine canopy resulted in lower net radiation than maize canopy under same incident solar radiation table 3 showed that monthly averaged r n over maize canopy was higher than that of grapevine canopy during the mid season growth stage thus closed maize canopy with less exposed soil generated higher net radiation than sparse and open grapevine canopy because the open canopy structure allows more exposed soil to experience greater incoming shortwave losses which was consistent with what reported by baldocchi 1994 soil heat flux is determined by coverage of exposed soil during the whole growth period both daily and monthly averaged g was higher for sparse grapevine canopy fig 3b table 3 soil heat flux accounted for 1 7 and 7 3 of net radiation in 2009 and 0 7 and 14 2 in 2010 respectively for maize and grapevine canopies seasonal averaged available energy r n g was higher for maize than grapevine with 125 0 and 85 6 w m 2 in 2009 and 121 9 and 99 5 w m 2 in 2010 respectively as presented in fig 3c Î»et from the two types of canopy was quite close to each other during the early growth stage Î»et over maize canopy was higher than grapevine canopy during the mid season growth stage seasonal averaged Î»et was higher for maize than grapevine with 100 8 and 59 4 w m 2 in 2009 and 94 4 and 54 0 w m 2 in 2010 respectively comparing to larger partitioning of available energy to Î»et grapevine canopy generated higher sensible heat flux fig 3d higher h s appeared during the early and late growth periods for both canopies generally main component of available energy was Î»et for both types of canopy seasonal averaged ratio of Î»et to available energy was 79 8 and 75 0 for maize and 62 3 and 59 8 for grapevine for both years respectively table 3 previous studies also presented that Î»et was main consumption component of available energy for many crops ding et al 2013 kool et al 2016 suyker and verma 2008 our result indicated that higher ratio of available energy is used in evapotranspiration for closed maize canopy than sparse grapevine canopy the occurrence of minus h s might be attributed to contribution of arid horizontal advection of sensible heat from dry upwind surfaces to wet maize canopy during the mid season growth stage in 2009 and 2010 the reasons and mechanisms of arid advection were discussed in ding et al 2015 daily Î² showed a higher value for grapevine canopy than maize canopy which was consistent with the result of energy partitioning fig 3e seasonal averaged Î² was 0 72 for grapevine canopy and 0 26 for maize canopy during the growth periods in 2009 and 2010 there were totally 17 days when Î² 1 over maize canopy and 52 days over grapevine canopy indicating that grapevine canopy dissipated more energy by sensible heat loss a larger Î² and higher t a were also documented in the previous study in this vineyard li et al 2009 kueppers et al 2007 found a regional irrigation cooling effect due to land cover and land use change our results indicated that the closed maize canopy with more irrigation water had lower Î² and t a than the sparse grapevine canopy with less irrigation water 3 3 comparisons of evapotranspiration and the priestley taylor coefficient daily et presented similar course during the whole growth periods for both crops fig 4 higher et over maize and grapevine canopy appeared on july and august and lower et appeared during the beginning and end stages the daily maximum et of maize canopy was 7 54 mm d 1 on july 23 2009 for grapevine canopy the maximum was 5 69 mm d 1 on july 27 2009 the drought in 2010 caused lower et due to lower soil water content fig 1d seasonal average et was 3 30 mm d 1 and 2 37 mm d 1 for the two years over maize grapevine and canopies respectively the stronger evapotranspiration rate over maize canopy was coordinated with the higher magnitude of Î»et the priestley taylor coefficient Î± for maize canopy was higher during the whole growth period fig 4b seasonal averaged Î± in the noon was 1 38 over maize canopy and 0 80 over grapevine canopy priestley and taylor 1972 reported that 1 26 was often regarded as a standard referred value for large wet surface there were 123 days for the two years when Î± 1 26 over maize canopy while only 16 days over grapevine canopy previous studies also reported a wider range of Î± jury and tanner 1975 flint and childs 1991 since Î± is defined as the ratio of Î»et Î»e q the magnitude of Î± was determined by both Î»et and Î»e q which was mainly controlled by r n higher maize Î± might be due to higher Î»et and lower r n in 2010 table 3 while lower grapevine Î± probably due to lower Î»et and higher r n these results indicated that grapevine was more controlled by physiological resistance while maize was limited by energy supply ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 3 4 comparisons of canopy conductance and decoupling coefficient seasonal variations of daily averaged g c was presented in fig 5 the results showed g c varied nearly from 1 to above 30 mm s 1 over maize canopy and from 0 to above 15 mm s 1 over grapevine canopy and higher g c appeared during the mid season stage for both years kelliher et al 1995 demonstrated that daily maximum g c was 32 5 mm s 1 for most crops with a wide range of lai suyker and verma 2008 indicated that daily g c was 20 30 mm s 1 in an irrigated maize for 2 years our findings of daily g c were within the ranges of those previous studies overall our results presented that g c for maize canopy was higher than that of grapevine canopy fig 5a indicating that maize leaf had a higher stomatal conductance maize canopy had higher Ï than grapevine canopy fig 5b the averaged Ï of maize canopy was 0 52 while it was only 0 30 over grapevine canopy for two years this result indicated that there was a strong couple between grapevine canopy and aero environment this result is quite consistent with g c values high Ï means a largely decoupling condition suggesting there is a weaker vapor transfer process over maize canopy the closed canopy may decrease the roughness of the surface so reduce the vapor and energy transfer efficiency decoupling coefficient was also used to evaluate the effect of meteorological factors vpd and r n vpd is more effective when Ï is close to 0 oppositely r n is effective on driving the evapotranspiration of crop canopy when Ï is close to 1 jia et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 in our study Ï of maize canopy varied from 0 06 to 0 98 while Ï of grapevine canopy varied from 0 05 to 0 62 thus though the influence of vpd and r n on both types of canopy was significant the difference of Ï showed that vpd was more effective on grapevine canopy and r n is more effective on maize canopy previous studies indicated that different ecosystems had varing Ï values a maximum Ï of 0 6 was reported by jia et al 2015 in a semi arid shrubland 0 5 was reported as a normal value of Ï over semi arid alfalfa and cotton canopies tolk et al 2006 0 21 was documented by kosugi et al 2007 over a temperate cypress forest canopy and a small midday Ï 0 12 in a tropical savanna was reported by rodrigues et al 2014 3 5 comparisons of physical and physiological controls of evapotranspiration the main meteorological factors controlling the transfer process of evapotranspiration are net radiation and vapor pressure deficit pereira et al 2015 net radiation decides the magnitude of available energy baldocchi 1994 we found that there were good linear relationships between Î»et and r n for both maize and grapevine canopies fig 6 but the slopes of linear regression between Î»et and r n were higher for maize canopy for both hourly and daily measurements indicating that maize et was largely determined by net radiation this result was in accordance with that of getting more net radiation for maize canopy in fig 3a the direct quantified effect of vpd on et parameter was not obvious data not shown both hourly and daily et was well linearly correlated with r n which provided a foundation for normalizing et using equilibrium evaporation the priestly taylor coefficient Î± to analyse the effect of other factors on et for both half hourly and daily time scales we found the relationship between Î± and g c was an exponential increase for both types of crop canopies fig 7 Î± significantly increased with the increased canopy conductance g c when g c 10 15 mm s 1 and gradually got constant when g c was over 15 mm s 1 on both canopies for both half hourly and daily time scales higher Î± appeared on maize canopy when g c was the same mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 indicated that canopy conductance affected et when gc 16 mm s 1 our results suggested that grapevine et was more controlled by g c than maize because most g c of grapevine was lower than the threshold of 15 mm s 1 which was in accordance with the analysis of decoupling coefficient in fig 5b previous studies indicated that different crops had a different threshold of the response to g c ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 implying that et for different type of crops was limited by either available energy or stomatal conductance our founding indicated that maize et was controlled by available energy and grapevine et by stomatal conductance fig 8 showed that Î± grew quickly with the increased lai when lai 2 8 m2 m 2 for both maize and grapevine canopies and kept constant when lai 2 8 m2 m 2 for maize canopy indicating that lai of 2 8 m2 m 2 can be used as the effective threshold affecting maize et previous studies reported a threshold of effective lai ranging within 2 5 3 0 m2 m 2 for given crops ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 full canopy cover would lead to no more increase of effective energy intercepted by crop canopy when lai was greater than the effective threshold so increased leaf area did not significantly increase et allen et al 1998 ding et al 2013 suyker and verma 2008 there were some lower Î± when lai was around 2 8 m2 m 2 at the maturity stage for grapevine canopy which might be because of leaf senescence and the decline of physiological function previous studies presented that leaf senescence could significantly decreases et for some crops due to different plant functional types and abiotic stress steduto and hsiao 1998 zhang et al 2010 the slope of linear regression between Î± and lai 2 8 m2 m 2 was higher for maize canopy indicating that maize et was more sensitive to lai these results suggested a lower water demand and larger physiological regulation of grapevine canopy while a higher water demand and larger physical regulation of maize canopy 4 conclusions to compare energy partitioning and evapotranspiration over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies in northwest china we measured energy exchanges and turbulent fluxes using eddy covariance technique and examined physical and physiological controlling factors during two growth seasons available energy r n g was higher for maize than grapevine canopies a higher energy partitioning of available energy to Î»et was found for maize canopy while air over grapevine canopy was drier higher evaporative demand and aerodynamical transfer the energy partitioning resulted in higher Î² for grapevine canopy 0 72 than maize canopy 0 26 g c and Ï for maize canopy was higher than grapevine higher Ï indicated maize et was more controlled by r n and grapevine et was more controlled by g c the response of maize et to lai had a threshold of 2 8 m2 m 2 but there was no explicit threshold for grapevine et these results are important for improving water management and developing sustainable agriculture across similar croplands

11483,energy exchanges and turbulent fluxes were simultaneously measured using eddy covariance technique over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies during two growth seasons in an arid region of northwest china canopy conductance g c and decoupling coefficient Ï were calculated to evaluate differences of fluxes and controlling factors over the two types of canopies atmosphere over grapevine canopy was drier higher evaporative demand and aerodynamical transfer than maize canopy because air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed over grapevine were higher seasonal averaged net radiation r n and soil heat flux g over maize canopy was higher and lower respectively than grapevine resulting in that averaged available energy r n g was higher for maize than grapevine canopies with 125 0 and 85 6 w m 2 in 2009 and 121 9 and 99 5 w m 2 in 2010 respectively energy partitioning of available energy to latent heat flux Î»et was higher for maize than grapevine canopies with seasonal averaged ratio of 79 8 and 75 0 for maize and 62 3 and 59 8 for grapevine for both years respectively seasonal averaged bowen ratio Î² was lower for maize than grapevine canopies with 0 26 and 0 72 respectively g c for maize canopy was higher than grapevine varying nearly from 1 to above 30 mm s 1 and from 0 to above 15 mm s 1 respectively Ï of maize canopy was higher than grapevine with averaged values of 0 52 and 0 30 respectively suggesting that there was a stronger coupling between grapevine canopy and the above air the slope of linear regression between evapotranspiration et and r n were higher for maize canopy indicating that maize et was mostly controlled by r n the relationship between the priestley taylor coefficient Î± and g c fits an exponential increase for both types of crop canopies suggesting that grapevine et was more controlled by g c because most grapevine g c was lower than the threshold of 15 mm s 1 the slope of linear regression between Î± and leaf area index lai 2 8 m2 m 2 was higher for maize canopy indicating that maize et was more sensitive to lai below the threshold these results are important for water management and agricultural sustainable development across similar croplands in arid regions keywords energy partitioning evapotranspiration canopy conductance decoupling coefficient canopy structure 1 introduction mass and energy transfer in terrestrial ecosystem is a complex process and has significant influence on global climate change baldocchi et al 2001 there were a number of studies examining water and heat fluxes for different underlying surfaces e g forests grassland and farmland baldocchi and meyers 1998 ding et al 2013 li et al 2005 they found that a main factor that affects fluxes of mass and energy was the roughness of underlying surface which is greatly decided by the structure of canopy therefore understanding how different canopies respond to meteorological conditions and what is the difference of physical and physiological regulations are necessary for characterizing and quantifying the governing processes of water and heat fluxes for different terrestrial surfaces and important for modelling terrestrial biosphere atmosphere interactions baldocchi 1994 denmead 1969 mcginn and king 1990 the transfer of water vapor and heat is controlled by the magnitude distribution and orientation of the crop canopy maize and grapevine herbal and woody crops respectively have different canopy structures and morphologies the two kinds of canopies have different traits leaf size and shape crown architecture canopy height and cover etc specifically maize has a maximum leaf area index lai of 6 0 m2 m 2 while grapevine has a maximum lai of 2 5 m2 m 2 lai of 3 0 m2 m 2 can be used as a threshold of canopy fully covering soil surface allen et al 1998 thus we distinguish two canopy types according to maximum lai and define closed and sparse canopies for maize and grapevine respectively the different canopy structures result in different functions and evapotranspiration et transfer of vapor from crop canopy to atmosphere crop et is important for computing crop water requirements for both irrigated and rainfed agriculture maize and grapevine are main cereal and commercial crops respectively in arid area of northwest china their water requirements are different and maize et is higher than grapevine ding et al 2013 li et al 2008 water scarcity in this area has brought about great stress on agricultural development kang et al 2004 thus how to arrange the planting patterns with different canopy structures influences local agricultural and social sustainability comparative study of water and heat fluxes of different canopy types is necessary for understanding and quantifying governing factors for different underlying surfaces and canopy structures baldocchi 1994 previous studies in this area analysed and modelled maize et variations ding et al 2013 li et al 2016 and investigated evaporative fraction et and carbon flux in vineyard li et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 guo et al 2014 however there are not yet studies that compared energy partitioning and

rearranged penman monteith equation to better quantify the relative control of available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux vapor pressure deficit and physiological resistance the priestley taylor pt coefficient which eliminated the weather influence and normalized et using equilibrium evaporation is usually used to evaluate the effect from different underlying canopy types lei and yang 2010 priestley and taylor 1972 shuttleworth and calder 1979 we use the approach as the framework for the quantitative description of controlling factors of crop et in this study the scientific questions addressed in this study are 1 what are the differences of energy components and energy partitioning over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies in northwest china 2 what are the differences of physical and physiological controlling factors for the two kinds of canopies in the area we hypothesize that a closed maize canopy has higher r n g and Î»et than sparse grapevine canopy due to smoother surface and higher lai and b grapevine one of woody crops was more controlled by physiological resistance therefore the main objectives of this paper were to compare the differences of mass and energy transfers and et and examine physical and physiological controlling factors over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental arrangement two experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 at maize field and grapevine yard respectively in the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university ding et al 2010 2013 guo et al 2014 the experimental site is located in wuwei city gansu province n37 52 e102 50 altitude 1581 m a typical continental temperate climate zone with mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and pan evaporation of 2000 mm maize field and grapevine yard had the same altitude and precipitation with the experimental station and the distance between them was close 3 0 km an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp usa at a height of 2 0 m above a standard grass surface 100 m from the experimental maize field was used to measure solar radiation and precipitation the accumulated precipitation was 93 5 mm and 54 3 mm during the whole growth seasons of maize and grapevine in 2009 and 2010 respectively monthly accumulated precipitation was 8 95 21 39 48 87 and 14 3 mm from june to september in 2009 25 9 6 13 6 11 1 97 and 14 19 mm from may to september in 2010 daily precipitation p was shown in fig 1 c maize was sown in the experimental field with a north south length of 700 m and an east west width of 300 m on april 21 and may 2 and harvested on september 28 and 26 in 2009 and 2010 respectively maximum crop height of maize was 3 0 m soil surface was partly covered with strips of plastic film with a width of 100 cm and 20 cm inserted into soil on each edge the bare soil where maize was not sown between plastic film strips was 65 cm maize seed was sown through 5 0 cm diameter holes in the plastic film with a row spacing of 50 cm and a plant spacing of 23 8 cm actual ground covered fraction was 0 5 in 2009 and 0 6 in 2010 respectively which was defined as one minus the ratio of the summed surface areas of bare soil and holes to ground area for the 0 1 0 m soil depth the soil type was silt loam with a bulk density of 1 38 g cm 3 a field capacity of 0 30 m3 m 3 and a wilting point of 0 12 m3 m 3 over the entire growing season maize was border irrigated four times for the two years irrigation scheduling was presented in table 1 the grapevine yard was established in 1999 over an area of 400 ha grapevines vitis vinifera l cv merlot were planted at a spacing of 1 m between vines and 2 7 m between rows oriented east west the vines were trained to have two trunks at the surface of the ground shoots were trained to a vertical plane by three wires supported by a 1 5 m high trellis system as a vertical shoot positional training system i e maximum crop height of grapevine was 1 5 m soil was a light sandy loam with a mean bulk density of 1 47 g cm 3 to a depth of 1 0 m with a field capacity of 0 35 m3 m 3 and a wilting point of 0 17 m3 m 3 the vineyard was furrow irrigated with a 0 3 m deep trapeziform furrow on the south side of each vine row with surface and bottom widths of 1 0 and 0 9 m respectively the vineyard was irrigated four times during the growing season of 2009 and 2010 respectively irrigation scheduling was presented in table 1 the irrigation volume in each event was expressed as average for the entire vineyard area but inter furrow strips remained dry indicating that the irrigation intensity was higher where the vine roots were growing 2 2 flux measurements fluxes over maize and grapevine canopies were measured by two eddy covariance ec systems each ec system was installed in the center of experimental field of maize and grapevine north west wind is the predominant wind direction in this region and fetch length was adequate for ec measurement the sensors were installed 3 5 m and 2 2 m above the ground level for maize and grapevine canopies respectively the two ec systems had the same 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc utah usa and temperature and humidity sensor of measuring air temperature and relative humidity hmp45c vaisala inc helsinki finland a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific inc utah usa was instrumented over maize canopy and an open path h2o and co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc nebraska usa over grapevine canopy the two ec systems were intercalibrated before the experiment flux measurements were taken with a sampling frequency of 10 hz based on the covariance of the 10 hz air temperature and specific humidity with vertical wind velocity the latent heat flux in 30 min durations was computed using the eddy covariance methodology with the carboeurope recommendations using the edire software http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire more detailed instrumentation and fluxes corrections were described in ding et al 2010 2013 and guo et al 2014 daily and seasonal averaged air temperature and vpd were presented and summed in fig 1 and table 2 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively net radiation r n was measured by a net radiometer nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux delft netherlands were installed at a soil depth of 8 0 cm under both the plastic film and bare soil for maize field and both the ditch and ridge for grapevine

was estimated by using the relationship between leaf area and the number of shoots on each vine trunk because it was difficult for manual measurement of leaf area zhang et al 2012 specifically ten maize plants were randomly selected to measure lai at intervals of 10 days during the growing season leaf area was calculated by summing the rectangular area of each leaf leaf length maximum width multiplied by a shape factor of 0 74 a conversion factor obtained by analyzing the ratio of the rectangular area to the actual area measured by an am300 leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd uk continuous lai was obtained by fitting observations using a single equation lai a tb exp r t where t is days after sowing r is a rate of lai change and a and b are fitted coefficients hashimoto 1990 grapevine leaf area was determined every 3 7 days each time the number of shoots on each vine trunk was counted three shoots of each trunk were randomly chosen and all leaves on each shoot were classified into three categories by size and counted three leaves were collected to determine the average individual area of leaves in each category 2 4 parameters calculation and data analysis we

comparison of air temperature over maize and grapevine canopies daily air temperature over grapevine was slightly higher than that of maize for both years indicating that air was drier over grapevine canopy table 2 presented seasonal averaged air temperature was 18 5 and 19 3 c in 2009 and 19 2 and 20 2 c in 2010 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively vpd for both canopies varied in similar trends but maize canopy generally had a lower value varying from 0 to 1 8 kpa while grapevine canopy from 0 7 to 3 5 kpa fig 1b seasonal averaged vpd was 0 80 and 1 86 kpa in 2009 and 0 95 and 1 93 kpa in 2010 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively table 2 vpd represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere allen et al 1998 campbell and norman 1998 higher vpd over grapevine canopy indicated larger evaporative demand which might be due to different supply of vapor from underlying vegetation since the two experimental fields located on same climate zone li et al 2009 kool et al 2016 seasonal averaged u over maize canopy was lower than that of grapevine canopy with 1 07 and 1 45 m s 1 in 2009 and 1 38 and 1 58 m s 1 in 2010 for maize and grapevine canopies respectively table 2 so g a over grapevine canopy was higher than that of maize canopy because g a was proportional to u from eq 3 which suggested that grapevine canopy had a higher aerodynamical transfer for vapor these results indicated that grapevine canopy was rougher or had a larger roughness length resulting in a larger g a campbell and norman 1998 swc at the 0 1 0 m layer varied greatly during the whole growth seasons of maize and grapevine in 2009 and 2010 the variability of swc depended on precipitation and irrigation scheduling irrigation quota and timing fig 1c and table 1 lai of maize presented a greater variability than grapevine fig 1d maize lai was a bell shaped curve reaching the top of 4 5 m2 m 2 on august grapevine lai started from nearly 1 0 m2 m 2 keeping constant about 3 0 m2 m 2 except a sudden drop in early july due to pruning during the beginning stage lai of both maize and grapevine was low and there was only a very small difference between them maize canopy has higher lai than grapevine canopy since late june grapevine lai reached maximum during the late season stage while maize lai began to decrease 3 2 comparisons of energy components and energy partitioning energy balance closure ratio is a valuable index for evaluating the data quality of flux measurements fig 2 showed that energy balance closure ratios were above 0 7 over both canopies for both years which were similar with the previous studies ding et al 2010 li et al 2008 energy closure ratio was 0 78 from 8 experimental stations including forest grassland farmland of chinaflux li et al 2005 the possible reasons for the imbalanced energy have been discussed by many studies such as sampling problems a lack of consideration of canopy heat storage and other energy sources and sinks ding et al 2010 li et al 2008 twine et al 2000 some researchers suggested the energy balance gap should be closed and others did not recommend the forced closure baldocchi et al 2001 ding et al 2010 twine et al 2000 in this study two intercalibrated ec systems were used to measure energy components for two canopies which provided a common foundation for comparing flux measurements here we did not close the energy balance gap because our objective was to compare energy components and energy partitioning for two kinds of canopies r n is largely determined by solar radiation and is affected by surface albedo allen et al 1998 r n from the two types of canopy was close during the beginning and the end stages of growing seasons where soil surface was not fully covered and lai were not so comparable to each other fig 3 a soil surface in maize field was fully covered while grapevine yard was partial covered during the mid season stage thus r n over grapevine canopy was lower than that over maize canopy due to greater surface albedo green vegetation canopy has an albedo of about 0 20 0 25 while it is 0 18 0 35 for a dry bare soil campbell and norman 1998 jacobs and van pul 1990 presented that albedo of maize ranged within 0 18 0 22 pieri and gaudillÃ¨re 2003 indicated that leaf albedo of grapevine is constantly near 0 28 so higher leaf and soil albedo from sparse grapevine canopy resulted in lower net radiation than maize canopy under same incident solar radiation table 3 showed that monthly averaged r n over maize canopy was higher than that of grapevine canopy during the mid season growth stage thus closed maize canopy with less exposed soil generated higher net radiation than sparse and open grapevine canopy because the open canopy structure allows more exposed soil to experience greater incoming shortwave losses which was consistent with what reported by baldocchi 1994 soil heat flux is determined by coverage of exposed soil during the whole growth period both daily and monthly averaged g was higher for sparse grapevine canopy fig 3b table 3 soil heat flux accounted for 1 7 and 7 3 of net radiation in 2009 and 0 7 and 14 2 in 2010 respectively for maize and grapevine canopies seasonal averaged available energy r n g was higher for maize than grapevine with 125 0 and 85 6 w m 2 in 2009 and 121 9 and 99 5 w m 2 in 2010 respectively as presented in fig 3c Î»et from the two types of canopy was quite close to each other during the early growth stage Î»et over maize canopy was higher than grapevine canopy during the mid season growth stage seasonal averaged Î»et was higher for maize than grapevine with 100 8 and 59 4 w m 2 in 2009 and 94 4 and 54 0 w m 2 in 2010 respectively comparing to larger partitioning of available energy to Î»et grapevine canopy generated higher sensible heat flux fig 3d higher h s appeared during the early and late growth periods for both canopies generally main component of available energy was Î»et for both types of canopy seasonal averaged ratio of Î»et to available energy was 79 8 and 75 0 for maize and 62 3 and 59 8 for grapevine for both years respectively table 3 previous studies also presented that Î»et was main consumption component of available energy for many crops ding et al 2013 kool et al 2016 suyker and verma 2008 our result indicated that higher ratio of available energy is used in evapotranspiration for closed maize canopy than sparse grapevine canopy the occurrence of minus h s might be attributed to contribution of arid horizontal advection of sensible heat from dry upwind surfaces to wet maize canopy during the mid season growth stage in 2009 and 2010 the reasons and mechanisms of arid advection were discussed in ding et al 2015 daily Î² showed a higher value for grapevine canopy than maize canopy which was consistent with the result of energy partitioning fig 3e seasonal averaged Î² was 0 72 for grapevine canopy and 0 26 for maize canopy during the growth periods in 2009 and 2010 there were totally 17 days when Î² 1 over maize canopy and 52 days over grapevine canopy indicating that grapevine canopy dissipated more energy by sensible heat loss a larger Î² and higher t a were also documented in the previous study in this vineyard li et al 2009 kueppers et al 2007 found a regional irrigation cooling effect due to land cover and land use change our results indicated that the closed maize canopy with more irrigation water had lower Î² and t a than the sparse grapevine canopy with less irrigation water 3 3 comparisons of evapotranspiration and the priestley taylor coefficient daily et presented similar course during the whole growth periods for both crops fig 4 higher et over maize and grapevine canopy appeared on july and august and lower et appeared during the beginning and end stages the daily maximum et of maize canopy was 7 54 mm d 1 on july 23 2009 for grapevine canopy the maximum was 5 69 mm d 1 on july 27 2009 the drought in 2010 caused lower et due to lower soil water content fig 1d seasonal average et was 3 30 mm d 1 and 2 37 mm d 1 for the two years over maize grapevine and canopies respectively the stronger evapotranspiration rate over maize canopy was coordinated with the higher magnitude of Î»et the priestley taylor coefficient Î± for maize canopy was higher during the whole growth period fig 4b seasonal averaged Î± in the noon was 1 38 over maize canopy and 0 80 over grapevine canopy priestley and taylor 1972 reported that 1 26 was often regarded as a standard referred value for large wet surface there were 123 days for the two years when Î± 1 26 over maize canopy while only 16 days over grapevine canopy previous studies also reported a wider range of Î± jury and tanner 1975 flint and childs 1991 since Î± is defined as the ratio of Î»et Î»e q the magnitude of Î± was determined by both Î»et and Î»e q which was mainly controlled by r n higher maize Î± might be due to higher Î»et and lower r n in 2010 table 3 while lower grapevine Î± probably due to lower Î»et and higher r n these results indicated that grapevine was more controlled by physiological resistance while maize was limited by energy supply ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 3 4 comparisons of canopy conductance and decoupling coefficient seasonal variations of daily averaged g c was presented in fig 5 the results showed g c varied nearly from 1 to above 30 mm s 1 over maize canopy and from 0 to above 15 mm s 1 over grapevine canopy and higher g c appeared during the mid season stage for both years kelliher et al 1995 demonstrated that daily maximum g c was 32 5 mm s 1 for most crops with a wide range of lai suyker and verma 2008 indicated that daily g c was 20 30 mm s 1 in an irrigated maize for 2 years our findings of daily g c were within the ranges of those previous studies overall our results presented that g c for maize canopy was higher than that of grapevine canopy fig 5a indicating that maize leaf had a higher stomatal conductance maize canopy had higher Ï than grapevine canopy fig 5b the averaged Ï of maize canopy was 0 52 while it was only 0 30 over grapevine canopy for two years this result indicated that there was a strong couple between grapevine canopy and aero environment this result is quite consistent with g c values high Ï means a largely decoupling condition suggesting there is a weaker vapor transfer process over maize canopy the closed canopy may decrease the roughness of the surface so reduce the vapor and energy transfer efficiency decoupling coefficient was also used to evaluate the effect of meteorological factors vpd and r n vpd is more effective when Ï is close to 0 oppositely r n is effective on driving the evapotranspiration of crop canopy when Ï is close to 1 jia et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 in our study Ï of maize canopy varied from 0 06 to 0 98 while Ï of grapevine canopy varied from 0 05 to 0 62 thus though the influence of vpd and r n on both types of canopy was significant the difference of Ï showed that vpd was more effective on grapevine canopy and r n is more effective on maize canopy previous studies indicated that different ecosystems had varing Ï values a maximum Ï of 0 6 was reported by jia et al 2015 in a semi arid shrubland 0 5 was reported as a normal value of Ï over semi arid alfalfa and cotton canopies tolk et al 2006 0 21 was documented by kosugi et al 2007 over a temperate cypress forest canopy and a small midday Ï 0 12 in a tropical savanna was reported by rodrigues et al 2014 3 5 comparisons of physical and physiological controls of evapotranspiration the main meteorological factors controlling the transfer process of evapotranspiration are net radiation and vapor pressure deficit pereira et al 2015 net radiation decides the magnitude of available energy baldocchi 1994 we found that there were good linear relationships between Î»et and r n for both maize and grapevine canopies fig 6 but the slopes of linear regression between Î»et and r n were higher for maize canopy for both hourly and daily measurements indicating that maize et was largely determined by net radiation this result was in accordance with that of getting more net radiation for maize canopy in fig 3a the direct quantified effect of vpd on et parameter was not obvious data not shown both hourly and daily et was well linearly correlated with r n which provided a foundation for normalizing et using equilibrium evaporation the priestly taylor coefficient Î± to analyse the effect of other factors on et for both half hourly and daily time scales we found the relationship between Î± and g c was an exponential increase for both types of crop canopies fig 7 Î± significantly increased with the increased canopy conductance g c when g c 10 15 mm s 1 and gradually got constant when g c was over 15 mm s 1 on both canopies for both half hourly and daily time scales higher Î± appeared on maize canopy when g c was the same mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 indicated that canopy conductance affected et when gc 16 mm s 1 our results suggested that grapevine et was more controlled by g c than maize because most g c of grapevine was lower than the threshold of 15 mm s 1 which was in accordance with the analysis of decoupling coefficient in fig 5b previous studies indicated that different crops had a different threshold of the response to g c ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 implying that et for different type of crops was limited by either available energy or stomatal conductance our founding indicated that maize et was controlled by available energy and grapevine et by stomatal conductance fig 8 showed that Î± grew quickly with the increased lai when lai 2 8 m2 m 2 for both maize and grapevine canopies and kept constant when lai 2 8 m2 m 2 for maize canopy indicating that lai of 2 8 m2 m 2 can be used as the effective threshold affecting maize et previous studies reported a threshold of effective lai ranging within 2 5 3 0 m2 m 2 for given crops ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 full canopy cover would lead to no more increase of effective energy intercepted by crop canopy when lai was greater than the effective threshold so increased leaf area did not significantly increase et allen et al 1998 ding et al 2013 suyker and verma 2008 there were some lower Î± when lai was around 2 8 m2 m 2 at the maturity stage for grapevine canopy which might be because of leaf senescence and the decline of physiological function previous studies presented that leaf senescence could significantly decreases et for some crops due to different plant functional types and abiotic stress steduto and hsiao 1998 zhang et al 2010 the slope of linear regression between Î± and lai 2 8 m2 m 2 was higher for maize canopy indicating that maize et was more sensitive to lai these results suggested a lower water demand and larger physiological regulation of grapevine canopy while a higher water demand and larger physical regulation of maize canopy 4 conclusions to compare energy partitioning and evapotranspiration over closed maize and sparse grapevine canopies in northwest china we measured energy exchanges and turbulent fluxes using eddy covariance technique and examined physical and physiological controlling factors during two growth seasons available energy r n g was higher for maize than grapevine canopies a higher energy partitioning of available energy to Î»et was found for maize canopy while air over grapevine canopy was drier higher evaporative demand and aerodynamical transfer the energy partitioning resulted in higher Î² for grapevine canopy 0 72 than maize canopy 0 26 g c and Ï for maize canopy was higher than grapevine higher Ï indicated maize et was more controlled by r n and grapevine et was more controlled by g c the response of maize et to lai had a threshold of 2 8 m2 m 2 but there was no explicit threshold for grapevine et these results are important for improving water management and developing sustainable agriculture across similar croplands

11484,water is the major factor limiting crop production in semi arid regions of the southern and central us high plains the ogallala aquifer is the major source of irrigation water in the region the water levels in the aquifer have been declining due to water withdrawals for irrigation exceeding mean annual recharge as a result some of the wells in the region are not able to meet the crop water requirements due to lower irrigation capacity ic grain sorghum one of the major crops grown in western kansas is considered drought tolerant there is limited literature on the effect of ic on grain sorghum yield under erratic rainfall patterns of the semi arid high plains study objectives were to 1 evaluate the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm for assessing grain sorghum yield and water productivity 2 develop grain sorghum water production functions under five different ic two cultivars and three irrigation scheduling strategies and 3 evaluate response of grain sorghum under various ic in western kansas based on long term historical weather 4 to determine the minimum irrigation capacity required for irrigating grain sorghum in western kansas a calibrated and validated late maturing cultivar in prior study was used while measured yield and phenology data of an early maturing cultivar was used to evaluate an existing cultivar in dssat model results showed that the cultivar in dssat were representative of the cultivars in the field with normalized root mean square of error nrmse 18 index of agreement i of 0 97 and percent of deviation d 19 to 29 the corresponding statistical goodness of fit values for days to flowering was 12 0 99 and 0 17 respectively overall the simulated yield and phenology values agreed with the measured indicating the satisfactory simulation performance of the model highest yield crop water productivity and irrigation water use efficiencies were obtained from ic of 2 5 3 6 mm day under the irrigation scheduling strategies from panicle initiation to grain filling however long term simulation showed that the minimum ic for growing grain sorghum varied depending on the minimum yield goal to be met based on long term perspective in some wet years lower ic up to 1 7 mm day or even in some of the wettest years no irrigation was suitable our findings indicate that it might not be necessary to irrigate grain sorghum from planting to maturity but if producers are forced to do so by climatic conditions an ic of 1 7 2 5 mm day was found to produce a yield of at least 5 t ha similar to that of 5 mm day ic in 75 of the long term growing seasons if producers have to irrigate grain sorghum from panicle initiation to maturity the 2 5 mm day ic was found to be adequate to meet a minimum yield goal of 5 t ha in 3 out of 4 years based on soils and long term average climate around western kansas ic of 3 6 mm day was found to be adequate if producers wish to irrigate only from panicle initiation to grain filling to meet a minimum yield goal of 6 t ha in 75 90 of the long term seasons keywords irrigation capacity production function dssat grain sorghum ogallala 1 introduction agriculture is the economic backbone of kansas however crop production in the semi arid western part of the state is limited by crop water stress to achieve potential yield irrigation is needed in most years the ogallala aquifer is the main source of irrigation water in this region numerous studies have shown that the aquifer water levels are declining and will cause significant negative socio economic consequences if water is not used efficiently and sustainably rogers and lamm 2012 https www scientificamerican com article the ogallala aquifer lamm et al 2007 noted that many wells in western kansas have insufficient capacity to meet full crop water requirements grain sorghum is one of the main crops grown in western kansas rogers et al 2003 grain sorghum is relatively tolerant to drought compared to other cereal crops wani et al 2012 many studies have shown that grain sorghum is well suited to water limited semi arid areas like western kansas lamm et al 2007 aiken et al 2015 kisekka et al 2016 and can be grown as a companion crop to high water consumptive crops like corn in order to optimize crop water use klocke et al 2012 it is imperative to know the response of grain sorghum to various ic and understand the minimal irrigation system capacity considering erratic rainfall conditions and yield goals understanding the response of grain sorghum to various ic could help to optimize land water allocation and cropping pattern reduce the cost of production improve profitability increase the water use efficiency and enhance the sustainability of the aquifer producers can increase or decrease irrigated area depending on the irrigation well capacity and by assessing the possible yield or economic returns from different ic which are a function of land water allocation previous and current grain sorghum irrigation studies conducted at the kansas state university southwest research extension center near garden city are shortterm limited to three to five years klocke et al 2012 kisekka et al 2016 klocke et al 2012 imposed five different levels of stress in relation to non stressed treatment full irrigation and found that the least irrigated grain sorghum treatment was able to use more stored soil water compared to the fully irrigated and mild stressed treatments they reported that the least yield was found to correspond with about 90 of the fully irrigated treatment which indicated that grain sorghum might be best suited for low ic klocke et al 2012 kisekka et al 2016 reported no significant differences between fully irrigated treatments and deficit irrigated treatment from a multisite grain sorghum irrigation study these studies were important for understanding grain sorghum yield response to irrigation but did not include long term inter decadal variations in climate and their influence on grain sorghum response to water in this study we assess the effect of ic on grain sorghum when irrigation initiated at planting versus when irrigation is initiated at panicle initiation for two widely used grain sorghum cultivars in western kansas the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the dssat csm hereafter dssat model for simulating grain sorghum growth and development in semi arid western kansas 2 apply the evaluated model to generate grain sorghum production functions for five different ic as a function of irrigation scheduling and cultivars short versus long season and 3 evaluate response of grain sorghum under various ic in western kansas under variable climate using long term historical weather data 4 determine the minimum irrigation capacity required for irrigating grain sorghum in western kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the kansas state university southwest research extension center near garden city kansas with the geographical location of 38 1 20 87 n 100 49 26 95 w and elevation of 887 m above mean sea level the climate is semiarid with the main growing season for grain sorghum between may and october the estimated long term 1950 2013 annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration based on fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 were approximately 455 mm and 1405 mm respectively the average maximum and minimum air temperature between may to october were reported to be 28 3 and 12 3 c respectively with frost free period of about 170 days klocke et al 2012 ulysses silt loam is the major soil type in the study site with bulk density of 1 36 g cm3 and field capacity wilting point and water content at saturation of 0 33 0 15 and 0 46 mm mm respectively klocke et al 2012 2 2 agronomic management grain sorghum was planted after the top 5 10 cm soil temperature reached at least 16 c or above fig 1 germination of grain sorghum is halted if temperatures are below 15 c wani et al 2012 according to fig 1 on an average after day of year doy 136 is a suitable time for planting grain sorghum other criteria such as initial soil moisture were also considered 60 70 planting date was set in the model to be june 15th two cultivars were considered for scenario analysis late long 120 140 days and early short 90 110 days maturing cultivars based on local practices plant population was assumed to be 18 plants per m2 and nitrogen applied was 102 kg n ha time of application of n was 22 kg at time of planting and 80 kg n ha a month after planting irrigation was applied using a center pivot sprinkler with assumed irrigation efficiency of 90 the treatments included two cultivars late and early maturing three irrigation scheduling scenarios irrigated from 1 planting to maturity 2 panicle initiation to grain filling and 3 panicle initiation to maturity table 1 normally the decision to apply irrigation may depend on the irrigation needed cost or yield goal or combinations of many factors the longer the time it takes for a center pivot to irrigate the planted area the more the crop suffers from water stress the well pumping capacity determines how many hectares of cropped land can be successfully irrigated during a growing season in this study for each cultivar grain sorghum yield was simulated under different ics the ic treatments were rainfed 0 0 mm day or dryland 1 7 mm day 25 mm in 15 days 2 5 mm day 25 mm in 10 days 3 6 mm day 25 mm in 7 days and 5 0 mm day 25 mm in 5 days table 1 in addition a treatment with fixed irrigation amount 25 mm based on threshold levels 50 of the maximum available soil water with sprinkler irrigation efficiency of 90 was scheduled from planting to maturity since irrigation was applied as required from planting to maturity this treatment corresponded to full irrigation the full irrigation and the dryland rainfed treatments were assumed to represent the upper and lower yield boundaries of grain sorghum in the study area respectively long term 1950 2013 yield based on all treatments were arranged from highest to lowest and probability of exceedance p were calculated based on raes et al 1996 2006 the yield and corresponding probabilities for all ics evaluated were then plotted and compared in order to set the minimum irrigation capacity for growing grain sorghum selected minimum simulated yield goals 5 5 5 and 6 t ha were set for dry climate season at three different probability of exceedances p 75 90 and 100 as it might vary with producer s interest minimum yield levels that correspond to dry seasons were selected in this study in order to minimize impacts of rainfall and soil water fluctuation on yield and ic accordingly the amount of water needed for grain sorghum for the selected yield levels in the season was assumed to be met mainly from irrigation another advantage of implementing this approach is that the method addresses issues related to irrigation scheduling techniques e g setting a trigger thresholds because i yields from dry season are selected as baseline criteria for determining minimum irrigation capacity for grain sorghum ii losses such as drainage and runoff under all ics and irrigation scheduling scenarios were also estimated and compared with the dryland and full irrigation treatments the upper fully irrigated and lower rainfed boundary of yield levels simulated based on fully irrigation as required and dryland were used to determine how far the yield levels simulated based on the various ics would deviate in relation to the two treatments in addition long term average et irrigation need yield irrigation water use efficiency and crop water productivity under the various irrigation and rainfed treatments were compared to evaluate the performance of grain sorghum under the various ics 2 3 model evaluation the dssat model jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2012 2015 was calibrated and evaluated for late season cultivar in prior study araya et al 2017 the model performance was evaluated for yield biomass phenology and et of grain sorghum at the study site araya et al 2017 in addition the average yield and phenology data of cultivars obtained from irrigated crop performance tests 2008 2017 available in http www agronomy k state edu services crop performance tests grainsorghum index html accessed in january 2018 were also obtained many of the cultivars grown during the experimental period in 2008 2009 2012 and 2013 were believed to be typical early short maturing cultivars the soils are similar to those of the experimental cultivar presented in araya et al 2017 the crop performance tests were conducted on silt loam soils dominant soils around garden city kansas with field capacity and wilting point of approximately 33 and 15 vol respectively planting was carried out between 1st 5th of june and nitrogen was assumed non limiting during the growing season in 2008 2013 there were two water treatments rainfed and irrigated treatments irrigation was applied as required and set in the model as non limiting grain sorghum cultivars in dssat were evaluated to determine if any of the cultivars in the dssat database represented the cultivars in the performance tests in terms of yield and phenology we were limited to searching a matching cultivar from the dssat crop databases based on yield and phenology because i the cultivars were already calibrated and evaluated possibly for many parameters before they were included into the database ii our available measured crop performance test data was limited to yield and phenology the measured yield and phenological values of the early maturing cultivar were evaluated against the simulated data of the selected matching cultivar in

cultivars grown during majority of growing seasons 2008 2009 2012 and 2013 in terms of phenology and yield when exposed to soil climate and management conditions of the study site 2 4 yield irrigation crop water use efficiencies crop water productivities and crop water production functions the long term 1950 2013 average yield under each irrigation capacity was calculated and production functions were developed between yield and ic developing relationships between yield and ic could help to estimate the possible grain sorghum yield levels under a given ic in addition relationships were developed between irrigated yield without dryland y d and irrigation water use efficiency iwp d irrigation crop water use efficiency iwp d in kg m3 was calculated as irrigated yield without dryland divided by the average amount of irrigation applied this was done to understand the impacts of irrigation on improving grain sorghum yield and assess how that amount of irrigation water was efficiently utilized to produce that amount of yield similarly the relationship between ic and crop water productivities were also assessed for the two grain sorghum cultivar crop water productivity cwp was calculated as yield divided by the seasonal crop evapotranspiration et the relationship could be used to guide irrigation scheduling under different ics the relationship between yield versus crop evapotranspiration under the three different irrigation scheduling scenarios 1 3 for both early and late maturing cultivars was also assessed for comparisons purposes we also used crop water production function for grain sorghum developed based on experimental studies klocke et al 2012 2014 and also based on yield using long term data as simulated with dssat 3 results 3 1 model evaluation dssat was calibrated and evaluated for late maturing grain sorghum cultivar in prior study araya et al 2017 in this study the early maturing cultivar tx 610 in dssat was evaluated and found to match the crop performance test cultivars 2008 2013 in terms of phenology and yield the nrmse and i of the measured and simulated yield were 18 and 0 97 respectively table 2 the percent deviation d between the simulated and measured yield ranged from 19 to 29 which was satisfactory similarly the nrmse and i values between the measured and simulated days to flowering were 12 and 0 99 respectively the d values also ranged from 0 to 17 therefore we believe that the cultivar in the model tx 610 represents the tested genotypes in the field the genetic coefficients of late and early maturing cultivars in dssat are presented in table 3 3 2 effect of irrigation capacity on yield uncertainty yield probabilities across the 64 1950 2013 years for the various irrigation strategies and ic indicated substantial difference among ic the 50 probability of exceedance of yield for late and early maturing cultivars under ic 0 mm day rainfed was 4 5 and 4 1 t ha respectively figs 2a d and 3a d there were also substantial yield differences among the various ic treatments of the same cultivar figs 2c d and 3c d similarly there was substantial deviations in yield under p of 50 and 75 for ic 0 1 7 and 2 5 mm day when compared to ic of 3 6 and 5 mm day figs 2c d and 3c d however the simulated yield levels between the early and late cultivars for the same irrigation capacity treatment were not very different for both cultivars grain sorghum responded well to 25 mm every 10 days ic 2 5 mm days and 15 days ic 1 7 mm days interval there was no significant difference in yield for both cultivars between ic of 5 mm day and 3 6 mm day among all irrigation scheduling scenarios these irrigation treatments were not substantially different from the fully irrigated treatment either the minimum ic for grain sorghum was found to be 1 7 2 5 mm day when the producer s goal was to meet at least 5 t ha in 75 of the long term growing seasons table 4 the minimum ic was even able to achieve the yield goal by applying irrigation scheduling scenario 2 the minimum ic could change if the yield goal is increased or decreased and if probability of success of meeting that yield level is set high or low for example the minimum ic to achieve a yield goal at least 6 t ha in 100 of the long term growing seasons is 3 6 mm day table 4 with timing of irrigation from panicle initiation to grain filling ic of 2 5 mm day might help stabilize yield in meeting at least 6 t ha in 100 of the growing season if irrigation scheduling scenario 1 irrigating grain sorghum from planting to maturity is applied however irrigating from planting to maturity could take significant amount of irrigation water depending on the length of growing period of that cultivar 3 3 grain sorghum yield and irrigation capacity for late maturing cultivar the average long term 1950 2013 grain sorghum yield under dryland was very low 4 5 t ha when compared to irrigated conditions fig 4 a there was small difference among the average long term yields of the various ic treatments although were not significant the relationship between yield and ic was a curvilinear yield slightly increased from lower to higher ic only when irrigation was limited to the period between panicle initiation to grain filling for late season cultivar average yield for irrigation from panicle initiation to grain filling was slightly lower than those other irrigated treatments with the exception for ic 5 mm day fig 4a the dryland yield of the early maturing cultivar was significantly lower than those irrigated treatments fig 4b however there was no substantial difference among the average yields of the different ics for example despite the highest irrigation application under ic 5 mm day the yield level was not significantly improved when compared with the other irrigated treatments yield under ic 1 7 and 2 5 mm day when applied at panicle initiation to grain filling was slightly lower than that under 3 6 and 5 mm day fig 4a b grain sorghum yield peaked when grain sorghum was irrigated under ic of 2 5 3 6 mm day fig 4a b the relationship between yield and ic was found to be a quadratic polynomial with r2 of 0 90 fig 4a b yield under ics of 2 5 and 1 7 mm day with irrigation scheduling scenarios 2 were slightly low compared to those of the corresponding levels of ic for irrigation scheduling scenario 1 and 3 whereas there was no much difference in yield under treatment with ic of 3 6 and 5 mm day regardless of the irrigation scheduling scenarios fig 4a b 3 4 relationship between irrigation capacity irrigation amount drainage and yield this study showed the low response of grain sorghum to higher irrigation applications fig 5 there was no substantial difference in yield between irrigation scheduling scenarios iss with 200 and 400 mm this indicates that higher irrigation application beyond 200 mm may not result in significantly higher yield average yield under the different ic increased with irrigation up to 200 230 mm and subsequently decreased with increase in irrigation fig 6 there was also curvilinear relationship between yield and irrigation fig 6 the average drainage losses at point when yield peaked was about 50 mm fig 6 yield did not increase with further increase in irrigation as grain sorghum water need was already met and thus majority of applied irrigation water was lost as drainage under higher irrigations beyond 250 mm there was strong linear relationship between drainage and irrigation after maximum yield was reached fig 6 drainage was high under ic of 5 mm day compared to the other ics fig 7 in contrast the lowest drainage was simulated for ic 0 and 1 7 mm day fig 7 the highest drainage loss was simulated when irrigation was applied from planting to maturity while the lowest was simulated when irrigation was applied from panicle initiation to grain filling fig 7 this study showed that it was difficult to avoid drainage if maximum yield is intended even in conditions when producers are using fixed automatic irrigation based on certain thresholds for example for one of the full irrigation treatment where irrigation was applied based on certain thresholds 50 available soil water threshold the drainage loss reached up to 80 mm caused in season rainfall that might occur after an irrigation event 3 5 irrigation water use efficiencies iwp d crop water productivity cwp and irrigation capacity the average irrigated yield without dryland y d substantially varied with irrigation scheduling scenarios the y d in treatments with irrigation scheduling scenario 2 under ic 1 7 and 2 5 mm day was slightly lower than those treatments with irrigation scheduling scenario 1 and 3 the quantitative relationship between y d and iwp d for late and early maturing grain sorghum cultivars is presented in fig 8 a b the figures show that irrigation scheduling scenario 2 were more productive in terms of water use than irrigation scheduling scenario 1 except under lower ic fig 8a b the y d values vary from 1 3 to 2 5 t ha the corresponding iwp d values were 2 4 and 1 7 kg m3 respectively the highest average yi d 2 4 2 5 t ha corresponded to iwp d of approximately 1 5 1 7 kg m3 fig 8a b there was substantial difference in cwp among the irrigation scheduling scenarios 1 3 the average cwp varied from 11 6 kg ha mm for ic 0 mm day dryland to 14 6 kg ha mm for ic of 3 6 mm day fig 9 a for the late maturing cultivar the relationship between cwp and ic for irrigation scheduling scenarios 1 2 and 3 are expressed in the form of quadratic polynomial equations fig 9a with r2 of above 0 72 cwp increased with ic up to 2 5 mm day for irrigation scheduling scenario 3 and up to 3 6 mm day for irrigation scheduling scenario 2 and the least was for 1 7 mm day for irrigation scheduling scenario 1 fig 9a the cwp for early maturing cultivar under dryland was slightly lower than that of the late maturing cultivar the cwp for early maturing cultivar ranged from 11 6 kg ha mm under dryland to 14 4 kg ha mm under ic of 3 6 mm day fig 9b similar to the late maturing cultivar the relationship between cwp and ic was quadratic polynomial with r2 of 0 8 6 fig 9b 3 6 yield versus crop evapotranspiration et production functions the relationship between yield and et of grain sorghum under various ic and irrigation management strategies is presented in fig 10 a b and table 5 the lowest threshold et that corresponds to above zero yield simulated in our rainfed treatment was approximately 150 mm yield was linearly related to et fig 10a b table 5 the lowest et produced the lowest yield but the highest et did not result in the highest yield fig 10a b there was no substantial difference in grain sorghum yield among the ic of 3 6 and 5 mm day for all irrigations scheduling scenarios fig 10a b for irrigations scheduling scenario 2 the ic of 5 mm day produced the highest yield for both cultivars but was not significantly different from ic of 3 6 mm day the relationship between yield and et varied with ic and irrigation scheduling scenario but the majority of the data showed an r2 of 0 50 table 5 however the relationship was slightly stronger under irrigations scheduling scenario 2 r2 0 60 compared to that of 1 and 3 r2 0 50 fig 10a b table 5 the results of the yield versus crop water use production functions based on experimental studies in the past for the same and other sites was also partially in agreement with this study 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation the short season cultivar had moderate statistical goodness of fit values nrmse of 18 d of 19 to 29 and i of 0 97 for yield these values were slightly better than those reported in akinseye et al 2017 and lopez et al 2017 the days to flowering were also adequately simulated with nrmse of 12 d of 0 17 and i of 0 99 but were less accurate when compared to those reported in lopez et al 2017 according to soler et al 2007 nrmse values of 18 can be taken as good performance of the model in simulating grain sorghum yield similarly i of above 0 97 is considered excellent agreement based on liu et al 2013 overall the statistical goodness of fit showed that early maturing cultivar in dssat tx 610 satisfactorily represented the yield and phenology of cultivars under the crop performance tests at the ksu swrec near garden city kansas 4 2 iwp d versus y d there relationship between yi d and iwp d was curvilinear with r2 of 0 96 0 99 the relationships showed that the y d values could be as low as 1 3 t ha and as high as 2 5 t ha which corresponded to iwp d values of 2 4 and 1 7 kg m3 respectively this indicates that the rate of increase in yield due to added irrigation water decreased with further increase in irrigation implying that the irrigation water was less efficiently used by the crop when high irrigation water 200 mm was applied iwp d was high when irrigation scheduling scenario 2 was applied for both cultivars which could be due to the high response of grain sorghum to irrigation water at the most sensitive stage of growth the highest iwp d was correlated with the lowest y d this was due to the increased efficiency of water utilization by the crop when water is constraint compared to the relatively lower efficiency of water utilization by the crop when water is available in sufficient amount as some of the water could be drained or evaporated the optimal irrigation capacity for both cultivars should be the level at which high yield is achieved at higher iwp d which corresponded to ic of 2 5 3 6 mm day under irrigation scheduling scenario 2 iwp d of grain sorghum slightly decreased with increase in ic when irrigation scheduling scenario 1 was used one of the reasons for this could be due to less response of grain sorghum to increasing irrigation water for example grain sorghum was reported to be less responsive to water klocke et al 2012 compared to crops such as corn in western kansas lamm et al 2007 araya et al 2017 araya et al 2016 used a simulation model to estimate the biomass and grain per unit of water supply under various climate water availability and soil conditions in western kansas they found that biomass and grain per unit of water supply decreased with the increase in total water supply the nature of the soils in the study area might have also partially contributed to the decrease of the biomass and grain per unit of water supply with increase in ic because water holding capacity of silt loam soils is much higher than many other coarser textured soils in addition with the increase in water supply the water loss as drainage or evaporation may increase and thus contribute to reduction in yield and biomass per unit of water supply in the texas high plains tolk and howell 2003 also reported the curvilinear relationship between water supply and grain sorghum yield which indicates the more irrigation water applied to grain sorghum the lesser the iwp d iwp d of grain sorghum simulated with irrigation scheduling scenario 1 was lower than that of 2 this could be because grain sorghum is very sensitive to water stress from panicle initiation to early grain filling wani et al 2012 panicle size and grain number may be severely affected if water stress occurred during panicle initiation wani et al 2012 reported that water stress at flowering early and late grain filling may result in pollination failure abortion of grain formation and smaller grain size respectively water stress at later grain filling may also enhance premature senescence wani et al 2012 hammer et al 2010 reviewed that grain number is a function of biomass conditions at the time of panicle initiation to start of grain filling whereas the grain size is determined by the distribution of assimilates during grain filling period assefa et al 2010 reported that yield losses due to water stress at reproductive stages may even go beyond 55 irrigation scheduling scenario 1 is not a right choice for grain sorghum because yield was low and irrigation water was not efficiently used by the crop when compared to other irrigation scheduling scenarios 2 and 3 grain sorghum was reported to be less sensitive to water stress especially during the early vegetative and late growth stages doorenbos and kassam 1979 4 3 crop water productivity and yield versus crop water use production functions crop water productivity of grain sorghum on average increased with the increase in ic and peaked at 3 6 mm day and gradually started to decrease thereafter this was because water losses through drainage and evaporation slightly increased with increase in ic in many studies crop water use et was strongly related to yield doorenbos and kassam 1979 kisekka et al 2016 while yield is curve linearly related to irrigation water tolk and howell 2003 klocke et al 2014 araya et al 2016 because over irrigation can cause yield decrease klocke et al 2012 due to leaching of nutrients and aeration stress soil evaporation may increase with an increase in crop water use which might contribute to reducing the cwp at high ic the cwp of grain sorghum in treatment with irrigation scheduling scenario 2 was slightly higher than that of grain sorghum under irrigation scheduling scenario 3 we found that cwp across each year from 1950 to 2013 were slightly smaller for irrigation scheduling scenario 1 and 3 compared to irrigation scheduling scenario 2 average cwp ranged from 11 6 kg ha mm under 0 mm day dryland to up to 14 6 kg ha mm under ic of 3 6 mm day these cwp value are slightly higher than those reported by hadebe et al 2017 however the yield et regression slope in this study showed a wider range 1 4 1 9 kg m3 with the highest and lowest values corresponding to irrigation scenarios 2 and 1 respectively klocke et al 2012 reported yield et regression with a slope of 2 1 kg m3 wani et al 2012 reported that crop water productivity of grain sorghum could vary from 0 23 to 2 2 kg m3and that cwp of 1 2 1 9 kg m3 was obtained in nebraska these results are in agreement with our findings the relationship between yield and et documented in prior experimental studies at the study site showed a linear relationship with r2 of 0 71 klocke et al 2014 kisekka et al 2016 similarly other previous studies on grain sorghum and et relations obtained a linear relationship stewart and steiner 1990 klocke et al 2012 in this study there was relatively poor relationship between et and grain yield with increase in irrigation water for example the yield et relations showed lower r2 values 0 40 for ic of 5 mm day whereas there was moderate linear relationship for mild and strong for water stressed treatments r2 0 6 similarly klocke et al 2014 reported lower r2 values 0 21 for wet years in garden city kansas the lowest crop water use for above zero yield simulated in rainfed treatment in our study was approximately 150 mm similarly previous studies showed that the threshold crop water use for grain sorghum in the study site was close but slightly lower 100 mm than that of ours klocke et al 2012 however our crop water production functions based on linear equations especially for both early and late maturing cultivar slightly differed from previous studies this might be attributed to i difference in experimental time period crop and climate characteristics during these studies and agronomic management practices ii uncertainty in model calibration and validation may also contribute to some differences and iii the crop simulation model used could be also be a factor as modeling structure flaw such as minor error in fundamental equations for simulation of crop yield or other parameters could contribute to inaccuracies 4 4 crop yield and irrigation capacity grain sorghum yield increased with increase in ic and peaked between 2 5 and 3 6 mm day and thereafter steadily decreased but the highest ic did not result in significantly higher yield compared to other irrigated treatments ics this was because i the water demand of the crop might have been met with lower ics ii increased leaching of nutrients with increase in irrigation water iii increased water loses as drainage with increase in irrigation water for example there was a substantial increase in drainage when irrigation water of above 230 mm was applied drainage was higher under ic 5 mm day than the other ics with irrigation scheduling scenario of 1 followed by 3 and least is for 2 some reports also showed a curvilinear relationship between yield and irrigation during wet years or with good supply of water araya et al 2016 we do not recommend to irrigate grain sorghum from planting to maturity as the long term yield of grain sorghum did not significantly differ from those other irrigation scheduling scenarios and as majority of water is loss as deep drainage if grain sorghum has to be irrigated from planting to maturity this study showed that ic of 1 7 mm day or 25 mm in 15 days is adequate according to our simulation study lower ics 1 7 or 2 5 mm day could be used if the objective is to meet at least 5 t ha in 75 of the long term season 3 out of 4 years under irrigation scheduling scenario of 2 higher ic 5 mm day may be needed when producers yield goal is to meet at least 5 t ha in 100 of the seasons irrigation capacity of 3 6 mm day may be best strategy when producers yield goal is to meet 6 t ha in 75 and 90 of the long term growing seasons under irrigation management scenario of 2 and 3 respectively lamm et al 2007 reported the difficulty of determining the minimum ic as it varies with soil and economic conditions in this study dry season yields over long term climate were considered as criteria in assessing the minimum ic for grain sroghum the cwp and iwp d values evaluated in this work were also essential to decide which irrigation scheduling scenario could be more efficient in terms of water use the higher the ic the higher the seasonal irrigation water application which might be needed only during dry years ksu 1998 and araya et al 2016 verified that grain sorghum needs irrigation amounts of 250 350 mm in dry years for a potential yield in western kansas the average water requirement of grain sorghum for southern high plain was estimated to be 495 mm marek et al 2017 similarly klocke et al 2012 estimated water requirement of 527 and 459 mm for fully and least irrigated grain sorghum treatments respectively lamm et al 2007 in their simulation study reported that grain sorghum might be more profitable under rainfed than under irrigated condition they suggested that yield penalties and net returns under various increased irrigation capacities may be good indicators for determining minimum ic we recommend future research to include economic analysis of cropping systems along with yield variabilities across spatial and temporal scales under various irrigation capacities 5 conclusion the minimum ic for grain sorghum was found to be 1 7 2 5 mm day when the producer s goal was to meet at least 5 t ha in 3 out of 4 growing seasons when the interest in producing at least 6 t ha the minimum ic increased to 3 6 mm day and irrigation should target the panicle initiation to grain filling stage irrigating grain sorghum from planting to maturity under higher ic is not recommended in such cases ic of 1 7 mm day may be adequate depending on the yield goals due to excess loss of irrigation water as drainage this study showed that relatively high yield and cwp were simulated when irrigation is initiated at panicle initiation and ended at grain filling with minimum irrigation capacity of 2 5 3 6 mm day however those yield increases were substantially different from lower ics 1 7 mm day lower ics substantially saved irrigation water that otherwise would have been lost as drainage compared to higher ics in some of the wettest years even received rainfall could be sufficient this work was based on probabilities of yield goals iwp d and cwp which did not include economic analysis profitability and we recommend further research including net returns and risk analysis

11484,water is the major factor limiting crop production in semi arid regions of the southern and central us high plains the ogallala aquifer is the major source of irrigation water in the region the water levels in the aquifer have been declining due to water withdrawals for irrigation exceeding mean annual recharge as a result some of the wells in the region are not able to meet the crop water requirements due to lower irrigation capacity ic grain sorghum one of the major crops grown in western kansas is considered drought tolerant there is limited literature on the effect of ic on grain sorghum yield under erratic rainfall patterns of the semi arid high plains study objectives were to 1 evaluate the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm for assessing grain sorghum yield and water productivity 2 develop grain sorghum water production functions under five different ic two cultivars and three irrigation scheduling strategies and 3 evaluate response of grain sorghum under various ic in western kansas based on long term historical weather 4 to determine the minimum irrigation capacity required for irrigating grain sorghum in western kansas a calibrated and validated late maturing cultivar in prior study was used while measured yield and phenology data of an early maturing cultivar was used to evaluate an existing cultivar in dssat model results showed that the cultivar in dssat were representative of the cultivars in the field with normalized root mean square of error nrmse 18 index of agreement i of 0 97 and percent of deviation d 19 to 29 the corresponding statistical goodness of fit values for days to flowering was 12 0 99 and 0 17 respectively overall the simulated yield and phenology values agreed with the measured indicating the satisfactory simulation performance of the model highest yield crop water productivity and irrigation water use efficiencies were obtained from ic of 2 5 3 6 mm day under the irrigation scheduling strategies from panicle initiation to grain filling however long term simulation showed that the minimum ic for growing grain sorghum varied depending on the minimum yield goal to be met based on long term perspective in some wet years lower ic up to 1 7 mm day or even in some of the wettest years no irrigation was suitable our findings indicate that it might not be necessary to irrigate grain sorghum from planting to maturity but if producers are forced to do so by climatic conditions an ic of 1 7 2 5 mm day was found to produce a yield of at least 5 t ha similar to that of 5 mm day ic in 75 of the long term growing seasons if producers have to irrigate grain sorghum from panicle initiation to maturity the 2 5 mm day ic was found to be adequate to meet a minimum yield goal of 5 t ha in 3 out of 4 years based on soils and long term average climate around western kansas ic of 3 6 mm day was found to be adequate if producers wish to irrigate only from panicle initiation to grain filling to meet a minimum yield goal of 6 t ha in 75 90 of the long term seasons keywords irrigation capacity production function dssat grain sorghum ogallala 1 introduction agriculture is the economic backbone of kansas however crop production in the semi arid western part of the state is limited by crop water stress to achieve potential yield irrigation is needed in most years the ogallala aquifer is the main source of irrigation water in this region numerous studies have shown that the aquifer water levels are declining and will cause significant negative socio economic consequences if water is not used efficiently and sustainably rogers and lamm 2012 https www scientificamerican com article the ogallala aquifer lamm et al 2007 noted that many wells in western kansas have insufficient capacity to meet full crop water requirements grain sorghum is one of the main crops grown in western kansas rogers et al 2003 grain sorghum is relatively tolerant to drought compared to other cereal crops wani et al 2012 many studies have shown that grain sorghum is well suited to water limited semi arid areas like western kansas lamm et al 2007 aiken et al 2015 kisekka et al 2016 and can be grown as a companion crop to high water consumptive crops like corn in order to optimize crop water use klocke et al 2012 it is imperative to know the response of grain sorghum to various ic and understand the minimal irrigation system capacity considering erratic rainfall conditions and yield goals understanding the response of grain sorghum to various ic could help to optimize land water allocation and cropping pattern reduce the cost of production improve profitability increase the water use efficiency and enhance the sustainability of the aquifer producers can increase or decrease irrigated area depending on the irrigation well capacity and by assessing the possible yield or economic returns from different ic which are a function of land water allocation previous and current grain sorghum irrigation studies conducted at the kansas state university southwest research extension center near garden city are shortterm limited to three to five years klocke et al 2012 kisekka et al 2016 klocke et al 2012 imposed five different levels of stress in relation to non stressed treatment full irrigation and found that the least irrigated grain sorghum treatment was able to use more stored soil water compared to the fully irrigated and mild stressed treatments they reported that the least yield was found to correspond with about 90 of the fully irrigated treatment which indicated that grain sorghum might be best suited for low ic klocke et al 2012 kisekka et al 2016 reported no significant differences between fully irrigated treatments and deficit irrigated treatment from a multisite grain sorghum irrigation study these studies were important for understanding grain sorghum yield response to irrigation but did not include long term inter decadal variations in climate and their influence on grain sorghum response to water in this study we assess the effect of ic on grain sorghum when irrigation initiated at planting versus when irrigation is initiated at panicle initiation for two widely used grain sorghum cultivars in western kansas the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the dssat csm hereafter dssat model for simulating grain sorghum growth and development in semi arid western kansas 2 apply the evaluated model to generate grain sorghum production functions for five different ic as a function of irrigation scheduling and cultivars short versus long season and 3 evaluate response of grain sorghum under various ic in western kansas under variable climate using long term historical weather data 4 determine the minimum irrigation capacity required for irrigating grain sorghum in western kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the kansas state university southwest research extension center near garden city kansas with the geographical location of 38 1 20 87 n 100 49 26 95 w and elevation of 887 m above mean sea level the climate is semiarid with the main growing season for grain sorghum between may and october the estimated long term 1950 2013 annual rainfall and reference evapotranspiration based on fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 were approximately 455 mm and 1405 mm respectively the average maximum and minimum air temperature between may to october were reported to be 28 3 and 12 3 c respectively with frost free period of about 170 days klocke et al 2012 ulysses silt loam is the major soil type in the study site with bulk density of 1 36 g cm3 and field capacity wilting point and water content at saturation of 0 33 0 15 and 0 46 mm mm respectively klocke et al 2012 2 2 agronomic management grain sorghum was planted after the top 5 10 cm soil temperature reached at least 16 c or above fig 1 germination of grain sorghum is halted if temperatures are below 15 c wani et al 2012 according to fig 1 on an average after day of year doy 136 is a suitable time for planting grain sorghum other criteria such as initial soil moisture were also considered 60 70 planting date was set in the model to be june 15th two cultivars were considered for scenario analysis late long 120 140 days and early short 90 110 days maturing cultivars based on local practices plant population was assumed to be 18 plants per m2 and nitrogen applied was 102 kg n ha time of application of n was 22 kg at time of planting and 80 kg n ha a month after planting irrigation was applied using a center pivot sprinkler with assumed irrigation efficiency of 90 the treatments included two cultivars late and early maturing three irrigation scheduling scenarios irrigated from 1 planting to maturity 2 panicle initiation to grain filling and 3 panicle initiation to maturity table 1 normally the decision to apply irrigation may depend on the irrigation needed cost or yield goal or combinations of many factors the longer the time it takes for a center pivot to irrigate the planted area the more the crop suffers from water stress the well pumping capacity determines how many hectares of cropped land can be successfully irrigated during a growing season in this study for each cultivar grain sorghum yield was simulated under different ics the ic treatments were rainfed 0 0 mm day or dryland 1 7 mm day 25 mm in 15 days 2 5 mm day 25 mm in 10 days 3 6 mm day 25 mm in 7 days and 5 0 mm day 25 mm in 5 days table 1 in addition a treatment with fixed irrigation amount 25 mm based on threshold levels 50 of the maximum available soil water with sprinkler irrigation efficiency of 90 was scheduled from planting to maturity since irrigation was applied as required from planting to maturity this treatment corresponded to full irrigation the full irrigation and the dryland rainfed treatments were assumed to represent the upper and lower yield boundaries of grain sorghum in the study area respectively long term 1950 2013 yield based on all treatments were arranged from highest to lowest and probability of exceedance p were calculated based on raes et al 1996 2006 the yield and corresponding probabilities for all ics evaluated were then plotted and compared in order to set the minimum irrigation capacity for growing grain sorghum selected minimum simulated yield goals 5 5 5 and 6 t ha were set for dry climate season at three different probability of exceedances p 75 90 and 100 as it might vary with producer s interest minimum yield levels that correspond to dry seasons were selected in this study in order to minimize impacts of rainfall and soil water fluctuation on yield and ic accordingly the amount of water needed for grain sorghum for the selected yield levels in the season was assumed to be met mainly from irrigation another advantage of implementing this approach is that the method addresses issues related to irrigation scheduling techniques e g setting a trigger thresholds because i yields from dry season are selected as baseline criteria for determining minimum irrigation capacity for grain sorghum ii losses such as drainage and runoff under all ics and irrigation scheduling scenarios were also estimated and compared with the dryland and full irrigation treatments the upper fully irrigated and lower rainfed boundary of yield levels simulated based on fully irrigation as required and dryland were used to determine how far the yield levels simulated based on the various ics would deviate in relation to the two treatments in addition long term average et irrigation need yield irrigation water use efficiency and crop water productivity under the various irrigation and rainfed treatments were compared to evaluate the performance of grain sorghum under the various ics 2 3 model evaluation the dssat model jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2012 2015 was calibrated and evaluated for late season cultivar in prior study araya et al 2017 the model performance was evaluated for yield biomass phenology and et of grain sorghum at the study site araya et al 2017 in addition the average yield and phenology data of cultivars obtained from irrigated crop performance tests 2008 2017 available in http www agronomy k state edu services crop performance tests grainsorghum index html accessed in january 2018 were also obtained many of the cultivars grown during the experimental period in 2008 2009 2012 and 2013 were believed to be typical early short maturing cultivars the soils are similar to those of the experimental cultivar presented in araya et al 2017 the crop performance tests were conducted on silt loam soils dominant soils around garden city kansas with field capacity and wilting point of approximately 33 and 15 vol respectively planting was carried out between 1st 5th of june and nitrogen was assumed non limiting during the growing season in 2008 2013 there were two water treatments rainfed and irrigated treatments irrigation was applied as required and set in the model as non limiting grain sorghum cultivars in dssat were evaluated to determine if any of the cultivars in the dssat database represented the cultivars in the performance tests in terms of yield and phenology we were limited to searching a matching cultivar from the dssat crop databases based on yield and phenology because i the cultivars were already calibrated and evaluated possibly for many parameters before they were included into the database ii our available measured crop performance test data was limited to yield and phenology the measured yield and phenological values of the early maturing cultivar were evaluated against the simulated data of the selected matching cultivar in the model using normalized root mean square of error nrmse eq 1 index of agreement i willmott 1981 1982 willmott et al 1985 eq 2 percent of deviation d eq 3 and r2 1 n r m s e r m s e m a 100 2 i 1 Ï

cultivars grown during majority of growing seasons 2008 2009 2012 and 2013 in terms of phenology and yield when exposed to soil climate and management conditions of the study site 2 4 yield irrigation crop water use efficiencies crop water productivities and crop water production functions the long term 1950 2013 average yield under each irrigation capacity was calculated and production functions were developed between yield and ic developing relationships between yield and ic could help to estimate the possible grain sorghum yield levels under a given ic in addition relationships were developed between irrigated yield without dryland y d and irrigation water use efficiency iwp d irrigation crop water use efficiency iwp d in kg m3 was calculated as irrigated yield without dryland divided by the average amount of irrigation applied this was done to understand the impacts of irrigation on improving grain sorghum yield and assess how that amount of irrigation water was efficiently utilized to produce that amount of yield similarly the relationship between ic and crop water productivities were also assessed for the two grain sorghum cultivar crop water productivity cwp was calculated as yield divided by the seasonal crop evapotranspiration et the relationship could be used to guide irrigation scheduling under different ics the relationship between yield versus crop evapotranspiration under the three different irrigation scheduling scenarios 1 3 for both early and late maturing cultivars was also assessed for comparisons purposes we also used crop water production function for grain sorghum developed based on experimental studies klocke et al 2012 2014 and also based on yield using long term data as simulated with dssat 3 results 3 1 model evaluation dssat was calibrated and evaluated for late maturing grain sorghum cultivar in prior study araya et al 2017 in this study the early maturing cultivar tx 610 in dssat was evaluated and found to match the crop performance test cultivars 2008 2013 in terms of phenology and yield the nrmse and i of the measured and simulated yield were 18 and 0 97 respectively table 2 the percent deviation d between the simulated and measured yield ranged from 19 to 29 which was satisfactory similarly the nrmse and i values between the measured and simulated days to flowering were 12 and 0 99 respectively the d values also ranged from 0 to 17 therefore we believe that the cultivar in the model tx 610 represents the tested genotypes in the field the genetic coefficients of late and early maturing cultivars in dssat are presented in table 3 3 2 effect of irrigation capacity on yield uncertainty yield probabilities across the 64 1950 2013 years for the various irrigation strategies and ic indicated substantial difference among ic the 50 probability of exceedance of yield for late and early maturing cultivars under ic 0 mm day rainfed was 4 5 and 4 1 t ha respectively figs 2a d and 3a d there were also substantial yield differences among the various ic treatments of the same cultivar figs 2c d and 3c d similarly there was substantial deviations in yield under p of 50 and 75 for ic 0 1 7 and 2 5 mm day when compared to ic of 3 6 and 5 mm day figs 2c d and 3c d however the simulated yield levels between the early and late cultivars for the same irrigation capacity treatment were not very different for both cultivars grain sorghum responded well to 25 mm every 10 days ic 2 5 mm days and 15 days ic 1 7 mm days interval there was no significant difference in yield for both cultivars between ic of 5 mm day and 3 6 mm day among all irrigation scheduling scenarios these irrigation treatments were not substantially different from the fully irrigated treatment either the minimum ic for grain sorghum was found to be 1 7 2 5 mm day when the producer s goal was to meet at least 5 t ha in 75 of the long term growing seasons table 4 the minimum ic was even able to achieve the yield goal by applying irrigation scheduling scenario 2 the minimum ic could change if the yield goal is increased or decreased and if probability of success of meeting that yield level is set high or low for example the minimum ic to achieve a yield goal at least 6 t ha in 100 of the long term growing seasons is 3 6 mm day table 4 with timing of irrigation from panicle initiation to grain filling ic of 2 5 mm day might help stabilize yield in meeting at least 6 t ha in 100 of the growing season if irrigation scheduling scenario 1 irrigating grain sorghum from planting to maturity is applied however irrigating from planting to maturity could take significant amount of irrigation water depending on the length of growing period of that cultivar 3 3 grain sorghum yield and irrigation capacity for late maturing cultivar the average long term 1950 2013 grain sorghum yield under dryland was very low 4 5 t ha when compared to irrigated conditions fig 4 a there was small difference among the average long term yields of the various ic treatments although were not significant the relationship between yield and ic was a curvilinear yield slightly increased from lower to higher ic only when irrigation was limited to the period between panicle initiation to grain filling for late season cultivar average yield for irrigation from panicle initiation to grain filling was slightly lower than those other irrigated treatments with the exception for ic 5 mm day fig 4a the dryland yield of the early maturing cultivar was significantly lower than those irrigated treatments fig 4b however there was no substantial difference among the average yields of the different ics for example despite the highest irrigation application under ic 5 mm day the yield level was not significantly improved when compared with the other irrigated treatments yield under ic 1 7 and 2 5 mm day when applied at panicle initiation to grain filling was slightly lower than that under 3 6 and 5 mm day fig 4a b grain sorghum yield peaked when grain sorghum was irrigated under ic of 2 5 3 6 mm day fig 4a b the relationship between yield and ic was found to be a quadratic polynomial with r2 of 0 90 fig 4a b yield under ics of 2 5 and 1 7 mm day with irrigation scheduling scenarios 2 were slightly low compared to those of the corresponding levels of ic for irrigation scheduling scenario 1 and 3 whereas there was no much difference in yield under treatment with ic of 3 6 and 5 mm day regardless of the irrigation scheduling scenarios fig 4a b 3 4 relationship between irrigation capacity irrigation amount drainage and yield this study showed the low response of grain sorghum to higher irrigation applications fig 5 there was no substantial difference in yield between irrigation scheduling scenarios iss with 200 and 400 mm this indicates that higher irrigation application beyond 200 mm may not result in significantly higher yield average yield under the different ic increased with irrigation up to 200 230 mm and subsequently decreased with increase in irrigation fig 6 there was also curvilinear relationship between yield and irrigation fig 6 the average drainage losses at point when yield peaked was about 50 mm fig 6 yield did not increase with further increase in irrigation as grain sorghum water need was already met and thus majority of applied irrigation water was lost as drainage under higher irrigations beyond 250 mm there was strong linear relationship between drainage and irrigation after maximum yield was reached fig 6 drainage was high under ic of 5 mm day compared to the other ics fig 7 in contrast the lowest drainage was simulated for ic 0 and 1 7 mm day fig 7 the highest drainage loss was simulated when irrigation was applied from planting to maturity while the lowest was simulated when irrigation was applied from panicle initiation to grain filling fig 7 this study showed that it was difficult to avoid drainage if maximum yield is intended even in conditions when producers are using fixed automatic irrigation based on certain thresholds for example for one of the full irrigation treatment where irrigation was applied based on certain thresholds 50 available soil water threshold the drainage loss reached up to 80 mm caused in season rainfall that might occur after an irrigation event 3 5 irrigation water use efficiencies iwp d crop water productivity cwp and irrigation capacity the average irrigated yield without dryland y d substantially varied with irrigation scheduling scenarios the y d in treatments with irrigation scheduling scenario 2 under ic 1 7 and 2 5 mm day was slightly lower than those treatments with irrigation scheduling scenario 1 and 3 the quantitative relationship between y d and iwp d for late and early maturing grain sorghum cultivars is presented in fig 8 a b the figures show that irrigation scheduling scenario 2 were more productive in terms of water use than irrigation scheduling scenario 1 except under lower ic fig 8a b the y d values vary from 1 3 to 2 5 t ha the corresponding iwp d values were 2 4 and 1 7 kg m3 respectively the highest average yi d 2 4 2 5 t ha corresponded to iwp d of approximately 1 5 1 7 kg m3 fig 8a b there was substantial difference in cwp among the irrigation scheduling scenarios 1 3 the average cwp varied from 11 6 kg ha mm for ic 0 mm day dryland to 14 6 kg ha mm for ic of 3 6 mm day fig 9 a for the late maturing cultivar the relationship between cwp and ic for irrigation scheduling scenarios 1 2 and 3 are expressed in the form of quadratic polynomial equations fig 9a with r2 of above 0 72 cwp increased with ic up to 2 5 mm day for irrigation scheduling scenario 3 and up to 3 6 mm day for irrigation scheduling scenario 2 and the least was for 1 7 mm day for irrigation scheduling scenario 1 fig 9a the cwp for early maturing cultivar under dryland was slightly lower than that of the late maturing cultivar the cwp for early maturing cultivar ranged from 11 6 kg ha mm under dryland to 14 4 kg ha mm under ic of 3 6 mm day fig 9b similar to the late maturing cultivar the relationship between cwp and ic was quadratic polynomial with r2 of 0 8 6 fig 9b 3 6 yield versus crop evapotranspiration et production functions the relationship between yield and et of grain sorghum under various ic and irrigation management strategies is presented in fig 10 a b and table 5 the lowest threshold et that corresponds to above zero yield simulated in our rainfed treatment was approximately 150 mm yield was linearly related to et fig 10a b table 5 the lowest et produced the lowest yield but the highest et did not result in the highest yield fig 10a b there was no substantial difference in grain sorghum yield among the ic of 3 6 and 5 mm day for all irrigations scheduling scenarios fig 10a b for irrigations scheduling scenario 2 the ic of 5 mm day produced the highest yield for both cultivars but was not significantly different from ic of 3 6 mm day the relationship between yield and et varied with ic and irrigation scheduling scenario but the majority of the data showed an r2 of 0 50 table 5 however the relationship was slightly stronger under irrigations scheduling scenario 2 r2 0 60 compared to that of 1 and 3 r2 0 50 fig 10a b table 5 the results of the yield versus crop water use production functions based on experimental studies in the past for the same and other sites was also partially in agreement with this study 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation the short season cultivar had moderate statistical goodness of fit values nrmse of 18 d of 19 to 29 and i of 0 97 for yield these values were slightly better than those reported in akinseye et al 2017 and lopez et al 2017 the days to flowering were also adequately simulated with nrmse of 12 d of 0 17 and i of 0 99 but were less accurate when compared to those reported in lopez et al 2017 according to soler et al 2007 nrmse values of 18 can be taken as good performance of the model in simulating grain sorghum yield similarly i of above 0 97 is considered excellent agreement based on liu et al 2013 overall the statistical goodness of fit showed that early maturing cultivar in dssat tx 610 satisfactorily represented the yield and phenology of cultivars under the crop performance tests at the ksu swrec near garden city kansas 4 2 iwp d versus y d there relationship between yi d and iwp d was curvilinear with r2 of 0 96 0 99 the relationships showed that the y d values could be as low as 1 3 t ha and as high as 2 5 t ha which corresponded to iwp d values of 2 4 and 1 7 kg m3 respectively this indicates that the rate of increase in yield due to added irrigation water decreased with further increase in irrigation implying that the irrigation water was less efficiently used by the crop when high irrigation water 200 mm was applied iwp d was high when irrigation scheduling scenario 2 was applied for both cultivars which could be due to the high response of grain sorghum to irrigation water at the most sensitive stage of growth the highest iwp d was correlated with the lowest y d this was due to the increased efficiency of water utilization by the crop when water is constraint compared to the relatively lower efficiency of water utilization by the crop when water is available in sufficient amount as some of the water could be drained or evaporated the optimal irrigation capacity for both cultivars should be the level at which high yield is achieved at higher iwp d which corresponded to ic of 2 5 3 6 mm day under irrigation scheduling scenario 2 iwp d of grain sorghum slightly decreased with increase in ic when irrigation scheduling scenario 1 was used one of the reasons for this could be due to less response of grain sorghum to increasing irrigation water for example grain sorghum was reported to be less responsive to water klocke et al 2012 compared to crops such as corn in western kansas lamm et al 2007 araya et al 2017 araya et al 2016 used a simulation model to estimate the biomass and grain per unit of water supply under various climate water availability and soil conditions in western kansas they found that biomass and grain per unit of water supply decreased with the increase in total water supply the nature of the soils in the study area might have also partially contributed to the decrease of the biomass and grain per unit of water supply with increase in ic because water holding capacity of silt loam soils is much higher than many other coarser textured soils in addition with the increase in water supply the water loss as drainage or evaporation may increase and thus contribute to reduction in yield and biomass per unit of water supply in the texas high plains tolk and howell 2003 also reported the curvilinear relationship between water supply and grain sorghum yield which indicates the more irrigation water applied to grain sorghum the lesser the iwp d iwp d of grain sorghum simulated with irrigation scheduling scenario 1 was lower than that of 2 this could be because grain sorghum is very sensitive to water stress from panicle initiation to early grain filling wani et al 2012 panicle size and grain number may be severely affected if water stress occurred during panicle initiation wani et al 2012 reported that water stress at flowering early and late grain filling may result in pollination failure abortion of grain formation and smaller grain size respectively water stress at later grain filling may also enhance premature senescence wani et al 2012 hammer et al 2010 reviewed that grain number is a function of biomass conditions at the time of panicle initiation to start of grain filling whereas the grain size is determined by the distribution of assimilates during grain filling period assefa et al 2010 reported that yield losses due to water stress at reproductive stages may even go beyond 55 irrigation scheduling scenario 1 is not a right choice for grain sorghum because yield was low and irrigation water was not efficiently used by the crop when compared to other irrigation scheduling scenarios 2 and 3 grain sorghum was reported to be less sensitive to water stress especially during the early vegetative and late growth stages doorenbos and kassam 1979 4 3 crop water productivity and yield versus crop water use production functions crop water productivity of grain sorghum on average increased with the increase in ic and peaked at 3 6 mm day and gradually started to decrease thereafter this was because water losses through drainage and evaporation slightly increased with increase in ic in many studies crop water use et was strongly related to yield doorenbos and kassam 1979 kisekka et al 2016 while yield is curve linearly related to irrigation water tolk and howell 2003 klocke et al 2014 araya et al 2016 because over irrigation can cause yield decrease klocke et al 2012 due to leaching of nutrients and aeration stress soil evaporation may increase with an increase in crop water use which might contribute to reducing the cwp at high ic the cwp of grain sorghum in treatment with irrigation scheduling scenario 2 was slightly higher than that of grain sorghum under irrigation scheduling scenario 3 we found that cwp across each year from 1950 to 2013 were slightly smaller for irrigation scheduling scenario 1 and 3 compared to irrigation scheduling scenario 2 average cwp ranged from 11 6 kg ha mm under 0 mm day dryland to up to 14 6 kg ha mm under ic of 3 6 mm day these cwp value are slightly higher than those reported by hadebe et al 2017 however the yield et regression slope in this study showed a wider range 1 4 1 9 kg m3 with the highest and lowest values corresponding to irrigation scenarios 2 and 1 respectively klocke et al 2012 reported yield et regression with a slope of 2 1 kg m3 wani et al 2012 reported that crop water productivity of grain sorghum could vary from 0 23 to 2 2 kg m3and that cwp of 1 2 1 9 kg m3 was obtained in nebraska these results are in agreement with our findings the relationship between yield and et documented in prior experimental studies at the study site showed a linear relationship with r2 of 0 71 klocke et al 2014 kisekka et al 2016 similarly other previous studies on grain sorghum and et relations obtained a linear relationship stewart and steiner 1990 klocke et al 2012 in this study there was relatively poor relationship between et and grain yield with increase in irrigation water for example the yield et relations showed lower r2 values 0 40 for ic of 5 mm day whereas there was moderate linear relationship for mild and strong for water stressed treatments r2 0 6 similarly klocke et al 2014 reported lower r2 values 0 21 for wet years in garden city kansas the lowest crop water use for above zero yield simulated in rainfed treatment in our study was approximately 150 mm similarly previous studies showed that the threshold crop water use for grain sorghum in the study site was close but slightly lower 100 mm than that of ours klocke et al 2012 however our crop water production functions based on linear equations especially for both early and late maturing cultivar slightly differed from previous studies this might be attributed to i difference in experimental time period crop and climate characteristics during these studies and agronomic management practices ii uncertainty in model calibration and validation may also contribute to some differences and iii the crop simulation model used could be also be a factor as modeling structure flaw such as minor error in fundamental equations for simulation of crop yield or other parameters could contribute to inaccuracies 4 4 crop yield and irrigation capacity grain sorghum yield increased with increase in ic and peaked between 2 5 and 3 6 mm day and thereafter steadily decreased but the highest ic did not result in significantly higher yield compared to other irrigated treatments ics this was because i the water demand of the crop might have been met with lower ics ii increased leaching of nutrients with increase in irrigation water iii increased water loses as drainage with increase in irrigation water for example there was a substantial increase in drainage when irrigation water of above 230 mm was applied drainage was higher under ic 5 mm day than the other ics with irrigation scheduling scenario of 1 followed by 3 and least is for 2 some reports also showed a curvilinear relationship between yield and irrigation during wet years or with good supply of water araya et al 2016 we do not recommend to irrigate grain sorghum from planting to maturity as the long term yield of grain sorghum did not significantly differ from those other irrigation scheduling scenarios and as majority of water is loss as deep drainage if grain sorghum has to be irrigated from planting to maturity this study showed that ic of 1 7 mm day or 25 mm in 15 days is adequate according to our simulation study lower ics 1 7 or 2 5 mm day could be used if the objective is to meet at least 5 t ha in 75 of the long term season 3 out of 4 years under irrigation scheduling scenario of 2 higher ic 5 mm day may be needed when producers yield goal is to meet at least 5 t ha in 100 of the seasons irrigation capacity of 3 6 mm day may be best strategy when producers yield goal is to meet 6 t ha in 75 and 90 of the long term growing seasons under irrigation management scenario of 2 and 3 respectively lamm et al 2007 reported the difficulty of determining the minimum ic as it varies with soil and economic conditions in this study dry season yields over long term climate were considered as criteria in assessing the minimum ic for grain sroghum the cwp and iwp d values evaluated in this work were also essential to decide which irrigation scheduling scenario could be more efficient in terms of water use the higher the ic the higher the seasonal irrigation water application which might be needed only during dry years ksu 1998 and araya et al 2016 verified that grain sorghum needs irrigation amounts of 250 350 mm in dry years for a potential yield in western kansas the average water requirement of grain sorghum for southern high plain was estimated to be 495 mm marek et al 2017 similarly klocke et al 2012 estimated water requirement of 527 and 459 mm for fully and least irrigated grain sorghum treatments respectively lamm et al 2007 in their simulation study reported that grain sorghum might be more profitable under rainfed than under irrigated condition they suggested that yield penalties and net returns under various increased irrigation capacities may be good indicators for determining minimum ic we recommend future research to include economic analysis of cropping systems along with yield variabilities across spatial and temporal scales under various irrigation capacities 5 conclusion the minimum ic for grain sorghum was found to be 1 7 2 5 mm day when the producer s goal was to meet at least 5 t ha in 3 out of 4 growing seasons when the interest in producing at least 6 t ha the minimum ic increased to 3 6 mm day and irrigation should target the panicle initiation to grain filling stage irrigating grain sorghum from planting to maturity under higher ic is not recommended in such cases ic of 1 7 mm day may be adequate depending on the yield goals due to excess loss of irrigation water as drainage this study showed that relatively high yield and cwp were simulated when irrigation is initiated at panicle initiation and ended at grain filling with minimum irrigation capacity of 2 5 3 6 mm day however those yield increases were substantially different from lower ics 1 7 mm day lower ics substantially saved irrigation water that otherwise would have been lost as drainage compared to higher ics in some of the wettest years even received rainfall could be sufficient this work was based on probabilities of yield goals iwp d and cwp which did not include economic analysis profitability and we recommend further research including net returns and risk analysis
