10530,agricultural system modeling has become an effective tool for analyzing and quantifying the effects of varying management practices and environmental conditions on crop production and nutrient export from croplands the use of such modeling tools provides useful insights in identifying the most effective management practices for enhancing productivity sustainability and resiliency of agricultural systems this study focuses on testing and application of an integrated field scale process based model drainmod dssat for simulating hydrology nitrate nitrogen no3 n loss and crop growth and yield responses in artificially drained croplands the tested model was used to evaluate the effects of different n fertilizer application rates and timings in both conventional and controlled drainage conditions on crop yield and no3 n losses in a poorly drained drummer flanagan soil in east central illinois the model was calibrated and validated for a corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l rotation using 7 years 1992 1998 of field measured tile drainage crop yield and no3 n data the graphical and statistical evaluations indicated very good model performance specifically monthly tile drainage flow was predicted with modeling efficiency nse index of agreement d and mean absolute error mae of 0 85 0 96 and 0 69 cm respectively monthly no3 n losses were predicted with nse d and mae of 0 82 0 95 and 1 16 kg n ha 1 respectively corn and soybean yields were predicted with an absolute percent error pe of 1 84 and 12 07 respectively the long term model simulation results indicated that split n application of 50 during spring pre plant s and 50 during side dressing sd could increase crop yield and reduce n leaching losses compared to other tested n application methods spring s only fall spring split f s and fall spring side dressing f s sd further applying 10 and 20 reduced n rates 194 kg n ha 1 and 174 kg n ha 1 respectively in combination with s sd split application in controlled drainage cd condition could reduce n leaching losses by 30 and 33 respectively compared to the conventional application method this study explored the effects of n fertilizer management on crop yield and nitrogen losses under two drainage conditions and underscored the importance of n fertilizer application rates and timings for achieving yield goals while minimizing nitrogen export from drained agricultural fields the results of the model simulations will be useful for stakeholders and policy makers while making decisions regarding promotion and adoption of best management practices for drained agricultural landscapes keywords hydrological modeling nitrogen management subsurface drainage controlled drainage corn and soybean yield 1 introduction management of nutrients in drained agricultural lands has become a pressing challenge for researchers policymakers farmers and other stakeholders meisinger and delgado 2002 commercial fertilizers applied to enhance crop production on drained fields are not entirely consumed by the plants and therefore a portion is transported to surface waters via an accelerated pathway provided by tile drainage systems david et al 2010 gentry et al 1998 meisinger and delgado 2002 the movement of highly water soluble nutrients such as nitrate nitrogen no3 n with drainage water leads to nutrient enrichment of surface water bodies causing water quality deterioration and eutrophication problems petrolia and gowda 2006 rabalais et al 2014 randall and mulla 2001 studies have shown that the majority of no3 n transport to the gulf of mexico is via the mississippi river which originates from the upper basin in the midwest corn belt states where a significant portion of the agricultural landscape is artificially drained alexander et al 2008 rebich et al 2011 the continuous expansion of tile drainage in agricultural lands and concomitant use of commercial fertilizers have made surface water and groundwater more vulnerable to water quality impairment david et al 2010 dinnes et al 2002 in recent decades research has focused on developing best management practices bmps to curtail nutrient losses from drained agricultural fields dinnes et al 2002 evans et al 1991 luo et al 2010 mitsch et al 2001 strock et al 2004 for example these bmps include edge of field practices such as saturated buffers constructed wetlands denitrifying bioreactors controlled drainage and in field practices such as crop rotation cover crops and nutrient application rates christianson et al 2016 however the implementation and effectiveness of these practices can vary widely with field characteristics cropping systems soil types and climatic conditions kladivko et al 1999 randall and mulla 2001 in an attempt to reduce n footprints of crop production the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy il nlrs proposed three practices in field edge of the field and land use change to reduce no3 n losses by 15 from agricultural fields of northern illinois and 20 from central illinois by 2025 iepa and idoa 2015 the in field practice emphasizes n fertilizer application timing and recommended n application rates for illinois based on the maximum return to nitrogen mrtn calculator the inrls suggests three n application timing alternatives to reduce n loading and achieve maximum crop production however the effectiveness of these alternative n application timings was estimated based on the results reported by clover 2005 and gentry et al 2014 and did not account for long term effects of weather variability and drainage water management practice on n leaching losses and crop production for example clover 2005 reported the effects of n application during fall spring pre plant and side dressing on n losses and corn yield from 2000 to 2004 however the study did not account for controlled drainage or long term weather variability similarly gentry et al 2014 reported variation in riverine nitrate using a regression model for two drained watersheds based on nitrate data from 1993 to 2012 which did not consider the site specific evaluation of n application rates and timing on n losses and crop yield moreover at a broader scale in the il nlrs the range of n application rates low mean and high provided by mrtn to maximize profitability for corn does not consider off site environmental impacts sawyer et al 2006 thus to provide a better understanding of the effects of alternative n application timing and rates in achieving the n loss reduction goal field specific evaluations are important to evaluate the impacts of different in field practices on multiple components of n cycling and crop productivity agricultural system models can be effective tools for analyzing and supplementing understanding of various field processes and controlling mechanisms ale et al 2012 thorp et al 2009 youssef et al 2006 different computer simulation models such as root zone water quality model rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 agricultural production system simulator apsim mccown et al 1996 drainmod skaggs 1978 drainmod nii youssef et al 2005b and agricultural policy environmental extender apex williams et al 2006 have been developed and employed by researchers to design and evaluate bmps in different contexts for example rzwqm has been used to simulate the effects of drainage water management n rates and weather on n leaching losses in drained fields and crop yields fang et al 2012 jeong and bhattarai 2018 ma et al 2007 saseendran et al 2007 apsim model was used for simulating the effects of agricultural management practices on n leaching losses and crop yield under subsurface drainage systems malone et al 2007a ojeda et al 2018 similarly drainmod nii was used to evaluate the performance of controlled drainage cd across the midwest youssef et al 2018 quantifying drainage flow and n leaching losses reduction under a wide range of soil types climatic conditions and management practices negm et al 2016 drainmod and drainmod nii have been widely used for designing and evaluating a wide range of management practices for sustainable agriculture under varying environmental conditions however these models were focused on hydrology and lacked crop growth modules that can predict plant phenological development and growth for varying genetics and environmental conditions negm et al 2014a thus the crop growth modules of dssat v4 0 hoogenboom et al 2004 were integrated with drainmod nii to improve the crop growth component of the model which has made it more suitable for simulating and predicting crop growth and yield along with hydrology and water quality negm et al 2014a this newly developed model has been evaluated for different drainage practices and nutrient management scenarios using field measured data in two u s midwestern states iowa and indiana and has shown promising potential for simulating drainage outflow no3 n loss and crop yield negm et al 2014a 2014b 2017 additional testing of the model in the u s midwest region is still needed extensive model performance evaluation in wide range of soil management and climatic conditions provides opportunity to establish higher credibility in intended use of the model improvement in model algorithms and expansion to a robust agro ecosystem model the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of drainmod dssat for predicting the hydrology no3 n losses and crop yield for the conditions of east central illinois using seven years 1992 1998 of field measured data the calibrated model was then used to simulate the effects of different n rates and timings on crop yield and n losses in both conventional and controlled drainage conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data description the study site is located in little vermillion river lvr watershed near danville 87 43 24 w and 39 58 55 in east central illinois usa fig 1 the climate of the region is classified as temperate with somewhat hot summer and an average annual rainfall of 990 mm isws 2017 the watershed exhibits typical plains characteristics of flat topography with naturally poorly drained dark prairie soils classified as silt loam and silty clay loam mitchell et al 2000 the soils on the site are predominantly characterized as drummer silty clay loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic endoaquolls with 4 5 7 organic matter content and flanagan silt loam fine smectitic mesic aquic argiudolls with 3 5 5 organic matter content these soils are poorly drained with 0 2 slope although eight field sites were established for a long term water quality monitoring project kalita et al 2006 mitchell et al 2000 monitoring results from one field site site a between 1992 and 1998 was used for this study all decisions regarding crop tillage and fertilizer management practices at the study site were made by the landowner and the information on the adopted practices was documented table 1 kalita et al 2006 the site was chisel plowed and disked or field cultivated each year and all n fertilizer was applied prior to planting corn kalita et al 2006 mitchell et al 2000 the 4 86 ha site was drained with an irregularly random spaced tile drainage system installed at a depth of 1 10 m mitchell et al 2000 the irregularly random spaced tile drainage systems are not spaced in a parallel manner and this type of subsurface drain installation specifically targets depressional areas in the fields rainfall data for the period 1992 1998 were recorded on site using tipping bucket rain gauges surface runoff was monitored using palmer bowlus flumes during each rainfall events whereas tile drainage flow at the site was continuously monitored using palmer bowlus flumes installed in access manholes near each drainage system outlet and data loggers were used to record the time stage data by increments of the stage from stage recorder kalita et al 2006 mitchell et al 2000 for monitoring no3 n water samples were taken automatically by auto water samplers activated by the data logger and additional water samples were collected bi weekly mitchell et al 2000 the analysis of no3 n concentration in the drainage water was conducted using the hydrazine sulfate reduction method and no3 n mass loss was determined as the product of drainage flow volume and the concentration of no3 n in drainage water mitchell et al 2000 2 2 model description drainmod dssat negm et al 2014a is an integrated comprehensive model that simulates hydrological biogeochemical and plant growth processes for agro ecosystems on shallow water table soils with artificial drainage specifically the model was developed by coupling the hydrological model drainmod skaggs et al 2012 and the carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics model drainmod nii youssef et al 2005a with the dssat v4 0 hoogenboom et al 2004 deterministic crop growth models ceres maize jones et al 1986 cropgro soybean boote et al 1998 and cropsim ceres wheat ritchie and otter 1985 drainmod can predict hydrologic variables such as infiltration subsurface drainage surface runoff water table depth evapotranspiration vertical and lateral seepage and water free pore space in the soil profile on daily monthly and annual bases the infiltration rate is computed using green and ampt 1911 method and subsurface drainage is calculated using steady state hooghoudt bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 for water table drawdown conditions and kirkham 1957 equation for ponded surface conditions the model computes potential evapotranspiration pet using temperature based thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 1957 method by default but it can be set to read user defined daily pet input files for default pet calculations monthly correction factors are used to correct pet estimated by thornthwaite method the model uses the heat flow equation to predict soil temperature and effects of soil freezing thawing and snow accumulation and melt on hydrologic predictions for cold regions luo et al 2000 the model computes vertical and lateral seepage if any using relatively simple method based on darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer assumptions skaggs et al 2012 the c and n dynamics model drainmod nii simulates soil n cycle in drained agricultural land under varying water and management practices and environmental conditions the model simulates n dynamics using three soil n pools nitrate no3 n ammonical nh4 n and organic n nitrogen transformation processes simulated by the model includes n inputs to the soil system from atmospheric deposition mineralization of organic n plant uptake n fixation by legumes application of inorganic n fertilizers application of organic n such as plant residues and manure ammonia volatilization nitrification denitrification n losses via subsurface drainage surface runoff and vertical seepage youssef et al 2005a the model simulates n transport through soil profile using multiphase form of the one dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation which solved numerically using a first order finite difference approximation youssef et al 2005a the carbon cycle in the model comprised of three soil organic matter pools active slow passive two above and two below ground litter pools metabolic and structural and a surface microbial pool whereas the nitrogen cycle comprised of three nitrogen pools nitrate nitrogen ammoniacal nitrogen organic nitrogen the model requires several carbon nitrogen related inputs for simulation which includes crop management n transport n transformation and organic matter parameters in addition to soil properties and weather input data the model uses finite difference to a multiphase one dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation to simulate n reactive transport the model output includes concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in soil solution and drainage water soil organic content of the top 20 cm soil layers and rates of simulated n processes on daily monthly and annual time scale youssef and skaggs 2006 ceres maize is the corn growth model in which the life cycle of corn is divided into nine different phases from sowing to physiological maturity each requiring accumulation of defined thermal units or growing degree days gdd before transitioning to next phase the model simulates daily crop water uptake as the summation of soil moisture extracted from each soil layer which is a function of root density and extractable soil water for a given soil layer negm et al 2014a the relative effect of deficit n supply is computed based on the n deficiency indicator nfac on different growth processes separately cropgro soybean simulates the growth and development of soybean the model uses a flexible approach that allows crop development at different growth phases up to thirteen phases to be differentially sensitive to photoperiod temperature water and n stresses boote et al 1998 the model computes physiological time development rates based on temperature photoperiod and water and nutrients conditions the model uses different temperature functions before and after flowering to predict the reproductive phenology of soybean the model follows a computational approach similar to ceres maize for computing water and nutrient stresses readers are referred to jones et al 1986 boote et al 1998 negm et al 2017 and negm et al 2014a for a detail description of crop growth modules and the integration of these modules with drainmod 2 3 drainmod dssat model integration drainmod dssat model integration allows data transfer and feedback between individual models on a daily time step negm 2011 briefly on each simulation day draimod and drainmod nii simultaneously simulate hydrologic variables and c n dynamics on the first day planting day of crop growing season the crop component calls the suitable crop module for initialization and model parameterization during the crop growing season drainmod provides the crop model with daily soil water soil temperature and weather data including maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and pet and drainmod nii provides the soil n available for plant uptake then the crop module convert drainmod predicted pet into potential plant transpiration pt0 based on the light extinction coefficient and simulated leaf area index lai in this integration actual daily root water uptake which represents plant transpiration is either equal to or less than drainmod calculated et but not higher the variable plant transpiration is a function of simulated lai root vigor as well as soil water availability defined by drainmod hydrologic compartment if root water uptake is insufficient to meet pt0 demand the crop model applies two water stress factors swfac and turfac the swfac stress factor reduces photosynthesis and biomass production whereas turfac restricts the expansive growth of crops the insufficiency in root water uptake can occur by either deficit soil water under dry conditions or excess soil water under saturated condition that prevents sufficient oxygen supply to crop roots in addition the crop module computes day length and hourly weather data if needed based on the daily measured data utilizing subroutines adapted from the dssat weather module after crop model completes crop growth simulations it returns the effective rooting depth the upper root zone where the majority of the root biomass exists to drainmod to complete soil water balance simulation for the day and update soil water profile for the next day of simulation drainmod nii receives daily hydrologic predictions from drainmod and the effective rooting depth and plant n uptake from crop model to complete simulation of c and n dynamics and update the soil n balance for the next day of simulation on the last day harvesting day of the growing season crop model provides drainmod nii with unharvested above and below ground biomass with their n content for residue recycling during the non growing season simulations become limited to water and n balance components only 2 4 model parameterization calibration and evaluation drainmod dssat model requires a number of input parameters to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes and interaction between them the model was calibrated and validated using seven years 1992 1998 of measured data of daily drainage flow no3 n losses and crop yields the calibration period was 1992 1995 and the validation period was 1996 1998 a warm up period 1990 1991 was used to initialize and stabilize the model simulation since random irregularly spaced tile drainage was used at the study site the trial and error method was used to adjust the tile drain spacing during the calibration process the process of calibration and validation followed the order of hydrology n and crop growth components calibration and repetitive iterations were performed using a number of parameters until optimal statistical indices were obtained for this study rainfall data was collected from the research site temperature data was obtained from a nearby weather station isws 2017 and daily pet was estimated by the model using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 monthly correction factors table 2 were applied to adjust the pet estimation for illinois conditions northcott 1999 the soil characteristics and profile details are referenced from the nrcs soil survey report for vermilion county illinois the soil profile was divided into five layers and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity values were referenced from northcott 1999 to initialize the model and some adjustments were made during the calibration process to improve model predictions soil temperature related parameters for freezing and thawing conditions were adopted from negm et al 2014b the model parameters such as maximum surface storage roughness of soil surface or depressional depth thickness of the restrictive layer and the piezometric head of the aquifer below the restrictive layer hydraulic head referenced at bottom of the restrictive layer are difficult to measure and thus were modified to improve the model performance and statistical goodness of fit table 2 tillage management inputs were set according to the implemented tillage practice at the study site the average fertilizer application rate for corn years over the study period was 215 kg n ha 1 and no fertilizer was applied in soybean years n transport and n transformation parameters required by the drainmod nii model to simulate n were obtained from different studies conducted in surrounding regions with similar soil type and environmental conditions and slight modification in few parameters were made to improve model prediction table 3 negm et al 2017 thorp et al 2009 youssef and skaggs 2006 youssef et al 2018 the major parameters for n simulation include n transport nitrification denitrification and soil organic matters som detail descriptions of c and n parameters terminologies and default values can be found elsewhere youssef and skaggs 2006 youssef et al 2005a youssef 2004 to simulate carbon dynamics in soil the model requires potential decomposition rates and c n ratios for different organic matter pools which were also adopted from different literature negm et al 2014a youssef et al 2006 and are presented in table 3 the ammonium and nitrate concentrations in rainfall water were set to 0 4 mgnl 1 and 1 4 gmnl 1 respectively based on data obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program nadp gay 2008 for crop growth and yield simulation the dssat crop module was provided with reasonable crop cultivar coefficients and planting characteristics such as row spacing and plant population suitable for illinois fields for soybean savoy sb0304 cultivar was selected for this study the crop coefficient values of selected cultivar were compared with negm et al 2017 for central iowa and were found to simulate the crop growth and phenological development of soybean reasonably well for the study site for corn crop growth and phenological development values were referenced from negm et al 2014b for indiana site and negm et al 2017 for central iowa site during the model calibration some cultivar parameters for corn were modified to improve the model prediction this includes modification of thermal time from seedling emergence to the end of the juvenile phase and thermal time from silking to physiological maturity as described in negm et al 2017 the cultivar coefficients used to simulate the corn and soybean growth are presented in table 4 2 5 model evaluation criteria the performance of drainmod dssat was evaluated by comparing model predictions and measured data of drainage flow nitrate loss and crop yield using the following statistical goodness of fit measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d mean absolute error mae and normalized root mean squared error n rmse in this study the model performance evaluation criteria recommended by skaggs et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2015 were used the model performance for predicting monthly drainage flow and nitrate loss is considered good if 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good if 0 75 nse 1 the performance evaluation of crop growth model is most commonly accessed using percent error pe and n rmse model performance is considered good when 10 n rmse 20 and very good when n rmse 10 jamieson et al 1991 in addition to statistical performance measures graphical performance measures were assessed using time series scatter plots and box plots to provide visual insights into the temporal behavior of the model moriasi et al 2015 a detailed explanation of both statistical and graphical performance measures can be found in moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 2 6 model application after model performance evaluation the model was used to evaluate the effects of n loss reduction strategies that include n fertilizer application rates and timings and drainage water management practices on nitrate loss and crop yields in the study three n application rates and four application timings were considered for both conventional and controlled drainage cd conditions conventional drainage also referred as free drainage fd allows unrestricted flow of subsurface drainage water from the fields whereas cd also referred as managed drainage or drainage water management utilizes a control structure at the outlet of subsurface drain lines to regulate drainage water flow from the field using a gate assembly it is a cost effective practice that helps in maintaining adequate soil water level in the root zone during the crop growing season while minimizing drainage outflow during non growing season the effects of fertilizer rates and timings were simulated by reducing application rate by 10 and 20 from the base application rate for four timings spring pre plant s spring pre plant side dressing s sd fall spring pre plant f s and fall spring pre plant side dressing f s sd the base rate of n application at the study site was determined to be 215 kg ha by averaging the fertilizer application years the three rates considered for this study corresponds to high 215 kg ha medium 194 kg n ha 1 and low 172 kg n ha 1 rates all within the range of maximum profitability determined by mrtn calculator for central illinois conditions and a corn soybean rotation mrtn 2018 the mrtn estimated n rates for illinois are based on n response data assembled from 185 soybean corn trial sites across illinois sawyer et al 2006 the effects of rates and n application timings in this study are designed based on fertilizer application practices included in illinois nutrient loss reduction strategies inrls report inlrs report has presented three n application practices 100 n application in spring pre plant s only split n application 50 50 in fall spring pre plant fs and split n application 40 fall 10 spring pre plant and 50 side dressing in fall spring pre plant side dressing fssd iepa and idoa 2015 along with these three application timings split n application 50 50 in spring pre plant and side dressing ssd was also considered in this study twenty seven years of climatological data 1990 2016 was used for long term simulation the soil organic matter module of the model was initialized using the first two years of model simulation and the remaining 25 years of model simulations were used to analyze the influence of management and drainage scenarios on crop yield and n dynamics the scenarios presented in table 5 were accessed and analyzed 3 result and discussion 3 1 hydrology hydrologic calibration procedure for drainmod dssat is similar to the calibration of drainmod described by skaggs et al 2012 model simulated average annual hydrologic components for fd system from 1992 to 1998 are presented in table 6 in the table each hydrologic component is expressed as a percent of rainfall to indicate the relative magnitude over the seven year study period the average annual rainfall was 98 9 cm the years 1992 and 1996 experienced average rainfall 1993 and 1998 experienced above average rainfall by 31 and 28 respectively and the years 1994 1995 and 1997 experienced below average rainfall by 15 20 and 25 respectively about 63 of rainfall occurred from march through august with 19 rainfall in march april and 45 rainfall in may august the percentage of annual rainfall that was lost via subsurface drainage flow varied considerably between the years 17 42 due to temporal variability in the rainfall magnitude the drainage flow during crop growing season april to october represented about 54 of total annual drainage whereas 46 of total annual drainage during non growing season november to march the difference in cumulative drainage flow and measured drainage flow was very small predicted cumulative 176 2 cm vs measured cumulative 177 2 cm over a period of seven years fig 2 illustrates a scatter plot comparing measured and predicted monthly drainage rates over the study period drainmod dssat accurately simulated monthly drainage flow with overall nse and index of agreement values of 0 85 and 0 96 respectively which can be rated as very good according to model performance evaluation guidelines suggested by moriasi et al 2015 and skaggs et al 2012 the mae of model predicted monthly drainage was found very small 0 69 cm when compared with the standard deviation of measured monthly drainage 2 88 cm which also indicates excellent model performance as well a two tailed student t test showed that the measured monthly drainage flow was not significantly different p 0 964 at 95 confidence level from the predicted monthly drainage flow the model performance for calibration years 1992 1995 was found to have nse d and mae of 0 87 0 96 and 0 64 cm respectively whereas nse d and mae were calculated to be 0 82 0 95 and 0 77 cm respectively for validation years 1996 1998 fig 3 illustrates the distribution of monthly measured and predicted drainage flow over the period of 1992 1998 the distribution showed wide month to month variability in both measured and predicted drainage flows the distribution pattern of measured and predicted drainage flow showed high variability in drainage flow during march may the average predicted and measured drainage flow during these months accounted for 43 and 47 of total drainage flow respectively during the crop growing period june september the variability in drainage flow was observed only in june and july the drainage flow was small from august to october the winter months november december were also found to have a wide variation in drainage flow however the mean monthly drainage flow during november and december was found to be close to the lower quartile which indicated that about 25 of drainage flow during these two months was below the mean flow on a daily basis model predicted and measured drainage flows also showed good agreement yet there were few peak events the model did not accurately predicted such as the flow events in november 1992 november 1993 april 1994 and february 1997 when the model under predicted drainage flow fig 4 such errors could be a result of less accurate estimation of infiltration due to freezing and thawing conditions during winter months which may have caused prediction of higher surface runoff however such postulation is difficult to confirm without actual field measurements the mean and standard deviation of model predicted daily drainage was very similar predicted 0 0687 0 1349 cm vs measured 0 0692 0 1642 cm the statistical indices for model predictions were nse 0 71 d 0 91 and mae 0 04 cm d 1 in the year 1998 the model over predicted drainage mostly during winter months and early spring when the snow starts to melt for all other years predicted drainage found in good agreement with measured drainage evapotranspiration et resulted in the maximum water loss from the system the model predicted et averaged at 61 8 cm representing 62 5 of average annual rainfall and is found to have consistent partitioning rate reported by negm et al 2014a fang et al 2012 and thorp et al 2007 for sites in iowa which has similar drained landscape climate and agricultural practices as in illinois the predicted et was also found within the range of the modeled et reported by sanford and selnick 2013 using the water balance model across the conterminous us the reported et range was 50 79 for the midwest region and 60 69 for central illinois the model predicted surface runoff and deep seepage represented minor pathways for water loss from the system the predicted average annual deep seepage loss was 5 6 cm representing 5 7 of average annual rainfall according to model prediction surface runoff accounted for 6 8 of average annual rainfall which was slightly higher compared to measured runoff of 2 however the result was found comparable with rzwqm simulation results reported by jeong and bhattarai 2018 for the same site most surface runoff events occurred in 1993 and 1998 when the rainfall was 25 higher than the average rainfall 3 2 crop growth and yield drainmod dssat performed well in predicting crop yields field measured crop yield was compared with predicted crop yield and the model performance for the calibration years and validation years was assessed using two statistical indices percent error pe and normalized root mean squared error n rmse drainmod dssat predicted corn yield with an absolute percent error of 1 84 and n rmse of 2 1 and soybean yield was predicted with an absolute percent error of 12 07 and n rmse of 17 5 table 7 the model over predicted soybean yield in the year 1996 and 1998 with pe of 25 32 and 28 45 respectively to understand why model over predicted soybean yield in those years we examined the crop growth output provided by the cropgro soybean we found that the model simulated higher root density cm cm3 in upper soil layers soil layer 1 3 in response to adequate soil moisture conditions during june and july which represent major crop growth period also we examined the rainfall received in june and july in both years and found that june and july received adequate amount of rainfall which may have contributed to even crop growth and higher grain yield simulation by the model similarly we examined n uptake by corn in 1995 and 1997 and found low plant n uptake in june and july the low plant n uptake may be due to direct result of poor rainfall in those two months which may have caused model to slightly under predict corn yield in those two years these results are reasonably comparable with findings reported by jeong and bhattarai 2018 for the same site using rzwqm and negm et al 2014b for indiana sites using drainmod dssat 3 3 nitrogen dynamics and nitrate n losses due to the complex nature of n dynamics in the soil water plant system it is challenging to quantify n leaching losses accurately one step in better predictions of n losses is to enable proper quantification of different soil n transformation processes under a range of environmental conditions youssef et al 2006 overall drainmod dssat performed very well in predicting annual no3 n losses in subsurface drainage the cumulative no3 n loss measured over the study period was 263 8 kg n ha 1 and the predicted was 262 8 kg n ha 1 pe of 0 36 fig 5 illustrates a scatter plot comparing predicted and measured monthly no3 n losses indicating good agreement between measured and predicted values the statistical indices nse d and mae for monthly no3 n losses over the period of 1992 1998 were found 0 82 0 95 and 1 16 kg n ha 1 respectively for calibration and validations years the statistical indices nse d and mae were found to be 0 87 and 0 76 0 97 and 0 93 and 0 95 and 1 43 kg n ha 1 respectively which indicated an overall very good model performance in predicting monthly n losses the majority predicted 66 vs measured 73 of n losses occurred between early spring february april and the mid crop growing period may july which covers the periods when snow started to melt and most spring rainfall occurred fig 6 illustrates the distribution of monthly measured and predicted no3 n loss over the period of 1992 1998 the distribution shows month to month variability in both measured and predicted n loss and follows a similar distribution pattern as that of monthly drainage flow the overall distribution of measured and predicted no3 n loss was similar the month of may had the highest variability in n losses compared to other months the mean monthly measured and predicted n loss for may suggest that about 50 of the no3 n loss were less than the mean value and 50 were greater than the mean value during the crop growing period june september the variability in no3 n loss was observed only in june and july the no3 n loss was minimum from august to october the winter months november december were also found to have a wide variation in n loss however the mean monthly no3 n loss during november and december was found close to the lower quartile which suggests that about 25 of no3 n loss during these two months were below the mean value the simulated net n mineralization ranged from 16 1 kg n ha 1 in 1997 to 200 0 kg n ha 1 in 1998 with an average annual net mineralization rate of 112 4 kg n ha 1 table 8 which is reasonable compared with values reported by negm et al 2014a and craft et al 2018 for iowa however similar studies also have reported higher net n mineralization in corn soybean cropping system in nearby locations for example thorp et al 2009 reported drainmod nii simulated average annual net n mineralization of 124 6 kg n ha 1 in a study conduct in iowa using 10 years of field data and qi et al 2011 reported average annual net n mineralization of 224 1 and 167 7 kg n ha 1 with and without rye cover crop respectively for corn soybean rotation in north central iowa using rzwqm2 higher net n mineralization in year 1998 is due to warmer winter months and low n immobilization whereas lower net n mineralization in 1997 is direct result of low mineralization and higher immobilization the model does not directly output the n addition in the soil through residue incorporation and therefore n mass added through crop residue incorporation was estimated using the relationship used by youssef et al 2005a for calculating plant shoot and root dry matter the estimated range of n addition from residue incorporation ranged from 57 2 145 2 kg n ha 1 in agroecosystems plant n uptake represents a major flux of the n cycle and therefore it is considered as an important component for analysis of n dynamics youssef et al 2006 the annual average n plant uptake predicted by the model for corn years averaged at 188 9 kg n ha 1 for soybean years the total plant uptake from both soil and n fixation predicted by the model averaged at 349 9 kg n ha 1 while difficult to measure directly denitrification is an important pathway of n loss in agricultural ecosystems youssef et al 2006 thus the model s ability to predict denitrification rate accurately can influence the overall model performance the average annual n loss through denitrification process predicted by the model was 23 6 kg n ha 1 which was in the similar range reported by youssef et al 2006 negm et al 2014b thorp et al 2009 and craft et al 2018 the other minor pathways for n losses such as deep seepage and surface runoff was predicted to be 1 55 and 6 81 kg n ha 1 respectively which represent 0 3 and 1 5 respectively of total n losses from the system annual changes of soil n storage ranged from a to net loss of 110 3 kg n ha 1 in 1992 to a net gain of 70 5 kg n ha 1 in 1997 over the period of seven year simulation soil n storage was decreased by 90 9 kg n ha 1 the net gain in soil n storage in the year 1997 resulted from low plant n uptake and small drainage n losses as affected by low rainfall 3 4 long term simulations 3 4 1 effects of n application rates and timing drainmod dssat was used to simulate the effect of n application rates and timings on corn yield and no3 n losses in fd and cd conditions three n application rates base rate 215 kg ha 1 10 reduced n rate 194 kg ha 1 and 20 reduced n rate 172 kg ha 1 were simulated for four different application timings s s sd f s and f s sd to determine effects on both yield and no3 n losses as compared to the conventional application method n rate of 215 kg ha 1 and spring pre plant application under fd condition the long term simulation results showed a decrease in corn yield and n leaching losses with a reduction in n rates for all application timings and drainage conditions table 9 this result agrees with the empirical relationship developed by malone et al 2007b using 10 years 1994 2003 field measured data in iowa the model results indicated corn yield reduction of 2 6 and no3 n losses reduction of 3 9 with 10 and 20 reduced n application rate compared to the base rate for different application timings the comparison between fd and cd on corn yield and no3 n losses for each n application timing suggests increased corn yield and reduced no3 n losses under cd condition compared to fd for all application timings table 9 this result was found to be consistent with field study results conducted in north carolina to quantify effects of drainage water management on crop yield poole et al 2013 the comparison was made between each application timing and rate under fd with cd the result showed an increase in corn yield up to 1 5 and a reduction in no3 n losses ranging from 24 1 to 26 4 for soybean yield no comparable difference was found between n application rates and timings under both drainage conditions as expected the median value for predicted soybean yield was 3472 2 kg ha 1 the comparison between different n application timing showed that the split application between spring and side dress s sd had the highest corn yield compared to other practices range of 2 8 likely as a result of increasing plant n uptake side dressing is a common recommendation to supplement the crop fertilizer demand from around v6 vegetative leaf stage 6 through vegetative growth which is the period of maximum n demand for corn ritchie et al 1993 when considering both yield and environmental outcomes the split n application in s sd 50 n rate during spring pre plant and 50 n rate during side dressing was also found to be the most beneficial among all n application timings for both fd and cd in simultaneously reducing n losses while slightly increasing corn yield however changes were relatively modest compared to spring only application s sd increased corn yield 5 and reduced n loss 3 on the other hand the split n application in fall 50 and spring 50 was least effective in reducing n losses and increasing corn yield n loss increased on average by 17 whereas yield decreased by 3 3 4 2 effects of conventional and controlled drainage cd reduces the amounts of drainage outflow thereby reducing n losses and promoting the denitrification process skaggs and chescheir 2003 the long term simulation results showed that on average about 15 33 n leaching losses could be reduced with cd combined with reduce n application rate by 10 and 20 compared to the conventional method this result was found to be consistent with the results from youssef and skaggs 2006 for north carolina sites the comparison between conventional application method rate 215 kg n ha 1 and spring pre plant under fd condition with different n application rates and timings under cd showed that cd generally increases corn yield and reduces n leaching losses table 10 our results suggest that the s sd application timing with 10 and 20 reduced n application rate under cd has a potential to reduce n leaching losses by 30 and 33 respectively without impacting corn yield compared to the conventional application method several field studies also have reported that cd practice has the potential to reduce drainage flow and n leaching losses up to 50 evans et al 1991 woli et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 the long term simulation results showed drainage flow reduction of 45 and n leaching losses reduction ranges from 15 to 33 in cd compared to fd for different n application timing and rates this result was found comparable to other similar studies fang et al 2012 youssef et al 2018 however this reduction in n leaching losses is highly influenced by the seasonal climatic variability for example in a cd setting the overflow level of the drainage water control structure was lowered to drain depth up to 4 weeks prior to the plantation and 3 weeks after planting during this period control drainage provides free drainage condition in the field whereas pre plant n application during this period accelerated mobility of n with drainage water over a period of 25 years 30 of the average annual rainfall occurred between march and may during this period the monthly distribution of drainage flow was about 51 9 of average annual drainage and no3 n losses were about 41 4 of average annual losses the free drainage condition during this period contributed to higher drainage flow and n loss compared to other months similarly the denitrification rate during this period was also slightly low mainly due to low temperature average monthly temperature ranges from 5 7 c 17 5 c representing only 28 7 of average annual denitrification during crop growing season june september the monthly distribution accounted for 38 of the average annual rainfall during this period the overflow level of the control structure was raised to 60 cm depth which restricted drainage flow as a result the drainage flow distribution during this period was only 7 7 of average annual drainage flow and no3 n loss was 17 6 of average annual losses during this period the distribution of denitrification rate accounted 41 8 of average annual denitrification the increase in denitrification rate and reduced drainage flow contributed to the reduction of n leaching losses during this period thus the seasonal variability in rainfall as well as control drainage settings highly influences the drainage flow and n leaching losses in the long run 4 conclusion this study evaluated the performance of an integrated process based model drainmod dssat in simulating the effects of different water and n management practices on hydrology water quality and crop yield for an artificially drained agricultural field in east central illinois the model was tested using 7 years of field measured data from a tile drained field under corn soybean rotation the model calibration and validation results showed very good agreement between predicted and measured drainage flow n loss and crop yield further the calibrated model was used to simulate the effects of three n fertilizer application rates and four n application timings in combination with drainage water management on n loss and crop yield using 27 years of weather data out of which 2 years were used as warm up period for model stabilization based on simulation results the split n application s sd was found to be the most effective in modestly increasing corn yield while simultaneously reducing n leaching losses on average the split n application s sd has the potential to increase corn yield by 9 2 and 5 and decrease in n leaching losses by 17 13 and 3 compared to f s f s sd and s only applications respectively simulation results suggest that the implementation of cd can further reduce n leaching losses without affecting crop productivity indicating the need for future field experiments to explore the effectiveness of this management approach cd limits the volume of drainage outflow and thus the delivery of associated n from the field it possess great potential in conserving soil water and improving crop yield mainly during dry period of the growing season however proper drainage water management strategy should be adopted to avoid crop damage due to excess water stress during wet years as saturated soil restricts adequate oxygen supply to crop roots applying 10 reduced n rates 194 kg n ha 1 which is equivalent to mrtn mean rate of 196 kg n ha 1 using split n between s sd under cd condition could potentially reduce n leaching losses by 30 and increase corn yield by 3 i e 290 kg ha 1 compared to the conventional method similarly a 20 reduced n rate 172 kg n ha 1 equivalent to mrtn low rate of 175 kg n ha 1 using split n between s sd under cd condition could reduce n leaching losses by 33 without impacting corn yield compared to the conventional method for all n application rates and timings soybean yield remains unaffected the present simulation using drainmod dssat helped to evaluate the effects of n application rates and timings in both fd and cd systems on crop productivity and n losses in a specific agricultural environment further this study has shown the

10530,agricultural system modeling has become an effective tool for analyzing and quantifying the effects of varying management practices and environmental conditions on crop production and nutrient export from croplands the use of such modeling tools provides useful insights in identifying the most effective management practices for enhancing productivity sustainability and resiliency of agricultural systems this study focuses on testing and application of an integrated field scale process based model drainmod dssat for simulating hydrology nitrate nitrogen no3 n loss and crop growth and yield responses in artificially drained croplands the tested model was used to evaluate the effects of different n fertilizer application rates and timings in both conventional and controlled drainage conditions on crop yield and no3 n losses in a poorly drained drummer flanagan soil in east central illinois the model was calibrated and validated for a corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l rotation using 7 years 1992 1998 of field measured tile drainage crop yield and no3 n data the graphical and statistical evaluations indicated very good model performance specifically monthly tile drainage flow was predicted with modeling efficiency nse index of agreement d and mean absolute error mae of 0 85 0 96 and 0 69 cm respectively monthly no3 n losses were predicted with nse d and mae of 0 82 0 95 and 1 16 kg n ha 1 respectively corn and soybean yields were predicted with an absolute percent error pe of 1 84 and 12 07 respectively the long term model simulation results indicated that split n application of 50 during spring pre plant s and 50 during side dressing sd could increase crop yield and reduce n leaching losses compared to other tested n application methods spring s only fall spring split f s and fall spring side dressing f s sd further applying 10 and 20 reduced n rates 194 kg n ha 1 and 174 kg n ha 1 respectively in combination with s sd split application in controlled drainage cd condition could reduce n leaching losses by 30 and 33 respectively compared to the conventional application method this study explored the effects of n fertilizer management on crop yield and nitrogen losses under two drainage conditions and underscored the importance of n fertilizer application rates and timings for achieving yield goals while minimizing nitrogen export from drained agricultural fields the results of the model simulations will be useful for stakeholders and policy makers while making decisions regarding promotion and adoption of best management practices for drained agricultural landscapes keywords hydrological modeling nitrogen management subsurface drainage controlled drainage corn and soybean yield 1 introduction management of nutrients in drained agricultural lands has become a pressing challenge for researchers policymakers farmers and other stakeholders meisinger and delgado 2002 commercial fertilizers applied to enhance crop production on drained fields are not entirely consumed by the plants and therefore a portion is transported to surface waters via an accelerated pathway provided by tile drainage systems david et al 2010 gentry et al 1998 meisinger and delgado 2002 the movement of highly water soluble nutrients such as nitrate nitrogen no3 n with drainage water leads to nutrient enrichment of surface water bodies causing water quality deterioration and eutrophication problems petrolia and gowda 2006 rabalais et al 2014 randall and mulla 2001 studies have shown that the majority of no3 n transport to the gulf of mexico is via the mississippi river which originates from the upper basin in the midwest corn belt states where a significant portion of the agricultural landscape is artificially drained alexander et al 2008 rebich et al 2011 the continuous expansion of tile drainage in agricultural lands and concomitant use of commercial fertilizers have made surface water and groundwater more vulnerable to water quality impairment david et al 2010 dinnes et al 2002 in recent decades research has focused on developing best management practices bmps to curtail nutrient losses from drained agricultural fields dinnes et al 2002 evans et al 1991 luo et al 2010 mitsch et al 2001 strock et al 2004 for example these bmps include edge of field practices such as saturated buffers constructed wetlands denitrifying bioreactors controlled drainage and in field practices such as crop rotation cover crops and nutrient application rates christianson et al 2016 however the implementation and effectiveness of these practices can vary widely with field characteristics cropping systems soil types and climatic conditions kladivko et al 1999 randall and mulla 2001 in an attempt to reduce n footprints of crop production the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy il nlrs proposed three practices in field edge of the field and land use change to reduce no3 n losses by 15 from agricultural fields of northern illinois and 20 from central illinois by 2025 iepa and idoa 2015 the in field practice emphasizes n fertilizer application timing and recommended n application rates for illinois based on the maximum return to nitrogen mrtn calculator the inrls suggests three n application timing alternatives to reduce n loading and achieve maximum crop production however the effectiveness of these alternative n application timings was estimated based on the results reported by clover 2005 and gentry et al 2014 and did not account for long term effects of weather variability and drainage water management practice on n leaching losses and crop production for example clover 2005 reported the effects of n application during fall spring pre plant and side dressing on n losses and corn yield from 2000 to 2004 however the study did not account for controlled drainage or long term weather variability similarly gentry et al 2014 reported variation in riverine nitrate using a regression model for two drained watersheds based on nitrate data from 1993 to 2012 which did not consider the site specific evaluation of n application rates and timing on n losses and crop yield moreover at a broader scale in the il nlrs the range of n application rates low mean and high provided by mrtn to maximize profitability for corn does not consider off site environmental impacts sawyer et al 2006 thus to provide a better understanding of the effects of alternative n application timing and rates in achieving the n loss reduction goal field specific evaluations are important to evaluate the impacts of different in field practices on multiple components of n cycling and crop productivity agricultural system models can be effective tools for analyzing and supplementing understanding of various field processes and controlling mechanisms ale et al 2012 thorp et al 2009 youssef et al 2006 different computer simulation models such as root zone water quality model rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 agricultural production system simulator apsim mccown et al 1996 drainmod skaggs 1978 drainmod nii youssef et al 2005b and agricultural policy environmental extender apex williams et al 2006 have been developed and employed by researchers to design and evaluate bmps in different contexts for example rzwqm has been used to simulate the effects of drainage water management n rates and weather on n leaching losses in drained fields and crop yields fang et al 2012 jeong and bhattarai 2018 ma et al 2007 saseendran et al 2007 apsim model was used for simulating the effects of agricultural management practices on n leaching losses and crop yield under subsurface drainage systems malone et al 2007a ojeda et al 2018 similarly drainmod nii was used to evaluate the performance of controlled drainage cd across the midwest youssef et al 2018 quantifying drainage flow and n leaching losses reduction under a wide range of soil types climatic conditions and management practices negm et al 2016 drainmod and drainmod nii have been widely used for designing and evaluating a wide range of management practices for sustainable agriculture under varying environmental conditions however these models were focused on hydrology and lacked crop growth modules that can predict plant phenological development and growth for varying genetics and environmental conditions negm et al 2014a thus the crop growth modules of dssat v4 0 hoogenboom et al 2004 were integrated with drainmod nii to improve the crop growth component of the model which has made it more suitable for simulating and predicting crop growth and yield along with hydrology and water quality negm et al 2014a this newly developed model has been evaluated for different drainage practices and nutrient management scenarios using field measured data in two u s midwestern states iowa and indiana and has shown promising potential for simulating drainage outflow no3 n loss and crop yield negm et al 2014a 2014b 2017 additional testing of the model in the u s midwest region is still needed extensive model performance evaluation in wide range of soil management and climatic conditions provides opportunity to establish higher credibility in intended use of the model improvement in model algorithms and expansion to a robust agro ecosystem model the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of drainmod dssat for predicting the hydrology no3 n losses and crop yield for the conditions of east central illinois using seven years 1992 1998 of field measured data the calibrated model was then used to simulate the effects of different n rates and timings on crop yield and n losses in both conventional and controlled drainage conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data description the study site is located in little vermillion river lvr watershed near danville 87 43 24 w and 39 58 55 in east central illinois usa fig 1 the climate of the region is classified as temperate with somewhat hot summer and an average annual rainfall of 990 mm isws 2017 the watershed exhibits typical plains characteristics of flat topography with naturally poorly drained dark prairie soils classified as silt loam and silty clay loam mitchell et al 2000 the soils on the site are predominantly characterized as drummer silty clay loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic endoaquolls with 4 5 7 organic matter content and flanagan silt loam fine smectitic mesic aquic argiudolls with 3 5 5 organic matter content these soils are poorly drained with 0 2 slope although eight field sites were established for a long term water quality monitoring project kalita et al 2006 mitchell et al 2000 monitoring results from one field site site a between 1992 and 1998 was used for this study all decisions regarding crop tillage and fertilizer management practices at the study site were made by the landowner and the information on the adopted practices was documented table 1 kalita et al 2006 the site was chisel plowed and disked or field cultivated each year and all n fertilizer was applied prior to planting corn kalita et al 2006 mitchell et al 2000 the 4 86 ha site was drained with an irregularly random spaced tile drainage system installed at a depth of 1 10 m mitchell et al 2000 the irregularly random spaced tile drainage systems are not spaced in a parallel manner and this type of subsurface drain installation specifically targets depressional areas in the fields rainfall data for the period 1992 1998 were recorded on site using tipping bucket rain gauges surface runoff was monitored using palmer bowlus flumes during each rainfall events whereas tile drainage flow at the site was continuously monitored using palmer bowlus flumes installed in access manholes near each drainage system outlet and data loggers were used to record the time stage data by increments of the stage from stage recorder kalita et al 2006 mitchell et al 2000 for monitoring no3 n water samples were taken automatically by auto water samplers activated by the data logger and additional water samples were collected bi weekly mitchell et al 2000 the analysis of no3 n concentration in the drainage water was conducted using the hydrazine sulfate reduction method and no3 n mass loss was determined as the product of drainage flow volume and the concentration of no3 n in drainage water mitchell et al 2000 2 2 model description drainmod dssat negm et al 2014a is an integrated comprehensive model that simulates hydrological biogeochemical and plant growth processes for agro ecosystems on shallow water table soils with artificial drainage specifically the model was developed by coupling the hydrological model drainmod skaggs et al 2012 and the carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics model drainmod nii youssef et al 2005a with the dssat v4 0 hoogenboom et al 2004 deterministic crop growth models ceres maize jones et al 1986 cropgro soybean boote et al 1998 and cropsim ceres wheat ritchie and otter 1985 drainmod can predict hydrologic variables such as infiltration subsurface drainage surface runoff water table depth evapotranspiration vertical and lateral seepage and water free pore space in the soil profile on daily monthly and annual bases the infiltration rate is computed using green and ampt 1911 method and subsurface drainage is calculated using steady state hooghoudt bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 for water table drawdown conditions and kirkham 1957 equation for ponded surface conditions the model computes potential evapotranspiration pet using temperature based thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 1957 method by default but it can be set to read user defined daily pet input files for default pet calculations monthly correction factors are used to correct pet estimated by thornthwaite method the model uses the heat flow equation to predict soil temperature and effects of soil freezing thawing and snow accumulation and melt on hydrologic predictions for cold regions luo et al 2000 the model computes vertical and lateral seepage if any using relatively simple method based on darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer assumptions skaggs et al 2012 the c and n dynamics model drainmod nii simulates soil n cycle in drained agricultural land under varying water and management practices and environmental conditions the model simulates n dynamics using three soil n pools nitrate no3 n ammonical nh4 n and organic n nitrogen transformation processes simulated by the model includes n inputs to the soil system from atmospheric deposition mineralization of organic n plant uptake n fixation by legumes application of inorganic n fertilizers application of organic n such as plant residues and manure ammonia volatilization nitrification denitrification n losses via subsurface drainage surface runoff and vertical seepage youssef et al 2005a the model simulates n transport through soil profile using multiphase form of the one dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation which solved numerically using a first order finite difference approximation youssef et al 2005a the carbon cycle in the model comprised of three soil organic matter pools active slow passive two above and two below ground litter pools metabolic and structural and a surface microbial pool whereas the nitrogen cycle comprised of three nitrogen pools nitrate nitrogen ammoniacal nitrogen organic nitrogen the model requires several carbon nitrogen related inputs for simulation which includes crop management n transport n transformation and organic matter parameters in addition to soil properties and weather input data the model uses finite difference to a multiphase one dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation to simulate n reactive transport the model output includes concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in soil solution and drainage water soil organic content of the top 20 cm soil layers and rates of simulated n processes on daily monthly and annual time scale youssef and skaggs 2006 ceres maize is the corn growth model in which the life cycle of corn is divided into nine different phases from sowing to physiological maturity each requiring accumulation of defined thermal units or growing degree days gdd before transitioning to next phase the model simulates daily crop water uptake as the summation of soil moisture extracted from each soil layer which is a function of root density and extractable soil water for a given soil layer negm et al 2014a the relative effect of deficit n supply is computed based on the n deficiency indicator nfac on different growth processes separately cropgro soybean simulates the growth and development of soybean the model uses a flexible approach that allows crop development at different growth phases up to thirteen phases to be differentially sensitive to photoperiod temperature water and n stresses boote et al 1998 the model computes physiological time development rates based on temperature photoperiod and water and nutrients conditions the model uses different temperature functions before and after flowering to predict the reproductive phenology of soybean the model follows a computational approach similar to ceres maize for computing water and nutrient stresses readers are referred to jones et al 1986 boote et al 1998 negm et al 2017 and negm et al 2014a for a detail description of crop growth modules and the integration of these modules with drainmod 2 3 drainmod dssat model integration drainmod dssat model integration allows data transfer and feedback between individual models on a daily time step negm 2011 briefly on each simulation day draimod and drainmod nii simultaneously simulate hydrologic variables and c n dynamics on the first day planting day of crop growing season the crop component calls the suitable crop module for initialization and model parameterization during the crop growing season drainmod provides the crop model with daily soil water soil temperature and weather data including maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and pet and drainmod nii provides the soil n available for plant uptake then the crop module convert drainmod predicted pet into potential plant transpiration pt0 based on the light extinction coefficient and simulated leaf area index lai in this integration actual daily root water uptake which represents plant transpiration is either equal to or less than drainmod calculated et but not higher the variable plant transpiration is a function of simulated lai root vigor as well as soil water availability defined by drainmod hydrologic compartment if root water uptake is insufficient to meet pt0 demand the crop model applies two water stress factors swfac and turfac the swfac stress factor reduces photosynthesis and biomass production whereas turfac restricts the expansive growth of crops the insufficiency in root water uptake can occur by either deficit soil water under dry conditions or excess soil water under saturated condition that prevents sufficient oxygen supply to crop roots in addition the crop module computes day length and hourly weather data if needed based on the daily measured data utilizing subroutines adapted from the dssat weather module after crop model completes crop growth simulations it returns the effective rooting depth the upper root zone where the majority of the root biomass exists to drainmod to complete soil water balance simulation for the day and update soil water profile for the next day of simulation drainmod nii receives daily hydrologic predictions from drainmod and the effective rooting depth and plant n uptake from crop model to complete simulation of c and n dynamics and update the soil n balance for the next day of simulation on the last day harvesting day of the growing season crop model provides drainmod nii with unharvested above and below ground biomass with their n content for residue recycling during the non growing season simulations become limited to water and n balance components only 2 4 model parameterization calibration and evaluation drainmod dssat model requires a number of input parameters to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes and interaction between them the model was calibrated and validated using seven years 1992 1998 of measured data of daily drainage flow no3 n losses and crop yields the calibration period was 1992 1995 and the validation period was 1996 1998 a warm up period 1990 1991 was used to initialize and stabilize the model simulation since random irregularly spaced tile drainage was used at the study site the trial and error method was used to adjust the tile drain spacing during the calibration process the process of calibration and validation followed the order of hydrology n and crop growth components calibration and repetitive iterations were performed using a number of parameters until optimal statistical indices were obtained for this study rainfall data was collected from the research site temperature data was obtained from a nearby weather station isws 2017 and daily pet was estimated by the model using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 monthly correction factors table 2 were applied to adjust the pet estimation for illinois conditions northcott 1999 the soil characteristics and profile details are referenced from the nrcs soil survey report for vermilion county illinois the soil profile was divided into five layers and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity values were referenced from northcott 1999 to initialize the model and some adjustments were made during the calibration process to improve model predictions soil temperature related parameters for freezing and thawing conditions were adopted from negm et al 2014b the model parameters such as maximum surface storage roughness of soil surface or depressional depth thickness of the restrictive layer and the piezometric head of the aquifer below the restrictive layer hydraulic head referenced at bottom of the restrictive layer are difficult to measure and thus were modified to improve the model performance and statistical goodness of fit table 2 tillage management inputs were set according to the implemented tillage practice at the study site the average fertilizer application rate for corn years over the study period was 215 kg n ha 1 and no fertilizer was applied in soybean years n transport and n transformation parameters required by the drainmod nii model to simulate n were obtained from different studies conducted in surrounding regions with similar soil type and environmental conditions and slight modification in few parameters were made to improve model prediction table 3 negm et al 2017 thorp et al 2009 youssef and skaggs 2006 youssef et al 2018 the major parameters for n simulation include n transport nitrification denitrification and soil organic matters som detail descriptions of c and n parameters terminologies and default values can be found elsewhere youssef and skaggs 2006 youssef et al 2005a youssef 2004 to simulate carbon dynamics in soil the model requires potential decomposition rates and c n ratios for different organic matter pools which were also adopted from different literature negm et al 2014a youssef et al 2006 and are presented in table 3 the ammonium and nitrate concentrations in rainfall water were set to 0 4 mgnl 1 and 1 4 gmnl 1 respectively based on data obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program nadp gay 2008 for crop growth and yield simulation the dssat crop module was provided with reasonable crop cultivar coefficients and planting characteristics such as row spacing and plant population suitable for illinois fields for soybean savoy sb0304 cultivar was selected for this study the crop coefficient values of selected cultivar were compared with negm et al 2017 for central iowa and were found to simulate the crop growth and phenological development of soybean reasonably well for the study site for corn crop growth and phenological development values were referenced from negm et al 2014b for indiana site and negm et al 2017 for central iowa site during the model calibration some cultivar parameters for corn were modified to improve the model prediction this includes modification of thermal time from seedling emergence to the end of the juvenile phase and thermal time from silking to physiological maturity as described in negm et al 2017 the cultivar coefficients used to simulate the corn and soybean growth are presented in table 4 2 5 model evaluation criteria the performance of drainmod dssat was evaluated by comparing model predictions and measured data of drainage flow nitrate loss and crop yield using the following statistical goodness of fit measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d mean absolute error mae and normalized root mean squared error n rmse in this study the model performance evaluation criteria recommended by skaggs et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2015 were used the model performance for predicting monthly drainage flow and nitrate loss is considered good if 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good if 0 75 nse 1 the performance evaluation of crop growth model is most commonly accessed using percent error pe and n rmse model performance is considered good when 10 n rmse 20 and very good when n rmse 10 jamieson et al 1991 in addition to statistical performance measures graphical performance measures were assessed using time series scatter plots and box plots to provide visual insights into the temporal behavior of the model moriasi et al 2015 a detailed explanation of both statistical and graphical performance measures can be found in moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 2 6 model application after model performance evaluation the model was used to evaluate the effects of n loss reduction strategies that include n fertilizer application rates and timings and drainage water management practices on nitrate loss and crop yields in the study three n application rates and four application timings were considered for both conventional and controlled drainage cd conditions conventional drainage also referred as free drainage fd allows unrestricted flow of subsurface drainage water from the fields whereas cd also referred as managed drainage or drainage water management utilizes a control structure at the outlet of subsurface drain lines to regulate drainage water flow from the field using a gate assembly it is a cost effective practice that helps in maintaining adequate soil water level in the root zone during the crop growing season while minimizing drainage outflow during non growing season the effects of fertilizer rates and timings were simulated by reducing application rate by 10 and 20 from the base application rate for four timings spring pre plant s spring pre plant side dressing s sd fall spring pre plant f s and fall spring pre plant side dressing f s sd the base rate of n application at the study site was determined to be 215 kg ha by averaging the fertilizer application years the three rates considered for this study corresponds to high 215 kg ha medium 194 kg n ha 1 and low 172 kg n ha 1 rates all within the range of maximum profitability determined by mrtn calculator for central illinois conditions and a corn soybean rotation mrtn 2018 the mrtn estimated n rates for illinois are based on n response data assembled from 185 soybean corn trial sites across illinois sawyer et al 2006 the effects of rates and n application timings in this study are designed based on fertilizer application practices included in illinois nutrient loss reduction strategies inrls report inlrs report has presented three n application practices 100 n application in spring pre plant s only split n application 50 50 in fall spring pre plant fs and split n application 40 fall 10 spring pre plant and 50 side dressing in fall spring pre plant side dressing fssd iepa and idoa 2015 along with these three application timings split n application 50 50 in spring pre plant and side dressing ssd was also considered in this study twenty seven years of climatological data 1990 2016 was used for long term simulation the soil organic matter module of the model was initialized using the first two years of model simulation and the remaining 25 years of model simulations were used to analyze the influence of management and drainage scenarios on crop yield and n dynamics the scenarios presented in table 5 were accessed and analyzed 3 result and discussion 3 1 hydrology hydrologic calibration procedure for drainmod dssat is similar to the calibration of drainmod described by skaggs et al 2012 model simulated average annual hydrologic components for fd system from 1992 to 1998 are presented in table 6 in the table each hydrologic component is expressed as a percent of rainfall to indicate the relative magnitude over the seven year study period the average annual rainfall was 98 9 cm the years 1992 and 1996 experienced average rainfall 1993 and 1998 experienced above average rainfall by 31 and 28 respectively and the years 1994 1995 and 1997 experienced below average rainfall by 15 20 and 25 respectively about 63 of rainfall occurred from march through august with 19 rainfall in march april and 45 rainfall in may august the percentage of annual rainfall that was lost via subsurface drainage flow varied considerably between the years 17 42 due to temporal variability in the rainfall magnitude the drainage flow during crop growing season april to october represented about 54 of total annual drainage whereas 46 of total annual drainage during non growing season november to march the difference in cumulative drainage flow and measured drainage flow was very small predicted cumulative 176 2 cm vs measured cumulative 177 2 cm over a period of seven years fig 2 illustrates a scatter plot comparing measured and predicted monthly drainage rates over the study period drainmod dssat accurately simulated monthly drainage flow with overall nse and index of agreement values of 0 85 and 0 96 respectively which can be rated as very good according to model performance evaluation guidelines suggested by moriasi et al 2015 and skaggs et al 2012 the mae of model predicted monthly drainage was found very small 0 69 cm when compared with the standard deviation of measured monthly drainage 2 88 cm which also indicates excellent model performance as well a two tailed student t test showed that the measured monthly drainage flow was not significantly different p 0 964 at 95 confidence level from the predicted monthly drainage flow the model performance for calibration years 1992 1995 was found to have nse d and mae of 0 87 0 96 and 0 64 cm respectively whereas nse d and mae were calculated to be 0 82 0 95 and 0 77 cm respectively for validation years 1996 1998 fig 3 illustrates the distribution of monthly measured and predicted drainage flow over the period of 1992 1998 the distribution showed wide month to month variability in both measured and predicted drainage flows the distribution pattern of measured and predicted drainage flow showed high variability in drainage flow during march may the average predicted and measured drainage flow during these months accounted for 43 and 47 of total drainage flow respectively during the crop growing period june september the variability in drainage flow was observed only in june and july the drainage flow was small from august to october the winter months november december were also found to have a wide variation in drainage flow however the mean monthly drainage flow during november and december was found to be close to the lower quartile which indicated that about 25 of drainage flow during these two months was below the mean flow on a daily basis model predicted and measured drainage flows also showed good agreement yet there were few peak events the model did not accurately predicted such as the flow events in november 1992 november 1993 april 1994 and february 1997 when the model under predicted drainage flow fig 4 such errors could be a result of less accurate estimation of infiltration due to freezing and thawing conditions during winter months which may have caused prediction of higher surface runoff however such postulation is difficult to confirm without actual field measurements the mean and standard deviation of model predicted daily drainage was very similar predicted 0 0687 0 1349 cm vs measured 0 0692 0 1642 cm the statistical indices for model predictions were nse 0 71 d 0 91 and mae 0 04 cm d 1 in the year 1998 the model over predicted drainage mostly during winter months and early spring when the snow starts to melt for all other years predicted drainage found in good agreement with measured drainage evapotranspiration et resulted in the maximum water loss from the system the model predicted et averaged at 61 8 cm representing 62 5 of average annual rainfall and is found to have consistent partitioning rate reported by negm et al 2014a fang et al 2012 and thorp et al 2007 for sites in iowa which has similar drained landscape climate and agricultural practices as in illinois the predicted et was also found within the range of the modeled et reported by sanford and selnick 2013 using the water balance model across the conterminous us the reported et range was 50 79 for the midwest region and 60 69 for central illinois the model predicted surface runoff and deep seepage represented minor pathways for water loss from the system the predicted average annual deep seepage loss was 5 6 cm representing 5 7 of average annual rainfall according to model prediction surface runoff accounted for 6 8 of average annual rainfall which was slightly higher compared to measured runoff of 2 however the result was found comparable with rzwqm simulation results reported by jeong and bhattarai 2018 for the same site most surface runoff events occurred in 1993 and 1998 when the rainfall was 25 higher than the average rainfall 3 2 crop growth and yield drainmod dssat performed well in predicting crop yields field measured crop yield was compared with predicted crop yield and the model performance for the calibration years and validation years was assessed using two statistical indices percent error pe and normalized root mean squared error n rmse drainmod dssat predicted corn yield with an absolute percent error of 1 84 and n rmse of 2 1 and soybean yield was predicted with an absolute percent error of 12 07 and n rmse of 17 5 table 7 the model over predicted soybean yield in the year 1996 and 1998 with pe of 25 32 and 28 45 respectively to understand why model over predicted soybean yield in those years we examined the crop growth output provided by the cropgro soybean we found that the model simulated higher root density cm cm3 in upper soil layers soil layer 1 3 in response to adequate soil moisture conditions during june and july which represent major crop growth period also we examined the rainfall received in june and july in both years and found that june and july received adequate amount of rainfall which may have contributed to even crop growth and higher grain yield simulation by the model similarly we examined n uptake by corn in 1995 and 1997 and found low plant n uptake in june and july the low plant n uptake may be due to direct result of poor rainfall in those two months which may have caused model to slightly under predict corn yield in those two years these results are reasonably comparable with findings reported by jeong and bhattarai 2018 for the same site using rzwqm and negm et al 2014b for indiana sites using drainmod dssat 3 3 nitrogen dynamics and nitrate n losses due to the complex nature of n dynamics in the soil water plant system it is challenging to quantify n leaching losses accurately one step in better predictions of n losses is to enable proper quantification of different soil n transformation processes under a range of environmental conditions youssef et al 2006 overall drainmod dssat performed very well in predicting annual no3 n losses in subsurface drainage the cumulative no3 n loss measured over the study period was 263 8 kg n ha 1 and the predicted was 262 8 kg n ha 1 pe of 0 36 fig 5 illustrates a scatter plot comparing predicted and measured monthly no3 n losses indicating good agreement between measured and predicted values the statistical indices nse d and mae for monthly no3 n losses over the period of 1992 1998 were found 0 82 0 95 and 1 16 kg n ha 1 respectively for calibration and validations years the statistical indices nse d and mae were found to be 0 87 and 0 76 0 97 and 0 93 and 0 95 and 1 43 kg n ha 1 respectively which indicated an overall very good model performance in predicting monthly n losses the majority predicted 66 vs measured 73 of n losses occurred between early spring february april and the mid crop growing period may july which covers the periods when snow started to melt and most spring rainfall occurred fig 6 illustrates the distribution of monthly measured and predicted no3 n loss over the period of 1992 1998 the distribution shows month to month variability in both measured and predicted n loss and follows a similar distribution pattern as that of monthly drainage flow the overall distribution of measured and predicted no3 n loss was similar the month of may had the highest variability in n losses compared to other months the mean monthly measured and predicted n loss for may suggest that about 50 of the no3 n loss were less than the mean value and 50 were greater than the mean value during the crop growing period june september the variability in no3 n loss was observed only in june and july the no3 n loss was minimum from august to october the winter months november december were also found to have a wide variation in n loss however the mean monthly no3 n loss during november and december was found close to the lower quartile which suggests that about 25 of no3 n loss during these two months were below the mean value the simulated net n mineralization ranged from 16 1 kg n ha 1 in 1997 to 200 0 kg n ha 1 in 1998 with an average annual net mineralization rate of 112 4 kg n ha 1 table 8 which is reasonable compared with values reported by negm et al 2014a and craft et al 2018 for iowa however similar studies also have reported higher net n mineralization in corn soybean cropping system in nearby locations for example thorp et al 2009 reported drainmod nii simulated average annual net n mineralization of 124 6 kg n ha 1 in a study conduct in iowa using 10 years of field data and qi et al 2011 reported average annual net n mineralization of 224 1 and 167 7 kg n ha 1 with and without rye cover crop respectively for corn soybean rotation in north central iowa using rzwqm2 higher net n mineralization in year 1998 is due to warmer winter months and low n immobilization whereas lower net n mineralization in 1997 is direct result of low mineralization and higher immobilization the model does not directly output the n addition in the soil through residue incorporation and therefore n mass added through crop residue incorporation was estimated using the relationship used by youssef et al 2005a for calculating plant shoot and root dry matter the estimated range of n addition from residue incorporation ranged from 57 2 145 2 kg n ha 1 in agroecosystems plant n uptake represents a major flux of the n cycle and therefore it is considered as an important component for analysis of n dynamics youssef et al 2006 the annual average n plant uptake predicted by the model for corn years averaged at 188 9 kg n ha 1 for soybean years the total plant uptake from both soil and n fixation predicted by the model averaged at 349 9 kg n ha 1 while difficult to measure directly denitrification is an important pathway of n loss in agricultural ecosystems youssef et al 2006 thus the model s ability to predict denitrification rate accurately can influence the overall model performance the average annual n loss through denitrification process predicted by the model was 23 6 kg n ha 1 which was in the similar range reported by youssef et al 2006 negm et al 2014b thorp et al 2009 and craft et al 2018 the other minor pathways for n losses such as deep seepage and surface runoff was predicted to be 1 55 and 6 81 kg n ha 1 respectively which represent 0 3 and 1 5 respectively of total n losses from the system annual changes of soil n storage ranged from a to net loss of 110 3 kg n ha 1 in 1992 to a net gain of 70 5 kg n ha 1 in 1997 over the period of seven year simulation soil n storage was decreased by 90 9 kg n ha 1 the net gain in soil n storage in the year 1997 resulted from low plant n uptake and small drainage n losses as affected by low rainfall 3 4 long term simulations 3 4 1 effects of n application rates and timing drainmod dssat was used to simulate the effect of n application rates and timings on corn yield and no3 n losses in fd and cd conditions three n application rates base rate 215 kg ha 1 10 reduced n rate 194 kg ha 1 and 20 reduced n rate 172 kg ha 1 were simulated for four different application timings s s sd f s and f s sd to determine effects on both yield and no3 n losses as compared to the conventional application method n rate of 215 kg ha 1 and spring pre plant application under fd condition the long term simulation results showed a decrease in corn yield and n leaching losses with a reduction in n rates for all application timings and drainage conditions table 9 this result agrees with the empirical relationship developed by malone et al 2007b using 10 years 1994 2003 field measured data in iowa the model results indicated corn yield reduction of 2 6 and no3 n losses reduction of 3 9 with 10 and 20 reduced n application rate compared to the base rate for different application timings the comparison between fd and cd on corn yield and no3 n losses for each n application timing suggests increased corn yield and reduced no3 n losses under cd condition compared to fd for all application timings table 9 this result was found to be consistent with field study results conducted in north carolina to quantify effects of drainage water management on crop yield poole et al 2013 the comparison was made between each application timing and rate under fd with cd the result showed an increase in corn yield up to 1 5 and a reduction in no3 n losses ranging from 24 1 to 26 4 for soybean yield no comparable difference was found between n application rates and timings under both drainage conditions as expected the median value for predicted soybean yield was 3472 2 kg ha 1 the comparison between different n application timing showed that the split application between spring and side dress s sd had the highest corn yield compared to other practices range of 2 8 likely as a result of increasing plant n uptake side dressing is a common recommendation to supplement the crop fertilizer demand from around v6 vegetative leaf stage 6 through vegetative growth which is the period of maximum n demand for corn ritchie et al 1993 when considering both yield and environmental outcomes the split n application in s sd 50 n rate during spring pre plant and 50 n rate during side dressing was also found to be the most beneficial among all n application timings for both fd and cd in simultaneously reducing n losses while slightly increasing corn yield however changes were relatively modest compared to spring only application s sd increased corn yield 5 and reduced n loss 3 on the other hand the split n application in fall 50 and spring 50 was least effective in reducing n losses and increasing corn yield n loss increased on average by 17 whereas yield decreased by 3 3 4 2 effects of conventional and controlled drainage cd reduces the amounts of drainage outflow thereby reducing n losses and promoting the denitrification process skaggs and chescheir 2003 the long term simulation results showed that on average about 15 33 n leaching losses could be reduced with cd combined with reduce n application rate by 10 and 20 compared to the conventional method this result was found to be consistent with the results from youssef and skaggs 2006 for north carolina sites the comparison between conventional application method rate 215 kg n ha 1 and spring pre plant under fd condition with different n application rates and timings under cd showed that cd generally increases corn yield and reduces n leaching losses table 10 our results suggest that the s sd application timing with 10 and 20 reduced n application rate under cd has a potential to reduce n leaching losses by 30 and 33 respectively without impacting corn yield compared to the conventional application method several field studies also have reported that cd practice has the potential to reduce drainage flow and n leaching losses up to 50 evans et al 1991 woli et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 the long term simulation results showed drainage flow reduction of 45 and n leaching losses reduction ranges from 15 to 33 in cd compared to fd for different n application timing and rates this result was found comparable to other similar studies fang et al 2012 youssef et al 2018 however this reduction in n leaching losses is highly influenced by the seasonal climatic variability for example in a cd setting the overflow level of the drainage water control structure was lowered to drain depth up to 4 weeks prior to the plantation and 3 weeks after planting during this period control drainage provides free drainage condition in the field whereas pre plant n application during this period accelerated mobility of n with drainage water over a period of 25 years 30 of the average annual rainfall occurred between march and may during this period the monthly distribution of drainage flow was about 51 9 of average annual drainage and no3 n losses were about 41 4 of average annual losses the free drainage condition during this period contributed to higher drainage flow and n loss compared to other months similarly the denitrification rate during this period was also slightly low mainly due to low temperature average monthly temperature ranges from 5 7 c 17 5 c representing only 28 7 of average annual denitrification during crop growing season june september the monthly distribution accounted for 38 of the average annual rainfall during this period the overflow level of the control structure was raised to 60 cm depth which restricted drainage flow as a result the drainage flow distribution during this period was only 7 7 of average annual drainage flow and no3 n loss was 17 6 of average annual losses during this period the distribution of denitrification rate accounted 41 8 of average annual denitrification the increase in denitrification rate and reduced drainage flow contributed to the reduction of n leaching losses during this period thus the seasonal variability in rainfall as well as control drainage settings highly influences the drainage flow and n leaching losses in the long run 4 conclusion this study evaluated the performance of an integrated process based model drainmod dssat in simulating the effects of different water and n management practices on hydrology water quality and crop yield for an artificially drained agricultural field in east central illinois the model was tested using 7 years of field measured data from a tile drained field under corn soybean rotation the model calibration and validation results showed very good agreement between predicted and measured drainage flow n loss and crop yield further the calibrated model was used to simulate the effects of three n fertilizer application rates and four n application timings in combination with drainage water management on n loss and crop yield using 27 years of weather data out of which 2 years were used as warm up period for model stabilization based on simulation results the split n application s sd was found to be the most effective in modestly increasing corn yield while simultaneously reducing n leaching losses on average the split n application s sd has the potential to increase corn yield by 9 2 and 5 and decrease in n leaching losses by 17 13 and 3 compared to f s f s sd and s only applications respectively simulation results suggest that the implementation of cd can further reduce n leaching losses without affecting crop productivity indicating the need for future field experiments to explore the effectiveness of this management approach cd limits the volume of drainage outflow and thus the delivery of associated n from the field it possess great potential in conserving soil water and improving crop yield mainly during dry period of the growing season however proper drainage water management strategy should be adopted to avoid crop damage due to excess water stress during wet years as saturated soil restricts adequate oxygen supply to crop roots applying 10 reduced n rates 194 kg n ha 1 which is equivalent to mrtn mean rate of 196 kg n ha 1 using split n between s sd under cd condition could potentially reduce n leaching losses by 30 and increase corn yield by 3 i e 290 kg ha 1 compared to the conventional method similarly a 20 reduced n rate 172 kg n ha 1 equivalent to mrtn low rate of 175 kg n ha 1 using split n between s sd under cd condition could reduce n leaching losses by 33 without impacting corn yield compared to the conventional method for all n application rates and timings soybean yield remains unaffected the present simulation using drainmod dssat helped to evaluate the effects of n application rates and timings in both fd and cd systems on crop productivity and n losses in a specific agricultural environment further this study has shown the need for field specific evaluations of agricultural management practices to minimize n footprints and maximum crop production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10531,automated irrigation scheduling of grain crops using a combination of plant and soil water sensing feedback has not been widely investigated a three year study was conducted at bushland texas to investigate irrigation management of grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l in 2012 using plant feedback with a single thermal stress threshold and in 2018 and 2019 using multiple thermal stress thresholds and a combination of plant and soil water sensing hybrid feedback the goals of the studies were to optimize grain yield crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp using sensor feedback at irrigation levels similar to 80 50 and 30 designated i80 i50 and i30 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity as determined with weekly neutron probe readings the manual method results in 2012 indicated that irrigation scheduling using plant feedback alone with a single thermal stress threshold produced grain yields that were significantly less 0 49 and 0 38 kg m 2 compared with the manual method 0 63 and 0 51 kg m 2 at the i80 and i50 treatment levels respectively however in 2018 the hybrid feedback method produced mean grain yields 0 87 kg m 2 that were significantly greater compared with the plant feedback 0 76 kg m 2 and manual 0 74 kg m 2 irrigation scheduling methods at the i80 treatment level in 2019 mean grain yields 0 86 0 83 and 0 88 kg m 2 cwp 1 25 1 29 and 1 20 kg m 3 and iwp 2 11 2 19 and 1 88 kg m 3 for the hybrid plant feedback and manual methods respectively were similar at the i80 level these results suggest that plant and soil water sensing feedback using multiple thermal stress thresholds and watering levels have the potential to produce optimal crop response for grain sorghum more research is required to test the efficacy of soil water sensing in combination with plant sensing for other crops keywords center pivot sprinkler infrared thermometers sensor networks wireless networks time domain reflectometers 1 introduction optimizing water as an input is critical in the texas high plains region where water for agriculture represents nearly 93 of consumptive water use from the highly depleted ogallala aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 monitoring crop status throughout a field to determine when and how much to irrigate to maximize yields at the field scale level or to improve crop water productivity cwp is not always straight forward and is logistically difficult when managing large size fields and multiple fields differences in the physical aspects of soil topography abiotic stresses and biotic stresses can cause variability in crop water requirements site specific irrigation using a variable rate irrigation sprinkler can apply precise amounts of water in precise locations o shaughnessy et al 2019 however sensor feedback is required to achieve precision timing and amount rodriguez ortega et al 2017 variable rate irrigation vri systems with sensor feedback reduced water consumption goumopoulos et al 2014 and served to maximize grain yields in sorghum corn soybean wheat and peas o shaughnessy et al 2012a sui and yan 2017 li et al 2019 el naggar et al 2020 most of these studies have incorporated soil water sensing to determine when and how much to irrigate more recent studies barker et al 2018a and 2018b bhatti et al 2020 have investigated the use of imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles or from satellites and spatial evapotranspiration models to develop decision support systems for vri systems however these systems do not yet have the ability to automate prescription maps in previous studies at bushland tx automated irrigation scheduling using a supervisory control and data acquisition isscada system was based solely on plant feedback using thermal stress index thresholds such as the time temperature threshold ttt evett et al 1996 peters and evett 2008 o shaughnessy and evett 2010 or a theoretical crop water stress index and time threshold o shaughnessy et al 2012b the early isscada system was comprised of a conventional center pivot sprinkler outfitted with a host computer located at the pivot point software on the computer was used to collect data from a network of infrared thermometers and a nearby weather station variable watering rates for each zone were controlled by nozzle sizes peters and evett 2007 after the center pivot sprinklers at bushland were outfitted with zone control each sprinkler zone contained 6 drops variable rate irrigation vri hardware valmont industries inc valley ne automated irrigation scheduling with the isscada system was accomplished independently for each plant feedback treatment plot however in some experiments the isscada system over irrigated treatment plots especially those designated as severely deficit 25 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity o shaughnessy et al 2015 2017 the over irrigation was primarily due to high infrared thermometer readings caused by soil background due to partial canopy cover in the deficit irrigated plots subsequent to these studies the software controlling the vri sprinklers was transformed into a server client architecture named ars pivot andrade et al 2016 2017 and new tools were added among the newest tools was an application programming interface api for soil water sensors which enabled the isscada system to collect continuous soil water data from wireless distributed soil water sensing stations soil water sensing was combined with plant feedback to provide a closed loop control system to prevent inordinate amounts of over or under irrigation this method is abbreviated as the isscada hybrid o shaughnessy et al 2018 and is an important feature since one of the goals in commercializing the isscada system is that its decision support algorithms adapt to different climates it s possible that plant feedback alone could lead to over irrigation or under irrigation because non stressed baseline thresholds can be different for different climatic regions payero and irmak 2006 abritta and garcia 2012 in humid and sub humid regions humidity can increase canopy temperature by reducing transpiration independent of soil water levels wanjura and upchurch 1997 in semi arid and arid regions cloudy skies can lead to rapid fluctuation in radiation causing stressed plants to have a greater response to rapid changes in radiation agam et al 2011 and continuous cloud cover can also mask the true water status of a crop causing calculated crop water stress index cwsi values to be near zero even when the crop requires water nielsen 1990 finally a multi tiered approach to irrigation scheduling was incorporated into the software this approach required three levels of a thermal stress index maximum medium and minimum and corresponding irrigation depths the thermal stress index was the integrated cwsi icwsi o shaughnessy et al 2017 explained in more detail later in the paper the expectation was that plants experiencing severe stress would indicate high levels of the icwsi and signal the maximum irrigation depth those crops experiencing moderate stress would indicate medium levels of the icwsi and signal the medium irrigation depth and plants experiencing mild stress would indicate low levels of the icwsi and signal the low irrigation depth using multiple icwsi thresholds produced positive results for irrigation management of corn when using the isscada system for irrigation scheduling andrade et al 2017 in this study the objectives were to investigate the performance of an isscada system after changes to include 1 a three tiered approach of irrigation thresholds and corresponding irrigation depths for use in site specific vri replacing a binary system irrigate or do not irrigate 2 the addition of soil water sensing feedback combined with plant feedback referred to as the hybrid method and 3 evaluate both methods of sensor feedback irrigation scheduling compared to a manual control method of

field 2 4 experimental designs 2 4 1 2012 study in 2012 plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two main treatment factors 1 irrigation scheduling methods and 2 irrigation levels treatments irrigation scheduling method by irrigation level was replicated four times the irrigation scheduling methods were an isscada plant feedback approach using an integrated crop water stress index icwsi discussed later in this section and a manual method using weekly neutron probe readings the irrigation treatment levels were 80 65 50 and 30 designated i80 i65 i50 and i30 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity fig 1 dryland plots i0 were established to calculate irrigation water productivity iwp and the i65 treatment level was used to investigate the level of control of the icwsi method i e could the icwsi threshold at the i65 treatment level produce grain yields that were between the i80 and i50 levels 2 4 2 2018 study in 2018 treatment plots were completely randomized fig 2 main treatments were three irrigation scheduling methods and three irrigation levels and dryland treatment plots unique from the 2012 study soil water sensing combined with plant feedback was an added irrigation scheduling method and rather than one icwsi threshold three thresholds with three corresponding irrigation levels were instituted the three irrigation scheduling methods were the 1 isscada plant feedback 2 isscada hybrid combination of soil water sensing and plant feedback and 3 manual the three irrigation treatment levels were i80 i50 i30 where the subscripts represent percent replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity treatments of irrigation scheduling method by irrigation treatment level were replicated four times dryland plots i0 were also established to calculate iwp the thermal stress thresholds were reduced from 2012 to limit water stress 2 4 3 2019 study in 2019 there was a total of 12 treatment plots with three main irrigation scheduling methods manual isscda plant feedback and isscada hybrid identical to those described for the 2018 study again dryland plots were established in the areas designated as border to allow for calculation of iwp the irrigation treatment was limited to the i80 level and plot sizes were increased the change in experimental design was to demonstrate the performance of the isscada system using larger sized plots the three irrigation scheduling methods were retained to investigate their effects on crop response treatment plots were replicated four times fig 3 the main treatments of irrigation scheduling methods irrigation levels sensor network systems and number of irts and soil water sensing stations for the three study years ar summarized in table 2 2 5 irrigation scheduling methods 2 5 1 manual manual irrigations were scheduled every three days as needed in a 7 day period and based on 80 50 and 30 designated m80 m50 and m30 respectively of full replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity in the top 1 5 m 5 ft of soil soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron probe np model 503dr1 5 instrotek campbell pacific nuclear martinez cal in 0 2 m increments from 0 10 m to 2 3 m in the m80 treatment plots access tubes were placed in a row in the center of each plot 24 rows wide the neutron probe was field calibrated to an accuracy of better than 0 01 m3 m 3 resulting in separate calibrations for three distinct soil layers ap bt and btca using methods described by evett 2008 irrigation amounts for the manual control plots over a seven day period were based on weekly neutron probe readings in the m80 plots and soil water depletion to field capacity was replenished at rates of 80 50 and 30 in the plots designated m80 m50 and m30 respectively precipitation occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for the 7 day period was subtracted from the required total 2 5 2 plant feedback canopy temperature and data from a nearby weather station were used to calculate an integrated crop water stress index icwsi the icwsi was calculated from 9 00 a m until 7 00 p m every minute eq 1 1 i c w s i i 1900 0900 t c t a t c t a l l t c t a u l t c t a l l where t c is the scaled canopy temperature determined using the scaling procedure eq 2 described in detail in peters and evett 2004 2 t c t e t r m t t t e t r e f t e t

day remote temperature measurement at time t t ref t is the measured reference temperature made at the same time and t ref is the reference temperature at all other times measured throughout the day all temperatures are in units of c the upper t c t a ul and lower t c t a ll boundaries estimating a fully stressed and a well watered crop respectively were calculated using the theoretical method detailed in jackson et al 1981 1988 irrigation timing was based on exceedance of the icwsi threshold established for the designated irrigation treatment level table 3 the thermal stress thresholds were derived from canopy temperature measurements and weather data the irrigation amounts were based on 80 of the average peak daily water requirements 10 5 mm for grain sorghum grown in bushland tx o shaughnessy et al 2012a 2012b multiplied by the irrigation interval that was established between irrigation events 2 5 days in the 2012 study as mentioned previously the decision support algorithm for the plant feedback method was modified in 2018 to include a minimum medium and maximum icwsi threshold and corresponding irrigation amounts for each irrigation treatment level table 4 the maximum irrigation amount was based on the maximum irrigation that could be applied on this field 36 mm without causing runoff the maximum amount for each irrigation level was based on the percent soil water depletion to field capacity subscript e g for c80 80 of 36 mm is 29 mm 50 of 36 mm is 18 mm 30 of 36 mm is 11 mm the lesser amounts of 7 6 mm and 5 mm represent approximately 20 of maximum irrigation depth for the field and the practical minimum irrigation depth for the center pivot system 2 5 3 hybrid the isscada hybrid irrigation scheduling method was used in 2018 and in 2019 this method combines soil water sensing with plant feedback to determine irrigation timing and depth using pre established thresholds of soil water depletion swd and the icwsi one set of four soil water sensors was installed into each type of hybrid plot along the side of the plant bed where the lesa nozzle traveled the first two sensors were installed horizontally at depths of 10 and 20 cm while the two deeper tdrs 40 and 75 cm were installed vertically so the mid point of the length of the steel rods of the tdr sensor was placed to a depth of either 40 and 75 cm respectively total soil water depletion was calculated by summing the depletion for each soil layer using data from the time domain reflectometry tdr sensors located at each of the four sensor depths i using eq 3 3 s w d i 1 4 x i θ f c i θ v i θ f c i θ p w p i where θ v i θ fc i and θ pwp i represent the measured volumetric water content field capacity and permanent wilting point listed in table 5 data from unger 1996 schwartz et al 2003 heng et al 2009 respectively for each soil layer x i where x is the thickness of the soil layer cm with mid point at depth i soil water depletion thresholds were the ratio of swd swdmax x 100 soil water sensors installed horizontally provide higher resolution sensing and accurate measurements when compared with measurements from a neutron probe chen et al 2019 horizontal installation of tdrs to a deeper depth requires a larger trench for proper insertion of the sensor into the plant bed and the soil must be carefully repacked to maintain original bulk density prevent voids avoid preferential flow conversely installation of tdrs in a vertical manner provided average soil water content representative of the soil from between the midpoint of the steel rods and both the upper and lower depths of the representative layer installation in a vertical manner indicates soil water content at a larger spatial scale musters and bouten 2000 but provides a reasonable approximation of soil water storage in the profile evett et al 2019 miyamoto et al 2001 was able to accurately describe the relationship between volumetric soil water content in minimum and conventional till soils when tdrs were installed in a vertical direction all sensors were installed when the crop was approximately 20 cm tall as mentioned previously a single soil water sensing station was located in each type of hybrid treatment plot h80 h50 and h30 totaling three soil water sensing stations in 2018 and one soil water sensing station in 2019 to manage the h80 designated plots each subscript x in hx represents the irrigation treatment level established using the designated soil water sensing and plant feedback thresholds table 6 while the swd threshold of 50 was from fao 56 allen et al 1998 as listed for sorghum for clarity in 2018 a soil water sensing station was located in plot 19 for all hybrid plots irrigated at the i50 level 11 19 29 and 35 in plot 23 for all hybrid plots irrigated at the i80 level 15 21 23 and 41 and in plot 33 for all hybrid plots irrigated at the i30 level 13 17 33 and 39 fig 3 in 2019 the soil water sensing station located in plot 42 was used to prevent over and under irrigation in all h80 treatment plots 34 36 40 and 42 the four tdr sensors were installed at the same depths and in the same manner detailed for 2018 after midnight a prescription map was built automatically by the arspivot server software program on the embedded computer using canopy temperature weather and soil water sensing data collected at the embedded computer every time the isscada system traveled across the field in irrigation mode or in dry mode canopy temperature information from the previous three days that the isscada system moved and soil water sensing data from the previous 48 h were used to prescribe the watering rates of each management zone treatment plot the decision support algorithm for the isscada hybrid plots summarized in fig 4 begins with the assessment of swd if swd 10 then no irrigation was applied if 10 swd 50 then the calculated mean icwsi values for all hybrid plots of the same irrigation treatment level was compared with the corresponding isscada plant feedback threshold to determine the amount of irrigation to apply table 4 finally if swd 50 then the maximum irrigation amount for the designated irrigation treatment level was applied table 6 the choice to manage multiple homogeneous mzs treatment plots using a single soil water sensing station located in a mz of the same type was based on practicality and economic feasibility calibration equations from the factory pre programmed within the sensor were used to estimate soil water depletion and to calculate water storage in the profile the distance of the tdr installations from the np access tube was approximately 1 0 m neutron probe measurements from each of the treatment plots were used to calculate seasonal etc 2 6 sampling and statistical analysis hand samples from all three studies were taken from a 10 m2 area within each treatment plot near the neutron probe access tube results were analyzed using mixed linear models in the proc mixed model procedures littell et al 2006 in sas statistical software version 9 4 sas institute 2016 the main effects of irrigation scheduling method and irrigation level i80 i50 i30 were treated as fixed effects blocks were considered random effects in 2012 differences among means of fixed effects were compared using the least square means method and considered to be significant at the p 0 05 level crop water productivity cwp y g e t c was based on the ratio of economic yield y g to seasonal crop water use etc howell 2002 as determined by the soil water balance equation etc p i f δs r where p is precipitation mm received during the growing season i is irrigation amount applied f is flux across the lower boundary of the control volume δs is seasonal change in soil water storage to 2 4 m depth and r is runoff as discussed in evett 2008 all in mm flux was considered to be zero as ascertained by the np readings down to 2 3 m while r was assumed to be zero due to furrow diking the use of lesa and irrigation events that did not exceed soil water infiltration capacity irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as the ratio of the difference between economic and dryland yield to the difference between mean cumulative irrigations applied to the treatment and dryland plots 3 results 3 1 seasonal climates 2012 was a relatively dry growing season total precipitation of 155 mm for the months of may through oct with minimal precipitation beginning in the month of july when the crop was entering the growth point differential stage and maximum daily air temperature was at its greatest the dry period continued through august while the crop was in the soft dough stage table 7 in 2018 the total precipitation for the month of may through oct was 319 mm 18 of the seasonal rainfall occurred in aug when the crop entered the reproductive stages and 57 occurred in oct after physiological maturity but prior to harvest in 2019 precipitation was greater than average in may eliminating the need for preplant irrigation similar to 2018 a large amount of precipitation occurred in oct after the crop reached physiological maturity but before samples could be harvested 3 2 irrigation grain yield etc cwp and iwp 3 2 1 2012 study in 2012 the mean cumulative irrigation amounts were 341 212 and 129 mm for the manual control plots and 267 273 226 and 160 mm for the isscada plant feedback plots for the i80 i65 i50 and i30 irrigation treatment levels respectively irrigation timing and lower cumulative irrigation amounts negatively impacted yields in the i80 i65 and i50 isscada plant feedback treatment plots in these irrigation treatment plots 3 4 irrigations were triggered between doy 233 aug 20 and doy 244 aug 31 the soft dough stage compared to eight irrigation events for the manual control plots because the calculated icwsi values were less than the thresholds listed in table 1 mean overall grain yield and cwp were significantly greater for the manual control plots compared with the isscada plant feedback plots while the overall mean etc and iwp were not significantly different table 8 by irrigation method as expected irrigation level had a significant effect on all crop responses comparing crop response between irrigation methods at the same irrigation level mean grain yields were significantly greater for the manual control plots at the higher irrigation level i80 crop water productivity and iwp were significantly greater only at the i50 level in the manual control plots mean grain yield cwp and iwp for the isscada plant feedback i65 irrigation treatment plots were 0 52 kg m 2 1 22 kg m 3 and 1 88 kg m 3 respectively the paired t test at p 0 05 level indicated that the mean yield for the i65 treatment plot was significantly greater compared with the mean grain yield produced by the isscada plant feedback i50 treatment plots however there was no significant difference between mean yield values at the isscada plant feedback i65 and i80 levels and no significant differences between isscada plant feedback cwp and iwp values at the i80 i65 and i50 irrigation treatment levels data not shown 3 2 2 2018 study in 2018 the mean cumulative irrigation amounts applied to the i80 i50 and i30 irrigation treatment plots were 393 295 and 166 mm respectively for the manual control plots 484 302 and 191 mm respectively for the isscada plant feedback plots and 476 316 and 191 mm respectively for the isscada hybrid plots in contrast to 2012 the timing of irrigation events was the same for all irrigation methods except for one irrigation event doy 229 that was withheld in the isscada hybrid treatment plots as a result of swd the 10 threshold in the h80 treatment plots 40 of the irrigations were based on plant feedback thresholds with the 10 swd 50 the isscada hybrid method resulted in withholding irrigations 7 of the time while 53 of the time it resulted in application of the maximum depth most irrigation events triggered for the h50 and h30 plots resulted in the maximum application depths table 4 due to swd levels 50 rather than show soil water depletion soil water storage calculated from tdr measurements was plotted over time to better represent water available for the crops evett et al 2019 fig 5 the soil water storage from the tdrs showed a positive linear relationship with readings taken in the same plots on the same doy as values calculated from measurements with the neutron probe np to a depth of 80 cm fig 5 upper right inset graph the soil profile was dry at the start of the irrigation season as shown on doy 205 where the soil water measurements from both the sensors and probe agreed well deviations from the 1 1 line occurred on doy 257 in the h50 plot 19 and h30 plot 33 plots with water storage calculations from the tdr readings being less than readings from the np although maximum irrigation depths table 6 were applied to the h80 h50 and h30 treatment plots on doy 244 254 and 258 the two tdrs at the deepest depths in plot 19 and in plot 33 recorded low readings and showed little change from aug 30 doy 242 through oct 4 doy 277 data not shown this was likely due to the crop using the applied water before it could infiltrate deeply this conjecture is bolstered by the fact that the total soil water storage on doy 257determined by tdr was less than that determined by np for the 50 and 30 treatments for the 2018 growing season mean grain yield was significantly greater for the isscada hybrid treatment plots however all other crop responses were similar table 9 irrigation treatment level had a significant effect on grain yield and etc while significant differences for cwp occurred between the i80 and i30 irrigation treatment levels comparing crop response between irrigation scheduling methods at the same irrigation level grain yields were significantly greater for the isscada hybrid treatment plots compared with the isscada plant feedback and manual control plots at the i80 level but there was no significant difference in crop response between irrigation scheduling methods at the i50 or i30 irrigation treatment levels 3 2 3 2019 study in 2019 cumulative irrigation amounts were 491 and 408 mm for the manual and isscada hybrid treatment plots respectively the mean irrigation amount applied to the isscada plant feedback method was 378 mm amounts ranged from 358 to 398 mm values of stored soil water from the tdr sensors in plot 42 isscada hybrid agreed well with the np readings for doy 176 184 190 and 212 fig 6 left hand side irrigations triggered for the isscada hybrid plots were mainly based on plant feedback as 10 swd 50 apart from doy 187 189 when precipitation filled the soil water profile on doy 224 soil water storage calculated from the np measurements were 9 less compared with the value calculated from the tdr readings and on doy 268 soil water storage calculated from the np was 31 greater the reasons for these differences may be due to spatial differences in root density after doy 232 the two deeper tdrs ceased to read likely due to loose connections inferred from nan readings at the datalogging unit when this occurred the isscada system automatically ignored the nan values and calculated swd based on the two tdrs nearest the surface of the soil fig 6 right hand side decision support for the isscada hybrid method from doy 232 through 243 were mainly based on soil water sensing feedback the maximum irrigation depth was recommended on doy 232 while withholding irrigation was recommended on doy 233 234 and 236 and 237 the three irrigations for the remainder of the season were based on plant feedback thresholds irrigation timing and amounts varied among the four isscada plant feedback plots i e the percent of minimum medium maximum and withheld applications were 18 12 47 and 23 for plot 35 23 12 53 and 12 for plot 38 12 23 41 and 24 for plot 43 and 6 23 53 and 18 for plot 45 irrigation scheduling method did not have a significant effect on dry grain yields cwp or iwp seasonal etc was significantly greater for the manually irrigated plots greater amounts of irrigation contributed to this difference standard deviations for crop response values were similar to results in the h80 treatment plots in 2018 table 10 4 discussion crop response being similar between the manual control irrigation scheduling and the two isscada methods demonstrates a positive result for automated irrigation management as the np is the most accurate indirect method of soil water determination available however a neutron probe is relatively expensive requires licensing and training for use of a radioactive source and is labor intensive evett 2008 peters et al 2013 rudnick et al 2015 robock 2015 the isscada methods of plant and soil water sensing feedback range in cost from 5000 to 20 000 for the wireless network systems depending on the number of sensors and datalogging units but requires minimal labor to operate in the 2012 field experiment the binary system of applying the maximum irrigation amount based on the average peak daily water requirement and the frequency of sprinkler rotation or no irrigation at all resulted in infrequent irrigation events for the isscada plant feedback treatment plots which negatively impacted grain yields and cwp in 2018 the two changes in the irrigation scheduling method for the isscada plant feedback method i e the decrease in the icwsi thresholds and the use of a three tiered set of icwsi thresholds with corresponding irrigation levels reduced irrigation gaps during the growing season and resulted in crop response of grain yield cwp and iwp in 2018 and 2019 that were similar to the manual control method although minimal irrigation was saved in 2018 and 2019 with the addition of soil water sensing feedback to the isscada system the isscada hybrid method consistently produced grain yield cwp and iwp that were similar to results using the np it is important to note that soil water sensing feedback alone did not govern the isscada hybrid method of irrigation scheduling rather it was the combination of soil water sensing and plant feedback that produced consistent results of crop response to irrigation management the benefit of the isscada hybrid method is that soil water information provides an accepted and well understood method of assessing the status of plant available water additionally the feedback is continuous and independent of the sprinkler moving across the field this information could be used to determine when to scan a field using the isscada system after planting and precipitation events the study also demonstrated that a single soil water sensing station in combination with plant feedback from non contiguous but homogeneous management zones can provide successful decision support for those management zones not hosting a soil water sensing station finally the importance of the isscada hybrid method is that it establishes redundancy in formulating decision support for irrigation scheduling this is critical to avert significant yield loss from under irrigation or water wastage as a result of over irrigation especially when using automated systems mccarthy et al 2014 navarro hellína et al 2016 the upgraded isscada plant feedback system using multiple icwsi thresholds has been tested in portageville mo in a two year study for irrigation management of cotton at a single irrigation treatment level lint yield was similar and iwp was significantly greater for cotton managed by the isscada plant feedback system as compared with the arkansas irrigation scheduler a method considered to be the best irrigation management practice in arkansas and missouri sui and vories 2018 vories et al 2019 sui et al 2020 in press reported that the isscada hybrid irrigation scheduling method used to irrigate soybean produced similar yields with significantly greater iwp values as compared with vri management with soil water sensors alone gs 1 decagon devices pullman washington usa to determine when to irrigate and how much to irrigate stone et al 2020 in press tested the isscada hybrid system in a sub humid climate for corn irrigation management with the goal to maximize grain yields they reported that yields and iwp were similar to those resulting from irrigation scheduling using soil water potentiometers to signal irrigation timing and amount the disadvantage of using the soil water potentiometers was that this data was collected manually it is possible that the upgraded isscada plant feedback and hybrid systems multi tier thresholds and water rates could also prevent excessive irrigation at the more deficit irrigation levels i50 and i30 for irrigated cotton as experienced by o shaughnessy et al 2015 future studies are needed to test the performance of the upgraded isscada system for cotton production in bushland 5 conclusion this study reports the performance of an isscada system for irrigation management of grain sorghum governed by plant feedback alone in a 2012 study and then using the combination of plant feedback and soil water sensing with the isscada system in a 2018 and 2019 study with a multi tiered irrigation threshold and watering system the 2012 study demonstrated that irrigation scheduling using plant feedback alone and a binary method of applying irrigations either daily peak crop water demand or no water may sometimes result in significantly lower grain yields and cwp however incorporating multiple thresholds and corresponding irrigation levels with plant feedback resulted in similar crop response as compared with irrigation scheduling using weekly np readings combining soil water sensing with plant feedback resulted in consistent crop response of grain yield cwp and iwp over two years additionally the isscada hybrid method provided a method of continuous monitoring of plant available water in parts of a cropped field and redundancy in preventing over and under irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

feedback at irrigation levels similar to 80 50 and 30 designated i80 i50 and i30 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity as determined with weekly neutron probe readings the manual method results in 2012 indicated that irrigation scheduling using plant feedback alone with a single thermal stress threshold produced grain yields that were significantly less 0 49 and 0 38 kg m 2 compared with the manual method 0 63 and 0 51 kg m 2 at the i80 and i50 treatment levels respectively however in 2018 the hybrid feedback method produced mean grain yields 0 87 kg m 2 that were significantly greater compared with the plant feedback 0 76 kg m 2 and manual 0 74 kg m 2 irrigation scheduling methods at the i80 treatment level in 2019 mean grain yields 0 86 0 83 and 0 88 kg m 2 cwp 1 25 1 29 and 1 20 kg m 3 and iwp 2 11 2 19 and 1 88 kg m 3 for the hybrid plant feedback and manual methods respectively were similar at the i80 level these results suggest that plant and soil water sensing feedback using multiple thermal stress thresholds and watering levels have the potential to produce optimal crop response for grain sorghum more research is required to test the efficacy of soil water sensing in combination with plant sensing for other crops keywords center pivot sprinkler infrared thermometers sensor networks wireless networks time domain reflectometers 1 introduction optimizing water as an input is critical in the texas high plains region where water for agriculture represents nearly 93 of consumptive water use from the highly depleted ogallala aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 monitoring crop status throughout a field to determine when and how much to irrigate to maximize yields at the field scale level or to improve crop water productivity cwp is not always straight forward and is logistically difficult when managing large size fields and multiple fields differences in the physical aspects of soil topography abiotic stresses and biotic stresses can cause variability in crop water requirements site specific irrigation using a variable rate irrigation sprinkler can apply precise amounts of water in precise locations o shaughnessy et al 2019 however sensor feedback is required to achieve precision timing and amount rodriguez ortega et al 2017 variable rate irrigation vri systems with sensor feedback reduced water consumption goumopoulos et al 2014 and served to maximize grain yields in sorghum corn soybean wheat and peas o shaughnessy et al 2012a sui and yan 2017 li et al 2019 el naggar et al 2020 most of these studies have incorporated soil water sensing to determine when and how much to irrigate more recent studies barker et al 2018a and 2018b bhatti et al 2020 have investigated the use of imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles or from satellites and spatial evapotranspiration models to develop decision support systems for vri systems however these systems do not yet have the ability to automate prescription maps in previous studies at bushland tx automated irrigation scheduling using a supervisory control and data acquisition isscada system was based solely on plant feedback using thermal stress index thresholds such as the time temperature threshold ttt evett et al 1996 peters and evett 2008 o shaughnessy and evett 2010 or a theoretical crop water stress index and time threshold o shaughnessy et al 2012b the early isscada system was comprised of a conventional center pivot sprinkler outfitted with a host computer located at the pivot point software on the computer was used to collect data from a network of infrared thermometers and a nearby weather station variable watering rates for each zone were controlled by nozzle sizes peters and evett 2007 after the center pivot sprinklers at bushland were outfitted with zone control each sprinkler zone contained 6 drops variable rate irrigation vri hardware valmont industries inc valley ne automated irrigation scheduling with the isscada system was accomplished independently for each plant feedback treatment plot however in some experiments the isscada system over irrigated treatment plots especially those designated as severely deficit 25 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity o shaughnessy et al 2015 2017 the over irrigation was primarily due to high infrared thermometer readings caused by soil background due to partial canopy cover in the deficit irrigated plots subsequent to these studies the software controlling the vri sprinklers was transformed into a server client architecture named ars pivot andrade et al 2016 2017 and new tools were added among the newest tools was an application programming interface api for soil water sensors which enabled the isscada system to collect continuous soil water data from wireless distributed soil water sensing stations soil water sensing was combined with plant feedback to provide a closed loop control system to prevent inordinate amounts of over or under irrigation this method is abbreviated as the isscada hybrid o shaughnessy et al 2018 and is an important feature since one of the goals in commercializing the isscada system is that its decision support algorithms adapt to different climates it s possible that plant feedback alone could lead to over irrigation or under irrigation because non stressed baseline thresholds can be different for different climatic regions payero and irmak 2006 abritta and garcia 2012 in humid and sub humid regions humidity can increase canopy temperature by reducing transpiration independent of soil water levels wanjura and upchurch 1997 in semi arid and arid regions cloudy skies can lead to rapid fluctuation in radiation causing stressed plants to have a greater response to rapid changes in radiation agam et al 2011 and continuous cloud cover can also mask the true water status of a crop causing calculated crop water stress index cwsi values to be near zero even when the crop requires water nielsen 1990 finally a multi tiered approach to irrigation scheduling was incorporated into the software this approach required three levels of a thermal stress index maximum medium and minimum and corresponding irrigation depths the thermal stress index was the integrated cwsi icwsi o shaughnessy et al 2017 explained in more detail later in the paper the expectation was that plants experiencing severe stress would indicate high levels of the icwsi and signal the maximum irrigation depth those crops experiencing moderate stress would indicate medium levels of the icwsi and signal the medium irrigation depth and plants experiencing mild stress would indicate low levels of the icwsi and signal the low irrigation depth using multiple icwsi thresholds produced positive results for irrigation management of corn when using the isscada system for irrigation scheduling andrade et al 2017 in this study the objectives were to investigate the performance of an isscada system after changes to include 1 a three tiered approach of irrigation thresholds and corresponding irrigation depths for use in site specific vri replacing a binary system irrigate or do not irrigate 2 the addition of soil water sensing feedback combined with plant feedback referred to as the hybrid method and 3 evaluate both methods of sensor feedback irrigation scheduling compared to a manual control method of irrigation scheduling using weekly neutron probe readings performance was based on comparisons of grain yield evapotranspiration etc cwp and iwp among the plant feedback hybrid and manual irrigation

the water on turn the water off to start and to stop the center pivot prescription maps were built automatically at midnight using the algorithms described later in the paper after the center pivot traveled around the field 2 3 2 sensor network systems the wireless network of infrared thermometers irts model sap ip irt dynamax inc houston tx usa was used to monitor canopy temperature as the pivot traveled across the field the radios within the sap ip irts are the xbee radios and the communication protocol is zigbee ieee 802 15 4 a low power low data rate network that enables mesh

of 0 c 50 c the irts were calibrated against a commercial black body in different ambient temperatures using a temperature controlled chamber as discussed in colaizzi et al 2018 the irts were mounted on masts that were secured to the truss system of the center pivot sprinkler and were forward of the sprinkler spray plates fixed approximately 0 45 m above the ground using low elevation spray application lesa viewing a dry canopy a pair of irts were located at the borders of each radial management zone and pointed towards the center of the zone at oblique angles to nadir readings from the paired irts were averaged to lessen sun angle effects moving irts aimed at row crops view a composite of shaded and sunlit canopy and shaded and sunlit soil the proportions of soil and sunlight and their sunlit and shaded components change continuously with the sun and vegetation geometry as the center pivot travels around the field colaizzi et al 2019 data target temperature sensor body temperature and battery voltage from the irts were recorded every 6 s and averaged and transmitted at 2 54 ghz every minute to a coordinator radio modem cabled to the embedded computer at the pivot

gui for the isscada system automatically provided irrigation scheduling recommendations in the form of a vri prescription map generated at midnight after the system traveled across any portion of the field 2 4 experimental designs 2 4 1 2012 study in 2012 plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two main treatment factors 1 irrigation scheduling methods and 2 irrigation levels treatments irrigation scheduling method by irrigation level was replicated four times the irrigation scheduling methods were an isscada plant feedback approach using an integrated crop water stress index icwsi discussed later in this section and a manual method using weekly neutron probe readings the irrigation treatment levels were 80 65 50 and 30 designated i80 i65 i50 and i30 replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity fig 1 dryland plots i0 were established to calculate irrigation water productivity iwp and the i65 treatment level was used to investigate the level of control of the icwsi method i e could the icwsi threshold at the i65 treatment level produce grain yields that were between the i80 and i50 levels 2 4 2 2018 study in 2018 treatment plots were completely randomized fig 2 main treatments were three irrigation scheduling methods and three irrigation levels and dryland treatment plots unique from the 2012 study soil water sensing combined with plant feedback was an added irrigation scheduling method and rather than one icwsi threshold three thresholds with three corresponding irrigation levels were instituted the three irrigation scheduling methods were the 1 isscada plant feedback 2 isscada hybrid combination of soil water sensing and plant feedback and 3 manual the three irrigation treatment levels were i80 i50 i30 where the subscripts represent percent replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity treatments of irrigation scheduling method by irrigation treatment level were replicated four times dryland plots i0 were also established to calculate iwp the thermal stress thresholds were reduced from 2012 to limit water stress 2 4 3 2019 study in 2019 there was a total of 12 treatment plots with three main irrigation scheduling methods manual isscda plant feedback and isscada hybrid identical to those described for the 2018 study again dryland plots were established in the areas designated as border to allow for calculation of iwp the irrigation treatment was limited to the i80 level and plot sizes were increased the change in experimental design was to demonstrate the performance of the isscada system using larger sized plots the three irrigation scheduling methods were retained to investigate their effects on crop response treatment plots were replicated four times fig 3 the main treatments of irrigation scheduling methods irrigation levels sensor network systems and number of irts and soil water sensing stations for the three study years ar summarized in table 2 2 5 irrigation scheduling methods 2 5 1 manual manual irrigations were scheduled every three days as needed in a 7 day period and based on 80 50 and 30 designated m80 m50 and m30 respectively of full replenishment of soil water depletion to field capacity in the top 1 5 m 5 ft of soil soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron probe np model 503dr1 5 instrotek campbell pacific nuclear martinez cal in 0 2 m increments from 0 10 m to 2 3 m in the m80 treatment plots access tubes were placed in a row in the center of each plot 24 rows wide the neutron probe was field calibrated to an accuracy of better than 0 01 m3 m 3 resulting in separate calibrations for three distinct soil layers ap bt and btca using methods described by evett 2008 irrigation amounts for the manual control plots over a seven day period were based on weekly neutron probe readings in the m80 plots and soil water depletion to field capacity was replenished at rates of 80 50 and 30 in the plots designated m80 m50 and m30 respectively precipitation occurring prior to irrigation of the total amount for the 7 day period was subtracted from the required total 2 5 2 plant feedback canopy temperature and data from a nearby weather station were used to calculate an integrated crop water stress index icwsi the icwsi was calculated from 9 00 a m until 7 00 p m every minute eq 1 1 i c w s i i 1900 0900 t c t a t c t a l l t c t a u l t c t a l l where t c is the scaled canopy temperature determined using the scaling procedure eq 2 described in detail in peters and evett 2004 2 t c t e t r m t t t e t r e f t e t

day remote temperature measurement at time t t ref t is the measured reference temperature made at the same time and t ref is the reference temperature at all other times measured throughout the day all temperatures are in units of c the upper t c t a ul and lower t c t a ll boundaries estimating a fully stressed and a well watered crop respectively were calculated using the theoretical method detailed in jackson et al 1981 1988 irrigation timing was based on exceedance of the icwsi threshold established for the designated irrigation treatment level table 3 the thermal stress thresholds were derived from canopy temperature measurements and weather data the irrigation amounts were based on 80 of the average peak daily water requirements 10 5 mm for grain sorghum grown in bushland tx o shaughnessy et al 2012a 2012b multiplied by the irrigation interval that was established between irrigation events 2 5 days in the 2012 study as mentioned previously the decision support algorithm for the plant feedback method was modified in 2018 to include a minimum medium and maximum icwsi threshold and corresponding irrigation amounts for each irrigation treatment level table 4 the maximum irrigation amount was based on the maximum irrigation that could be applied on this field 36 mm without causing runoff the maximum amount for each irrigation level was based on the percent soil water depletion to field capacity subscript e g for c80 80 of 36 mm is 29 mm 50 of 36 mm is 18 mm 30 of 36 mm is 11 mm the lesser amounts of 7 6 mm and 5 mm represent approximately 20 of maximum irrigation depth for the field and the practical minimum irrigation depth for the center pivot system 2 5 3 hybrid the isscada hybrid irrigation scheduling method was used in 2018 and in 2019 this method combines soil water sensing with plant feedback to determine irrigation timing and depth using pre established thresholds of soil water depletion swd and the icwsi one set of four soil water sensors was installed into each type of hybrid plot along the side of the plant bed where the lesa nozzle traveled the first two sensors were installed horizontally at depths of 10 and 20 cm while the two deeper tdrs 40 and 75 cm were installed vertically so the mid point of the length of the steel rods of the tdr sensor was placed to a depth of either 40 and 75 cm respectively total soil water depletion was calculated by summing the depletion for each soil layer using data from the time domain reflectometry tdr sensors located at each of the four sensor depths i using eq 3 3 s w d i 1 4 x i θ f c i θ v i θ f c i θ p w p i where θ v i θ fc i and θ pwp i represent the measured volumetric water content field capacity and permanent wilting point listed in table 5 data from unger 1996 schwartz et al 2003 heng et al 2009 respectively for each soil layer x i where x is the thickness of the soil layer cm with mid point at depth i soil water depletion thresholds were the ratio of swd swdmax x 100 soil water sensors installed horizontally provide higher resolution sensing and accurate measurements when compared with measurements from a neutron probe chen et al 2019 horizontal installation of tdrs to a deeper depth requires a larger trench for proper insertion of the sensor into the plant bed and the soil must be carefully repacked to maintain original bulk density prevent voids avoid preferential flow conversely installation of tdrs in a vertical manner provided average soil water content representative of the soil from between the midpoint of the steel rods and both the upper and lower depths of the representative layer installation in a vertical manner indicates soil water content at a larger spatial scale musters and bouten 2000 but provides a reasonable approximation of soil water storage in the profile evett et al 2019 miyamoto et al 2001 was able to accurately describe the relationship between volumetric soil water content in minimum and conventional till soils when tdrs were installed in a vertical direction all sensors were installed when the crop was approximately 20 cm tall as mentioned previously a single soil water sensing station was located in each type of hybrid treatment plot h80 h50 and h30 totaling three soil water sensing stations in 2018 and one soil water sensing station in 2019 to manage the h80 designated plots each subscript x in hx represents the irrigation treatment level established using the designated soil water sensing and plant feedback thresholds table 6 while the swd threshold of 50 was from fao 56 allen et al 1998 as listed for sorghum for clarity in 2018 a soil water sensing station was located in plot 19 for all hybrid plots irrigated at the i50 level 11 19 29 and 35 in plot 23 for all hybrid plots irrigated at the i80 level 15 21 23 and 41 and in plot 33 for all hybrid plots irrigated at the i30 level 13 17 33 and 39 fig 3 in 2019 the soil water sensing station located in plot 42 was used to prevent over and under irrigation in all h80 treatment plots 34 36 40 and 42 the four tdr sensors were installed at the same depths and in the same manner detailed for 2018 after midnight a prescription map was built automatically by the arspivot server software program on the embedded computer using canopy temperature weather and soil water sensing data collected at the embedded computer every time the isscada system traveled across the field in irrigation mode or in dry mode canopy temperature information from the previous three days that the isscada system moved and soil water sensing data from the previous 48 h were used to prescribe the watering rates of each management zone treatment plot the decision support algorithm for the isscada hybrid plots summarized in fig 4 begins with the assessment of swd if swd 10 then no irrigation was applied if 10 swd 50 then the calculated mean icwsi values for all hybrid plots of the same irrigation treatment level was compared with the corresponding isscada plant feedback threshold to determine the amount of irrigation to apply table 4 finally if swd 50 then the maximum irrigation amount for the designated irrigation treatment level was applied table 6 the choice to manage multiple homogeneous mzs treatment plots using a single soil water sensing station located in a mz of the same type was based on practicality and economic feasibility calibration equations from the factory pre programmed within the sensor were used to estimate soil water depletion and to calculate water storage in the profile the distance of the tdr installations from the np access tube was approximately 1 0 m neutron probe measurements from each of the treatment plots were used to calculate seasonal etc 2 6 sampling and statistical analysis hand samples from all three studies were taken from a 10 m2 area within each treatment plot near the neutron probe access tube results were analyzed using mixed linear models in the proc mixed model procedures littell et al 2006 in sas statistical software version 9 4 sas institute 2016 the main effects of irrigation scheduling method and irrigation level i80 i50 i30 were treated as fixed effects blocks were considered random effects in 2012 differences among means of fixed effects were compared using the least square means method and considered to be significant at the p 0 05 level crop water productivity cwp y g e t c was based on the ratio of economic yield y g to seasonal crop water use etc howell 2002 as determined by the soil water balance equation etc p i f δs r where p is precipitation mm received during the growing season i is irrigation amount applied f is flux across the lower boundary of the control volume δs is seasonal change in soil water storage to 2 4 m depth and r is runoff as discussed in evett 2008 all in mm flux was considered to be zero as ascertained by the np readings down to 2 3 m while r was assumed to be zero due to furrow diking the use of lesa and irrigation events that did not exceed soil water infiltration capacity irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as the ratio of the difference between economic and dryland yield to the difference between mean cumulative irrigations applied to the treatment and dryland plots 3 results 3 1 seasonal climates 2012 was a relatively dry growing season total precipitation of 155 mm for the months of may through oct with minimal precipitation beginning in the month of july when the crop was entering the growth point differential stage and maximum daily air temperature was at its greatest the dry period continued through august while the crop was in the soft dough stage table 7 in 2018 the total precipitation for the month of may through oct was 319 mm 18 of the seasonal rainfall occurred in aug when the crop entered the reproductive stages and 57 occurred in oct after physiological maturity but prior to harvest in 2019 precipitation was greater than average in may eliminating the need for preplant irrigation similar to 2018 a large amount of precipitation occurred in oct after the crop reached physiological maturity but before samples could be harvested 3 2 irrigation grain yield etc cwp and iwp 3 2 1 2012 study in 2012 the mean cumulative irrigation amounts were 341 212 and 129 mm for the manual control plots and 267 273 226 and 160 mm for the isscada plant feedback plots for the i80 i65 i50 and i30 irrigation treatment levels respectively irrigation timing and lower cumulative irrigation amounts negatively impacted yields in the i80 i65 and i50 isscada plant feedback treatment plots in these irrigation treatment plots 3 4 irrigations were triggered between doy 233 aug 20 and doy 244 aug 31 the soft dough stage compared to eight irrigation events for the manual control plots because the calculated icwsi values were less than the thresholds listed in table 1 mean overall grain yield and cwp were significantly greater for the manual control plots compared with the isscada plant feedback plots while the overall mean etc and iwp were not significantly different table 8 by irrigation method as expected irrigation level had a significant effect on all crop responses comparing crop response between irrigation methods at the same irrigation level mean grain yields were significantly greater for the manual control plots at the higher irrigation level i80 crop water productivity and iwp were significantly greater only at the i50 level in the manual control plots mean grain yield cwp and iwp for the isscada plant feedback i65 irrigation treatment plots were 0 52 kg m 2 1 22 kg m 3 and 1 88 kg m 3 respectively the paired t test at p 0 05 level indicated that the mean yield for the i65 treatment plot was significantly greater compared with the mean grain yield produced by the isscada plant feedback i50 treatment plots however there was no significant difference between mean yield values at the isscada plant feedback i65 and i80 levels and no significant differences between isscada plant feedback cwp and iwp values at the i80 i65 and i50 irrigation treatment levels data not shown 3 2 2 2018 study in 2018 the mean cumulative irrigation amounts applied to the i80 i50 and i30 irrigation treatment plots were 393 295 and 166 mm respectively for the manual control plots 484 302 and 191 mm respectively for the isscada plant feedback plots and 476 316 and 191 mm respectively for the isscada hybrid plots in contrast to 2012 the timing of irrigation events was the same for all irrigation methods except for one irrigation event doy 229 that was withheld in the isscada hybrid treatment plots as a result of swd the 10 threshold in the h80 treatment plots 40 of the irrigations were based on plant feedback thresholds with the 10 swd 50 the isscada hybrid method resulted in withholding irrigations 7 of the time while 53 of the time it resulted in application of the maximum depth most irrigation events triggered for the h50 and h30 plots resulted in the maximum application depths table 4 due to swd levels 50 rather than show soil water depletion soil water storage calculated from tdr measurements was plotted over time to better represent water available for the crops evett et al 2019 fig 5 the soil water storage from the tdrs showed a positive linear relationship with readings taken in the same plots on the same doy as values calculated from measurements with the neutron probe np to a depth of 80 cm fig 5 upper right inset graph the soil profile was dry at the start of the irrigation season as shown on doy 205 where the soil water measurements from both the sensors and probe agreed well deviations from the 1 1 line occurred on doy 257 in the h50 plot 19 and h30 plot 33 plots with water storage calculations from the tdr readings being less than readings from the np although maximum irrigation depths table 6 were applied to the h80 h50 and h30 treatment plots on doy 244 254 and 258 the two tdrs at the deepest depths in plot 19 and in plot 33 recorded low readings and showed little change from aug 30 doy 242 through oct 4 doy 277 data not shown this was likely due to the crop using the applied water before it could infiltrate deeply this conjecture is bolstered by the fact that the total soil water storage on doy 257determined by tdr was less than that determined by np for the 50 and 30 treatments for the 2018 growing season mean grain yield was significantly greater for the isscada hybrid treatment plots however all other crop responses were similar table 9 irrigation treatment level had a significant effect on grain yield and etc while significant differences for cwp occurred between the i80 and i30 irrigation treatment levels comparing crop response between irrigation scheduling methods at the same irrigation level grain yields were significantly greater for the isscada hybrid treatment plots compared with the isscada plant feedback and manual control plots at the i80 level but there was no significant difference in crop response between irrigation scheduling methods at the i50 or i30 irrigation treatment levels 3 2 3 2019 study in 2019 cumulative irrigation amounts were 491 and 408 mm for the manual and isscada hybrid treatment plots respectively the mean irrigation amount applied to the isscada plant feedback method was 378 mm amounts ranged from 358 to 398 mm values of stored soil water from the tdr sensors in plot 42 isscada hybrid agreed well with the np readings for doy 176 184 190 and 212 fig 6 left hand side irrigations triggered for the isscada hybrid plots were mainly based on plant feedback as 10 swd 50 apart from doy 187 189 when precipitation filled the soil water profile on doy 224 soil water storage calculated from the np measurements were 9 less compared with the value calculated from the tdr readings and on doy 268 soil water storage calculated from the np was 31 greater the reasons for these differences may be due to spatial differences in root density after doy 232 the two deeper tdrs ceased to read likely due to loose connections inferred from nan readings at the datalogging unit when this occurred the isscada system automatically ignored the nan values and calculated swd based on the two tdrs nearest the surface of the soil fig 6 right hand side decision support for the isscada hybrid method from doy 232 through 243 were mainly based on soil water sensing feedback the maximum irrigation depth was recommended on doy 232 while withholding irrigation was recommended on doy 233 234 and 236 and 237 the three irrigations for the remainder of the season were based on plant feedback thresholds irrigation timing and amounts varied among the four isscada plant feedback plots i e the percent of minimum medium maximum and withheld applications were 18 12 47 and 23 for plot 35 23 12 53 and 12 for plot 38 12 23 41 and 24 for plot 43 and 6 23 53 and 18 for plot 45 irrigation scheduling method did not have a significant effect on dry grain yields cwp or iwp seasonal etc was significantly greater for the manually irrigated plots greater amounts of irrigation contributed to this difference standard deviations for crop response values were similar to results in the h80 treatment plots in 2018 table 10 4 discussion crop response being similar between the manual control irrigation scheduling and the two isscada methods demonstrates a positive result for automated irrigation management as the np is the most accurate indirect method of soil water determination available however a neutron probe is relatively expensive requires licensing and training for use of a radioactive source and is labor intensive evett 2008 peters et al 2013 rudnick et al 2015 robock 2015 the isscada methods of plant and soil water sensing feedback range in cost from 5000 to 20 000 for the wireless network systems depending on the number of sensors and datalogging units but requires minimal labor to operate in the 2012 field experiment the binary system of applying the maximum irrigation amount based on the average peak daily water requirement and the frequency of sprinkler rotation or no irrigation at all resulted in infrequent irrigation events for the isscada plant feedback treatment plots which negatively impacted grain yields and cwp in 2018 the two changes in the irrigation scheduling method for the isscada plant feedback method i e the decrease in the icwsi thresholds and the use of a three tiered set of icwsi thresholds with corresponding irrigation levels reduced irrigation gaps during the growing season and resulted in crop response of grain yield cwp and iwp in 2018 and 2019 that were similar to the manual control method although minimal irrigation was saved in 2018 and 2019 with the addition of soil water sensing feedback to the isscada system the isscada hybrid method consistently produced grain yield cwp and iwp that were similar to results using the np it is important to note that soil water sensing feedback alone did not govern the isscada hybrid method of irrigation scheduling rather it was the combination of soil water sensing and plant feedback that produced consistent results of crop response to irrigation management the benefit of the isscada hybrid method is that soil water information provides an accepted and well understood method of assessing the status of plant available water additionally the feedback is continuous and independent of the sprinkler moving across the field this information could be used to determine when to scan a field using the isscada system after planting and precipitation events the study also demonstrated that a single soil water sensing station in combination with plant feedback from non contiguous but homogeneous management zones can provide successful decision support for those management zones not hosting a soil water sensing station finally the importance of the isscada hybrid method is that it establishes redundancy in formulating decision support for irrigation scheduling this is critical to avert significant yield loss from under irrigation or water wastage as a result of over irrigation especially when using automated systems mccarthy et al 2014 navarro hellína et al 2016 the upgraded isscada plant feedback system using multiple icwsi thresholds has been tested in portageville mo in a two year study for irrigation management of cotton at a single irrigation treatment level lint yield was similar and iwp was significantly greater for cotton managed by the isscada plant feedback system as compared with the arkansas irrigation scheduler a method considered to be the best irrigation management practice in arkansas and missouri sui and vories 2018 vories et al 2019 sui et al 2020 in press reported that the isscada hybrid irrigation scheduling method used to irrigate soybean produced similar yields with significantly greater iwp values as compared with vri management with soil water sensors alone gs 1 decagon devices pullman washington usa to determine when to irrigate and how much to irrigate stone et al 2020 in press tested the isscada hybrid system in a sub humid climate for corn irrigation management with the goal to maximize grain yields they reported that yields and iwp were similar to those resulting from irrigation scheduling using soil water potentiometers to signal irrigation timing and amount the disadvantage of using the soil water potentiometers was that this data was collected manually it is possible that the upgraded isscada plant feedback and hybrid systems multi tier thresholds and water rates could also prevent excessive irrigation at the more deficit irrigation levels i50 and i30 for irrigated cotton as experienced by o shaughnessy et al 2015 future studies are needed to test the performance of the upgraded isscada system for cotton production in bushland 5 conclusion this study reports the performance of an isscada system for irrigation management of grain sorghum governed by plant feedback alone in a 2012 study and then using the combination of plant feedback and soil water sensing with the isscada system in a 2018 and 2019 study with a multi tiered irrigation threshold and watering system the 2012 study demonstrated that irrigation scheduling using plant feedback alone and a binary method of applying irrigations either daily peak crop water demand or no water may sometimes result in significantly lower grain yields and cwp however incorporating multiple thresholds and corresponding irrigation levels with plant feedback resulted in similar crop response as compared with irrigation scheduling using weekly np readings combining soil water sensing with plant feedback resulted in consistent crop response of grain yield cwp and iwp over two years additionally the isscada hybrid method provided a method of continuous monitoring of plant available water in parts of a cropped field and redundancy in preventing over and under irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10532,in dryland agricultural production areas knowledge on the growth and variation of winter wheat root systems under different mulching methods is important for guiding winter wheat production we conducted a two year field trial to explore the effects of different mulching practices on the spatial temporal distribution of root growth soil water storage and grain yield four cultivation practices were tested i traditional flat planting ck ii flat planting with half film mulching m1 iii ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges only m2 and iv ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows m3 the results showed that the root diameter rd root length density rld and root surface area density rsd of wheat under the four treatments were mainly concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer the mean rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounted for 62 2 61 0 59 3 and 55 8 of the total root length density under m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively at maturity in both years the m3 cultivation method produced the maximum values for rd rld and rsd among all cultivation practices and the highest water storage efficiency after the three precipitation events the m3 treatment had 11 1 15 4 and 38 4 higher mean grain yields than m2 m1 and ck respectively over the two year study soil water storage had positive correlations with rd rld and rsd the rd rld and rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layer had strong positive correlations with yield components yield aboveground biomass and water use efficiency wue based on this study ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows is an effective sustainable cultivation method for wheat production in rainfed regions which can increase the spatial temporal distribution of root systems and soil water content across the root zones to increase crop production and wue keywords ridge furrow dual mulching spatial temporal distribution of root soil moisture grain yield winter wheat 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important cultivated crops in the loess plateau of china accounting for 44 of the cultivated area in this region jin et al 2007 wang et al 2012 despite the average annual precipitation on the loess plateau being around 580 mm only about 200 mm occurs in the wheat growing season which is about 30 of the total crop water demand of wheat xue et al 2017 because groundwater is scarce and relatively deep in the loess plateau dryland agriculture mainly relies on natural precipitation to maintain agricultural production zhang et al 2009a therefore practices that improve the utilization of limited precipitation reduce evaporation and increase water use efficiency are urgently needed the ridge and furrow rain harvesting cultivation technique mulching ridges with film and planting crops in furrows could direct the rainwater falling onto the ridges to the crop s rooting zone and improve the utilization rate of precipitation carter and miller 1991 li et al 2001 2013 jia et al 2018a some studies have indicated that ridge and furrow rain harvesting systems are better able to collect light rain and retain surface runoff from heavy rain than flat planting thereby increasing water use efficiency han et al 2013 li et al 2016 compared to the conventional flat planting pattern ridge furrow cultivation improves soil temperature accumulates rainwater and enhances grain yields tian et al 2003 zhang et al 2007 liu et al 2014 however during early winter growth ridge furrow planting with film only over the ridges is less likely to reduce evaporation in the furrows than film mulching over both ridges and furrows chen et al 2015 some frequent small precipitation events will quickly evaporate directly from the surface of the plastic film and not infiltrate rooting zones for crop use under full plastic film mulching in ridges and furrows zhao et al 2009 ding et al 2018 straw mulching reduces water evaporation but prevents rain from hitting the soil surface dong et al 2018 positive effects of plastic film mulch over the ridges and straw mulch in the furrows on maize production have been reported li et al 2013 but no such studies have been undertaken on winter wheat the spatial and temporal distribution of the wheat root system determines its ability to absorb nutrients and water yang et al 2004 chen et al 2014 the distribution of wheat roots in soil is important for efficient production management and the development of water saving agriculture ali et al 2018 the root system occupies a crucial position in the agricultural ecosystem and provides information from the soil to the crop to stimulate appropriate adaptive responses for instance the root system regulates root distribution characteristics and metabolism to allocate limited water resources optimally lynch 2007 ali et al 2018 the root system s function is closely related to root morphology and physiological characteristics and it often adapts to environmental changes through configuration changes and its spatial and temporal distribution lynch 2007 wu and cheng 2014 song et al 2018 the growth and development of the root system and its spatial and temporal distribution in soil not only determine the crop s absorption of water and nutrients during the growing period but also directly affect the establishment of the aboveground canopy assimilate distribution and final yield forde and lorenzo 2001 chen et al 2014 roots are highly plastic and influenced by soil moisture status which most of the roots are located feng et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the main root parameters of crops include root length density rld root surface area density rsd and root diameter rd ali et al 2018 which determine the efficacy of the whole root system mosaddeghi et al 2009 gao et al 2014 and indirectly affect aboveground biomass and grain yield feng et al 2017 longer roots provide more nutrients to plants than shorter roots gao et al 2014 a sound root system can prevent crop lodging when adverse conditions occur fageria 2004 increased root length density and root surface area density can mitigate the effects of drought stress on wheat zhang et al 2009b feng et al 2017 mulching can effectively promote early root growth and quick rooting increase root length root number and root quality and improve the spatial and temporal distribution of roots in soil gao et al 2014 in rainfed agricultural production areas exploring the growth and development of winter wheat roots under different mulching methods will guide production improvements because crop roots are hidden in the soil it is difficult to study root growth dynamics traditional root growth research methods are often laborious and time consuming and even destroy the soil root system which is not conducive to obtaining accurate root growth dynamic results minirhizotron root monitoring technology is a non destructive method for observing fine roots of plants in situ johnson et al 2001 majdi and öhrvik 2004 xiong et al 2011 this technique has been widely used to study dynamic changes in crop root systems among nitrogen application levels cultivation systems different growing periods and different varieties herrera et al 2007 munoz romero et al 2010 however application of the minirhizotron root monitoring technique to the root system of winter wheat under different mulching treatments is rarely reported moreover there are few reports on the spatial temporal distribution of winter wheat roots and water consumption using different mulching methods therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of winter wheat roots under different mulching methods using minirhizotron root monitoring technology 2 analyze the correlations among root parameters water storage yield components yield aboveground biomass and water use efficiency and 3 identify whether ridge furrow dual mulching is an effective strategy in rainfed regions for increasing the spatial temporal distribution of root systems crop production and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1

in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the four cultivation practices used in this experiment were i traditional flat planting ck ii flat planting with half film mulching m1 iii ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges only m2 and iv ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows m3 there were 12 experimental plots each being 10

collected images were 21 56 19 56 cm three minirhizotrons 200 cm long 6 4 cm inner diameter were installed at the center of each treatment on the sowing line in november 2013 at an angle of 45 to the soil surface light was blocked from entering the aboveground tube with black film meanwhile a cover was installed at the mouth of the tube to prevent rain and dust from entering fig 3 scanning software equipped with the ci 600 root monitoring system was used to obtain root system images of the 0 100 cm soil layer at different winter wheat growth stages over wintering jointing anthesis and maturity in turn the miniature camera was inserted into each tube to a depth of 100 cm and images were captured at intervals of 10 cm soil layer with the aid of a slide rod after each data collection the images were analyzed by winrhizotron image analysis software for root lengths average diameter surface area etc roots that were white or brown were classified as live and black as dead wang et al

and simko 2016 all data are averages of three replicates 3 results 3 1 temporal distribution of root root diameter rd root length density rld and root surface area density rsd in the 0 20 cm soil layer were strongly affected by the different treatments fig 4 in the 0 20 cm soil layer rd rld and rsd of the wheat crop increased first and then decreased with the growth process and root growth was the most vigorous from jointing to anthesis root diameter differed significantly among the different soil mulching treatments in 2013 2014 m3 m2 and m1 had 13 3 10 0 and 6 7 higher rd respectively at the over wintering stage relative to ck reaching a maximum at anthesis in all treatments m3 m2 m1 ck at maturity rd in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments was 22 2 11 1 and 4 4 higher than ck respectively similar trends for rd were observed in 2014 2015 except for no significant difference between m1 and ck at the over wintering stage p 0 05 all mulching treatments had significantly higher rd than ck from regreening to maturity in both years p 0 05 the different soil mulching treatments significantly affected rld at different growth stages of wheat across the two seasons fig 4 the m3 treatment produced higher rld than the m2 m1 and ck treatments at all growth stages being 38 1 of ck at over wintering 56 2 at regreening 62 8 at jointing 50 9 at anthesis and 49 8 at maturity the rsd of wheat under m3 m2 and m1 was significantly higher than ck after the over wintering stage in both study years p 0 05 being 60 1 33 4 25 4 and 23 5 higher in m3 55 1 27 4 18 5 and 15 9 higher in m2 and 40 9 15 8 13 4 and 12 5 higher in m1 at regreening jointing anthesis and maturity respectively 3 2 spatial distribution of root the root diameter rd of winter wheat declined with increasing soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer at anthesis and maturity fig 5 the 0 20 cm soil layer had the largest rd followed by the 20 40 cm soil layer mulching treatments increased the rd at anthesis relative to ck in the 0 100 cm soil layer in both years at harvest all treatments showed a decreasing trend in rd which were not significantly thicker than ck in m2 or m1 from 40 to 100 cm in either study year p 0 05 except for the 40 60 cm layer in 2014 2015 root length density rld can reflect the spatial state of the wheat root system in soil and indirectly reflect the growth and development of the root system and the absorption state of soil water and nutrients most of the wheat root systems under the four treatments were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer the maximum rld was mainly in the 0 20 cm soil layer with a few roots distributed in the 40 100 cm soil layer fig 6 the mean rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounted for 62 2 61 0 59 3 and 55 8 of the total rld in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively at maturity in both years indicating that the 0 40 cm soil layer is the main active distribution area of the wheat root system at anthesis and maturity in both years the mulching treatments produced significantly higher rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer than the ck treatment p 0 05 but no significant differences in the 40 100 cm soil layer p 0 05 the root surface area density rsd and root length density rld followed a similar trend in the 0 100 cm soil layer between treatments fig 7 at anthesis m3 m2 and m1 had significantly higher rsd than ck in the 0 40 cm soil layer p 0 05 the mean rsd values across both years in m3 were 22 6 and 27 0 higher than that of ck in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively at anthesis rsd in the 40 100 cm soil layer did not differ between treatments at maturity m3 m2 and m1 had significantly higher rsd than ck from 0 to 40 cm p 0 05 except for the 20 40 cm soil layer in 2014 at maturity rsd in 40 100 cm soil layer did not significantly differ between treatments in either year p 0 05 3 3 soil moisture soil water storage sws from 0 to 100 cm soil depth before and after precipitation differed in the different mulching treatments table 1 precipitation events in 2014 2015 during seeding jointing and anthesis are used here as examples at seeding one precipitation event from 22 to 24 november 2014 increased soil water storage by 32 5 30 5 26 3 and 20 1 mm in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively relative to that before the rain the water storage efficiency wse increased by 67 5 55 2 and 35 6 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment at jointing one precipitation event from 18 to 20 march 2015 increased sws by 46 6 44 0 43 2 and 34 1 mm in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively relative to that before the rain the wse increased by 26 3 19 2 and 16 5 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment at anthesis one precipitation event from 18 to 21 april 2015 increased sws by 32 9 30 5 28 6 and 21 2 mm in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively relative to that before the rain the water storage efficiency increased by 24 6 15 5 and 8 3 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment these results indicate that the water storage capacity decreases with increasing crop canopy size in all treatments the m3 treatment had the highest wse based on the three sampling times the most pronounced effects on sws were recorded during seeding growth in both years fig 8 with the average sws within the 0 200 cm soil layer increasing by 8 3 7 1 and 3 9 in m3 m2 and m1 respectively relative to ck in 2013 2014 sws reached the highest level at anthesis while it occurred at jointing in 2014 2015 these differences were a consequence of the timing and amount of precipitation and crop growth and development the m3 treatment had the highest sws in both years followed by the m2 and m1 treatments 3 4 correlation between root system and soil water storage a correlation analysis between sws during the growing season and root parameters was undertaken to explore these relationships under different mulching treatments fig 9 sws had a significant positive correlation with rd rld and rsd p 0 05 with correlation coefficients of 0 56 0 76 and 0 69 respectively during over wintering stage 0 71 0 79 and 0 81 respectively during anthesis stage and 0 83 0 76 and 0 73 respectively during maturity stage this indicates that root growth is closely related to the environmental water content and that different water harvesting methods can significantly change the water environment for crop roots 3 5 grain yields and wue all mulching treatments had higher spike numbers grain numbers 1000 grain weights and aboveground biomass than the control treatment with the m3 treatment having the highest values table 2 the mulching treatments also had higher wheat yields and wues than the ck treatment with m3 significantly higher than m2 and m1 p 0 05 the average wheat yield across study years was in the order of m3 m2 m1 ck being 39 1 25 1 and 20 4 respectively higher than ck the two year mean wue in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments increased significantly by 42 3

with rsd 4 discussion 4 1 effect of soil mulching on root growth and spatial and temporal distribution our findings suggest that adequate water supply in rainfed areas can stimulate rapid root growth in the upper soil layer the root system is the most important part of wheat growth and development whether the root system develops well or not will directly affect the ability of crops to absorb water and nutrients and synthesize a variety of physiologically active substances yang et al 2004 in this study a minirhizotron root monitoring system was used to detect the root growth of wheat more accurately through repeated in situ detection without disturbance than traditional drilling studies have shown that the rd rld and rsd of winter wheat roots increase first and then decrease with advancement of the growth process and root growth was the most vigorous from over wintering to anthesis qiu et al 2012 feng et al 2017 however there is no consistent conclusion on when rd and rld reach the maximum value feng et al 2017 believed that rld and rsd of wheat reached the maximum at the anthesis stage qiu et al 2012 reported that the rd and rld of wheat reached the maximum at the end of the jointing stage and rsd at the anthesis stage in our study rd rld and rsd reached the maximum at the anthesis stage this difference may be related to experimental conditions and varieties the rd rld and rsd grew fastest during anthesis in 2013 14 and jointing in 2014 15 fig 4 this difference may have been due to more precipitation occurring during anthesis in 2013 14 and jointing in 2014 15 fig 1 at the same time the m3 treatment had the maximum values for rd rld and rsd among all treatments probably because it produced the best soil water storage and moisture conservation table 1 and fig 8 root diameter is an important morphological root parameter since it can have a significant effect on root modeling and root penetration ability into deeper soil enabling roots to absorb more water from deeper soil layers during the dry season ali et al 2018 the rd of wheat mainly depends on water supply during the growing period in rainfed areas li et al 2001 2010 in our study the mulching treatments resulted in a thicker rd than the ck treatment at anthesis but rd slowly declined in all treatments at maturity fig 5 this indicates that mulching treatments can increase root diameter which is beneficial for absorbing soil nutrients root length density rld and root surface area density rsd in crop plants play an important role in improving water and nutrient use efficiency in soil jia et al 2018a chen et al 2018 typically a ridge furrow system can increase vertical root penetration due to more precipitation infiltrated deeper into the soil xu et al 2016 as observed in our study where the mulching treatments had markedly higher rld and rsd than the ck treatment with the maximum values observed in the m3 treatment figs 6 and 7 jia et al 2018a reported that the ridge furrow treatment had significantly higher rld and rsd in the 0 50 cm soil layer than traditional flat planting with no significant differences observed in the 60 100 cm soil layer at silking and maturity in maize ridge furrow mulching significantly increased the soil moisture content in the root layer making the root absorb the soil moisture in the upper layer which induced the growth of the topsoil roots ali et al 2018 therefore rld and rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layer were significantly different among different treatments while there was no significant difference in the soil layer below 40 cm figs 6 and 7 4 2 effect of soil mulching on soil moisture changes in sws during wheat growth is mainly affected by precipitation soil evaporation and crop transpiration hu et al 2014 li et al 2016 gu et al 2017 compared with planting on bare land soil mulching cultivation can enhance water storage in the soil jia et al 2006 in our study the mean wse increased by 39 4 30 0 and 20 1 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment when precipitation occurred at three different growth stages of wheat table 1 the water storage capacity in all treatments decreased as the crop canopy increased in size which may be due to more precipitation attaching to and evaporating from the increased surface area of the crop canopy han et al 2004 and hu et al 2019 found that the m3 treatment succeeded in collecting more precipitation into the soil in arid and semiarid environments similarly our study showed that ridge furrow dual mulching helped collect precipitation to the wheat root areas effectively and efficiently although half film mulching with or without ridges also collected precipitation to the wheat root areas part of the precipitation may have already flowed to the uncovered area with less precipitation collecting to the root areas gao et al 2014 compared with ridge furrow dual mulching half film mulching harvested less precipitation evaporated more water and was poor in collecting precipitation the most pronounced effects on soil water storage from 0 200 cm occurred during seeding growth in both years fig 8 bu et al 2013 and hu et al 2019 confirmed that more soil water is lost from traditional flat planting due to intense soil surface evaporation by direct solar radiation during early growth 4 3 correlation between root system and soil water storage water conditions affect the growth and distribution of crop roots and the growth of wheat roots is influence by the soil water environment and cultivation methods feng et al 2017 when water is sufficient it is beneficial to root growth and increase the number of surface roots while the opposite is true when water is deficient xu et al 2010 steinemann et al 2015 in canola brassica napus and maize rd and rld were positively related to soil water availability kirkegaard et al 1997 gao et al 2014 similar to zhou et al 2015 we found that sws had a significant positive correlation with rd rld and rsd therefore we conclude that increasing soil water storage can significantly improve the growing environment of crop roots which promotes root growth and enhances the crop s ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil 4 4 effect of soil mulching on grain yield and wue crop yields reflect the levels of agricultural system management and soil productivity and are an important evaluation index of sustainable agricultural development mukherjee et al 2010 it is well known that stabilizing and increasing yield per unit area is important for the sustainable development of dryland agriculture ding et al 2019 soil mulching is an effective cultivation practice for improving crop production ridge and furrow rain harvesting collects rainwater that falls onto the ridges to be passed to the crop rooting zones improving precipitation use efficiency and grain yields mo et al 2017 qin et al 2018 jia et al 2018b our two year study showed that mulching increased mean wheat yields and wue by 39 1 and 42 3 in m3 25 1 and 26 4 in m2 and 20 4 and 21 4 in m1 respectively relative to ck table 2 there was no significant difference in total et over the whole wheat growing season so wue was affected by grain yield not et table 2 studies have shown that because ck can reduce soil evaporation ck has a larger et than mulching treatments chen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in our study there was no significant difference in et between ck and mulching treatments which may be because the mulching treatment effectively restrained soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration and saved soil water for later vegetative and reproductive growth ding et al 2018 previous research has shown that ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows improved soil water and temperature status enhanced crop yield and increased net income when compared with plastic film mulch on ridges li et al 2013 chen et al 2015 4 5 correlation between yield and wue and root parameters wheat yield components yield aboveground biomass and wue had positive correlations with rd rld and rsd in both years fig 10 the et values had negative correlations with yield components yield ab wue rd and rld in both years and no or weak correlations with rsd jia et al 2018c reported that rld and rsd in maize had a high positive correlation with grain yield therefore the promotion of root development should be the main strategy for increasing grain yield feng et al 2017 reported that aboveground biomass and wue had significant positive correlations with rld rsd and root weight density in the 0 20 cm soil layer in our study root parameters rd rld rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layers had stronger correlations with yield components yield ab and wue but weaker correlations with yield components yield ab and wue in the 60 100 cm soil layers 5 conclusions the m3 treatment was a more effective practice for increasing grain yields than m2 m1 and ck respectively over the two years of study soil mulching significantly improved morphology of the root system in the top 40 cm of the soil profile and enhanced soil water storage through the whole rooting zone which contributed to improving yield the rd rld and rsd reached maximum values in the m3 treatment at the same time m3 had the highest water storage efficiency based on the three sampling times soil water storage had positive correlations with rd rld and rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layer rd rld rsd had strong positive correlations with yield components yield aboveground biomass and wue we conclude that ridge furrow planting with plastic film mulch over ridges and wheat straw mulch in furrows is an effective sustainable cultivation method for wheat production in rainfed regions this is due to improvements in rooting systems and increased water content in rooting zones which contributes to higher grain yield and wue declaration of competing

10532,in dryland agricultural production areas knowledge on the growth and variation of winter wheat root systems under different mulching methods is important for guiding winter wheat production we conducted a two year field trial to explore the effects of different mulching practices on the spatial temporal distribution of root growth soil water storage and grain yield four cultivation practices were tested i traditional flat planting ck ii flat planting with half film mulching m1 iii ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges only m2 and iv ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows m3 the results showed that the root diameter rd root length density rld and root surface area density rsd of wheat under the four treatments were mainly concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer the mean rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounted for 62 2 61 0 59 3 and 55 8 of the total root length density under m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively at maturity in both years the m3 cultivation method produced the maximum values for rd rld and rsd among all cultivation practices and the highest water storage efficiency after the three precipitation events the m3 treatment had 11 1 15 4 and 38 4 higher mean grain yields than m2 m1 and ck respectively over the two year study soil water storage had positive correlations with rd rld and rsd the rd rld and rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layer had strong positive correlations with yield components yield aboveground biomass and water use efficiency wue based on this study ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows is an effective sustainable cultivation method for wheat production in rainfed regions which can increase the spatial temporal distribution of root systems and soil water content across the root zones to increase crop production and wue keywords ridge furrow dual mulching spatial temporal distribution of root soil moisture grain yield winter wheat 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important cultivated crops in the loess plateau of china accounting for 44 of the cultivated area in this region jin et al 2007 wang et al 2012 despite the average annual precipitation on the loess plateau being around 580 mm only about 200 mm occurs in the wheat growing season which is about 30 of the total crop water demand of wheat xue et al 2017 because groundwater is scarce and relatively deep in the loess plateau dryland agriculture mainly relies on natural precipitation to maintain agricultural production zhang et al 2009a therefore practices that improve the utilization of limited precipitation reduce evaporation and increase water use efficiency are urgently needed the ridge and furrow rain harvesting cultivation technique mulching ridges with film and planting crops in furrows could direct the rainwater falling onto the ridges to the crop s rooting zone and improve the utilization rate of precipitation carter and miller 1991 li et al 2001 2013 jia et al 2018a some studies have indicated that ridge and furrow rain harvesting systems are better able to collect light rain and retain surface runoff from heavy rain than flat planting thereby increasing water use efficiency han et al 2013 li et al 2016 compared to the conventional flat planting pattern ridge furrow cultivation improves soil temperature accumulates rainwater and enhances grain yields tian et al 2003 zhang et al 2007 liu et al 2014 however during early winter growth ridge furrow planting with film only over the ridges is less likely to reduce evaporation in the furrows than film mulching over both ridges and furrows chen et al 2015 some frequent small precipitation events will quickly evaporate directly from the surface of the plastic film and not infiltrate rooting zones for crop use under full plastic film mulching in ridges and furrows zhao et al 2009 ding et al 2018 straw mulching reduces water evaporation but prevents rain from hitting the soil surface dong et al 2018 positive effects of plastic film mulch over the ridges and straw mulch in the furrows on maize production have been reported li et al 2013 but no such studies have been undertaken on winter wheat the spatial and temporal distribution of the wheat root system determines its ability to absorb nutrients and water yang et al 2004 chen et al 2014 the distribution of wheat roots in soil is important for efficient production management and the development of water saving agriculture ali et al 2018 the root system occupies a crucial position in the agricultural ecosystem and provides information from the soil to the crop to stimulate appropriate adaptive responses for instance the root system regulates root distribution characteristics and metabolism to allocate limited water resources optimally lynch 2007 ali et al 2018 the root system s function is closely related to root morphology and physiological characteristics and it often adapts to environmental changes through configuration changes and its spatial and temporal distribution lynch 2007 wu and cheng 2014 song et al 2018 the growth and development of the root system and its spatial and temporal distribution in soil not only determine the crop s absorption of water and nutrients during the growing period but also directly affect the establishment of the aboveground canopy assimilate distribution and final yield forde and lorenzo 2001 chen et al 2014 roots are highly plastic and influenced by soil moisture status which most of the roots are located feng et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the main root parameters of crops include root length density rld root surface area density rsd and root diameter rd ali et al 2018 which determine the efficacy of the whole root system mosaddeghi et al 2009 gao et al 2014 and indirectly affect aboveground biomass and grain yield feng et al 2017 longer roots provide more nutrients to plants than shorter roots gao et al 2014 a sound root system can prevent crop lodging when adverse conditions occur fageria 2004 increased root length density and root surface area density can mitigate the effects of drought stress on wheat zhang et al 2009b feng et al 2017 mulching can effectively promote early root growth and quick rooting increase root length root number and root quality and improve the spatial and temporal distribution of roots in soil gao et al 2014 in rainfed agricultural production areas exploring the growth and development of winter wheat roots under different mulching methods will guide production improvements because crop roots are hidden in the soil it is difficult to study root growth dynamics traditional root growth research methods are often laborious and time consuming and even destroy the soil root system which is not conducive to obtaining accurate root growth dynamic results minirhizotron root monitoring technology is a non destructive method for observing fine roots of plants in situ johnson et al 2001 majdi and öhrvik 2004 xiong et al 2011 this technique has been widely used to study dynamic changes in crop root systems among nitrogen application levels cultivation systems different growing periods and different varieties herrera et al 2007 munoz romero et al 2010 however application of the minirhizotron root monitoring technique to the root system of winter wheat under different mulching treatments is rarely reported moreover there are few reports on the spatial temporal distribution of winter wheat roots and water consumption using different mulching methods therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of winter wheat roots under different mulching methods using minirhizotron root monitoring technology 2 analyze the correlations among root parameters water storage yield components yield aboveground biomass and water use efficiency and 3 identify whether ridge furrow dual mulching is an effective strategy in rainfed regions for increasing the spatial temporal distribution of root systems crop production and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1

in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the four cultivation practices used in this experiment were i traditional flat planting ck ii flat planting with half film mulching m1 iii ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges only m2 and iv ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows m3 there were 12 experimental plots each being 10 m2 5 m 2 m and arranged in a randomized design with three replicates in the m1 treatment the half plastic film was mulched on the flat surface in the m2 and m3 treatments the ridges 30 cm wide and 15

the next crop is planted with maize after the wheat harvest winter wheat variety xiaoyan 22 at a seeding rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 and row spacing of 30 cm was planted on 9 october 2013 and 15 october 2014 and harvested on 5 june 2014 and 6 june 2015 respectively before sowing 120 kg n ha 1 and 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 fertilizer were applied to the upper soil layer 0 20 cm with another 30 kg n ha 1

measurements were obtained using a ci 600 cid bio science camas wa usa minirhizotron root monitoring system which comprises a minirhizotron micro camera and winrhizotron image analysis software the collected images were 21 56 19 56 cm three minirhizotrons 200 cm long 6 4 cm inner diameter were installed at the center of each treatment on the sowing line in november 2013 at an angle of 45 to the soil surface light was blocked from entering the aboveground tube with black film meanwhile a cover was installed at the mouth of the tube to prevent rain and dust from entering fig 3 scanning software equipped with the ci 600 root monitoring system was used to obtain root system images of the 0 100 cm soil layer at different winter wheat growth stages over wintering jointing anthesis and maturity in turn the miniature camera was inserted into each tube to a depth of 100 cm and images were captured at intervals of 10 cm soil layer with the aid of a slide rod after each data collection the images were analyzed by winrhizotron image analysis software for root lengths average diameter surface area etc roots that were white or brown were classified as live and black as dead wang et al 2017 root length density rld and root surface area density rsd were calculated as 5 r l d r l s d 6 r s d r s s d where rld cm cm 3 is root length density per unit volume rsd cm2 cm 3 is root surface

and simko 2016 all data are averages of three replicates 3 results 3 1 temporal distribution of root root diameter rd root length density rld and root surface area density rsd in the 0 20 cm soil layer were strongly affected by the different treatments fig 4 in the 0 20 cm soil layer rd rld and rsd of the wheat crop increased first and then decreased with the growth process and root growth was the most vigorous from jointing to anthesis root diameter differed significantly among the different soil mulching treatments in 2013 2014 m3 m2 and m1 had 13 3 10 0 and 6 7 higher rd respectively at the over wintering stage relative to ck reaching a maximum at anthesis in all treatments m3 m2 m1 ck at maturity rd in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments was 22 2 11 1 and 4 4 higher than ck respectively similar trends for rd were observed in 2014 2015 except for no significant difference between m1 and ck at the over wintering stage p 0 05 all mulching treatments had significantly higher rd than ck from regreening to maturity in both years p 0 05 the different soil mulching treatments significantly affected rld at different growth stages of wheat across the two seasons fig 4 the m3 treatment produced higher rld than the m2 m1 and ck treatments at all growth stages being 38 1 of ck at over wintering 56 2 at regreening 62 8 at jointing 50 9 at anthesis and 49 8 at maturity the rsd of wheat under m3 m2 and m1 was significantly higher than ck after the over wintering stage in both study years p 0 05 being 60 1 33 4 25 4 and 23 5 higher in m3 55 1 27 4 18 5 and 15 9 higher in m2 and 40 9 15 8 13 4 and 12 5 higher in m1 at regreening jointing anthesis and maturity respectively 3 2 spatial distribution of root the root diameter rd of winter wheat declined with increasing soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer at anthesis and maturity fig 5 the 0 20 cm soil layer had the largest rd followed by the 20 40 cm soil layer mulching treatments increased the rd at anthesis relative to ck in the 0 100 cm soil layer in both years at harvest all treatments showed a decreasing trend in rd which were not significantly thicker than ck in m2 or m1 from 40 to 100 cm in either study year p 0 05 except for the 40 60 cm layer in 2014 2015 root length density rld can reflect the spatial state of the wheat root system in soil and indirectly reflect the growth and development of the root system and the absorption state of soil water and nutrients most of the wheat root systems under the four treatments were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer the maximum rld was mainly in the 0 20 cm soil layer with a few roots distributed in the 40 100 cm soil layer fig 6 the mean rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounted for 62 2 61 0 59 3 and 55 8 of the total rld in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively at maturity in both years indicating that the 0 40 cm soil layer is the main active distribution area of the wheat root system at anthesis and maturity in both years the mulching treatments produced significantly higher rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer than the ck treatment p 0 05 but no significant differences in the 40 100 cm soil layer p 0 05 the root surface area density rsd and root length density rld followed a similar trend in the 0 100 cm soil layer between treatments fig 7 at anthesis m3 m2 and m1 had significantly higher rsd than ck in the 0 40 cm soil layer p 0 05 the mean rsd values across both years in m3 were 22 6 and 27 0 higher than that of ck in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively at anthesis rsd in the 40 100 cm soil layer did not differ between treatments at maturity m3 m2 and m1 had significantly higher rsd than ck from 0 to 40 cm p 0 05 except for the 20 40 cm soil layer in 2014 at maturity rsd in 40 100 cm soil layer did not significantly differ between treatments in either year p 0 05 3 3 soil moisture soil water storage sws from 0 to 100 cm soil depth before and after precipitation differed in the different mulching treatments table 1 precipitation events in 2014 2015 during seeding jointing and anthesis are used here as examples at seeding one precipitation event from 22 to 24 november 2014 increased soil water storage by 32 5 30 5 26 3 and 20 1 mm in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively relative to that before the rain the water storage efficiency wse increased by 67 5 55 2 and 35 6 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment at jointing one precipitation event from 18 to 20 march 2015 increased sws by 46 6 44 0 43 2 and 34 1 mm in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively relative to that before the rain the wse increased by 26 3 19 2 and 16 5 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment at anthesis one precipitation event from 18 to 21 april 2015 increased sws by 32 9 30 5 28 6 and 21 2 mm in m3 m2 m1 and ck respectively relative to that before the rain the water storage efficiency increased by 24 6 15 5 and 8 3 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment these results indicate that the water storage capacity decreases with increasing crop canopy size in all treatments the m3 treatment had the highest wse based on the three sampling times the most pronounced effects on sws were recorded during seeding growth in both years fig 8 with the average sws within the 0 200 cm soil layer increasing by 8 3 7 1 and 3 9 in m3 m2 and m1 respectively relative to ck in 2013 2014 sws reached the highest level at anthesis while it occurred at jointing in 2014 2015 these differences were a consequence of the timing and amount of precipitation and crop growth and development the m3 treatment had the highest sws in both years followed by the m2 and m1 treatments 3 4 correlation between root system and soil water storage a correlation analysis between sws during the growing season and root parameters was undertaken to explore these relationships under different mulching treatments fig 9 sws had a significant positive correlation with rd rld and rsd p 0 05 with correlation coefficients of 0 56 0 76 and 0 69 respectively during over wintering stage 0 71 0 79 and 0 81 respectively during anthesis stage and 0 83 0 76 and 0 73 respectively during maturity stage this indicates that root growth is closely related to the environmental water content and that different water harvesting methods can significantly change the water environment for crop roots 3 5 grain yields and wue all mulching treatments had higher spike numbers grain numbers 1000 grain weights and aboveground biomass than the control treatment with the m3 treatment having the highest values table 2 the mulching treatments also had higher wheat yields and wues than the ck treatment with m3 significantly higher than m2 and m1 p 0 05 the average wheat yield across study years was in the order of m3 m2 m1 ck being 39 1 25 1 and 20 4 respectively higher than ck the two year mean wue in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments increased significantly by 42 3 26 4 and 21 4 p 0 05 respectively relative to ck no significant differences in et were observed p 0 05 3 6 correlation between yields and wue and root parameters the correlations between yield components yield aboveground biomass et wue and root parameters at maturity for the two study years are shown in fig 10 overall yield components yield aboveground biomass and wue had positive

with rsd 4 discussion 4 1 effect of soil mulching on root growth and spatial and temporal distribution our findings suggest that adequate water supply in rainfed areas can stimulate rapid root growth in the upper soil layer the root system is the most important part of wheat growth and development whether the root system develops well or not will directly affect the ability of crops to absorb water and nutrients and synthesize a variety of physiologically active substances yang et al 2004 in this study a minirhizotron root monitoring system was used to detect the root growth of wheat more accurately through repeated in situ detection without disturbance than traditional drilling studies have shown that the rd rld and rsd of winter wheat roots increase first and then decrease with advancement of the growth process and root growth was the most vigorous from over wintering to anthesis qiu et al 2012 feng et al 2017 however there is no consistent conclusion on when rd and rld reach the maximum value feng et al 2017 believed that rld and rsd of wheat reached the maximum at the anthesis stage qiu et al 2012 reported that the rd and rld of wheat reached the maximum at the end of the jointing stage and rsd at the anthesis stage in our study rd rld and rsd reached the maximum at the anthesis stage this difference may be related to experimental conditions and varieties the rd rld and rsd grew fastest during anthesis in 2013 14 and jointing in 2014 15 fig 4 this difference may have been due to more precipitation occurring during anthesis in 2013 14 and jointing in 2014 15 fig 1 at the same time the m3 treatment had the maximum values for rd rld and rsd among all treatments probably because it produced the best soil water storage and moisture conservation table 1 and fig 8 root diameter is an important morphological root parameter since it can have a significant effect on root modeling and root penetration ability into deeper soil enabling roots to absorb more water from deeper soil layers during the dry season ali et al 2018 the rd of wheat mainly depends on water supply during the growing period in rainfed areas li et al 2001 2010 in our study the mulching treatments resulted in a thicker rd than the ck treatment at anthesis but rd slowly declined in all treatments at maturity fig 5 this indicates that mulching treatments can increase root diameter which is beneficial for absorbing soil nutrients root length density rld and root surface area density rsd in crop plants play an important role in improving water and nutrient use efficiency in soil jia et al 2018a chen et al 2018 typically a ridge furrow system can increase vertical root penetration due to more precipitation infiltrated deeper into the soil xu et al 2016 as observed in our study where the mulching treatments had markedly higher rld and rsd than the ck treatment with the maximum values observed in the m3 treatment figs 6 and 7 jia et al 2018a reported that the ridge furrow treatment had significantly higher rld and rsd in the 0 50 cm soil layer than traditional flat planting with no significant differences observed in the 60 100 cm soil layer at silking and maturity in maize ridge furrow mulching significantly increased the soil moisture content in the root layer making the root absorb the soil moisture in the upper layer which induced the growth of the topsoil roots ali et al 2018 therefore rld and rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layer were significantly different among different treatments while there was no significant difference in the soil layer below 40 cm figs 6 and 7 4 2 effect of soil mulching on soil moisture changes in sws during wheat growth is mainly affected by precipitation soil evaporation and crop transpiration hu et al 2014 li et al 2016 gu et al 2017 compared with planting on bare land soil mulching cultivation can enhance water storage in the soil jia et al 2006 in our study the mean wse increased by 39 4 30 0 and 20 1 in the m3 m2 and m1 treatments respectively compared to the ck treatment when precipitation occurred at three different growth stages of wheat table 1 the water storage capacity in all treatments decreased as the crop canopy increased in size which may be due to more precipitation attaching to and evaporating from the increased surface area of the crop canopy han et al 2004 and hu et al 2019 found that the m3 treatment succeeded in collecting more precipitation into the soil in arid and semiarid environments similarly our study showed that ridge furrow dual mulching helped collect precipitation to the wheat root areas effectively and efficiently although half film mulching with or without ridges also collected precipitation to the wheat root areas part of the precipitation may have already flowed to the uncovered area with less precipitation collecting to the root areas gao et al 2014 compared with ridge furrow dual mulching half film mulching harvested less precipitation evaporated more water and was poor in collecting precipitation the most pronounced effects on soil water storage from 0 200 cm occurred during seeding growth in both years fig 8 bu et al 2013 and hu et al 2019 confirmed that more soil water is lost from traditional flat planting due to intense soil surface evaporation by direct solar radiation during early growth 4 3 correlation between root system and soil water storage water conditions affect the growth and distribution of crop roots and the growth of wheat roots is influence by the soil water environment and cultivation methods feng et al 2017 when water is sufficient it is beneficial to root growth and increase the number of surface roots while the opposite is true when water is deficient xu et al 2010 steinemann et al 2015 in canola brassica napus and maize rd and rld were positively related to soil water availability kirkegaard et al 1997 gao et al 2014 similar to zhou et al 2015 we found that sws had a significant positive correlation with rd rld and rsd therefore we conclude that increasing soil water storage can significantly improve the growing environment of crop roots which promotes root growth and enhances the crop s ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil 4 4 effect of soil mulching on grain yield and wue crop yields reflect the levels of agricultural system management and soil productivity and are an important evaluation index of sustainable agricultural development mukherjee et al 2010 it is well known that stabilizing and increasing yield per unit area is important for the sustainable development of dryland agriculture ding et al 2019 soil mulching is an effective cultivation practice for improving crop production ridge and furrow rain harvesting collects rainwater that falls onto the ridges to be passed to the crop rooting zones improving precipitation use efficiency and grain yields mo et al 2017 qin et al 2018 jia et al 2018b our two year study showed that mulching increased mean wheat yields and wue by 39 1 and 42 3 in m3 25 1 and 26 4 in m2 and 20 4 and 21 4 in m1 respectively relative to ck table 2 there was no significant difference in total et over the whole wheat growing season so wue was affected by grain yield not et table 2 studies have shown that because ck can reduce soil evaporation ck has a larger et than mulching treatments chen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in our study there was no significant difference in et between ck and mulching treatments which may be because the mulching treatment effectively restrained soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration and saved soil water for later vegetative and reproductive growth ding et al 2018 previous research has shown that ridge furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows improved soil water and temperature status enhanced crop yield and increased net income when compared with plastic film mulch on ridges li et al 2013 chen et al 2015 4 5 correlation between yield and wue and root parameters wheat yield components yield aboveground biomass and wue had positive correlations with rd rld and rsd in both years fig 10 the et values had negative correlations with yield components yield ab wue rd and rld in both years and no or weak correlations with rsd jia et al 2018c reported that rld and rsd in maize had a high positive correlation with grain yield therefore the promotion of root development should be the main strategy for increasing grain yield feng et al 2017 reported that aboveground biomass and wue had significant positive correlations with rld rsd and root weight density in the 0 20 cm soil layer in our study root parameters rd rld rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layers had stronger correlations with yield components yield ab and wue but weaker correlations with yield components yield ab and wue in the 60 100 cm soil layers 5 conclusions the m3 treatment was a more effective practice for increasing grain yields than m2 m1 and ck respectively over the two years of study soil mulching significantly improved morphology of the root system in the top 40 cm of the soil profile and enhanced soil water storage through the whole rooting zone which contributed to improving yield the rd rld and rsd reached maximum values in the m3 treatment at the same time m3 had the highest water storage efficiency based on the three sampling times soil water storage had positive correlations with rd rld and rsd in the 0 40 cm soil layer rd rld rsd had strong positive correlations with yield components yield aboveground biomass and wue we conclude that ridge furrow planting with plastic film mulch over ridges and wheat straw mulch in furrows is an effective sustainable cultivation method for wheat production in rainfed regions this is due to improvements in rooting systems and increased water content in rooting zones which contributes to higher grain yield and wue declaration of competing

biomass was 21 3 ton ha 1 21 8 ton ha 1 19 ton ha 1 and 18 3 ton ha 1 respectively as a consequence wp could increase by 92 8 78 and 95 in s b s c and s d respectively with reference to the measured

where 91 of the population experiences at least some kind of water shortage kummu ward et al 2010 in order to feed the growing population across the globe there is a dire need to grow more food therefore the scope of adjustment of agricultural water use is crucial as a response to meet the global food security targets wheat is the main staple food of afghanistan which is consumed 2 3 times a

over irrigation of different crops e g maize rice barley etc is a common practice in afghanistan safi 2011 a general hypothesis exists among farmers in afghanistan that over irrigation gets them more biomass and yields this has on one side retarded the equity in water allocation and irrigated area expansion and on the other side weakened the interaction between farmers at different reaches of the canal which leads often to conflicts over water distribution poor conveyance and water sharing beside this the supply based irrigation system across the kabul river basin is suffering from poor performance and lower efficiency akhtar et al 2018 under growing water scarcity the business as usual is not sustainable and hence water managers at some point of time have to interfere the current study therefore is designed to develop different options for the farmers and the policy makers to mitigate the adverse impact of water scarcity by adapting deficit irrigation schedule there are different models which are being used for simulation of crop water productivity wp under deficit irrigation but most of them require extensive data sets for carrying out targeted simulations and sometimes they are not user friendly or perhaps are region and crop specific but in the current study we used aquacrop model due to the fact that it has shown better performance than cropsyst under both optimal and non optimal water conditions akhtar et al 2013 abi saab et al 2015 moreover it considers the fundamental processes involved in crop productivity and in its response to water deficit scenarios both in terms of physiological and agronomic background perspectives aquacrop may be successful in getting a good balance in simplicity robustness accuracy and ease of use steduto et al 2009 greaves and wang 2016 used aquacrop model for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed irrigation management strategies they used this model for the analysis of the performance of aquacrop for maize under full and deficit irrigation under tropical environment and meanwhile tested and validated the effectiveness of the calibrated model for simulating biomass and grain yield under diversified environmental conditions an overall r2 value of 0 85 and 0 92 obtained under the study of greaves and wang 2016 for biomass and yield respectively shows the suitability of aquacrop model for simulating crop wp under different climate conditions in the current study fao s aquacrop model was calibrated and validated with field data for wheat crop and therefore simulated different water scarcity scenarios to evaluate and analyze the resultant yield wp and biomass production these scenarios are namely s a s b s c and s d the s a deals with optimizing wheat wp under business as usual scenario and s b is about refilling the soil profile to field capacity upon 50 water depletion and s c is about refilling the soil profile upon 100 depletion while scenario s d is about refilling the soil profile upon 130 depletion occurrence two wheat fields namely a and b were considered for intensive monitoring for soil moisture content meteorological situation irrigation application crop

study also provides a detailed analysis of the yield and biomass response under different irrigation optimizations options simulated by using the aquacrop model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area attawor irrigation scheme ais with geographic coordinates 34 581 n and 70 606 e lies in nangarhar province at the downstream of the kabul river basin krb and constitute the north western upstream of the indus basin fig 1 the krb consists of around 450 000 ha of irrigated area habib 2014 and hosts around 1 3rd of the country s total population akhtar 2017 the krb provides water for agricultural industrial as well as municipal needs of its inhabitants and contribute to the environmental flow and recharge the groundwater aquifer too being called the agricultural basket of afghanistan nangarhar province cultivates wheat barley maize and rice as the major crops followed by large scale vegetable production that are being consumed inside afghanistan and is partly exported to pakistan world bank 2019 ais takes its supply from kunar river and has a command area of 260 ha out of which 200 ha is cultivated and the remaining 60 ha remains uncultivated ofwmp 2012 wheat has been the major crop cultivated under irrigated conditions at the ais during the study period the study area is characterized by hot summers and mild winters the mean annual rainfall in the study area is in the range of 150 mm mail usgs 2011 which is not enough for crop production and therefore supplementary irrigation is required to meet the crop water demand data from the metrological station shows that the peak temperature during the crop growth period was 37 c and the minimum recorded temperature during this period was 4 c in winter time fig 2 for assessing the conventional irrigation practices and to calibrate and validate the model two experimental fields field a 3598 m2 and field b 4133 m2 were selected at the head and tail reaches of the canal command area respectively 2 2 field data collection soil samples from both fields were collected from three locations at a depth of 0 20 cm 20 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm through an augur the soil samples were collected from the same locations throughout the study period the soil texture analysis was done with lamotte apparatus lamotte 2017 after the determination of soil particle composition through lamotte apparatus the soil was oven dried for 24 h at 104 c the organic matter was determined by the procedure given by reddy 2015 usda soil texture calculator was used to find out the soil types at different layers in both the experimental fields with the same usda soil water characteristic model permanent wilting point pwp hydraulic conductivity of soil field capacity and soil saturation sat were also determined the soil moisture samples were taken from the same sampling points which had already been used for soil texture analysis gravimetric method boone and wengert 1998 was used to determine the soil moisture content before and after each irrigation event cut throat flumes were installed on both fields to measure the amount of irrigation water applied to the fields these flumes were provided and calibrated by the on farm water management project ofwmp in the krb area inlet and outlet readings were recorded on flume with an interval of 1 5 min depending on when the flume readings become constant crop cultivar information and post harvest data was also collected the widely cultivated cultivar of wheat in the study area is baghlan 09 the cultivar information for baghlan 09 was obtained from the local provincial agriculture irrigation and livestock directorate dail for acquiring measured biomass and yield three representative sample points of size 1 m2 were randomly identified each in the head middle and tail end of both fields the harvested crop from each sample field were tied in separate bundles and kept in a safe place for three days as a local practice to dry once the samples were dried the weight of biomass and grains were recorded through a digital balance the soil samples were collected from different depths and soil texture was analyzed tables 1 and 2 2 3 aquacrop model parameterization calibration and validation the aquacrop model was parameterized for the conventional irrigation system with the available climatic data for the period of 2016 2017 different crop growth stages and their relevant phenological information is crucial input for the model calibration the crop parameters are divided into two main categories the first category is called the conservative parameters which are not cultivar specific and are applicable to a wide range while the second category of parameters are called non conservative the conservative parameters table 3 were taken from fao raes et al 2009 and adopted by andarzian bannayan et al 2011 the non conservative parameters as given in table 4 for baghlan 09 wheat variety were acquired through field observations as well as from the cultivar catalogue the farmers used the broadcast method while sowing the experimental fields at a seed sowing rate of 200 kg ha 1 for the calibration of the aquacrop model the yield and biomass data from the fields were used while for validation purpose the measured actual evapotranspiration eta and soil moisture data were used the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the correlativity of the simulated and observed values of yield and biomass as well as eta soil moisture for calibration and validation respectively the simulation models are based on complex iterative equations and techniques with possible uncertainties in order to mitigate these uncertainties there is a need to calibrate and validate the simulated results against field observations for this purpose the r2 eq 1 and root mean square error rmse eq 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the aquacrop model s simulated results the r2 and rmse were calculated as below 1 r 2 1 y i y i 2 y i y 2 where yi y i 2 is the sum squared regression which is a result of the sum of the residuals squared and yi y 2 is the total sum of squares yi is the actual y value y i is the predicted y value and y is the mean y value 2 r m s e i 1 n x o b s i x m o del 1 n where xobs is observed values and xmodel is modelled values at time place i 2 4 simulation of different scenarios with aquacrop model the scenarios adapted in this study were namely s a s b s c and s d the scenario s a deals with optimizing wheat wp under business as usual scenario and scenarios s b is about refilling the soil profile to field capacity upon 50 water depletion of the total available water taw the scenario s c is about refilling the soil profile upon 100 depletion under this scenario the crop was subjected to no stress at the initial crop stage from germination to 50 canopy cover while upon 60 depletion of the taw it was set to apply 40 mm water upon achieving 50 canopy cover and onwards the model was set to subject the crop to water stress and apply 50 mm water when the soil water moisture depletes to 100 of the total available water and apply no water once the crop senescence stage starts similarly the scenario s d is about refilling the soil profile upon 130 depletion occurrence in this scenario the model was set to generate irrigation schedule with the following specification apply 50 mm net irrigation when 60 depletion of the taw occurs during the initial stage from sowing to the 50 canopy cover and to apply 50 mm net irrigation when 130 depletion of the taw occurs when reached at the 50 canopy cover and onwards and then stop irrigation application once the senescence starts 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the aquacrop model the calibration results show that the simulated yield and biomass for field a could be 6 6 ton ha 1 and 18 8 ton ha 1 respectively while for the same experimental field the observed yield and biomass was 6 3 ton ha 1 and 18 5 ton ha 1 which is a perfect match under the local conditions similarly for the field b the simulated yield and biomass could be 6 3 ton ha 1 and 17 9 ton ha 1 respectively while the observed yield and biomass were 6 1 ton ha 1 and 18 ton ha 1 respectively the precision in yield and biomass simulation of wheat through aquacrop model can be confirmed from other studies too singh saha et al 2013 kumar sarangi et al 2014 3 2 validation of the aquacrop model by correlating the observed and simulated actual evapotranspiration eta the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 90 and 0 86 for field a and field b respectively fig 3 this confirms the validity of our analysis and indicates the possibility of a minor error in the measured soil moisture content readings for the mentioned irrigation events which may be attributed to issues with the weighing balance oven as well as the time taken to transport the soil samples from the field to the laboratory the comparative analysis of simulated and measured soil moisture contents shows acceptable fitness both for field a and field b with the r2 of 0 92 and 0 82 respectively fig 4 this indicates the accuracy of the calibrated model for representing the field conditions and reliability for simulating the irrigation optimization scenarios the cumulative simulated and measured eta for field a was 385 mm and 361 mm respectively while for field b these values were 348 mm and 313 mm respectively fig 5 the rmse for the simulated eta of fields a and field b were 11 6 and 11 8 respectively it therefore testifies the calibration accuracy of the aquacrop model for scenarios analyses akhtar 2017 analyzed eta from 2003 to 2013 for the kabul river basin kbr using surface energy balance system sebs the results of akhtar 2017 shows a mean eta of 215 68 mm during 2003 2013 for the wheat growth period in nangarhar province which includes the attawor irrigation scheme ais too the simulated mean eta for the research fields 385 mm for field a and 348 mm for field b for winter wheat is in the range of the analysis conducted by akhter 2017 in the lower reaches of the krb 3 3 irrigation optimization scenarios 3 3 1 scenarios a conventional irrigation system or business as usual in the conventional irrigation system the farmer used his own irrigation schedule which is largely based on his physical observations and water availability in this scenario the farmers applied an average of 81 mm of net irrigation during each irrigation event upon introducing the farmer s schedule into the aquacrop model as stated above in the calibration section the conservative parameters were adjusted accordingly to let the simulated yield and biomass match the observed yield and biomass as a result the simulated yield and biomass for field a was 6 6 ton ha 1 and 18 8 ton ha 1 respectively while the observed yield and biomass was 6 3 ton ha 1 and 18 5 ton ha 1 respectively similarly for the field b the simulated yield and biomass was 6 3 ton ha 1 and 17 9 ton ha 1 respectively while the observed yield and biomass were 6 1 ton ha 1 and 18 ton ha 1 respectively for this very scenario water use efficiency wue was 0 58 kg m 3 and 0 66 kg m 3 for field a and field b respectively 3 3 2 scenarios b irrigation to field capacity level optimum schedule the simulations indicate that 422 mm of net water is required by the crop to meet its et demand for the entire growing season while without subjecting the crop to any type of water stress the crop production response to this irrigation scheduling shows considerable increase in the above ground biomass i e 21 8 ton ha1 and dry yield i e 8 7 ton ha 1 the crop doesn t face any water stress and grows with its full canopy development and the water productivity wp is estimated as 2 5 kg m 3 eta a total of 11 irrigation events are proposed with a minimum interval of 10 days depending upon the initial conditions of soil this shows that the farmers typical behavior in terms of irrigation amount is that use as much as you grab on one side and then leaves it dry enough to starve and get closer to the wilting point which has negative impact on both yield and biomass 3 3 3 scenario c irrigation optimization upon 100 water depletion in this case the model is set to apply 40 mm of water at a depletion of 60 of the total available water while using this strategy the crop is subjected to water stress at different levels usually the crop water demand increases at the crop development stage compared to a little earlier due to the fact of increasing the evapotranspiration and other physiological processes that are active at this very stage eventually a small reduction in canopy cover during crop development and flowering stage is observed results indicate that the net irrigation water consumption is reduced to 230 mm while irrigation events also reduced and a total of 5 irrigation events are required for the entire growing season from the production point of view the above biomass production and dry yield reduced to 19 ton ha 1 and 7 4 ton ha 1 respectively under water stressed conditions but the beneficial use of water decreased and the overall wp increased up to 2 74 kg m 3 eta 3 3 4 scenario d irrigation optimization upon 130 depletion the simulation of this scenario and the correlation of cc and tr curve it is obvious that the crop doesn t face severe stress during the initial and crop development stage but it is only subjected to stress during the ripening stage by increasing the stress level to 130 of the available water and by slightly increasing the application of water in each irrigation event the production response to water is different from the previous scheduling options the wp rises up to 2 78 kg3 eta in this kind of irrigation scheduling while the above ground biomass and dry yield slightly reduced to 18 3 ton ha 1 and 6 7 ton ha 1 respectively this is due to the fact that at the ripening stage the yield formation is almost ready while additional irrigation application contributes to the biomass mainly which has been affected results showed that the net irrigation requirements decreased to 200 mm while a total of 4 irrigation events were proposed to be applied throughout the crop growth period the frequency and quantity of irrigation events are presented in table 5 3 4 assessment of irrigation optimization scenarios and future potential implications the wp and yield response of different irrigation optimization options is presented in fig 6 it is clear from the figure that irrigating the crop to field capacity level and keeping the crop in unstressed condition gives the maximum yield per unit hectare of land while from the wp perspective 130 depletion scheduling has the higher wp value the reason behind is the maximum utilization of the irrigation water applied at a stage where the crop is extremely stressed similarly the wp and the net irrigation requirements of different irrigation optimization scenarios show that the conventional irrigation system have the least wp but the over irrigation application results into considerable non beneficial water use relation between eta and wp is shown in fig 7 the crop is not subjected to water stress in field capacity level scheduling hence there is maximum eta while the eta is controlled by subjecting the crop to a particular level of water stress in deficit irrigation optimization options the denominator in wp is eta reduction in eta has a considerable impact on improvements in wp the wp of deficit irrigation schedules optimization scenarios is thereby higher than that of conventional irrigation schedules the above figures were analyzed to get the potential yield and the prospects for potential area expansion for irrigation under different irrigation optimization scenarios irrigation water requirement 4220 m3 at field capacity irrigation scheduling is considered the benchmark for the analysis the results of the analysis are shown in table 6 from the above analysis it is clear that 4220 m3 net water is required to irrigate one hectare of land at unstressed condition irrigation optimization option 1 irrigation to field capacity which will give a dry yield about 8 7 ton ha 1 if the same quantity of water is applied on conventional irrigation method ci being practiced by the farmers the irrigated area could be reduced as there would be more application losses but the irrigated area could be expanded by 0 83 ha and 1 11 ha if the same quantity of water is applied by adopting deficit irrigation strategy a and b respectively and ultimately the dry yield could also be increased furthermore the analysis shown in table 7 shows that with the current application efficiency the farmers cultivate 200 ha of land by applying 2 001 840 m3 of gross irrigation water at an application efficiency of 46 while adapting unstressed condition s a and by improving the application efficiency to 100 the irrigated area can be expanded up to about 474 ha the remaining 60 ha of uncultivated land in ais could be brought under irrigation while the excess water could be reallocated to other purposes 4 conclusion based on the analysis and the approach used in this study it is concluded that there is no such physical water scarcity specifically in attawor irrigation scheme ais provided the same streamflow is available as a result of the precipitation in the form of snowfall at the upstream peaks of the kabul river basin kbr the water scarcity is subjected to the existing inefficiencies in the irrigation system and the lack of farmer s knowledge about the efficient and optimal use of the available water for irrigation the farmers over irrigate their fields irrespective of the crop water needs and irrigation water amount is supply based rather than demand based it can also be concluded from the lower water use efficiency wue and water productivity wp values of the conventional irrigation that less water is beneficially being used in conventional irrigation system and there is great potential for improving the wue as well as the wp incase relevant institutions intervene and farmers are provided with necessary trainings supplemented with incentives aimed at infrastructure development and ensured water supply through decentralized storage systems the available water has a potential to expand the irrigated area without subjecting the crop to water stress and perhaps there is no need to go for deficit irrigation strategies under the current status the farmers irrigating behavior could be improved through innovative adjustments to the irrigation schedule irrigation roster the farmers would get better results in terms of yield increment and irrigated land expansion and the required irrigation events will reduce if the timing of irrigation application is changed slightly and to bring it to demand based application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

different models which are being used for simulation of crop water productivity wp under deficit irrigation but most of them require extensive data sets for carrying out targeted simulations and sometimes they are not user friendly or perhaps are region and crop specific but in the current study we used aquacrop model due to the fact that it has shown better performance than cropsyst under both optimal and non optimal water conditions akhtar et al 2013 abi saab et al 2015 moreover it considers the fundamental processes involved in crop productivity and in its response to water deficit scenarios both in terms of physiological and agronomic background perspectives aquacrop may be successful in getting a good balance in simplicity robustness accuracy and ease of use steduto et al 2009 greaves and wang 2016 used aquacrop model for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed irrigation management strategies they used this model for the analysis of the performance of aquacrop for maize under full and deficit irrigation under tropical environment and meanwhile tested and validated the effectiveness of the calibrated model for simulating biomass and grain yield under diversified environmental conditions an overall r2 value of 0 85 and 0 92 obtained under the study of greaves and wang 2016 for biomass and yield respectively shows the suitability of aquacrop model for simulating crop wp under different climate conditions in the current study fao s aquacrop model was calibrated and validated with field data for wheat crop and therefore simulated different water scarcity scenarios to evaluate and analyze the resultant yield wp and biomass production these scenarios are namely s a s b s c and s d the s a deals with optimizing wheat wp under business as usual scenario and s b is about refilling the soil profile to field capacity upon 50 water depletion and s c is about refilling the soil profile upon 100 depletion while scenario s d is about refilling the soil profile upon 130 depletion occurrence two wheat fields namely a and b were considered for intensive monitoring for soil moisture content meteorological situation irrigation application crop phenological information and post harvest data i e biomass and yield this study highlights the potential for irrigation expansion by adapting irrigation optimization options in the study area this study also provides a detailed analysis of the yield and biomass response under different irrigation optimizations options simulated by using the aquacrop model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area attawor irrigation scheme ais with geographic coordinates 34 581 n and 70 606 e lies in nangarhar province at the downstream of the kabul river basin krb and constitute the north western upstream of the indus basin fig 1 the krb consists of around 450 000 ha of irrigated area habib 2014 and hosts around 1 3rd of the country s total population akhtar 2017 the krb provides water for agricultural industrial as well as municipal needs of its inhabitants and contribute to the environmental flow and recharge the groundwater aquifer too being called the agricultural basket of afghanistan nangarhar province cultivates wheat barley maize and rice as the major crops followed by large scale vegetable production that are being consumed inside afghanistan and is partly exported to pakistan world bank 2019 ais takes its supply from kunar river and has a command area of 260 ha out of which 200 ha is cultivated and the remaining 60 ha remains uncultivated ofwmp 2012 wheat has been the major crop cultivated under irrigated conditions at the ais during the study period the study area is characterized by hot summers and mild winters the mean annual rainfall in the study area is in the range of 150 mm mail usgs 2011 which is not enough for crop production and therefore supplementary irrigation is required to meet the crop water demand data from the metrological station shows that the peak temperature during the crop growth period was 37 c and the minimum recorded temperature during this period was 4 c in winter time fig 2 for assessing the conventional irrigation practices and to calibrate and validate the model two experimental fields field a 3598 m2 and field b 4133 m2 were selected at the head and tail reaches of the canal command area respectively 2 2 field data collection soil samples from both fields were collected from three locations at a depth of 0 20 cm 20 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm through an augur the soil samples were collected from the same locations throughout the study period the soil texture analysis was done with lamotte apparatus lamotte 2017 after the determination of soil particle composition through lamotte apparatus the soil was oven dried for 24 h at 104 c the organic matter was determined by the procedure given by reddy 2015 usda soil texture calculator was used to find out the soil types at different layers in both the experimental fields with the same usda soil water characteristic model permanent wilting point pwp hydraulic conductivity of soil field capacity and soil saturation sat were also determined the soil moisture samples were taken from the same sampling points which had already been used for soil texture analysis gravimetric method boone and wengert 1998 was used to determine the soil moisture content before and after each irrigation event cut throat flumes were installed on both fields to measure the amount of irrigation water applied to the fields these flumes were provided and calibrated by the on farm water management project ofwmp in the krb area inlet and outlet readings were recorded on flume with an interval of 1 5 min depending on when the flume readings become constant crop cultivar information and post harvest data was also collected the widely cultivated cultivar of wheat in the study area is baghlan 09 the cultivar information for baghlan 09 was obtained from the local provincial agriculture irrigation and livestock directorate dail for acquiring measured biomass and yield three representative sample points of size 1 m2 were randomly identified each in the head middle and tail end of both fields the harvested crop from each sample field were tied in separate bundles and kept in a safe place for three days as a local practice to dry once the samples were dried the weight of biomass and grains were recorded through a digital balance the soil samples were collected from different depths and soil texture was analyzed tables 1 and 2 2 3 aquacrop model parameterization calibration and validation the aquacrop model was parameterized for the conventional irrigation system with the available climatic data for the period of 2016 2017 different crop growth stages and their relevant phenological information is crucial input for the model calibration the crop parameters are divided into two main categories the first category is called the conservative parameters which are not cultivar specific and are applicable to a wide range while the second category of parameters are called non conservative the conservative parameters table 3 were taken from fao raes et al 2009 and adopted by andarzian bannayan et al 2011 the non conservative parameters as given in table 4 for baghlan 09 wheat variety were acquired through field observations as well as from the cultivar catalogue the farmers used the broadcast method while sowing the experimental fields at a seed sowing rate of 200 kg ha 1 for the calibration of the aquacrop model the yield and biomass data from the fields were used while for validation purpose the measured actual evapotranspiration eta and soil moisture data were used the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the correlativity of the simulated and observed values of yield and biomass as well as eta soil moisture for calibration and validation respectively the simulation models are based on complex iterative equations and techniques with possible uncertainties in order to mitigate these uncertainties there is a need to calibrate and validate the simulated results against field observations for this purpose the r2 eq 1 and root mean square error rmse eq 2 were used to evaluate the performance of the aquacrop model s simulated results the r2 and rmse were calculated as below 1 r 2 1 y i y i 2 y i y 2 where yi y i 2 is the sum squared regression which is a result of the sum of the residuals squared and yi y 2 is the total sum of squares yi is the actual y value y i is the predicted y value and y is the mean y value 2 r m s e i 1 n x o b s i x m o del 1 n where xobs is observed values and xmodel is modelled values at time place i 2 4 simulation of different scenarios with aquacrop model the scenarios adapted in this study were namely s a s b s c and s d the scenario s a deals with optimizing wheat wp under business as usual scenario and scenarios s b is about refilling the soil profile to field capacity upon 50 water depletion of the total available water taw the scenario s c is about refilling the soil profile upon 100 depletion under this scenario the crop was subjected to no stress at the initial crop stage from germination to 50 canopy cover while upon 60 depletion of the taw it was set to apply 40 mm water upon achieving 50 canopy cover and onwards the model was set to subject the crop to water stress and apply 50 mm water when the soil water moisture depletes to 100 of the total available water and apply no water once the crop senescence stage starts similarly the scenario s d is about refilling the soil profile upon 130 depletion occurrence in this scenario the model was set to generate irrigation schedule with the following specification apply 50 mm net irrigation when 60 depletion of the taw occurs during the initial stage from sowing to the 50 canopy cover and to apply 50 mm net irrigation when 130 depletion of the taw occurs when reached at the 50 canopy cover and onwards and then stop irrigation application once the senescence starts 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the aquacrop model the calibration results show that the simulated yield and biomass for field a could be 6 6 ton ha 1 and 18 8 ton ha 1 respectively while for the same experimental field the observed yield and biomass was 6 3 ton ha 1 and 18 5 ton ha 1 which is a perfect match under the local conditions similarly for the field b the simulated yield and biomass could be 6 3 ton ha 1 and 17 9 ton ha 1 respectively while the observed yield and biomass were 6 1 ton ha 1 and 18 ton ha 1 respectively the precision in yield and biomass simulation of wheat through aquacrop model can be confirmed from other studies too singh saha et al 2013 kumar sarangi et al 2014 3 2 validation of the aquacrop model by correlating the observed and simulated actual evapotranspiration eta the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 90 and 0 86 for field a and field b respectively fig 3 this confirms the validity of our analysis and indicates the possibility of a minor error in the measured soil moisture content readings for the mentioned irrigation events which may be attributed to issues with the weighing balance oven as well as the time taken to transport the soil samples from the field to the laboratory the comparative analysis of simulated and measured soil moisture contents shows acceptable fitness both for field a and field b with the r2 of 0 92 and 0 82 respectively fig 4 this indicates the accuracy of the calibrated model for representing the field conditions and reliability for simulating the irrigation optimization scenarios the cumulative simulated and measured eta for field a was 385 mm and 361 mm respectively while for field b these values were 348 mm and 313 mm respectively fig 5 the rmse for the simulated eta of fields a and field b were 11 6 and 11 8 respectively it therefore testifies the calibration accuracy of the aquacrop model for scenarios analyses akhtar 2017 analyzed eta from 2003 to 2013 for the kabul river basin kbr using surface energy balance system sebs the results of akhtar 2017 shows a mean eta of 215 68 mm during 2003 2013 for the wheat growth period in nangarhar province which includes the attawor irrigation scheme ais too the simulated mean eta for the research fields 385 mm for field a and 348 mm for field b for winter wheat is in the range of the analysis conducted by akhter 2017 in the lower reaches of the krb 3 3 irrigation optimization scenarios 3 3 1 scenarios a conventional irrigation system or business as usual in the conventional irrigation system the farmer used his own irrigation schedule which is largely based on his physical observations and water availability in this scenario the farmers applied an average of 81 mm of net irrigation during each irrigation event upon introducing the farmer s schedule into the aquacrop model as stated above in the calibration section the conservative parameters were adjusted accordingly to let the simulated yield and biomass match the observed yield and biomass as a result the simulated yield and biomass for field a was 6 6 ton ha 1 and 18 8 ton ha 1 respectively while the observed yield and biomass was 6 3 ton ha 1 and 18 5 ton ha 1 respectively similarly for the field b the simulated yield and biomass was 6 3 ton ha 1 and 17 9 ton ha 1 respectively while the observed yield and biomass were 6 1 ton ha 1 and 18 ton ha 1 respectively for this very scenario water use efficiency wue was 0 58 kg m 3 and 0 66 kg m 3 for field a and field b respectively 3 3 2 scenarios b irrigation to field capacity level optimum schedule the simulations indicate that 422 mm of net water is required by the crop to meet its et demand for the entire growing season while without subjecting the crop to any type of water stress the crop production response to this irrigation scheduling shows considerable increase in the above ground biomass i e 21 8 ton ha1 and dry yield i e 8 7 ton ha 1 the crop doesn t face any water stress and grows with its full canopy development and the water productivity wp is estimated as 2 5 kg m 3 eta a total of 11 irrigation events are proposed with a minimum interval of 10 days depending upon the initial conditions of soil this shows that the farmers typical behavior in terms of irrigation amount is that use as much as you grab on one side and then leaves it dry enough to starve and get closer to the wilting point which has negative impact on both yield and biomass 3 3 3 scenario c irrigation optimization upon 100 water depletion in this case the model is set to apply 40 mm of water at a depletion of 60 of the total available water while using this strategy the crop is subjected to water stress at different levels usually the crop water demand increases at the crop development stage compared to a little earlier due to the fact of increasing the evapotranspiration and other physiological processes that are active at this very stage eventually a small reduction in canopy cover during crop development and flowering stage is observed results indicate that the net irrigation water consumption is reduced to 230 mm while irrigation events also reduced and a total of 5 irrigation events are required for the entire growing season from the production point of view the above biomass production and dry yield reduced to 19 ton ha 1 and 7 4 ton ha 1 respectively under water stressed conditions but the beneficial use of water decreased and the overall wp increased up to 2 74 kg m 3 eta 3 3 4 scenario d irrigation optimization upon 130 depletion the simulation of this scenario and the correlation of cc and tr curve it is obvious that the crop doesn t face severe stress during the initial and crop development stage but it is only subjected to stress during the ripening stage by increasing the stress level to 130 of the available water and by slightly increasing the application of water in each irrigation event the production response to water is different from the previous scheduling options the wp rises up to 2 78 kg3 eta in this kind of irrigation scheduling while the above ground biomass and dry yield slightly reduced to 18 3 ton ha 1 and 6 7 ton ha 1 respectively this is due to the fact that at the ripening stage the yield formation is almost ready while additional irrigation application contributes to the biomass mainly which has been affected results showed that the net irrigation requirements decreased to 200 mm while a total of 4 irrigation events were proposed to be applied throughout the crop growth period the frequency and quantity of irrigation events are presented in table 5 3 4 assessment of irrigation optimization scenarios and future potential implications the wp and yield response of different irrigation optimization options is presented in fig 6 it is clear from the figure that irrigating the crop to field capacity level and keeping the crop in unstressed condition gives the maximum yield per unit hectare of land while from the wp perspective 130 depletion scheduling has the higher wp value the reason behind is the maximum utilization of the irrigation water applied at a stage where the crop is extremely stressed similarly the wp and the net irrigation requirements of different irrigation optimization scenarios show that the conventional irrigation system have the least wp but the over irrigation application results into considerable non beneficial water use relation between eta and wp is shown in fig 7 the crop is not subjected to water stress in field capacity level scheduling hence there is maximum eta while the eta is controlled by subjecting the crop to a particular level of water stress in deficit irrigation optimization options the denominator in wp is eta reduction in eta has a considerable impact on improvements in wp the wp of deficit irrigation schedules optimization scenarios is thereby higher than that of conventional irrigation schedules the above figures were analyzed to get the potential yield and the prospects for potential area expansion for irrigation under different irrigation optimization scenarios irrigation water requirement 4220 m3 at field capacity irrigation scheduling is considered the benchmark for the analysis the results of the analysis are shown in table 6 from the above analysis it is clear that 4220 m3 net water is required to irrigate one hectare of land at unstressed condition irrigation optimization option 1 irrigation to field capacity which will give a dry yield about 8 7 ton ha 1 if the same quantity of water is applied on conventional irrigation method ci being practiced by the farmers the irrigated area could be reduced as there would be more application losses but the irrigated area could be expanded by 0 83 ha and 1 11 ha if the same quantity of water is applied by adopting deficit irrigation strategy a and b respectively and ultimately the dry yield could also be increased furthermore the analysis shown in table 7 shows that with the current application efficiency the farmers cultivate 200 ha of land by applying 2 001 840 m3 of gross irrigation water at an application efficiency of 46 while adapting unstressed condition s a and by improving the application efficiency to 100 the irrigated area can be expanded up to about 474 ha the remaining 60 ha of uncultivated land in ais could be brought under irrigation while the excess water could be reallocated to other purposes 4 conclusion based on the analysis and the approach used in this study it is concluded that there is no such physical water scarcity specifically in attawor irrigation scheme ais provided the same streamflow is available as a result of the precipitation in the form of snowfall at the upstream peaks of the kabul river basin kbr the water scarcity is subjected to the existing inefficiencies in the irrigation system and the lack of farmer s knowledge about the efficient and optimal use of the available water for irrigation the farmers over irrigate their fields irrespective of the crop water needs and irrigation water amount is supply based rather than demand based it can also be concluded from the lower water use efficiency wue and water productivity wp values of the conventional irrigation that less water is beneficially being used in conventional irrigation system and there is great potential for improving the wue as well as the wp incase relevant institutions intervene and farmers are provided with necessary trainings supplemented with incentives aimed at infrastructure development and ensured water supply through decentralized storage systems the available water has a potential to expand the irrigated area without subjecting the crop to water stress and perhaps there is no need to go for deficit irrigation strategies under the current status the farmers irrigating behavior could be improved through innovative adjustments to the irrigation schedule irrigation roster the farmers would get better results in terms of yield increment and irrigated land expansion and the required irrigation events will reduce if the timing of irrigation application is changed slightly and to bring it to demand based application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10534,n fertilization is often viewed as a cheap insurance against yield loss in vegetable production because of the generally large added value resulting in application of fertilizer n often in excess of actual crop demand in combination with the low fertilizer n recovery by many vegetable crops and the often excessive irrigation this may lead to both health and environmental risks related to high nitrate concentrations in water leaving the root zone in this review we discuss the decisive factors in the overall n balance of field vegetable production systems and the different tools at hand to increase fertilizer use efficiency and consequently reduce n losses to the environment based on this we identify areas of research and technology transfer where further work is required only an integration of the different methods and strategies for n management may really mitigate the risk of nitrate leaching and maintain crop yields while enhancing the environmental sustainability of vegetable production systems keywords n balance cover crops cropping systems fertilizers n fertilization efficiency n leaching 1 introduction many vegetable crop species have a relatively low nutrient use efficiency compared to arable crops often related to the short growing season and superficial rooting greenwood et al 1989 thompson et al 2020 because of the generally large added value of the vegetable production sector compared to e g arable crops or grassland fertilization especially n fertilization is often viewed as a cheap insurance against yield loss resulting in application of fertilizer n often in excess of actual crop demand thompson et al 2007 the combination of n application in excess of crop demand the low n fertilizer recovery by vegetable crops and the often excessive irrigation thompson et al 2007 thorup kristensen et al 2012 may lead to both health risks i e nitrate accumulation in leafy vegetables colla et al 2018 and environmental risks associated with high nitrate concentrations in water leaving the root zone agostini et al 2010 cameira and mota 2017 thompson et al 2020 despite the relatively small share in total land area and production the vegetable sector represents a disproportionately large economic share in europe eurostat 2019 fresh vegetables production in the eu represented a value of 34 5 billions of euro in 2017 or 8 3 of the value of all the agricultural goods and services produced in the eu in 2016 there were about 823 000 farms in the eu 28 cultivating fresh vegetables representing just 8 0 of the total number of farms and 2 2 million hectares of agricultural land eurostat 2019 in 2014 15 vegetables represented 7 4 of total fertilizer consumption of 103 mt n at global level heffer et al 2017 in the eu 28 n fertilizers in vegetables represented 2 3 of the total consumption of about 11 mt n while vegetable production is only representing 1 2 of the area in europe the protection of natural waters from diffuse pollution by nutrients n and p is regulated by the nitrate directive council of the european communities 1991 and the water framework directive european commission 2000 and the main source of this pollution is agriculture given the intensive nature of most of the vegetable production in europe this sector is contributing much to the problem of nitrate pollution of natural waters in several regions in europe the very existence of intensive vegetable production will depend on its willingness and ability to drastically cut n losses to the environment by implementing a more efficient n management quemada et al 2013 consequently research has been focusing increasingly on improving n management in vegetable cropping systems to significantly reduce the environmental and health impacts tei et al 2017 padilla et al 2018 kristensen and stavridou 2017 in addition high nitrate concentrations in soil are associated with the emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o snyder et al 2009 the aim of this review is to discuss the different factors that are decisive in the overall n balance of field vegetable production systems and the different tools at hand to increase fertilizer use efficiency and consequently reduce n losses to the environment with focus on losses to surface and groundwater and to identify areas of research and technology transfer where further work is required 2 drawing up the n balance for vegetable production systems an in depth insight into all processes that govern the n cycling in soil is needed to optimize fertilization and maximize n use efficiency whilst minimizing losses therefore we start by discussing the detailed n balance in the soil crop atmosphere continuum congreves and van eerd 2015 thompson et al 2017 which forms the basis for the so called balance sheet systems of n fertilization the n balance takes into account all possible inputs soil mineral n available at planting n mineralized from soil organic matter n mineralized from organic materials mineral fertilizer n n from irrigation and atmospheric deposition and all possible outputs crop n uptake n losses by denitrification volatilization and leaching and n immobilization in the soil the individual components of the balance are often difficult to quantify because of the highly dynamic nature of n transformations and the many interactions generalizations and simplifications will always have to be made for practical use 2 1 soil mineral n at planting the sum of nh4 n and no3 n at or shortly before planting is a key variable for efficient n fertilizer management it depends mainly on the previous crop and its management e g applied n fertilizer rate irrigation and harvest time the weather conditions mainly rainfall and planting time commonly higher soil mineral n in autumn than in spring due to fall winter leaching by rainfall e g nendel 2009 n use efficiency can be improved drastically by including soil mineral n at planting in the calculation of n fertilization thompson et al 2017 2018 de pascale et al 2018 2 2 n mineralization from soil organic matter and n immobilization the processes of n mineralization and immobilization occur simultaneously in soil at all times mineralization immobilization turnover mit norton and schimel 2012 the result of these two processes is termed net n mineralization greatly influenced by soil temperature moisture content and compaction de neve 2017 soil organic matter som mineralization is the predominant source of n for the crop especially in low input production systems nendel et al 2019 and crucially needs to be accounted for in n fertilizer calculations however n mineralization from som is difficult to measure in situ because the mineralized n is rapidly consumed in other processes or transported through the soil profile a few attempts have been made to measure n mineralization using micro lysimeters nendel et al 2005 or using buried soil cores in field incubations delphin 2000 alternatively in situ n mineralization can be derived from measuring all components of the n balance in a field however because of the large spatial and temporal variability of soil n processes and the difficulty in measuring loss processes this approach is not applicable in practice most often n mineralization is measured in controlled conditions in the laboratory and there have been many attempts to predict n mineralization in controlled conditions by simple or more complex relationships with soil properties e g som c n som content ph texture and environmental factors temperature moisture content bulk density general soil structural quality de neve 2017 nendel et al 2019 nendel et al 2019 analyzed 340 data sets extracted from previously published incubation experiments for potential nitrogen mineralization covering a large range of soils and climate conditions they found that under warm and year round humid conditions the potentially mineralizable n as fraction of the soil total n was significantly smaller than in dry or temperate environments the n mineralization potential that is the maximum amount of n being released from soil under optimum conditions for mineralization by the microbial biomass optimum temperature soil water content nutrient and oxygen supply in temperate climates was estimated to be 151 kg n ha 1 as climate zone median as a coarse first estimate n mineralization under temperate maritime climates can be very roughly estimated to be 2 3 of the soil organic n with the lower limit for heavy soils and the upper limit for sandy soils de neve 2017 lorenz et al 1989 suggested a value of 5 5 kg n ha 1 week 1 of n mineralization from soil organic matter for the rhineland palatinate region in germany in general n mineralization from soil organic matter is higher in vegetable cropped soils than in arable soils because of the intensive nature of vegetable production with large historical applications of mineral and organic fertilizers and the small harvest index with large amounts of crop residues being returned to the soil 2 3 n mineralization from added organic materials incorporation of vegetable crop residues in particular represents a highly important but often neglected source of mineral n the amount of crop residue can vary from 25 30 kg n ha 1 e g spinach lettuce to as much as 250 300 kg n ha 1 e g for cabbages chaves et al 2007 agneessens et al 2014 congreves and van eerd 2015 de neve 2017 tempesta et al 2019 de neve and hofman 1996 found that 60 80 of the n in vegetable crop residues is mineralized within the 3 weeks following incorporation in summer or early autumn in a study conducted in western europe under exceptionally good conditions i e a warm moist and very well aerated soil over 80 of the mineral nitrogen present in crop residues was released as early as 9 weeks after incorporation tremblay et al 2001 failure to properly account for the n contained in crop residues obviously may lead to excessive n fertilization and n losses other added organic materials include cover crops animal manures slurries and farmyard manure composts by products from the agricultural industries e g animal by products such as blood meal hair meal and bone meal digestates from manure processing and from bio energy production municipal solid wastes sewage sludge amongst others for some of the more common of these materials green manures animal slurries n release is relatively well known but others are poorly characterized with respect to both the amount and the timing of n release de neve 2017 sambo and nicoletto 2017 benincasa et al 2017 an important aspect of the management of organic materials is the synchronization of n mineralization with crop n demand to avoid yield loss and or minimize the risk of n losses fig 1 for instance lack of synchrony may occur in early spring in temperate humid climates when crop n demand can already by high while n mineralization is still limited because of relatively low soil temperatures in autumn n mineralization of crop residues rich in n may still proceed at high rates due to high soil temperatures at a time when the soil is bare or the crop n demand is low the lack of synchronization in spring can easily be remediated by additional fertilization but excessive n mineralization in autumn is much more difficult to manage and is one of the chief causes for high n losses 2 4 n supply from irrigation irrigation water may contain a significant amount of n particularly in regions with high nitrate levels in groundwater reliable estimates of these n inputs can be obtained by frequent analysis of the irrigation water and by keeping good records of irrigation volumes for example a typical seasonal irrigation volume for sweet pepper of about 3000 m3 ha 1 with a nitrate concentration of 50 mg l 1 corresponds to a total n input from irrigation of 34 kg n ha 1 2 5 n from atmospheric deposition both wet precipitation and dry dust deposition mainly associated with ammonia nh3 emissions related to intensive livestock production and nox emissions from industry and traffic may contribute significantly to the overall n input for agricultural crops nitrogen may be transported over long distances before being deposited and thus may have a transboundary component vet et al 2014 found wet deposition of n in europe to range from 1 to 25 kg n ha 1 yr 1 while n deposition drastically declined over the past decades as a result of measures to combat air pollution in some regions of intensive livestock production northern part of belgium parts of the netherlands and denmark emissions and deposition may still be significant and may represent between 10 and 20 of the total n requirement of the vegetable crop 2 6 mineral fertilizer n in the balance sheet system of n fertilizer advice the amount of fertilizer to be applied is calculated as the difference between outputs and inputs rate timing type and application method of mineral fertilizer represent critical issues to optimize crop production and minimize environmental losses snyder 2017 see section 3 3 moreover not only yield but also produce quality should be considered in calculating optimal n fertilizer rates in vegetables burns 2006 while reduced n availability may negatively affect biomass yield and fruit size it has been reported to increase the concentration of free radical scavengers with anti oxidant capacity stefanelli et al 2010 excessive n fertilization was reported to reduce quality parameters e g fruit size vitamin c concentration sugar content in different vegetable crops albornoz 2016 and to increase the concentration of harmful compounds such as nitrates in leafy vegetables colla et al 2018 given the decisive impact of produce quality on price n management should also be analyzed from an accurate economic analysis of marketable products in addition to the biomass yield or environmental perspective burns 2006 2 7 crop n uptake at optimal n status mineral n uptake is the product of the total biomass and the critical n concentration i e the minimum n concentration required for maximum plant growth greenwood et al 1990 total biomass is in turn highly correlated with crop yield some authors greenwood et al 1990 lemaire and gastal 1997 lemaire et al 2008 determined the relationship between the critical n concentration and the above ground plant dry weight the relationship is highly different between c3 and c4 plants reflecting the different metabolic pathway but is relatively constant within the same metabolic group still species specific critical n dilution curves have been determined for example for potato greenwood et al 1990 1996 processing tomato tei et al 2002 lettuce tei et al 2003 di gioia et al 2017 conversa and elia 2019 cabbage ekbladh and witter 2010 broccoli and cauliflower riley and vågen 2003 conversa et al 2019 carrot shlevin et al 2018 from the critical n dilution curve the relationship can be obtained between crop biomass and crop n uptake at optimal n nutritional status this allows to quantify the potential n crop demand to be used in the n balance crop n demands are often summarized and averaged in look up tables based on past agronomic experiments for use in practice by farmers and technicians despite the high n demand of most vegetable crops feller and fink 2002 congreves and van eerd 2015 they can only take up a fraction of the soil mineral n i e the nitrogen uptake efficiency nupe is less than 1 or less than 100 greenwood et al 1989 defined the apparent recovery rec of fertilizer n by the crop as rec uf u0 nf where nf fertilizer n rate uf n uptake when nf is applied u0 n uptake when no fertilizer is applied i e an estimate of the uptake of mineral n already present into the soil before planting and mineralized during crop growth the same authors showed that in vegetables the relationship between n fertilization rates and n uptake decreased linearly according to the following general equation rec rec0 b nf where rec0 is the fitted value of rec with an infinitesimally small amount of fertilizer n and b is the gradient of rec against nf fig 2 consequently knowledge of the rec value for a species provides an estimate of the proportion of n fertilizer not taken up by the crop at a given n rate this approach is useful to achieve a compromise between yield and environmental issues burns 2006 these relationships are species specific because they depend on differences in root function and architecture e g tei et al 1999 they are also influenced by soil conditions e g water shortage reduces growth and n uptake weather conditions agronomic practices e g irrigation and fertilizer application methods e g broadcast or localized application tremblay et al 2001 benincasa et al 2011 given the difficulty of obtaining the rec from specific field experiments a safety margin practical approach has been proposed by some authors e g tremblay et al 2001 defined as an additional amount of mineral n to be present as a kind of n buffer to allow for maximum n uptake at all times

with a better developed root system e g cabbage brussels sprouts carrots tremblay et al 2001 the kns system is one example of a n fertilizer advice system mainly for vegetable crops that uses such a n buffer in the calculation of the n fertilizer requirements see section 3 1 1 2 8 n losses nitrogen loss processes including denitrification volatilization and leaching will lead to reduced n availability given the often high n fertilization rates and the high concentrations of soil mineral n the risk of these n losses and the extent to which they occur is particularly high in n intensive horticultural systems cameira and mota 2017 2 8 1 denitrification and volatilization losses denitrification i e conversion of nitrate no3 to molecular nitrogen n2 with possible formation of nitrous oxide n2o and nitric oxide no occurs within the soil wherever there is sufficient nitrate labile organic carbon and low oxygen concentrations and oxygen diffusion rates these losses are low in most dryland cropping soils but may be significant in slowly draining and waterlogged soils myrold and bottomley 2008 hence normally n losses by denitrification are small in vegetable fields however they can be appreciable in specific circumstances e g when large amounts of vegetable crop residues are incorporated and this is followed by heavy rain ammonia volatilization occurs when ammonium from ammonium containing or urea containing fertilizers or from organic fertilizers e g cattle manure castor bean cake legume fertilizers is converted to ammonia the risk of such losses is low when these fertilizers are incorporated immediately or injected but can be very high when they are surface applied engel et al 2011 ramanantenasoa et al 2019 the potential risk of ammonia volatilization from urea fertilizer can represent up to 65 of the n applied depending on soil and climatic conditions sutton and grinsven 2011 ammonia volatilization can also occur during mineralization of vegetable crop residues de ruijter et al 2010a found that about 5 16 of the n in vegetable crop residues could be lost as nh3 2 8 2 nitrate leaching vegetable crops are often grown on coarse textured soils that have low water holding capacity and a high hydraulic conductivity so excess nitrate not taken up by the crop has high probability to be leached out below the root zone in case of excess precipitation or not well managed irrigation the risk of leaching depends on i the soil nitrate concentration at a given time that depends in turn on the history of n management in the specific field ii the intensity and frequency of water inputs i e rainfall or irrigation iii the soil hydraulic characteristics nitrate leaching losses and the associated potential risk of groundwater contamination from intensive vegetable production has been studied extensively in a wide variety of pedo climatic conditions and cropping systems e g thompson et al 2007 xie et al 2017 farneselli et al 2018 tosti et al 2019 rakotovololona et al 2019 de haan et al 2019 hefner et al 2019 2 9 final considerations on the n balance as illustrated in this section the n balance takes into account all possible inputs and outputs of n to and from the field and is therefore a potentially very accurate basis for calculation of n fertilization that should allow to minimize n losses notably by leaching however the efficiency of this approach critically depends on the quality of the available data e g crop n uptake expected mineralization and the experience of the persons drawing up the balance it should be pointed out that there are some minor variations in the way that the n balance is calculated by different daughters and recommendation schemes as discussed by thompson et al 2017 3 strategies for improved sustainability of n fertilization 3 1 tools to assist with crop n management often growers and advisors make decisions on the amount of n fertilizer to be applied based on experience or look up tables adapted to the local pedo climatic and cropping conditions for fine tuning of fertilizer recommendations look up tables can take into account some crucial characteristics of a specific field and its history e g soil texture previous crop crop residues management but generally lack precision advising on the safe side to minimize risks of yield reductions thus potentially leading to high n losses simple observational methods that introduce basic diagnostic tools such as plant color unfertilized windows indicator plants tremblay et al 2001 for monitoring soil and crop n status allow for a first refinement of n fertilization in data poor conditions in some countries legislation demands quite complex n fertilizer planning often guided by extension services for example in denmark the use of look up tables is combined with modelling of previous winter leaching at regional scale taking into account the soil type pre crop effect irrigation and crop n demand at field level for conventional production organic production is regulated by a general rule on maximal 100 kg used n ha 1 in average across the fields of a farm danish ministry of environment and food 2020 given the increasing pressure for improving environmental performance of agriculture in general and vegetable growing in particular e g with respect to the targets in the framework guidelines for water protection european commission 2000 more science based methods of n management have been developed in the past decades extensive reviews of such methods including application reliability and sensitivity have been published recently e g thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2018 de pascale et al 2018 3 1 1 fertilizer recommendation schemes based on soil analysis or soil n supply nmin kns and n expert systems are methods that use the soil mineral n content to calculate n fertilizer advices through a simplified n balance thompson et al 2017 2018 nmin system is the simplest method because it calculates the mineral n fertilizer rate for the entire crop cycle by subtracting the measured soil mineral n in the root zone at crop planting from a tabled n target value kns system refines the approach of the nmin system by including a tabled n buffer i e a safety margin to determine a n target value an estimate of the expected weekly n mineralization from som and a soil mineral n analysis during the crop growth period to calculate the n top dressing the n expert system is a further development of kns by introducing an apparent recovery of 80 of total n supply the estimated n recovery and the estimated mineralisation from soil organic matter are combined in a component called apparent n net mineralisation these methods are commonly used with field grown vegetable crops in north western and central europe soil n supply sns system is an index system used in england and wales in which the soil n supply is estimated rather than measured thompson et al 2017 ahdb 2020 the sns indices estimate available soil mineral n including estimates of n mineralised from organic material during the crop growth period sns indices are determined for a specific field by considering average annual rainfall soil texture and residues from the preceding crop and are used to recommend the n fertilizer rate these methods when used as part of improved management systems proved to notably reduce no3 leaching in vegetable cropping systems thompson et al 2017 2018 additionally the nitrate concentration of the soil solution in the root zone can be used to assist with n management of fertigated vegetable crops thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2020 this method developed in israel but used in spain too is based on analysis of soil solution extracted with ceramic suction samplers and on the use of sufficiency values or tendencies for data interpretation and n management peña fleitas et al 2015 padilla et al 2020 3 1 2 methods based on crop or plant analysis destructive leaf tissue n analysis petiole sap test and non destructive chlorophyll meters flavonols meters canopy reflectance sensors crop based methods are mainly used to detect crop n status and to guide top dressing n fertilization petiole sap test is very sensitive to crop n status and is easily used on the farm peña fleitas et al 2015 while the other methods are of limited use for different reasons leaf tissue n analysis because of the very time consuming nature of the measurement lemaire et al 2008 chlorophyll meters and flavonols meters because they can be influenced by cultivar and environment and require a thorough calibration and validation and canopy reflectance sensors which although they are promising tools within a precision agriculture context the high cost of some optical sensors makes them expensive for small scale farmers the use of these methods as a key for efficient n management of vegetable crops with reduced n loss to the environment has been reviewed in detail by thompson et al 2017 and padilla et al 2020 3 1 3 simulation models and decision support systems dsss dynamic computer simulation models are very useful for demonstration purposes but many are too complex for steering crop management decisions at farm level a considerable number of dsss based on mechanistic simulation models have been developed in europe to calculate n fertilization rates for vegetable crops examples include n expert in germany azofert in france vegsyst dss and fertilicalc in mediterranean countries notably spain gecon and cal fert in italy planet and rb209 in the united kingdom and eu rotate in several european countries thompson et al 2017 gallardo et al 2020 the use of dss proved to significantly reduce n leaching losses in intensive vegetable rotations as compared to the management used by growers gallardo et al 2020 it is difficult to measure the extent to which dsss are being used for nutrient management in commercial farming nevertheless azofert n expert cropmanage gescon and planet were used to provide nutrient recommendations for numerous commercial farms and smartphone versions of rb209 were downloaded thousands of times since the release in 2017 gallardo et al 2020 provided an in depth discussion of these issues use of all these tools has been demonstrated to appreciably reduce fertilizer n application and n losses while maintaining production levels but the selection of tools to be used by a grower will be influenced by factors such as availability the grower s technical level and economic considerations thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2020 gallardo et al 2020 3 2 agronomic cropping practices 3 2 1 crop rotation nitrogen management is usually focused on a single crop but it is only by integrating available techniques of soil fertility management at the level of the crop rotation that effective environmental sustainability can be achieved including efficient n management agneessens et al 2014 benincasa et al 2017 some basic principles for a well designed crop rotation include legume crops as cash crops or cover crops can supply significant amounts of n to the succeeding crops possibly eliminating the need for additional n fertilization thorup kristensen et al 1999 thorup kristensen and dresbøll 2010 farneselli et al 2018 tosti et al 2019 hefner et al 2020 catch crops to minimize nitrate leaching during the fall winter season when there is no cash crop in temperate climates thorup kristensen et al 2003 gabriel et al 2012 alternation of shallow and deep rooting crops vegetable crops catch crops living mulches in time thorup kristensen 2006 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004a 2004b christiansen et al 2006 and in space to recycle soil no3 from deep soil layers by growing deep rooted crops xie and kristensen 2016 xie et al 2017 in addition some crops such as several crucifers and summer squash but not leek potato or beetroot increase rooting depth and n exploitation at deep n placement or high sowing density kristensen and thorup kristensen 2007 kristensen and stavridou 2017 large reductions of nitrate leaching losses were shown by thorup kristensen 2006 by a simple change in crop sequence after winter fallow in crop rotation the deep rooted white cabbage 2 4 m root depth reduced soil mineral n in deep soil layers of 1 2 5 m depth by more than 100 kg n ha 1 compared to the shallow rooted leek 0 5 m root depth therefore 100 kg n ha 1 less of mineral n was present in the deep soil layers after the harvest of this long seasoned crop where it was too late to establish a winter catch crop when growing a winter catch crop prior to vegetables the leaching of mineral n was decreased for leek and medium deep rooted beetroot 1 9 m root depth by 60 kg n ha 1 the following winter the effect was much lower for white cabbage because of its own deep n uptake thorup kristensen et al 2012 the catch crop grown prior to the vegetables had kept or transferred the soil mineral n to the shallow soil layers within the reach of the shallow rooted crop resulting in 34 higher n uptake in leek at harvest kristensen and thorup kristensen 2007 adapting crop rotations may have large economic consequences as it often means that high value vegetable crops are replaced by other low value crops or cover crops as was shown for two examples by de haan and garcia diaz 2002 however adapting rotations in this way can also improve the growing conditions of the vegetable crop resulting in higher yields or better quality and even positive economic results 3 2 2 cover crops cover crops including catch crops intercrops living mulches and green manures legumes replace bare fallow or a cash crop and are either incorporated or left on the soil surface before the succeeding cash crop the terminology is not settled but cover crops are first of all grown for soil cover which may have other purposes than to close the n cycle e g n fixation weed suppression c storage catch crops are grown to scavenge residual soil mineral n and are defined in some countries as non legumes e g denmark legumes are often grown as cover crops to bring n into the system through biological fixation common cover crops include grasses e g barley rye ryegrass wheat oat legumes e g hairy vetch faba bean pea clovers crucifers e g rapeseed fodder radish white mustard or mixtures of these types thorup kristensen et al 2012 benincasa et al 2017 various reviews and meta analyses conducted from an international perspective e g valkama et al 2015 norris and congreves 2018 concluded that cover crops provide a multitude of ecosystems services e g n supply n2o emission reduction no3 retention soil carbon storage runoff and erosion control increase of microbial biomass suppression of weeds and pests beneficial insect conservation increase of insect biodiversity in organic vegetable production this input is crucial as availability of animal manure is often limited and the use of legumes enables self sufficiency in nitrogen thorup kristensen et al 1999 farneselli et al 2018 tosti et al 2019 in general legumes are less efficient than non legumes in preventing n leaching and are more cold sensitive conversely they pose less risk of pre emptive competition for both water and nutrients to the subsequent cash crop compared to e g grasses and cereals thorup kristensen 1993 grass and cereal catch crops are highly efficient in scavenging nitrate in soil but care must be taken at termination to avoid pre emptive competition with the subsequent crop when the catch crop retains n that would otherwise have been available for the cash crop hefner et al 2020 grass catch crops usually show an easy establishment high cold tolerance and continuous growth in winter thorup kristensen 2001 crucifers are both frost sensitive and winter hardy catch crops and rapidly develop deep root systems kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004a they have a relatively fast n release after incorporation into the soil according to their low c n ratio ramirez garcia et al 2015 the targeted mixing of legume and non legume cover crops allows to manage the amount and rate of n that will be released for the succeeding crops tosti et al 2014 2019 farneselli et al 2018 kramberger et al 2013 hefner et al 2020 the management of cover crops e g sowing date and density termination date and method may greatly affect the cover crop effect on the n dynamics and ecosystem services murrell et al 2017 benincasa et al 2017 sowing date and density depend very much on pedo climatic conditions in general an earlier termination date limits the biomass n accumulation and the effect on nitrate leaching but allows a longer time for seed bed preparation for the succeeding cash crop thorup kristensen et al 2003 vogeler et al 2019 to terminate the cover crop ploughing or disk incorporation is increasingly being replaced by shallow incorporation or mulching cover crop biomass can be mowed or roller crimped hefner et al 2020 and left on the soil surface as organic dead mulches campiglia et al 2010 2014 following the principles of conservation agriculture i e farming systems that promote minimum soil disturbance maintenance of a permanent soil cover and diversification of plant species fao 2020 the effect of this change on nitrogen availability for crop growth and nitrogen loss is depending on the cover crop type legume or non legume and following crop hefner et al 2010 campiglia et al 2014 fertigation may be used to mitigate the effects of the temporal or spatial mismatch between nutrient release from incorporated cover crop biomass or the nutrient demand of the wide spaced vegetables farneselli et al 2013 2018 the effectiveness of cover crops to reduce n losses to water bodies has been clearly demonstrated sanchez et al 2004 scholberg et al 2010 according to a meta analysis by tonitto et al 2006 the reduction of n leaching was 70 under non legume cover crops compared to keeping the soil bare and 40 with legume cover crops in both cases thanks to fall and winter n uptake by the cover crop 3 2 3 intercropping intercropping refers to two or more crop species or genotypes that grow together or coexist for some time in the same field the main benefit of a well designed intercropping is a more efficient resource use such as solar radiation water soil nutrients niche complementarity beneficial neighbor interactions facilitation and resource sharing through common mycorrhizal fungal networks or recycling of nutrients through leaf senescence and root turnover brooker et al 2015 these benefits may lead to enhanced resource use efficiencies including n use efficiency pest disease and weed control and higher crop productivity than corresponding monocultures and delivery of various ecosystem services martin guay et al 2018 the constraints are mainly related to difficulties in mechanization conflicts in management timing increased labor requirements and use of agro chemicals but also competition resulting in yield imbalance which limit a wide adoption in intensive farming systems as vegetable production systems there is a need to develop knowledge for management tools for improved competition control e g system design species combination root pruning displacement of sowing time xie et al 2017 therefore intercropping potentially plays an important role in organic agriculture but is not implemented much in conventional large scale production however intercropping is seen with increasing interest as an alternative practice for a sustainable agriculture in conservation farming systems lithourgidis et al 2011 intercropping cauliflower with overwintering grass clover and moderately reduced n fertilization was feasible in organic cauliflower production with regard to maintaining marketable yield and reducing the risk of nitrate leaching in the agroecosystem xie and kristensen 2016 the intercropping of a shallow rooted leek crop and a deep rooted catch crop isatis tinctoria l dyer s woad crucifer resulted in highly complementary root systems increasing the rooted zone from 0 5 m in monocropped leek to more than 2 m depth in the intercropped system intercropping reduced late autumn soil nitrate by more than 50 kg n ha 1 under leek known for high leaching losses xie and kristensen 2017 across similar trials of vegetable and catch crop intercropping in italy slovenia germany and denmark reductions of 17 52 kg n ha 1 of the risk of nitrate leaching were obtained at best xie et al 2017 in several cases legumes white clover burr medic sown at the time of cauliflower or leek transplanting had limited effects on reducing soil nitrate and negative effects on cash crop n uptake tempesta et al 2019 3 2 4 plant breeding breeding of n efficient genotypes characterized by a low susceptibility to yield depression at reduced n fertilization levels is another approach to improve the sustainability of n management in fact both species and cultivars show differences in nitrogen use efficiency nue plant morphological and physiological traits that contribute to n efficient crops and cultivars are numerous and interacting at different plant organizational levels from root characteristics to differences at the cell level with the involvement of biochemical and molecular traits ferrante et al 2017 lammerts van bueren and struik 2017 spinach has a low n uptake efficiency due to the shallow rooting depth and a low n utilization efficiency optimum n shoot concentration 50 mg n g 1 dm while carrot have a high n uptake efficiency thanks to a deep and expanded root system and low optimum n shoot concentration 30 mg n g 1 dm schenk 2006 most brassica crops have a low n harvest index resulting in high amounts of n in crop residues schulte auf m erley et al 2010 found that white cabbage genotypes differed both in n efficiency head fresh weight at low n supply and in yield at high n supply and that these differences were not related to n uptake but to harvest index for earlier maturing cultivars a slower leaf emergence was responsible for the low harvest index which was mainly dependent on temperature this suggests that breeding of cultivars with generally low temperature tolerance could contribute to enhancing n utilization for late cultivars a high n retranslocation from leaves to the heads was related to yield both at low and high n supply similar results have been reported for cauliflower rather et al 1999 this review by lammerts van bueren and struik 2017 described that head forming crops as cabbage schulte auf m erley et al 2010 and lettuce kerbiriou et al 2014 depend on the prolonged photosynthesis of outer leaves to provide the carbon sources for continued n supply and growth of the photosynthetically less active younger inner leaves in spinach studies conducted by chan navarrete et al 2014 on several cultivars under both low and high n availability in controlled conditions showed that nue was highly correlated with shoot fresh weight shoot dry weight leaf area and root dry weight while there was a moderate negative correlation with specific leaf area and root shoot ratio chlorophyll content showed significant correlation with nue only under high n availability in potato the main factor explaining nue was maturity the late varieties show higher yield and higher nue correlated to a longer growing period and an extended period of maximum leaf canopy and photosynthesis activity ospina et al 2014 in general root performance is relevant for all crops but especially for short cycle vegetable crops that benefit from early below ground growth lammerts van bueren and struik 2017 all the studies suggest that breeding of n efficient cultivars is not only a potential tool to reduce n release to the environment by reducing the necessary n input and reducing the n content remaining in the crop residues but also a strategy to allow crop productivity in farming systems where access to fertilizers is limited ferrante et al 2017 commented that to this aim several strategies should be adopted involving crop management in the short period and genetic improvement in the long one hence breeding should be oriented to increase traits that improve nue under different growing conditions the increasing knowledge about the molecular and physiological bases of a complex trait as nue and the development of innovative emerging molecular technologies for the study of the genome and transcriptome will provide useful tools for supporting the modern breeding programmes 3 3 choice and application of mineral and organic fertilizers much attention is currently going towards improving the sustainable use of mineral fertilizers through the 4r nutrient stewardship reetz et al 2015 bruulsema 2018 that provides a framework for using the right nutrient source applied at the right rate at the right time in the right place the right rate and right time are based on the determination and application of an adequate amount of all limiting nutrients nitrogen in our case to meet plant requirements in relation to yield and quality goals and considering the interactions of crop uptake soil supply environmental risks and field operation logistics as extensively explained in other section of this review 3 3 1 right source the right source of n fertilizers refers to choosing plant available nutrient forms that provide a balanced supply of all essential nutrients that are released in a way that best matches crop demand enhanced efficiency n fertilizers eefs chien et al 2009 snyder 2017 are an example of this approach this term encompasses slow and controlled release n fertilizers nitrification inhibitor treated n fertilizers urease inhibitor treated n fertilizers or products treated with both nitrification and urease inhibitors slow release fertilizers srfs are materials that are slow to enter in solution because of their low solubility and that are converted to plant available n through microbial decomposition and hydrolysis guertal 2009 morgan et al 2009 examples of srfs include urea formaldehyde uf and isobutylenediurea ibdu the primary mechanism of n release in uf is microbial decomposition of the polymer but environmental factors such as soil temperature soil moisture ph and oxygen content all interact with microbial activity the n release from ibdu on the contrary does not depend on microbial activity but the n is made available through hydrolysis at low temperatures given that the n release is accelerated by high soil temperatures and low ph this fertilizer is preferred for cool season application morgan et al 2009 controlled release fertilizers crfs have a release mechanism governed by a water insoluble coating i e sulfur polymer or both sulfur and polymer coatings that limits or controls the rate of water penetration and n release in function of soil temperature and moisture affecting micropore coating simonne and hutchinson 2005 morgan et al 2009 van eerd et al 2018 both srfs and crfs proved to be effective in reducing n leaching in vegetable production systems particularly on sandy soils simonne and hutchinson 2005 hartz and smith 2009 however their use is limited as synchronization of the n release from the fertilizer with varying n demand of the crop is difficult especially in crops with a short growth cycle and a high n demand and as they are more expensive than conventional mineral n fertilizers per unit of n thompson et al 2017 nitrification inhibitors nis are chemical compounds that slow down the conversion of ammonium to nitrate thereby reducing leaching risks of nitrate temperature is a key factor influencing nis efficacy several publications demonstrated that the use of nis improved n fertilizer use efficiency reduced nitrate leaching and decreased n2o emissions ruser and schulz 2015 a meta analysis carried out on 62 peer reviewed publication 1984 2013 with 859 datasets across the globe qiao et al 2015 found that nis application reduced dissolved inorganic n leaching by 48 confidence interval 56 38 moreover the use of nis allows for a reduction of the number of n fertilizer applications pasda et al 2001 and of nitrate concentration in leafy vegetables irigoyen et al 2006 the most commonly used chemical nitrification inhibitors are 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate dmpp and dicyandiamide dcd pasda et al 2001 gilsanz et al 2016 the nitrification inhibition efficacy of dmpp is more dependent on soil type than that of dcd although the efficacy of both inhibitors was lower in more alkaline low organic matter soil guardia et al 2018 in incubation experiments dcd inhibited nitrification from cauliflower residues for 50 days and dmpp for at least 95 days chaves et al 2006 hence especially dmpp shows a potential to reduce nitrate leaching after incorporation of crop residues urease inhibitors uis are chemicals that block the activity of the ubiquitous enzyme urease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonium in soils with high ph or soils that are poorly buffered against ph changes the rapid hydrolysis of urea can result in an accumulation of ammonia rather than ammonium by keeping urea from hydrolyzing urease inhibitors protect against ammonia volatilization so also uis together with nis proved to be effective in increasing yields and nue see meta analysis by abalos et al 2014 typically uis can protect against ammonia loss from surface applied fertilizers for a couple of weeks depending on temperature and moisture conditions the main uis are n n butyl thiophosphoric triamide nbpt and n n propyl thiophosphoric triamide nppt chemical compounds containing urease inhibitor plus nitrification inhibitor are also available snyder 2017 the use of nis and uis may not translate into yield or environmental benefits if weather and soil conditions are not conducive to n loss or when n rates are excessive moreover thompson et al 2017 observed that given the concern of consumers and retailers regarding healthy food attention will need to be paid to ensure that there are no or minimal residues of nis and their degradation products in edible vegetable products the overall effect of eefs is questionable de ruijter et al 2010b examined different types of eefs in various vegetable crops results for eefs were comparable to the use of can calcium ammonium nitrate when applied according to good agricultural practice with use of e g split and banded applications snyder 2017 suggested that the purchase and use of eefs may depend to a great extent on 1 the farmer s cropping system management abilities 2 the agronomic and environmental knowledge of the agricultural retailer and professional crop adviser 3 regional crop and fertilizer economics 4 the soil and water conservation practices also implemented by the farmer on each field 5 the availability and costs of nutrient management technology 6 risks and magnitudes of the dominant environmental n losses and 7 any governmental support or regulatory policies that may affect crop or cropping system choices and or record keeping i e tracking of nutrient performance over time 3 3 2 right place the right placement of nutrients refers to placing the fertilizer close to the growing roots by banding or fertigation in order to maximize absorption and to minimize nutrient losses banding of fertilizers refers to concentrating the fertilizers under or along the plant row of vegetables with usually a wide planting distance the fertilizer may be placed with the seed at planting as a pop up fertilizer or placed under the seed or the transplant as starter fertilizer both pop up and starter fertilizer that are generally low in n and relatively high in p increased early crop growth both root and shoot yield and n use efficiency in carrot cabbage onion lettuce and green bean costigan 1988 stone 1998 burns et al 2010 side dress fertilization on the soil surface in e g cauliflower onion lettuce potato reduced n rates and increased apparent n recovery in comparison with broadcast application burns et al 2010 recently kristensen and stavridou 2017 found that small n fertilizer applications in rocket improved nue through the stimulation of n uptake by deeper roots thus allowing to reduce the amount of fertilizer given in frequent applications or reducing applications given in the late growth phase fertigation i e the agronomic practice in which fertilizers are dissolved in the irrigation water and as such delivered to the root zone usually micro irrigation system is the most effective technique to synchronize n uptake with n availability increase nue and reduce n leaching benincasa et al 2011 farneselli et al 2018 the main advantages of fertigation are the flexibility to split the fertilizer application according to the crop n demand during the entire crop growth cycle localizing n close to the root zone and maintaining relatively low and constant n availability in the soil solution i e all the 4r principles are implemented exhaustive reviews on fertigation management in irrigated vegetable cropping have been published by simonne et al 2017 and incrocci et al 2017 3 3 3 organic fertilizers organic fertilizers are an important source of nitrogen both in conventional and organic vegetable cropping systems and contribute to maintain soil organic matter a recent review by möller 2018 provides detailed information on the effect of organic management on soil fertility and on the composition of several organic amendments currently available to organic farmers organic fertilizers can be either bulky organic materials e g solid animal manures slurries composts digestates based on anaerobic digestion of vegetative biomass or household wastes with a relatively low nutrient concentration commonly used as base dressing or more concentrated commercial organic fertilizers e g feather meal hoof and horn meal meat and bone meal fertilizers derived from plants and plant products processing used to finetune the nutrient supply to the crop requirements solid animal manures and composts are characterized by a relatively high c n ratio 20 30 and therefore a limited n release in the year of application while keratins 20 30 or liquids like vinasse 2 3 or digestates 2 7 showed much higher and fast n availability ifoam 2013 cited by möller 2018 in the mediterranean area compost anaerobic digestate and municipal solid waste gave good yield results in tomato zucchini and lettuce e g montemurro et al 2010 alburquerque et al 2012 some liquid organic fertilizers can also be used for fertigation for example farneselli et al 2018 found that broadcast applications of poultry manure norg 4 c n 10 and by product from a leather factory norg 5 c n 5 at a low n rate of 100 kg ha 1 were inadequate to meet the n requirements of processing tomato in central italy while the by product from a leather factory added as a liquid fertilizer norg 8 c n 3 to the irrigation water at a similar rate showed the same efficacy of the mineral fertigation with higher environmental sustainability the main constraints to the use of organic fertilizers both in conventional and organic vegetable production systems de neve et al 2004 de neve 2017 sambo and nicoletto 2017 möller 2018 can be summarized as follows i the lack of uniformity the bulkiness and instability ii the difficulties in synchronizing n mineralization with crop n demand iii the risk of n losses by volatilization iv the higher cost per unit of nutrients in comparison to mineral fertilizers except for regions with a large manure surplus v national or international legislation prohibiting or limiting their use for example in the eu large manure applications are not allowed due to the limit of 170 kg n ha 1 in nitrate vulnerable zones and the application periods are limited according to each country s action program in some eu countries the use of slurries is forbidden in vegetables the value of organic fertilizers is more than the value of the nutrients in the fertilizer de haan and van geel 2018 give indicative values for the value of the organic matter in slurries of 37 ton cattle slurry and 12 ton pig slurry the use of legume based fertilizers of fresh or silage material may achieve a better synchronization with plant n demand möller 2018 such plant based cut and carry fertilizers were found useful to replace conventional animal based fertilizers sørensen and grevsen 2015 perennial legumes of alfalfa white clover red clover and a grass clover mixture produced 400 500 kg n ha 1 year 1 by two to four harvests per year annual legumes of broad bean lupin and pea produced around 200 kg n ha 1 year 1 and the harvest of seeds resulted in similar amounts a strategy with frequent cuts resulted in cut and carry fertilizers with low c n ratios suitable for precise fast release organic fertilization for vegetable production split dose fertilization of leek was studied by step wise incorporation of white clover after intercropping during the early growth phase of the leek xie et al 2018 leek growth was maintained or increased despite interspecific competition for n between leek and clover the n input from n2 fixation was increased to better match leek n demands and the n retention was improved in the plant soil system compared to full incorporation before leek planting 3 4 other agronomic options in n management 3 4 1 tillage systems soil tillage operations can influence nitrogen cycling in various ways we focus in this review on the effects of controlled traffic farming and reduced and no tillage on crop yield and n dynamics controlled traffic farming ctf where all machinery traffic is restricted to long term permanent lanes as opposed to random traffic farming rtf is a potential management tool to alleviate the problems associated with soil compaction johansen et al 2015 ctf adoption increases soil porosity and water infiltration but did not increase nitrate leaching in vegetables vermeulen and mosquera 2009 conversion to ctf showed positive effects after 2 3 years on vegetable yields root growth and nitrogen availability hefner et al 2019 white cabbage potato beetroot and winter squash yields increased by 27 70 on sandy loam they grew 1 3 25 times more roots under ctf than rtf on sandy loam and coarse sandy soil soil mineral n and potential net n mineralization were equal or higher in ctf while n leaching did not increase the cropping system resilience defined as a similar production level over a couple of years increased for ctf hefner et al 2019 reduced tillage rt and no tillage nt cropping systems have been tested in vegetables with varying results but little is known about the implications for n management from arable farming it is known that reducing tillage intensity changes both crop n demand due to change in yield potential and the supply of n due to changes in net n mineralization and n losses malhi et al 2001 vegetable yields were very much reduced under nt combined with roller crimping of cover crops for weed suppression when compared to bare soil in the usa leavitt et al 2011 in europe the system showed promising results in a mediterranean climate canali et al 2013 but diverse results on yields depending on cover crop species and sufficient n fertilization in denmark the risk of nitrate leaching was suggested to be decreased by nt combined with roller crimping hefner et al 2020 knowledge of rt and nt effects on n dynamics and the applicability in vegetable production in other climates is scarce 3 4 2 organic and conventional farming systems in general conservation and organic farming systems tend to pay more attention to the crop rotation than conventional farming systems where short term economic aspects often prevail over agronomic and environmental considerations unless imposed by regulation this leads to short crop rotations and open nutrient cycles mainly in large scale specialized vegetable farms möller 2018 the differences in n use efficiency and n losses mainly nitrate leaching between organic and conventional agriculture including horticultural crops is still a matter of debate comparisons of nitrate leaching between the systems often come to contradictory conclusions which is not surprising given the enormous diversity in both organic and conventional farming management a main difficulty is the inherent differences in the farming systems which make direct comparison difficult such as management practices affecting e g size of seedlings sowing planting and harvest time use of cover crops fertilizers and amendments and harvest quality criteria which interact with the n management practices another difficulty is the interpretation of results e g nitrate leaching per kg applied n per ha of land or per kg of marketable yield one good example of the limited number of studies of nitrate losses scaled per yield shows lower nitrate leaching losses in organic as compared to conventional arable fields 0 2 0 1 kg n kg 1 n year 1 versus 0 3 0 1 kg n kg 1 n year 1 when calculated across 37 fields in 8 crop rotations benoit et al 2014 a meta analysis seufert et al 2012 showed greater yield reduction for vegetable crops than for cereals and oilseed crops in organic compared to conventional management however the organic systems better maintained or improved soil health indices such as soil fertility and organic matter content scialabba and müller lindenlauf 2010 thorup kristensen et al 2012 showed that plant nutrition and n use efficiency could be optimized in a vegetable crop rotation by replacing n fertilization by the use of non legume and legume cover crops combined with a design of the crop rotation based on rooting depth and n demand thorup kristensen 2006 the change of fertilizer input plant cover and rotation design turned out to be more important to secure high yields and low nitrate leaching than if the farming practice was conventional or organic the yield across all crops in rotation was reduced to 82 in organic compared to conventional systems calculated per hectare of cropped land while mineral n contents in 1 2 m soil depth were 74 and 61 kg n ha 1 in the conventional and organic systems respectively without cover crops and 22 kg n ha 1 in the organic systems with cover crops 3 4 3 biostimulants plant biostimulants have been included among the tools that may have potential in sustainable n fertilization management de pascale et al 2017 2018 there is absence of a biostimulant definition universally accepted by the regulatory bodies colla and rouphael 2015 in a recent review the following definition was proposed a plant biostimulant is any substance or microorganism applied to plants with the aim to enhance nutrition efficiency abiotic stress tolerance and or crop quality traits regardless of its nutrients content by extension plant biostimulants also designate commercial products containing mixtures of such substances and or microorganisms du jardin 2015 the following main categories of plant biostimulants were suggested i humic and fulvic acids ii protein hydrolysates and other n containing compounds iii seaweed extracts and botanicals iv chitosan and other biopolymers v inorganic compounds vi beneficial fungi vii beneficial bacteria different researches demonstrated a significant effect on plant nitrogen uptake in general calvo et al 2014 bulgari et al 2015 protein hydrolysates increased n use efficiency in greenhouse spinach carillo et al 2019 and rocket di mola et al 2019 while humic acids improved yield in field grown onion kandil et al 2013 however more research is needed to deepen knowledge of the mode of action of biostimulants to improve nutrient availability and uptake de pascale et al 2017 and very importantly to quantify the actual potential to contribute to a sustainable n management of cropping systems 3 4 4 grafting grafting is a cultural technique that consists in the union by different methods i e cleft tongue approach grafting hole insertion tube or pine grafting of a rootstock and a scion of two different species or of two different cultivars of the same species in vegetable crops grafting is practiced worldwide from decades mainly in cucurbitaceae melon watermelon and cucumber and solanaceae tomato eggplant pepper species to provide tolerance to biotic stress e g soil borne fungi virus bacterial diseases and abiotic stresses e g cold salinity drought heavy metal toxicity to increase plant vigor to influence sex expression to improve quality traits and overall considered to increase yield in greenhouse or open field crops kiriacou et al 2017 rouphael et al 2018 several studies showing enhanced n use efficiency of grafted plants e g in melon colla et al 2010 tomato djidonou et al 2013 and pepper ropokis et al 2019 which indicates that grafting can contribute to the sustainable n management in vegetable production systems simonne et al 2017 de pascale et al 2018 all researchers pointed out that the impact of grafting depended not merely on the rootstock genotype but on the rootstock scion combination 4 final considerations vegetable production systems are typically intensive cropping systems with high n input and high risk of n leaching specific problems of n management in vegetables include the often large n mineralization potential of soils and the high n release of incorporated vegetable crop residues which complicates the synchronization between n supply and crop n demand the most crucial factor is the correct quantification of the different n balance components in the soil crop atmosphere continuum by using established estimation methods for these components and possibly monitoring tools of the crop n status throughout the growing season in addition the correct choice of n fertilizer type timing and application method can further increase n use efficiency and reduce n losses notably by using fertigation techniques however further improvements in n use efficiency should not only be limited to the further refinement of n fertilizer advices and more precise fertilization techniques but also include in a wider systems approach this would mean that more attention should go to the overall design of the crop rotation e g a judicious choice of crops in the rotation that are complementary with respect to n demand and n uptake efficiency also including non vegetables also the use of less common techniques intercropping reduced tillage controlled traffic farming should further be explored for the potential to increase n use efficiency however this will need to be reconciled with a number of economic constraints finally the success of all these tools will crucially depend on the adoption rate by farmers there is therefore also a need to include all these aspects in user friendly decision support systems that can be directly implemented in farmers practice funding this research did not

10534,n fertilization is often viewed as a cheap insurance against yield loss in vegetable production because of the generally large added value resulting in application of fertilizer n often in excess of actual crop demand in combination with the low fertilizer n recovery by many vegetable crops and the often excessive irrigation this may lead to both health and environmental risks related to high nitrate concentrations in water leaving the root zone in this review we discuss the decisive factors in the overall n balance of field vegetable production systems and the different tools at hand to increase fertilizer use efficiency and consequently reduce n losses to the environment based on this we identify areas of research and technology transfer where further work is required only an integration of the different methods and strategies for n management may really mitigate the risk of nitrate leaching and maintain crop yields while enhancing the environmental sustainability of vegetable production systems keywords n balance cover crops cropping systems fertilizers n fertilization efficiency n leaching 1 introduction many vegetable crop species have a relatively low nutrient use efficiency compared to arable crops often related to the short growing season and superficial rooting greenwood et al 1989 thompson et al 2020 because of the generally large added value of the vegetable production sector compared to e g arable crops or grassland fertilization especially n fertilization is often viewed as a cheap insurance against yield loss resulting in application of fertilizer n often in excess of actual crop demand thompson et al 2007 the combination of n application in excess of crop demand the low n fertilizer recovery by vegetable crops and the often excessive irrigation thompson et al 2007 thorup kristensen et al 2012 may lead to both health risks i e nitrate accumulation in leafy vegetables colla et al 2018 and environmental risks associated with high nitrate concentrations in water leaving the root zone agostini et al 2010 cameira and mota 2017 thompson et al 2020 despite the relatively small share in total land area and production the vegetable sector represents a disproportionately large economic share in europe eurostat 2019 fresh vegetables production in the eu represented a value of 34 5 billions of euro in 2017 or 8 3 of the value of all the agricultural goods and services produced in the eu in 2016 there were about 823 000 farms in the eu 28 cultivating fresh vegetables representing just 8 0 of the total number of farms and 2 2 million hectares of agricultural land eurostat 2019 in 2014 15 vegetables represented 7 4 of total fertilizer consumption of 103 mt n at global level heffer et al 2017 in the eu 28 n fertilizers in vegetables represented 2 3 of the total consumption of about 11 mt n while vegetable production is only representing 1 2 of the area in europe the protection of natural waters from diffuse pollution by nutrients n and p is regulated by the nitrate directive council of the european communities 1991 and the water framework directive european commission 2000 and the main source of this pollution is agriculture given the intensive nature of most of the vegetable production in europe this sector is contributing much to the problem of nitrate pollution of natural waters in several regions in europe the very existence of intensive vegetable production will depend on its willingness and ability to drastically cut n losses to the environment by implementing a more efficient n management quemada et al 2013 consequently research has been focusing increasingly on improving n management in vegetable cropping systems to significantly reduce the environmental and health impacts tei et al 2017 padilla et al 2018 kristensen and stavridou 2017 in addition high nitrate concentrations in soil are associated with the emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o snyder et al 2009 the aim of this review is to discuss the different factors that are decisive in the overall n balance of field vegetable production systems and the different tools at hand to increase fertilizer use efficiency and consequently reduce n losses to the environment with focus on losses to surface and groundwater and to identify areas of research and technology transfer where further work is required 2 drawing up the n balance for vegetable production systems an in depth insight into all processes that govern the n cycling in soil is needed to optimize fertilization and maximize n use efficiency whilst minimizing losses therefore we start by discussing the detailed n balance in the soil crop atmosphere continuum congreves and van eerd 2015 thompson et al 2017 which forms the basis for the so called balance sheet systems of n fertilization the n balance takes into account all possible inputs soil mineral n available at planting n mineralized from soil organic matter n mineralized from organic materials mineral fertilizer n n from irrigation and atmospheric deposition and all possible outputs crop n uptake n losses by denitrification volatilization and leaching and n immobilization in the soil the individual components of the balance are often difficult to quantify because of the highly dynamic nature of n transformations and the many interactions generalizations and simplifications will always have to be made for practical use 2 1 soil mineral n at planting the sum of nh4 n and no3 n at or shortly before planting is a key variable for efficient n fertilizer management it depends mainly on the previous crop and its management e g applied n fertilizer rate irrigation and harvest time the weather conditions mainly rainfall and planting time commonly higher soil mineral n in autumn than in spring due to fall winter leaching by rainfall e g nendel 2009 n use efficiency can be improved drastically by including soil mineral n at planting in the calculation of n fertilization thompson et al 2017 2018 de pascale et al 2018 2 2 n mineralization from soil organic matter and n immobilization the processes of n mineralization and immobilization occur simultaneously in soil at all times mineralization immobilization turnover mit norton and schimel 2012 the result of these two processes is termed net n mineralization greatly influenced by soil temperature moisture content and compaction de neve 2017 soil organic matter som mineralization is the predominant source of n for the crop especially in low input production systems nendel et al 2019 and crucially needs to be accounted for in n fertilizer calculations however n mineralization from som is difficult to measure in situ because the mineralized n is rapidly consumed in other processes or transported through the soil profile a few attempts have been made to measure n mineralization using micro lysimeters nendel et al 2005 or using buried soil cores in field incubations delphin 2000 alternatively in situ n mineralization can be derived from measuring all components of the n balance in a field however because of the large spatial and temporal variability of soil n processes and the difficulty in measuring loss processes this approach is not applicable in practice most often n mineralization is measured in controlled conditions in the laboratory and there have been many attempts to predict n mineralization in controlled conditions by simple or more complex relationships with soil properties e g som c n som content ph texture and environmental factors temperature moisture content bulk density general soil structural quality de neve 2017 nendel et al 2019 nendel et al 2019 analyzed 340 data sets extracted from previously published incubation experiments for potential nitrogen mineralization covering a large range of soils and climate conditions they found that under warm and year round humid conditions the potentially mineralizable n as fraction of the soil total n was significantly smaller than in dry or temperate environments the n mineralization potential that is the maximum amount of n being released from soil under optimum conditions for mineralization by the microbial biomass optimum temperature soil water content nutrient and oxygen supply in temperate climates was estimated to be 151 kg n ha 1 as climate zone median as a coarse first estimate n mineralization under temperate maritime climates can be very roughly estimated to be 2 3 of the soil organic n with the lower limit for heavy soils and the upper limit for sandy soils de neve 2017 lorenz et al 1989 suggested a value of 5 5 kg n ha 1 week 1 of n mineralization from soil organic matter for the rhineland palatinate region in germany in general n mineralization from soil organic matter is higher in vegetable cropped soils than in arable soils because of the intensive nature of vegetable production with large historical applications of mineral and organic fertilizers and the small harvest index with large amounts of crop residues being returned to the soil 2 3 n mineralization from added organic materials incorporation of vegetable crop residues in particular represents a highly important but often neglected source of mineral n the amount of crop residue can vary from 25 30 kg n ha 1 e g spinach lettuce to as much as 250 300 kg n ha 1 e g for cabbages chaves et al 2007 agneessens et al 2014 congreves and van eerd 2015 de neve 2017 tempesta et al 2019 de neve and hofman 1996 found that 60 80 of the n in vegetable crop residues is mineralized within the 3 weeks following incorporation in summer or early autumn in a study conducted in western europe under exceptionally good conditions i e a warm moist and very well aerated soil over 80 of the mineral nitrogen present in crop residues was released as early as 9 weeks after incorporation tremblay et al 2001 failure to properly account for the n contained in crop residues obviously may lead to excessive n fertilization and n losses other added organic materials include cover crops animal manures slurries and farmyard manure composts by products from the agricultural industries e g animal by products such as blood meal hair meal and bone meal digestates from manure processing and from bio energy production municipal solid wastes sewage sludge amongst others for some of the more common of these materials green manures animal slurries n release is relatively well known but others are poorly characterized with respect to both the amount and the timing of n release de neve 2017 sambo and nicoletto 2017 benincasa et al 2017 an important aspect of the management of organic materials is the synchronization of n mineralization with crop n demand to avoid yield loss and or minimize the risk of n losses fig 1 for instance lack of synchrony may occur in early spring in temperate humid climates when crop n demand can already by high while n mineralization is still limited because of relatively low soil temperatures in autumn n mineralization of crop residues rich in n may still proceed at high rates due to high soil temperatures at a time when the soil is bare or the crop n demand is low the lack of synchronization in spring can easily be remediated by additional fertilization but excessive n mineralization in autumn is much more difficult to manage and is one of the chief causes for high n losses 2 4 n supply from irrigation irrigation water may contain a significant amount of n particularly in regions with high nitrate levels in groundwater reliable estimates of these n inputs can be obtained by frequent analysis of the irrigation water and by keeping good records of irrigation volumes for example a typical seasonal irrigation volume for sweet pepper of about 3000 m3 ha 1 with a nitrate concentration of 50 mg l 1 corresponds to a total n input from irrigation of 34 kg n ha 1 2 5 n from atmospheric deposition both wet precipitation and dry dust deposition mainly associated with ammonia nh3 emissions related to intensive livestock production and nox emissions from industry and traffic may contribute significantly to the overall n input for agricultural crops nitrogen may be transported over long distances before being deposited and thus may have a transboundary component vet et al 2014 found wet deposition of n in europe to range from 1 to 25 kg n ha 1 yr 1 while n deposition drastically declined over the past decades as a result of measures to combat air pollution in some regions of intensive livestock production northern part of belgium parts of the netherlands and denmark emissions and deposition may still be significant and may represent between 10 and 20 of the total n requirement of the vegetable crop 2 6 mineral fertilizer n in the balance sheet system of n fertilizer advice the amount of fertilizer to be applied is calculated as the difference between outputs and inputs rate timing type and application method of mineral fertilizer represent critical issues to optimize crop production and minimize environmental losses snyder 2017 see section 3 3 moreover not only yield but also produce quality should be considered in calculating optimal n fertilizer rates in vegetables burns 2006 while reduced n availability may negatively affect biomass yield and fruit size it has been reported to increase the concentration of free radical scavengers with anti oxidant capacity stefanelli et al 2010 excessive n fertilization was reported to reduce quality parameters e g fruit size vitamin c concentration sugar content in different vegetable crops albornoz 2016 and to increase the concentration of harmful compounds such as nitrates in leafy vegetables colla et al 2018 given the decisive impact of produce quality on price n management should also be analyzed from an accurate economic analysis of marketable products in addition to the biomass yield or environmental perspective burns 2006 2 7 crop n uptake at optimal n status mineral n uptake is the product of the total biomass and the critical n concentration i e the minimum n concentration required for maximum plant growth greenwood et al 1990 total biomass is in turn highly correlated with crop yield some authors greenwood et al 1990 lemaire and gastal 1997 lemaire et al 2008 determined the relationship between the critical n concentration and the above ground plant dry weight the relationship is highly different between c3 and c4 plants reflecting the different metabolic pathway but is relatively constant within the same metabolic group still species specific critical n dilution curves have been determined for example for potato greenwood et al 1990 1996 processing tomato tei et al 2002 lettuce tei et al 2003 di gioia et al 2017 conversa and elia 2019 cabbage ekbladh and witter 2010 broccoli and cauliflower riley and vågen 2003 conversa et al 2019 carrot shlevin et al 2018 from the critical n dilution curve the relationship can be obtained between crop biomass and crop n uptake at optimal n nutritional status this allows to quantify the potential n crop demand to be used in the n balance crop n demands are often summarized and averaged in look up tables based on past agronomic experiments for use in practice by farmers and technicians despite the high n demand of most vegetable crops feller and fink 2002 congreves and van eerd 2015 they can only take up a fraction of the soil mineral n i e the nitrogen uptake efficiency nupe is less than 1 or less than 100 greenwood et al 1989 defined the apparent recovery rec of fertilizer n by the crop as rec uf u0 nf where nf fertilizer n rate uf n uptake when nf is applied u0 n uptake when no fertilizer is applied i e an estimate of the uptake of mineral n already present into the soil before planting and mineralized during crop growth the same authors showed that in vegetables the relationship between n fertilization rates and n uptake decreased linearly according to the following general equation rec rec0 b nf where rec0 is the fitted value of rec with an infinitesimally small amount of fertilizer n and b is the gradient of rec against nf fig 2 consequently knowledge of the rec value for a species provides an estimate of the proportion of n fertilizer not taken up by the crop at a given n rate this approach is useful to achieve a compromise between yield and environmental issues burns 2006 these relationships are species specific because they depend on differences in root function and architecture e g tei et al 1999 they are also influenced by soil conditions e g water shortage reduces growth and n uptake weather conditions agronomic practices e g irrigation and fertilizer application methods e g broadcast or localized application tremblay et al 2001 benincasa et al 2011 given the difficulty of obtaining the rec from specific field experiments a safety margin practical approach has been proposed by some authors e g tremblay et al 2001 defined as an additional amount of mineral n to be present as a kind of n buffer to allow for maximum n uptake at all times this n buffer is added to the crop n demand and is higher for crops with small shallow roots few root hairs e g leeks and onions i e crops that are inefficient at extracting n as compared to crops with a better developed root system e g cabbage brussels sprouts carrots tremblay et al 2001 the kns system is one example of a n fertilizer advice system mainly for vegetable crops that uses such a n buffer in the calculation of the n fertilizer requirements see section 3 1 1 2 8 n losses nitrogen loss processes including denitrification volatilization and leaching will lead to reduced n availability given the often high n fertilization rates and the high concentrations of soil mineral n the risk of these n losses and the extent to which they occur is particularly high in n intensive horticultural systems cameira and mota 2017 2 8 1 denitrification and volatilization losses denitrification i e conversion of nitrate no3 to molecular nitrogen n2 with possible formation of nitrous oxide n2o and nitric oxide no occurs within the soil wherever there is sufficient nitrate labile organic carbon and low oxygen concentrations and oxygen diffusion rates these losses are low in most dryland cropping soils but may be significant in slowly draining and waterlogged soils myrold and bottomley 2008 hence normally n losses by denitrification are small in vegetable fields however they can be appreciable in specific circumstances e g when large amounts of vegetable crop residues are incorporated and this is followed by heavy rain ammonia volatilization occurs when ammonium from ammonium containing or urea containing fertilizers or from organic fertilizers e g cattle manure castor bean cake legume fertilizers is converted to ammonia the risk of such losses is low when these fertilizers are incorporated immediately or injected but can be very high when they are surface applied engel et al 2011 ramanantenasoa et al 2019 the potential risk of ammonia volatilization from urea fertilizer can represent up to 65 of the n applied depending on soil and climatic conditions sutton and grinsven 2011 ammonia volatilization can also occur during mineralization of vegetable crop residues de ruijter et al 2010a found that about 5 16 of the n in vegetable crop residues could be lost as nh3 2 8 2 nitrate leaching vegetable crops are often grown on coarse textured soils that have low water holding capacity and a high hydraulic conductivity so excess nitrate not taken up by the crop has high probability to be leached out below the root zone in case of excess precipitation or not well managed irrigation the risk of leaching depends on i the soil nitrate concentration at a given time that depends in turn on the history of n management in the specific field ii the intensity and frequency of water inputs i e rainfall or irrigation iii the soil hydraulic characteristics nitrate leaching losses and the associated potential risk of groundwater contamination from intensive vegetable production has been studied extensively in a wide variety of pedo climatic conditions and cropping systems e g thompson et al 2007 xie et al 2017 farneselli et al 2018 tosti et al 2019 rakotovololona et al 2019 de haan et al 2019 hefner et al 2019 2 9 final considerations on the n balance as illustrated in this section the n balance takes into account all possible inputs and outputs of n to and from the field and is therefore a potentially very accurate basis for calculation of n fertilization that should allow to minimize n losses notably by leaching however the efficiency of this approach critically depends on the quality of the available data e g crop n uptake expected mineralization and the experience of the persons drawing up the balance it should be pointed out that there are some minor variations in the way that the n balance is calculated by different daughters and recommendation schemes as discussed by thompson et al 2017 3 strategies for improved sustainability of n fertilization 3 1 tools to assist with crop n management often growers and advisors make decisions on the amount of n fertilizer to be applied based on experience or look up tables adapted to the local pedo climatic and cropping conditions for fine tuning of fertilizer recommendations look up tables can take into account some crucial characteristics of a specific field and its history e g soil texture previous crop crop residues management but generally lack precision advising on the safe side to minimize risks of yield reductions thus potentially leading to high n losses simple observational methods that introduce basic diagnostic tools such as plant color unfertilized windows indicator plants tremblay et al 2001 for monitoring soil and crop n status allow for a first refinement of n fertilization in data poor conditions in some countries legislation demands quite complex n fertilizer planning often guided by extension services for example in denmark the use of look up tables is combined with modelling of previous winter leaching at regional scale taking into account the soil type pre crop effect irrigation and crop n demand at field level for conventional production organic production is regulated by a general rule on maximal 100 kg used n ha 1 in average across the fields of a farm danish ministry of environment and food 2020 given the increasing pressure for improving environmental performance of agriculture in general and vegetable growing in particular e g with respect to the targets in the framework guidelines for water protection european commission 2000 more science based methods of n management have been developed in the past decades extensive reviews of such methods including application reliability and sensitivity have been published recently e g thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2018 de pascale et al 2018 3 1 1 fertilizer recommendation schemes based on soil analysis or soil n supply nmin kns and n expert systems are methods that use the soil mineral n content to calculate n fertilizer advices through a simplified n balance thompson et al 2017 2018 nmin system is the simplest method because it calculates the mineral n fertilizer rate for the entire crop cycle by subtracting the measured soil mineral n in the root zone at crop planting from a tabled n target value kns system refines the approach of the nmin system by including a tabled n buffer i e a safety margin to determine a n target value an estimate of the expected weekly n mineralization from som and a soil mineral n analysis during the crop growth period to calculate the n top dressing the n expert system is a further development of kns by introducing an apparent recovery of 80 of total n supply the estimated n recovery and the estimated mineralisation from soil organic matter are combined in a component called apparent n net mineralisation these methods are commonly used with field grown vegetable crops in north western and central europe soil n supply sns system is an index system used in england and wales in which the soil n supply is estimated rather than measured thompson et al 2017 ahdb 2020 the sns indices estimate available soil mineral n including estimates of n mineralised from organic material during the crop growth period sns indices are determined for a specific field by considering average annual rainfall soil texture and residues from the preceding crop and are used to recommend the n fertilizer rate these methods when used as part of improved management systems proved to notably reduce no3 leaching in vegetable cropping systems thompson et al 2017 2018 additionally the nitrate concentration of the soil solution in the root zone can be used to assist with n management of fertigated vegetable crops thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2020 this method developed in israel but used in spain too is based on analysis of soil solution extracted with ceramic suction samplers and on the use of sufficiency values or tendencies for data interpretation and n management peña fleitas et al 2015 padilla et al 2020 3 1 2 methods based on crop or plant analysis destructive leaf tissue n analysis petiole sap test and non destructive chlorophyll meters flavonols meters canopy reflectance sensors crop based methods are mainly used to detect crop n status and to guide top dressing n fertilization petiole sap test is very sensitive to crop n status and is easily used on the farm peña fleitas et al 2015 while the other methods are of limited use for different reasons leaf tissue n analysis because of the very time consuming nature of the measurement lemaire et al 2008 chlorophyll meters and flavonols meters because they can be influenced by cultivar and environment and require a thorough calibration and validation and canopy reflectance sensors which although they are promising tools within a precision agriculture context the high cost of some optical sensors makes them expensive for small scale farmers the use of these methods as a key for efficient n management of vegetable crops with reduced n loss to the environment has been reviewed in detail by thompson et al 2017 and padilla et al 2020 3 1 3 simulation models and decision support systems dsss dynamic computer simulation models are very useful for demonstration purposes but many are too complex for steering crop management decisions at farm level a considerable number of dsss based on mechanistic simulation models have been developed in europe to calculate n fertilization rates for vegetable crops examples include n expert in germany azofert in france vegsyst dss and fertilicalc in mediterranean countries notably spain gecon and cal fert in italy planet and rb209 in the united kingdom and eu rotate in several european countries thompson et al 2017 gallardo et al 2020 the use of dss proved to significantly reduce n leaching losses in intensive vegetable rotations as compared to the management used by growers gallardo et al 2020 it is difficult to measure the extent to which dsss are being used for nutrient management in commercial farming nevertheless azofert n expert cropmanage gescon and planet were used to provide nutrient recommendations for numerous commercial farms and smartphone versions of rb209 were downloaded thousands of times since the release in 2017 gallardo et al 2020 provided an in depth discussion of these issues use of all these tools has been demonstrated to appreciably reduce fertilizer n application and n losses while maintaining production levels but the selection of tools to be used by a grower will be influenced by factors such as availability the grower s technical level and economic considerations thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2020 gallardo et al 2020 3 2 agronomic cropping practices 3 2 1 crop rotation nitrogen management is usually focused on a single crop but it is only by integrating available techniques of soil fertility management at the level of the crop rotation that effective environmental sustainability can be achieved including efficient n management agneessens et al 2014 benincasa et al 2017 some basic principles for a well designed crop rotation include legume crops as cash crops or cover crops can supply significant amounts of n to the succeeding crops possibly eliminating the need for additional n fertilization thorup kristensen et al 1999 thorup kristensen and dresbøll 2010 farneselli et al 2018 tosti et al 2019 hefner et al 2020 catch crops to minimize nitrate leaching during the fall winter season when there is no cash crop in temperate climates thorup kristensen et al 2003 gabriel et al 2012 alternation of shallow and deep rooting crops vegetable crops catch crops living mulches in time thorup kristensen 2006 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004a 2004b christiansen et al 2006 and in space to recycle soil no3 from deep soil layers by growing deep rooted crops xie and kristensen 2016 xie et al 2017 in addition some crops such as several crucifers and summer squash but not leek potato or beetroot increase rooting depth and n exploitation at deep n placement or high sowing density kristensen and thorup kristensen 2007 kristensen and stavridou 2017 large reductions of nitrate leaching losses were shown by thorup kristensen 2006 by a simple change in crop sequence after winter fallow in crop rotation the deep rooted white cabbage 2 4 m root depth reduced soil mineral n in deep soil layers of 1 2 5 m depth by more than 100 kg n ha 1 compared to the shallow rooted leek 0 5 m root depth therefore 100 kg n ha 1 less of mineral n was present in the deep soil layers after the harvest of this long seasoned crop where it was too late to establish a winter catch crop when growing a winter catch crop prior to vegetables the leaching of mineral n was decreased for leek and medium deep rooted beetroot 1 9 m root depth by 60 kg n ha 1 the following winter the effect was much lower for white cabbage because of its own deep n uptake thorup kristensen et al 2012 the catch crop grown prior to the vegetables had kept or transferred the soil mineral n to the shallow soil layers within the reach of the shallow rooted crop resulting in 34 higher n uptake in leek at harvest kristensen and thorup kristensen 2007 adapting crop rotations may have large economic consequences as it often means that high value vegetable crops are replaced by other low value crops or cover crops as was shown for two examples by de haan and garcia diaz 2002 however adapting rotations in this way can also improve the growing conditions of the vegetable crop resulting in higher yields or better quality and even positive economic results 3 2 2 cover crops cover crops including catch crops intercrops living mulches and green manures legumes replace bare fallow or a cash crop and are either incorporated or left on the soil surface before the succeeding cash crop the terminology is not settled but cover crops are first of all grown for soil cover which may have other purposes than to close the n cycle e g n fixation weed suppression c storage catch crops are grown to scavenge residual soil mineral n and are defined in some countries as non legumes e g denmark legumes are often grown as cover crops to bring n into the system through biological fixation common cover crops include grasses e g barley rye ryegrass wheat oat legumes e g hairy vetch faba bean pea clovers crucifers e g rapeseed fodder radish white mustard or mixtures of these types thorup kristensen et al 2012 benincasa et al 2017 various reviews and meta analyses conducted from an international perspective e g valkama et al 2015 norris and congreves 2018 concluded that cover crops provide a multitude of ecosystems services e g n supply n2o emission reduction no3 retention soil carbon storage runoff and erosion control increase of microbial biomass suppression of weeds and pests beneficial insect conservation increase of insect biodiversity in organic vegetable production this input is crucial as availability of animal manure is often limited and the use of legumes enables self sufficiency in nitrogen thorup kristensen et al 1999 farneselli et al 2018 tosti et al 2019 in general legumes are less efficient than non legumes in preventing n leaching and are more cold sensitive conversely they pose less risk of pre emptive competition for both water and nutrients to the subsequent cash crop compared to e g grasses and cereals thorup kristensen 1993 grass and cereal catch crops are highly efficient in scavenging nitrate in soil but care must be taken at termination to avoid pre emptive competition with the subsequent crop when the catch crop retains n that would otherwise have been available for the cash crop hefner et al 2020 grass catch crops usually show an easy establishment high cold tolerance and continuous growth in winter thorup kristensen 2001 crucifers are both frost sensitive and winter hardy catch crops and rapidly develop deep root systems kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004a they have a relatively fast n release after incorporation into the soil according to their low c n ratio ramirez garcia et al 2015 the targeted mixing of legume and non legume cover crops allows to manage the amount and rate of n that will be released for the succeeding crops tosti et al 2014 2019 farneselli et al 2018 kramberger et al 2013 hefner et al 2020 the management of cover crops e g sowing date and density termination date and method may greatly affect the cover crop effect on the n dynamics and ecosystem services murrell et al 2017 benincasa et al 2017 sowing date and density depend very much on pedo climatic conditions in general an earlier termination date limits the biomass n accumulation and the effect on nitrate leaching but allows a longer time for seed bed preparation for the succeeding cash crop thorup kristensen et al 2003 vogeler et al 2019 to terminate the cover crop ploughing or disk incorporation is increasingly being replaced by shallow incorporation or mulching cover crop biomass can be mowed or roller crimped hefner et al 2020 and left on the soil surface as organic dead mulches campiglia et al 2010 2014 following the principles of conservation agriculture i e farming systems that promote minimum soil disturbance maintenance of a permanent soil cover and diversification of plant species fao 2020 the effect of this change on nitrogen availability for crop growth and nitrogen loss is depending on the cover crop type legume or non legume and following crop hefner et al 2010 campiglia et al 2014 fertigation may be used to mitigate the effects of the temporal or spatial mismatch between nutrient release from incorporated cover crop biomass or the nutrient demand of the wide spaced vegetables farneselli et al 2013 2018 the effectiveness of cover crops to reduce n losses to water bodies has been clearly demonstrated sanchez et al 2004 scholberg et al 2010 according to a meta analysis by tonitto et al 2006 the reduction of n leaching was 70 under non legume cover crops compared to keeping the soil bare and 40 with legume cover crops in both cases thanks to fall and winter n uptake by the cover crop 3 2 3 intercropping intercropping refers to two or more crop species or genotypes that grow together or coexist for some time in the same field the main benefit of a well designed intercropping is a more efficient resource use such as solar radiation water soil nutrients niche complementarity beneficial neighbor interactions facilitation and resource sharing through common mycorrhizal fungal networks or recycling of nutrients through leaf senescence and root turnover brooker et al 2015 these benefits may lead to enhanced resource use efficiencies including n use efficiency pest disease and weed control and higher crop productivity than corresponding monocultures and delivery of various ecosystem services martin guay et al 2018 the constraints are mainly related to difficulties in mechanization conflicts in management timing increased labor requirements and use of agro chemicals but also competition resulting in yield imbalance which limit a wide adoption in intensive farming systems as vegetable production systems there is a need to develop knowledge for management tools for improved competition control e g system design species combination root pruning displacement of sowing time xie et al 2017 therefore intercropping potentially plays an important role in organic agriculture but is not implemented much in conventional large scale production however intercropping is seen with increasing interest as an alternative practice for a sustainable agriculture in conservation farming systems lithourgidis et al 2011 intercropping cauliflower with overwintering grass clover and moderately reduced n fertilization was feasible in organic cauliflower production with regard to maintaining marketable yield and reducing the risk of nitrate leaching in the agroecosystem xie and kristensen 2016 the intercropping of a shallow rooted leek crop and a deep rooted catch crop isatis tinctoria l dyer s woad crucifer resulted in highly complementary root systems increasing the rooted zone from 0 5 m in monocropped leek to more than 2 m depth in the intercropped system intercropping reduced late autumn soil nitrate by more than 50 kg n ha 1 under leek known for high leaching losses xie and kristensen 2017 across similar trials of vegetable and catch crop intercropping in italy slovenia germany and denmark reductions of 17 52 kg n ha 1 of the risk of nitrate leaching were obtained at best xie et al 2017 in several cases legumes white clover burr medic sown at the time of cauliflower or leek transplanting had limited effects on reducing soil nitrate and negative effects on cash crop n uptake tempesta et al 2019 3 2 4 plant breeding breeding of n efficient genotypes characterized by a low susceptibility to yield depression at reduced n fertilization levels is another approach to improve the sustainability of n management in fact both species and cultivars show differences in nitrogen use efficiency nue plant morphological and physiological traits that contribute to n efficient crops and cultivars are numerous and interacting at different plant organizational levels from root characteristics to differences at the cell level with the involvement of biochemical and molecular traits ferrante et al 2017 lammerts van bueren and struik 2017 spinach has a low n uptake efficiency due to the shallow rooting depth and a low n utilization efficiency optimum n shoot concentration 50 mg n g 1 dm while carrot have a high n uptake efficiency thanks to a deep and expanded root system and low optimum n shoot concentration 30 mg n g 1 dm schenk 2006 most brassica crops have a low n harvest index resulting in high amounts of n in crop residues schulte auf m erley et al 2010 found that white cabbage genotypes differed both in n efficiency head fresh weight at low n supply and in yield at high n supply and that these differences were not related to n uptake but to harvest index for earlier maturing cultivars a slower leaf emergence was responsible for the low harvest index which was mainly dependent on temperature this suggests that breeding of cultivars with generally low temperature tolerance could contribute to enhancing n utilization for late cultivars a high n retranslocation from leaves to the heads was related to yield both at low and high n supply similar results have been reported for cauliflower rather et al 1999 this review by lammerts van bueren and struik 2017 described that head forming crops as cabbage schulte auf m erley et al 2010 and lettuce kerbiriou et al 2014 depend on the prolonged photosynthesis of outer leaves to provide the carbon sources for continued n supply and growth of the photosynthetically less active younger inner leaves in spinach studies conducted by chan navarrete et al 2014 on several cultivars under both low and high n availability in controlled conditions showed that nue was highly correlated with shoot fresh weight shoot dry weight leaf area and root dry weight while there was a moderate negative correlation with specific leaf area and root shoot ratio chlorophyll content showed significant correlation with nue only under high n availability in potato the main factor explaining nue was maturity the late varieties show higher yield and higher nue correlated to a longer growing period and an extended period of maximum leaf canopy and photosynthesis activity ospina et al 2014 in general root performance is relevant for all crops but especially for short cycle vegetable crops that benefit from early below ground growth lammerts van bueren and struik 2017 all the studies suggest that breeding of n efficient cultivars is not only a potential tool to reduce n release to the environment by reducing the necessary n input and reducing the n content remaining in the crop residues but also a strategy to allow crop productivity in farming systems where access to fertilizers is limited ferrante et al 2017 commented that to this aim several strategies should be adopted involving crop management in the short period and genetic improvement in the long one hence breeding should be oriented to increase traits that improve nue under different growing conditions the increasing knowledge about the molecular and physiological bases of a complex trait as nue and the development of innovative emerging molecular technologies for the study of the genome and transcriptome will provide useful tools for supporting the modern breeding programmes 3 3 choice and application of mineral and organic fertilizers much attention is currently going towards improving the sustainable use of mineral fertilizers through the 4r nutrient stewardship reetz et al 2015 bruulsema 2018 that provides a framework for using the right nutrient source applied at the right rate at the right time in the right place the right rate and right time are based on the determination and application of an adequate amount of all limiting nutrients nitrogen in our case to meet plant requirements in relation to yield and quality goals and considering the interactions of crop uptake soil supply environmental risks and field operation logistics as extensively explained in other section of this review 3 3 1 right source the right source of n fertilizers refers to choosing plant available nutrient forms that provide a balanced supply of all essential nutrients that are released in a way that best matches crop demand enhanced efficiency n fertilizers eefs chien et al 2009 snyder 2017 are an example of this approach this term encompasses slow and controlled release n fertilizers nitrification inhibitor treated n fertilizers urease inhibitor treated n fertilizers or products treated with both nitrification and urease inhibitors slow release fertilizers srfs are materials that are slow to enter in solution because of their low solubility and that are converted to plant available n through microbial decomposition and hydrolysis guertal 2009 morgan et al 2009 examples of srfs include urea formaldehyde uf and isobutylenediurea ibdu the primary mechanism of n release in uf is microbial decomposition of the polymer but environmental factors such as soil temperature soil moisture ph and oxygen content all interact with microbial activity the n release from ibdu on the contrary does not depend on microbial activity but the n is made available through hydrolysis at low temperatures given that the n release is accelerated by high soil temperatures and low ph this fertilizer is preferred for cool season application morgan et al 2009 controlled release fertilizers crfs have a release mechanism governed by a water insoluble coating i e sulfur polymer or both sulfur and polymer coatings that limits or controls the rate of water penetration and n release in function of soil temperature and moisture affecting micropore coating simonne and hutchinson 2005 morgan et al 2009 van eerd et al 2018 both srfs and crfs proved to be effective in reducing n leaching in vegetable production systems particularly on sandy soils simonne and hutchinson 2005 hartz and smith 2009 however their use is limited as synchronization of the n release from the fertilizer with varying n demand of the crop is difficult especially in crops with a short growth cycle and a high n demand and as they are more expensive than conventional mineral n fertilizers per unit of n thompson et al 2017 nitrification inhibitors nis are chemical compounds that slow down the conversion of ammonium to nitrate thereby reducing leaching risks of nitrate temperature is a key factor influencing nis efficacy several publications demonstrated that the use of nis improved n fertilizer use efficiency reduced nitrate leaching and decreased n2o emissions ruser and schulz 2015 a meta analysis carried out on 62 peer reviewed publication 1984 2013 with 859 datasets across the globe qiao et al 2015 found that nis application reduced dissolved inorganic n leaching by 48 confidence interval 56 38 moreover the use of nis allows for a reduction of the number of n fertilizer applications pasda et al 2001 and of nitrate concentration in leafy vegetables irigoyen et al 2006 the most commonly used chemical nitrification inhibitors are 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate dmpp and dicyandiamide dcd pasda et al 2001 gilsanz et al 2016 the nitrification inhibition efficacy of dmpp is more dependent on soil type than that of dcd although the efficacy of both inhibitors was lower in more alkaline low organic matter soil guardia et al 2018 in incubation experiments dcd inhibited nitrification from cauliflower residues for 50 days and dmpp for at least 95 days chaves et al 2006 hence especially dmpp shows a potential to reduce nitrate leaching after incorporation of crop residues urease inhibitors uis are chemicals that block the activity of the ubiquitous enzyme urease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonium in soils with high ph or soils that are poorly buffered against ph changes the rapid hydrolysis of urea can result in an accumulation of ammonia rather than ammonium by keeping urea from hydrolyzing urease inhibitors protect against ammonia volatilization so also uis together with nis proved to be effective in increasing yields and nue see meta analysis by abalos et al 2014 typically uis can protect against ammonia loss from surface applied fertilizers for a couple of weeks depending on temperature and moisture conditions the main uis are n n butyl thiophosphoric triamide nbpt and n n propyl thiophosphoric triamide nppt chemical compounds containing urease inhibitor plus nitrification inhibitor are also available snyder 2017 the use of nis and uis may not translate into yield or environmental benefits if weather and soil conditions are not conducive to n loss or when n rates are excessive moreover thompson et al 2017 observed that given the concern of consumers and retailers regarding healthy food attention will need to be paid to ensure that there are no or minimal residues of nis and their degradation products in edible vegetable products the overall effect of eefs is questionable de ruijter et al 2010b examined different types of eefs in various vegetable crops results for eefs were comparable to the use of can calcium ammonium nitrate when applied according to good agricultural practice with use of e g split and banded applications snyder 2017 suggested that the purchase and use of eefs may depend to a great extent on 1 the farmer s cropping system management abilities 2 the agronomic and environmental knowledge of the agricultural retailer and professional crop adviser 3 regional crop and fertilizer economics 4 the soil and water conservation practices also implemented by the farmer on each field 5 the availability and costs of nutrient management technology 6 risks and magnitudes of the dominant environmental n losses and 7 any governmental support or regulatory policies that may affect crop or cropping system choices and or record keeping i e tracking of nutrient performance over time 3 3 2 right place the right placement of nutrients refers to placing the fertilizer close to the growing roots by banding or fertigation in order to maximize absorption and to minimize nutrient losses banding of fertilizers refers to concentrating the fertilizers under or along the plant row of vegetables with usually a wide planting distance the fertilizer may be placed with the seed at planting as a pop up fertilizer or placed under the seed or the transplant as starter fertilizer both pop up and starter fertilizer that are generally low in n and relatively high in p increased early crop growth both root and shoot yield and n use efficiency in carrot cabbage onion lettuce and green bean costigan 1988 stone 1998 burns et al 2010 side dress fertilization on the soil surface in e g cauliflower onion lettuce potato reduced n rates and increased apparent n recovery in comparison with broadcast application burns et al 2010 recently kristensen and stavridou 2017 found that small n fertilizer applications in rocket improved nue through the stimulation of n uptake by deeper roots thus allowing to reduce the amount of fertilizer given in frequent applications or reducing applications given in the late growth phase fertigation i e the agronomic practice in which fertilizers are dissolved in the irrigation water and as such delivered to the root zone usually micro irrigation system is the most effective technique to synchronize n uptake with n availability increase nue and reduce n leaching benincasa et al 2011 farneselli et al 2018 the main advantages of fertigation are the flexibility to split the fertilizer application according to the crop n demand during the entire crop growth cycle localizing n close to the root zone and maintaining relatively low and constant n availability in the soil solution i e all the 4r principles are implemented exhaustive reviews on fertigation management in irrigated vegetable cropping have been published by simonne et al 2017 and incrocci et al 2017 3 3 3 organic fertilizers organic fertilizers are an important source of nitrogen both in conventional and organic vegetable cropping systems and contribute to maintain soil organic matter a recent review by möller 2018 provides detailed information on the effect of organic management on soil fertility and on the composition of several organic amendments currently available to organic farmers organic fertilizers can be either bulky organic materials e g solid animal manures slurries composts digestates based on anaerobic digestion of vegetative biomass or household wastes with a relatively low nutrient concentration commonly used as base dressing or more concentrated commercial organic fertilizers e g feather meal hoof and horn meal meat and bone meal fertilizers derived from plants and plant products processing used to finetune the nutrient supply to the crop requirements solid animal manures and composts are characterized by a relatively high c n ratio 20 30 and therefore a limited n release in the year of application while keratins 20 30 or liquids like vinasse 2 3 or digestates 2 7 showed much higher and fast n availability ifoam 2013 cited by möller 2018 in the mediterranean area compost anaerobic digestate and municipal solid waste gave good yield results in tomato zucchini and lettuce e g montemurro et al 2010 alburquerque et al 2012 some liquid organic fertilizers can also be used for fertigation for example farneselli et al 2018 found that broadcast applications of poultry manure norg 4 c n 10 and by product from a leather factory norg 5 c n 5 at a low n rate of 100 kg ha 1 were inadequate to meet the n requirements of processing tomato in central italy while the by product from a leather factory added as a liquid fertilizer norg 8 c n 3 to the irrigation water at a similar rate showed the same efficacy of the mineral fertigation with higher environmental sustainability the main constraints to the use of organic fertilizers both in conventional and organic vegetable production systems de neve et al 2004 de neve 2017 sambo and nicoletto 2017 möller 2018 can be summarized as follows i the lack of uniformity the bulkiness and instability ii the difficulties in synchronizing n mineralization with crop n demand iii the risk of n losses by volatilization iv the higher cost per unit of nutrients in comparison to mineral fertilizers except for regions with a large manure surplus v national or international legislation prohibiting or limiting their use for example in the eu large manure applications are not allowed due to the limit of 170 kg n ha 1 in nitrate vulnerable zones and the application periods are limited according to each country s action program in some eu countries the use of slurries is forbidden in vegetables the value of organic fertilizers is more than the value of the nutrients in the fertilizer de haan and van geel 2018 give indicative values for the value of the organic matter in slurries of 37 ton cattle slurry and 12 ton pig slurry the use of legume based fertilizers of fresh or silage material may achieve a better synchronization with plant n demand möller 2018 such plant based cut and carry fertilizers were found useful to replace conventional animal based fertilizers sørensen and grevsen 2015 perennial legumes of alfalfa white clover red clover and a grass clover mixture produced 400 500 kg n ha 1 year 1 by two to four harvests per year annual legumes of broad bean lupin and pea produced around 200 kg n ha 1 year 1 and the harvest of seeds resulted in similar amounts a strategy with frequent cuts resulted in cut and carry fertilizers with low c n ratios suitable for precise fast release organic fertilization for vegetable production split dose fertilization of leek was studied by step wise incorporation of white clover after intercropping during the early growth phase of the leek xie et al 2018 leek growth was maintained or increased despite interspecific competition for n between leek and clover the n input from n2 fixation was increased to better match leek n demands and the n retention was improved in the plant soil system compared to full incorporation before leek planting 3 4 other agronomic options in n management 3 4 1 tillage systems soil tillage operations can influence nitrogen cycling in various ways we focus in this review on the effects of controlled traffic farming and reduced and no tillage on crop yield and n dynamics controlled traffic farming ctf where all machinery traffic is restricted to long term permanent lanes as opposed to random traffic farming rtf is a potential management tool to alleviate the problems associated with soil compaction johansen et al 2015 ctf adoption increases soil porosity and water infiltration but did not increase nitrate leaching in vegetables vermeulen and mosquera 2009 conversion to ctf showed positive effects after 2 3 years on vegetable yields root growth and nitrogen availability hefner et al 2019 white cabbage potato beetroot and winter squash yields increased by 27 70 on sandy loam they grew 1 3 25 times more roots under ctf than rtf on sandy loam and coarse sandy soil soil mineral n and potential net n mineralization were equal or higher in ctf while n leaching did not increase the cropping system resilience defined as a similar production level over a couple of years increased for ctf hefner et al 2019 reduced tillage rt and no tillage nt cropping systems have been tested in vegetables with varying results but little is known about the implications for n management from arable farming it is known that reducing tillage intensity changes both crop n demand due to change in yield potential and the supply of n due to changes in net n mineralization and n losses malhi et al 2001 vegetable yields were very much reduced under nt combined with roller crimping of cover crops for weed suppression when compared to bare soil in the usa leavitt et al 2011 in europe the system showed promising results in a mediterranean climate canali et al 2013 but diverse results on yields depending on cover crop species and sufficient n fertilization in denmark the risk of nitrate leaching was suggested to be decreased by nt combined with roller crimping hefner et al 2020 knowledge of rt and nt effects on n dynamics and the applicability in vegetable production in other climates is scarce 3 4 2 organic and conventional farming systems in general conservation and organic farming systems tend to pay more attention to the crop rotation than conventional farming systems where short term economic aspects often prevail over agronomic and environmental considerations unless imposed by regulation this leads to short crop rotations and open nutrient cycles mainly in large scale specialized vegetable farms möller 2018 the differences in n use efficiency and n losses mainly nitrate leaching between organic and conventional agriculture including horticultural crops is still a matter of debate comparisons of nitrate leaching between the systems often come to contradictory conclusions which is not surprising given the enormous diversity in both organic and conventional farming management a main difficulty is the inherent differences in the farming systems which make direct comparison difficult such as management practices affecting e g size of seedlings sowing planting and harvest time use of cover crops fertilizers and amendments and harvest quality criteria which interact with the n management practices another difficulty is the interpretation of results e g nitrate leaching per kg applied n per ha of land or per kg of marketable yield one good example of the limited number of studies of nitrate losses scaled per yield shows lower nitrate leaching losses in organic as compared to conventional arable fields 0 2 0 1 kg n kg 1 n year 1 versus 0 3 0 1 kg n kg 1 n year 1 when calculated across 37 fields in 8 crop rotations benoit et al 2014 a meta analysis seufert et al 2012 showed greater yield reduction for vegetable crops than for cereals and oilseed crops in organic compared to conventional management however the organic systems better maintained or improved soil health indices such as soil fertility and organic matter content scialabba and müller lindenlauf 2010 thorup kristensen et al 2012 showed that plant nutrition and n use efficiency could be optimized in a vegetable crop rotation by replacing n fertilization by the use of non legume and legume cover crops combined with a design of the crop rotation based on rooting depth and n demand thorup kristensen 2006 the change of fertilizer input plant cover and rotation design turned out to be more important to secure high yields and low nitrate leaching than if the farming practice was conventional or organic the yield across all crops in rotation was reduced to 82 in organic compared to conventional systems calculated per hectare of cropped land while mineral n contents in 1 2 m soil depth were 74 and 61 kg n ha 1 in the conventional and organic systems respectively without cover crops and 22 kg n ha 1 in the organic systems with cover crops 3 4 3 biostimulants plant biostimulants have been included among the tools that may have potential in sustainable n fertilization management de pascale et al 2017 2018 there is absence of a biostimulant definition universally accepted by the regulatory bodies colla and rouphael 2015 in a recent review the following definition was proposed a plant biostimulant is any substance or microorganism applied to plants with the aim to enhance nutrition efficiency abiotic stress tolerance and or crop quality traits regardless of its nutrients content by extension plant biostimulants also designate commercial products containing mixtures of such substances and or microorganisms du jardin 2015 the following main categories of plant biostimulants were suggested i humic and fulvic acids ii protein hydrolysates and other n containing compounds iii seaweed extracts and botanicals iv chitosan and other biopolymers v inorganic compounds vi beneficial fungi vii beneficial bacteria different researches demonstrated a significant effect on plant nitrogen uptake in general calvo et al 2014 bulgari et al 2015 protein hydrolysates increased n use efficiency in greenhouse spinach carillo et al 2019 and rocket di mola et al 2019 while humic acids improved yield in field grown onion kandil et al 2013 however more research is needed to deepen knowledge of the mode of action of biostimulants to improve nutrient availability and uptake de pascale et al 2017 and very importantly to quantify the actual potential to contribute to a sustainable n management of cropping systems 3 4 4 grafting grafting is a cultural technique that consists in the union by different methods i e cleft tongue approach grafting hole insertion tube or pine grafting of a rootstock and a scion of two different species or of two different cultivars of the same species in vegetable crops grafting is practiced worldwide from decades mainly in cucurbitaceae melon watermelon and cucumber and solanaceae tomato eggplant pepper species to provide tolerance to biotic stress e g soil borne fungi virus bacterial diseases and abiotic stresses e g cold salinity drought heavy metal toxicity to increase plant vigor to influence sex expression to improve quality traits and overall considered to increase yield in greenhouse or open field crops kiriacou et al 2017 rouphael et al 2018 several studies showing enhanced n use efficiency of grafted plants e g in melon colla et al 2010 tomato djidonou et al 2013 and pepper ropokis et al 2019 which indicates that grafting can contribute to the sustainable n management in vegetable production systems simonne et al 2017 de pascale et al 2018 all researchers pointed out that the impact of grafting depended not merely on the rootstock genotype but on the rootstock scion combination 4 final considerations vegetable production systems are typically intensive cropping systems with high n input and high risk of n leaching specific problems of n management in vegetables include the often large n mineralization potential of soils and the high n release of incorporated vegetable crop residues which complicates the synchronization between n supply and crop n demand the most crucial factor is the correct quantification of the different n balance components in the soil crop atmosphere continuum by using established estimation methods for these components and possibly monitoring tools of the crop n status throughout the growing season in addition the correct choice of n fertilizer type timing and application method can further increase n use efficiency and reduce n losses notably by using fertigation techniques however further improvements in n use efficiency should not only be limited to the further refinement of n fertilizer advices and more precise fertilization techniques but also include in a wider systems approach this would mean that more attention should go to the overall design of the crop rotation e g a judicious choice of crops in the rotation that are complementary with respect to n demand and n uptake efficiency also including non vegetables also the use of less common techniques intercropping reduced tillage controlled traffic farming should further be explored for the potential to increase n use efficiency however this will need to be reconciled with a number of economic constraints finally the success of all these tools will crucially depend on the adoption rate by farmers there is therefore also a need to include all these aspects in user friendly decision support systems that can be directly implemented in farmers practice funding this research did not
