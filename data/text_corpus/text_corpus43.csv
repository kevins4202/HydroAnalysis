215,since conventional in situ measurements of suspended sediments in the river system are labor intensive and time consuming remote sensing approaches using multi or hyper spectral cameras have widely been applied to obtain high resolution suspended sediment concentration ssc distributions in rivers and streams however in nature the properties of heterogeneous sediment such as the mineral content and particle size distribution induce a strong variability in the optical images of the suspended sediments for this reason the robust estimation of the suspended sediment using the remote sensing technique is challenging due to the optical variability of the suspended sediment thus it is necessary to deal with this variability of the optical images to improve the accuracy of remote sensing based ssc measurements and extend them to the global estimator in this study a robust machine learning ml model for ssc estimation based on hyperspectral images was developed by considering the optical variability of the suspended sediment in water bodies a series of field scale tracer experiments were conducted in open channels with three different sediment types in order to obtain both the ssc using laser diffraction sensors and hyperspectral images using a uav camera the experimental results showed that the optical characteristics of ssc were critically heterogeneous due to the properties of the sediment using these experimental dataset four explicit regression models and two implicit ml regression models were developed and compared to select an optimal estimator consequently a support vector regression svr model using relevant spectral bands in a wide wavelength range yielded the most accurate results with an r2 of 0 90 for the whole dataset however linear regression models which could not consider various spectral bands and the nonlinear effect of the optical variability of ssc were limited in their ability to retrieve ssc from hyperspectral images furthermore the svr model accurately reproduced the spatio temporal ssc distributions in all study cases including low visibility suspended sediments thus successfully resolved the optical variability of ssc with widely selected spectral bands from recursive feature elimination rfe the svr model also successfully retrieved the ssc distribution in uncalibrated rivers the results of this study demonstrated that the proposed ml regression models based on the hyperspectral imagery achieved a significant improvement in ssc estimation in terms of accuracy and global applicability keywords

suspended sediment exert a significant impact on river morphology and the ecosystem while also affecting flow and pollutant transport behaviors derakhshannia et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 leite ribeiro et al 2012 ostad ali askari et al 2018 umar et al 2018 to improve our understanding of the suspended sediment transport mechanisms in riverine systems high resolution spatio temporal data are required for the analysis of the complex interactions between suspended sediments and environmental factors ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 vercruysse et al 2017 in the conventional method observation of the suspended sediment concentration ssc generally relies on in situ measurements obtained by sampling of the river water this in situ measurement approach is extremely labor intensive and time consuming and it provides low resolution temporal data at discrete spatial points ostad ali askar et al 2018 qu et al 2016 in recent years laser diffraction based optical sensors have frequently been utilized to obtain high resolution temporal ssc data based on its high measurement frequency haun et al 2013 lokhov et al 2020 pedocchi and garcía 2006 pomázi and baranya 2020 however this method also required high labor cost to produce high resolution spatial data since only point measurement is available pomázi and baranya 2020 rai and kumar 2015 as an alternative to these point based measurement methods acoustics based ssc measurement using adcp has been frequently applied which can obtain cross sectional distribution of suspended sediment simmons et al 2020 son et al 2021 wosiacki et al 2021 despite the distinct advantage over other methods adcp has a limitation in differentiating the change between ssc and particle size distribution psd since single or multi frequencies are able to be used in adcp aggarwal et al 2011 for this reason the errors increase with variations in psd and it is appropriate in a limited psd range depending on a specific frequency in adcp thorne and hanes 2002 thorne and hurther 2014 with the recent advances in image processing techniques numerous studies have used remote sensing approaches to retrieve high resolution spatial data on the quality of large bodies of water from multispectral or hyperspectral satellite images arisanty and nur saputra 2017 caballero et al 2018 dekker et al 2001 dethier et al 2020 ismail et al 2019 kabir and ahmari 2020 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2020 pirnazar et al 2018 ross et al 2019 topp et al 2020 umar et al 2018 the remote sensing ssc measurement approach used in aquatic environments is based on the optical characteristics of sunlight which is strongly absorbed by water by sensing the sunlight intensity the spectral signals of solar radiation at visible vis and near infrared nir wavelengths can be captured by multispectral or hyperspectral cameras dethier et al 2020 fonstad and marcus 2005 kwon et al 2020 ostad ali askari et al 2017b wei et al 2019 these spectral signals of solar radiation are recorded as the radiance of discrete spectral bands with respect to wavelength to be more specific the radiance in the water environment can be divided into four sub radiance categories the radiance reflected from the river bed lb the back scattered radiance from the water body lc the radiance reflected from the interface between the atmosphere and the water body ls and the path radiance of the atmosphere lp baek et al 2019 golian et al 2020 legleiter et al 2004 niroumand jadidi et al 2018 ostad ali askari et al 2020 vercruysse et al 2017 among these four sub radiances the ssc is most highly sensitive to lc which is backscattered by the particles in the water column therefore lc is higher in a turbid water body with a high concentration of suspended sediments than a pure water body in addition this optical phenomenon can be observed in the nir region which has longer wavelengths than the vis region so many previous studies used the nir band to measure ssc even though the nir band cannot fully explain the optical characteristics of ssc bhargava and mariam 1991 chen et al 1991 novo et al 1989 to address this problem recent studies considered both the vis and nir regions to determine the most relevant spectral band that best represents ssc based on the correlation between ssc and the radiance of those bands doxaran et al 2003 espinoza villar et al 2013 islam et al 2001 liu et al 2017 ma and dai 2005 montanher et al 2014 ostad ali askari et al 2019 pereira et al 2019 schiebe et al 1992 shen et al 2010 talebmorad et al 2021 topliss et al 1990 vanani et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2009a wang et al 2009b liu et al 2017 developed exponential and power law equations for ssc retrievals using reflectance of single band from multispectral satellite image in lake this study suggested the optimal equation and spectral band by comparing two types of equation and each of the nine spectral bands in the multispectral image as an independent variable wang et al 2017 proposed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformed red band and nir band using satellite image in estuaries and coasts espinoza villar 2013 also used the ratio of red band and nir as an independent variable of a power law equation to map the ssc distribution in large rivers montanher et al 2014 compared the reflectance of single band and the ratio of reflectance of the spectral bands as an independent input variable for the linear regression model to estimate the ssc in rivers additionally machine learning approaches were also proposed to improve the accuracy of the regression model with additional spectral bands effectively resolving the nonlinearity between the input spectral values and the target ssc values peterson et al 2018 umar et al 2018 most previous remote sensing studies were conducted in marine and coastal environments because it is possible to acquire a sufficient amount of relevant spatial data from satellite images and the effect of bottom reflectance is less pronounced in marine and coastal areas due to the relative narrowness of rivers remote sensing based ssc measurements have rarely been applied to riverine systems pham et al 2018 although the recently launched sentinel 2 and sentinel 3 satellites have improved the spatial resolution of available images by up to 5 10 m coarse spectral resolution which has a bandwidth of 60 80 nm is still a crucial shortcoming of satellite based remote sensing for the measurement of water quality and ssc in rivers kwon et al 2020 wei et al 2019 recently to overcome this limitation uav unmanned aerial vehicle based hyperspectral remote sensing has been carried out to measure water depth algal blooms and cyanobacteria concentration with higher spatio temporal resolution and a narrower spectral band width than provided by multispectral sensors kwon et al 2020 legleiter et al 2019 legleiter and harrison 2019 ostad ali askari et al 2017a pyo et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2021 however the amount of research on hyperspectral measurement of ssc in rivers is currently insufficient due to the regional characteristics of suspended sediment while other targets in rivers are easier to measure dethier et al 2020 gebreslassie et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 salehi hafshejani et al 2019 in this respect previous studies mainly focused on improving the prediction accuracy in the specific study areas where regression equations had been built and the main wavelengths of the spectral bands involved in the regression equations were spread over a rather wide range pereira et al 2019 this regionality of previous research occurred because the optical characteristics of suspended sediment vary according to the particle size mineral content and sediment color of the suspended sediment these variables are collectively referred to as the optical variability of suspended sediment kabir and ahmari 2020 therefore several empirical and semi empirical models have been developed to account for the optical variability of suspended sediment gebreslassie et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 qu et al 2016 a semi empirical model spectral mixing analysis sma showed relatively accurate performance regardless of the optical variability from sediment color and particle size distribution gebreslassie et al 2020 qu et al 2016 this model can be developed from laboratory analysis to obtain the individual spectrum of constituents including clean water and dry sediment then the spectral mixing abundance of each constituent can be estimated by decomposing the measured spectrum of river waters based on sma the spectral mixing abundance is finally used as the independent variable of the ssc regression model however this study has limitations in extending to the spatial mapping of ssc since it can be validated and applied only at the points where river water is sampled likewise a number of suspended sediment samples are required to represent the sediment characteristics of the target river it is also difficult to consider the suspended sediment to be a single constituent if the sediment properties have a bimodal distribution of particle size or varied mineral contents to develop an empirical model kabir and ahmari 2020 established log linear regression equations according to sediment color using an rgb camera based on laboratory experiments they developed practical and accurate models and demonstrated the necessity of classification for the ssc estimator according to suspended sediment variability nevertheless their model showed limitations in that the amount of available data was inadequate and the performance in the field was relatively poor due to the discrepancy between the particle size distributions psds of the suspended sediment samples used in model development and application therefore there have been efforts to improve the accuracy of ssc estimation by developing a model that can consider the optical variability however there are no studies that have clearly identified the causes of variability in the optical images few models that considered the optical variability had limitations in applying them globally consequently analysis of the optical variability of the suspended sediment is the most important task to achieve the robustly successful estimation of ssc from remote sensing technique the key objective in this study was maximizing the accuracy of the mapping of ssc via remote sensing and accomplishing global application of models while understanding the confounding factors of optical variability as a significant uncertainty cause to achieve this objective based on the exploration of the effect of suspended sediment properties with optical variability on hyperspectral images we developed a robust empirical model for remote sensed ssc in rivers in specific we first obtained both in situ measured ssc using a laser diffraction sensor and remotely sensed hyperspectral images by the uav camera this was done by conducting tracer tests with three types of sediments in a field scale open channel then we explored the impact of the optical variability of the suspended sediment according to sediment properties we then developed a robust machine learning ml based regression model of the suspended sediment using recursive feature elimination rfe and compared the results with those of other regression models finally we retrieved the spatio temporal map of ssc even for low visibility suspended sediment from hyperspectral images and analyzed the influence of sediment properties on the hyperspectral image based estimation of ssc in addition the global applicability of the proposed model was assessed in an uncalibrated region using spectral data from the natural rivers with shallow depth 2 experiments 2 1 experimental set up 2 1 1 tracer experiments as mentioned above the optical properties of suspended sediment vary with the mineral content and particle size distribution of the sediment dethier et al 2020 qu et al 2016 this study investigated the effect of such optical variability on the spectral properties of suspended sediment for this purpose tracer tests were conducted with three types of sediment in order to collect a dataset containing both hyperspectral images and in situ measured ssc values given various sediment characteristics the sediment tracers used in the experiment consisted of quartz sand yellow loess and a mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess the experiments were conducted in the river experimental center rec of the korea institute of civil engineering and building technology kict located at andong south korea as shown in fig 1 a the experiments were performed in a straight channel with a river scale trapezoidal section with a length of 500 m top width of 11 m depth of 2 m and side slope of 1 2 the channel bed consists of natural sand and the side bank consists of concrete blocks the water used in the experiments was pumped in from the nakdong river which is located near the rec fig 1 b shows the tracer injection point and measurement section in the experimental channel the injection point was located at the center of the upstream bridge at this point using a mixer sediment solution diluted in river water was injected in a completely mixed state as shown in fig 1 c it was injected underwater to minimize the effect of the drop in momentum of the initial sediment tracer injection as shown in fig 1 d at the measurement section two different measurements were taken to obtain both hyperspectral images and ssc values first hyperspectral images were taken at two locations in front of and behind the bridge via different techniques hyperspectral images were taken in front of the bridge in order to extract the ground based hyperspectral spectrum of the corresponding pixels with the in situ sensor to minimize the effect of the atmosphere on the hyperspectral images a push room line scan type hyperspectral camera was installed at the center of the bridge 1 85 m above the water surface using a dji ronin 3 axis handheld gimbal for the images taken behind the bridge spatial information including the width of the channel was obtained using a uav mounted hyperspectral camera these images were used to retrieve the spatio temporal distribution of suspended sediment the hyperspectral camera used in this study a microhsi 410 shark is a push broom type sensor with a size of 13 6 8 7 7 0 cm and a weight of 680 g this sensor covers the 400 1000 nm spectral range with 150 spectral bands and 682 spatial pixels per line this sensor spatially records the light entering through the prism by arranging multiple optical sensors linearly fowler 2014 since hyperspectral images of transverse lines over time were acquired by this sensor the hyperspectral spectrum line was captured continuously as the water flowed while the sensor was fixed at the measurement section accordingly the dimensions of the hyperspectral images obtained in this experiment were width y time t wavelength λ for the in situ ssc measurement a sequoia scientific lisst 200x which measures particle size using light scattering based on underwater laser diffraction was used to measure the sediment concentration particle size distribution psd and temperature the lisst 200x used in this study is capable of measuring a sufficient range of psd and ssc the psd range consists of 36 bins that are distributed from 1 to 500 μm in logarithmic increments while the range of ssc is from 0 5 to 700 ppm this sensor was installed at the iron rod connected to the center of the bridge to measure the temporal concentration of suspended sediment as shown in fig 1d to obtain the concentration near both the water surface and the bed two lisst 200x devices were deployed at fixed depths of 0 675 and 0 225 m from the bed which was 0 75 and 0 25 times the water depth the sampling rate of both sensors was set to 0 67 hz in this study three cases were examined with three different sediment tracer types quartz sand yellow loess and the quartz sand and yellow loess mixture as shown in fig 1 e and table 1 all sediment used for injection was first passed through a 0 2 mm filter using a stainless steel sieve to remove large particles the solution of sediment and river water that was injected had the same volume in all cases the hydraulic data discharge mean velocity and water depth were obtained using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the sontek river surveyor s5 at the measurement section all experimental cases were carried out under the same hydraulic conditions which are summarized in table 1 2 1 2 field experiment in order to validate the trained model with a completely independent dataset we conducted a field experiment in the hwang river tributary to the nakdong rivers in south korea the hwang river has a total length of 107 6 km and its total river basin area is 1329 km2 shin and julien 2010 the experimental reach was located 450 m upstream of the confluence of the nakdong river and the hwang river and its length was 250 m as shown in fig 2 a the experiment was conducted on march 30 2021 at this time the water depth condition of the experimental site was 0 6 2 6 m but most of the area was deeper than the condition of the field scale experiment in section 2 1 1 during this experiment the ssc was measured at 49 monitoring points using a lisst 200x attached to the side of a hydroboard as shown in fig 2 b additional hydraulic data such as water depth and vertical flow velocity profile were obtained using the adcp river surveyor m9 by sontek usa and gps installed on the hydroboard kwak et al 2020 son et al 2021 the hyperspectral images were simultaneously acquired using the same uav platform used for the tracer experiment in the field scale channels while the hyperspectral images were acquired by hovering the drone in the field scale experiment we manipulated the uav to scan in the river width direction to cover the entire target area in the field experiments for this reason several flight strips were designed and the separately acquired hyperspectral images according to their strips were integrated to obtain the hyperspectral images covering a large area 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 analysis of suspended sediment data in this study the lisst 200x was used to measure particle size psd and ssc in the experiment the background turbidity was high enough to neglect the effect of bottom reflectance since the water used in the experiment was pumped in from the nakdong river which has high turbidity after a flood a sample of background water was taken using a horizontal van dorn water sampler this sample was moved to the laboratory and dried to measure the psd the psd was measured using both the hydrometer test and the lisst 200x the psds measured by the two methods were similar and silt of size ranging from 0 004 to 0 062 mm accounted for approximately 50 of total psd as shown in fig 3 a nevertheless the psds from the two methods showed a slightly different percentage of fine particulate matter under 0 004 mm which may introduce some uncertainty into this study since the background psd and the particle size of the sediment tracer in each case were under 0 2 mm psd values ranging from 0 001 to 0 2 mm were considered in this study therefore the range of psd in this study included four classes of sediment according to particle size fine sand range 125 200 μm very fine sand range 62 125 μm silt range 4 62 μm and clay 1 4 μm merten et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the density of the used quartz sand and yellow loess was estimated from the volume concentration measured by lisst 200x and the weight concentration from the dry weight of each sediment in this procedure distilled water was placed in a 1 l beaker and the amount of the sample was increased while measuring by lisst 200x the full path flow through chamber was utilized to circulate water and pass through the lisst 200x each concentration was measured for 1 min and mean concentration was used to estimate the density of each sediment the validation curve with lisst 200x and the estimated density of each sediment were shown in fig 3 b and c as a result the volume concentration measured by lisst 200x and weight concentration resulted in a high r2 value it was confirmed that both the known psd and ssc were in reasonable agreement with this instrument the psd at the maximum concentration in each case and in the background water are illustrated in figs 3 5 as shown in fig 4 the proportion of sand increased significantly near both the water surface and the river bed after the injection of quartz sand case 1 compared to the background water in which clay and silt were dominant the relative frequency of sand was higher near the river bed than near the water surface because quartz sand tends to settle to the bottom of a body of water as shown in fig 5 in case of yellow loess case 2 the concentration of particles with the size of silt and very fine sand increased at the maximum overall particle concentration however in this case the variations in concentration near the water surface and river bed were similar which implies that the settling velocity was not very high as shown in fig 6 for the mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess case 3 the relative frequency of silt and fine sand increased similar to the yellow loess case case 2 the relative frequency of fine sand increased to a greater extent than in case 2 due to the effect of quartz sand similarly the relative frequency of fine sand at the sampling depth of 0 25h was greater than the relative frequency of fine sand at the sampling depth of 0 75h due to the settling property of quartz sand breakthrough curves btcs of ssc measured at 0 75h and 0 25h of the three experimental cases are plotted in fig 7 as shown in the figure the ssc for case 1 were lower than those of case 2 even though the same amount of mass was discharged at the injection point in all three cases this is because due to the high fall velocity the quartz sand in case 1 settled down to the channel bed faster than the yellow loess in case 2 when it was transported downstream of the injection point in the channel the suspended sediment cloud images captured by the rgb camera fig 1 e also clearly reveal this difference the suspended sediment cloud of quartz sand in case 1 is less vivid than the cloud of yellow loess in case 2 a comparison of two btcs of quartz sand in case 1 shown in fig 7 a also revealed that the concentration measured near the bed 0 25 h was greater than the concentration measured near the water surface 0 75 h the mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess case 3 showed intermediate behavior between the behavior in cases 1 and 2 as shown in fig 7 the time to peak concentration and time to centroid of btc were almost the same in all three cases furthermore the tails of the btcs in all three cases were not persistent because the storage effects due to the boundary irregularities in the prismatic straight channel were not significant 2 2 2 hyperspectral image analysis from all of the acquired raw hyperspectral images radiometric correction was first conducted to convert digital number dn which stores the radiance as an integer on the hyperspectral camera to relative reflectance since the radiance recorded in the hyperspectral camera did not coincide with the actual energy emitted or reflected by the surface due to the azimuth angle and elevation of the sun a radiometric correction process using calibration tarps which provides reference reflectance values was used to enhance the interpretability and quality of the hyperspectral data booysen et al 2020 jakob et al 2017 in this study calibration tarps offering lambertian reflectance of 0 84 0 56 0 24 and 0 03 were used the lambertian reflectance denotes the isotropic reflected light intensity which serves as a reference for radiometric correction regardless of the camera angle baek et al 2019 the reference reflectance values were obtained before each experiment by placing the tarp on a flat plate from the reference values the radiance was normalized to relative reflectance using eq 1 1 r λ g a i n l λ o f f s e t where r λ is relative reflectance and l λ w m2 sr is radiance hyperspectral images usually include noise which can arise from sensor sensitivity sun glint and solar conditions e g cloud coverage mishra et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 also in a river measurement suspended substances or bubbles on the surface of the water significantly increase the ls λ which prevents lc λ the back scattered radiance from the water body from reaching the sensor thus in this study the median filter which replaces the noise with the median value of a moving window was used to minimize the noise in both the spatial and the spectral domains the median filter was employed by a 4 point 20 cm window with a length of approximately 2 of stream width since a large window induces the blurring effect in this study the median filter was employed using median filter function in the scipy library in python 3 7 from the preprocessed ground based hyperspectral images the five central pixels corresponding to the in situ sensor location were extracted and averaged to be analyzed with the measured ssc by applying the median filter to a hyperspectral spectrum where a bubble passed on the water surface the high noise value was attenuated and the spectrum was smoothed overall fig 8 shows the spectral reflectance along the entire measured wavelength range 400 1000 nm according to ssc variation for each case in the spectral profiles of all sediment types the highest reflectance values appeared near red wavelengths 650 nm also apparent variation due to an increase in ssc was observed near the red 650 nm and red nir 750 nm wavelengths these wavelengths were also identified as sensitive ranges in previous studies doxaran et al 2003 gebreslassie et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 as shown in the figure although the spectral profiles of all sediment types had similar tendencies the reflectance values over 550 nm differed at the same ssc according to sediment type for this reason the optical variability of sediment type caused uncertainty in the remotely sensed estimation of ssc in order to evaluate the effect of certain properties of suspended sediment sediment type psd sampling depth and temperature on the hyperspectral spectrum principal component analysis pca was applied to the acquired hyperspectral images the hyperspectral image was a high dimensional dataset with vast spectral information and thus it was difficult to directly investigate the relation between properties of suspended sediment and corresponding spectral band values in the hyperspectral spectrum in this respect pca could reduce the hyperspectral images with 150 spectral bands into a few orthogonally transformed variables which retained the maximum variation of the original data this dimensional reduction technique has been widely used for feature extraction of hyperspectral images in various fields kim et al 2020 qin et al 2013 sváb et al 2005 whetton et al 2017 in this study we compared the condensed spectral characteristics of hyperspectral images acquired by pca to the properties of suspended sediment to identify the dominant properties each point in fig 9 represents a hyperspectral spectrum corresponding to the in situ measured ssc projected into principal component pc 1 and pc 2 defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix these two components showed that 80 of pc 1 and 16 of pc 2 of variance were retained in the space defined by pc 1 and pc 2 there was little difference in the reflectance characteristics of each case in background water however as pc 1 increased each case changed in a different direction and the cases were clearly distinguished from each other pc 1 showed a strong correlation with ssc as noted in table 2 which indicates that the spectral characteristics of the three types of sediments differed moreover the lower the settling velocity and visibility the more parallel the spectrum data was with the pc 1 axis thus if pc 2 is less affected the spectral characteristics are more related to ssc in this study pca was also applied to spatial hyperspectral images acquired by the drone fig 10 shows the original rgb pc 1 and pc 2 images as shown in this figure pc 1 successfully captured the distribution of suspended sediment in all cases not only cases 2 and 3 with high visibility even in the rgb image but also case 1 with low visibility can be observed in the pc 1 image hence the correlation between pc 1 which implies the optical characteristics of the hyperspectral spectrum and the properties of suspended sediment was calculated table 2 referring to table 2 ssc showed a high correlation with pc 1 and the fine sand and d50 also showed a strong positive correlation with pc 1 in the aspect of psd such correlations mean that the larger the concentration and the more large particles the stronger the lc reaching the hyperspectral sensor thus this result implies that reflectance at the same ssc can differ according to the psd the same result was also reported by koestner et al 2020 who found that the larger the particles the stronger the back scattering in the water body on the other hand despite the large particle size of quartz sand the reflectance value was lower than that of yellow loess due to its high settling velocity and the invisibility of the mineral 3 model development 3 1 index based regression models in order to retrieve the ssc using the regression approach with hyperspectral images we employed optimal band ratio analysis obra based linear regression lr and symbolic regression sr as explicit regression approaches obra the most popular algorithm for retrieval of water depth and water quality parameters uses the ratio of spectral bands to isolate the lc λ back scattered by the suspended sediment in water bodies legleiter et al 2019 2004 legleiter and harrison 2019 niroumand jadidi et al 2020 2019 2018 the optimal band ratio in obra was determined by calculating the band ratio according to all pairs of bands λ1 λ2 and yields the highest accuracy of regression of ssc on band ratio in this study the log transformed single band ratio eq 2 and normalized difference ratio eq 3 were used as the lr and sr input variables respectively 2 x ln r λ 1 r λ 2 3 x ln r λ 1 r λ 2 r λ 1 r λ 2 on the other hand the relationship between hyperspectral radiance and ssc in the open channel flows is complicated since the radiance of ssc is influenced by many factors such as the existence of various types of substrate in the water varying water depth according to discharge and surface scattering effect of glinting sunlight thus in this study nonlinear regression was additionally employed to represent the optical complexity in shallow open channel waters baek et al 2019 binding et al 2005 fraser 1998 legleiter and harrison 2019 schiebe et al 1992 sr was chosen from various nonlinear regression approaches sr does not require the fixed functional form as prior knowledge since it aims to identify the optimal functional form using an evolutionary optimization algorithm the genetic algorithm ga hristov et al 2020 searson et al 2010 weng et al 2019 in the sr optimization process the functional form was continuously evolved through the operators in ga such as mutation recombination and selection until the mean squared error mse reached the termination criteria the input variable was selected in the same manner as the lr these are the two types of optimal band ratio with the forms shown in eqs 2 and 3 in this study only simple operators x x ln x were selected to avoid overcomplicating the functional form and overfitting the sr was implemented using the gplearn library in python 3 7 3 2 machine learning ml regression models in this study among various ml based regression models random forest rf and support vector regression svr were employed and compared to the band ratio based explicit regression models these two ml models which are the most popular ml based regression models show superior performance when the given dataset is highly nonlinear and complicated due to high dimensionality choi and seo 2018 kwon et al 2021 thus unlike the explicit regression which makes the equation more complex and causes overfitting in the presence of many variables the ml models have an advantage in analyzing high dimensional data like hyperspectral images in this respect a wide range of spectral information can be considered in these models and thus we developed rf and svr models to predict the ssc using reflectance values of several spectral bands in a wide range of wavelengths rf is an ensemble decision tree model that minimizes the variance of predictions from a single decision tree breiman 2001 with respect to the structure of rf each decision tree in rf divides the space of the input variable into multiple hierarchies according to the value of the output variable based on the tree structure specifically this model selects samples and variables randomly then divides the input variable into each node of decision trees according to the value of the output variable in this study the sample was generated by bootstrap sampling with random replacement in the bagging process breiman 1996 in the training process of this model the split for each node was determined by maximizing the reduction in overall error in nodes the error was estimated by mean square error mse when the decision tree was used for regression as given in eq 4 4 m s e 1 n σ y i y i 2 where n is a number of the dataset yi is the in situ measured ssc y i was estimated ssc by hsi based on these criteria the casual relationship between input and output variables can be known through the constructed model structure of rf svr was proposed by vapnik et al 1997 and extended to a regression problem through application of a support vector machine svm which is a machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification problems svr has the advantage of finding a globally optimal solution because it uses convex optimization to generate a function for the relationship between data inputs and outputs this yields more accurate prediction results than other ml algorithms when the amount of available data is insufficient chi et al 2008 pal and foody 2010 in this study the relationship between ssc and the reflectance value which is defined by eq 4 was derived by solving the optimization problem with eq 5 as the objective function and eq 6 as the constraint to solve for the f xij that is distributed within one deviation

spectral bands for ssc recursive feature elimination rfe a thorough feature selection method based on model performance was employed guyon et al 2002 rfe eliminated the least important band according to the particular feature importance criteria of each model this algorithm first trained the model using all of the spectral bands in the hyperspectral image it then repeatedly removed any redundant bands until the performance of the continuously trained model was reduced the remaining bands were finally selected as the relevant spectral bands for ssc the root mean square error rmse eq 7 was adopted as the performance criteria with 5 fold cross validation at each step to reduce bias 7 r m s e 1 n i y i y i 2 where yi is the in situ measured ssc and y i is the remotely sensed ssc in rfe the two suggested ml models used the different feature importance criteria to eliminate irrelevant bands in the rf model the mean decrease impurity was used the impurity was estimated by the normalized total reduction of mse by each variable eq 8 of the decision trees which determined the splitting variables and the split nodes in the decision trees biau and scornet 2016 for each spectral band i in the spectrum the band importance i averaged n of decision trees in rf was calculated as 8 i i n δ m s e i n where k represents the number of target values and p m k is the proportion of the kth target values in node m in case of the svr model the weight coefficient wi in eq 4 indicates the effect of the reflectance value of the ith band on the prediction using the variable importance criteria of the rf and svr models the optimal band subsets selected by rfe served as the input variables for each model 4 evaluation of regression models 4 1 obra based explicit models as explicit regression models the obra based lr and sr were applied to three individual cases and the entire dataset that combined all three cases first obra was implemented with the single band ratio to identify the optimal bands by using all data in each case without splitting the data into training and testing datasets fig 11 a shows that the wavelengths of the selected optimal bands for case 1 quartz sand were near the red part of the spectrum 582 93 and 663 02 nm this was one of the sensitive bands to ssc as shown in fig 7a the yellow loess was regressed by the red edge and nir bands 703 06 and 883 25 with the highest value of r2 as shown in fig 11 b fig 11 c shows that the wavelengths of the selected optimal bands for the mixture ranged between red and red edge 747 11 and 703 06 nm given these results the obra based lr model with the single band ratio selected different spectral bands according to sediment type which implies that different types of suspended sediment have spectrally unique characteristics as demonstrated by the pc analysis in terms of accuracy even though the lr model showed an r2 of over 0 80 for cases 2 and 3 it showed relatively poor performance for case 1 with an r2 of 0 57 when it was applied to the combined dataset from all three cases obra based lr showed an r2 of 0 75 with optimal bands in the nir range 791 15 and 855 22 nm as shown in fig 11 d which means that the effect of the yellow loess data was more dominant than that of quartz sand these results indicate that the obra based lr model is limited in its ability to retrieve the characteristics of suspended sediment with a high settling property and low visibility like quartz sand to overcome this limitation we implemented two other approaches the obra based lr approach with a normalized difference ratio eq 3 and sr as described in the previous section these two approaches were applied only to the whole dataset which was split into 80 training data and 20 testing data the train test split function in the scikit learn package in python was utilized to split the datasets randomly validation of the trained regression models was carried out using the test dataset to measure the quantitative error of each model r2 the coefficient of determination rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape were utilized 9 r 2 1 i y i y i 2 i y i y 2 10 m a p e 1 n i y i y i y i 100 the obra model selected the optimal bands for the normalized difference ratio eq 3 the wavelengths of the spectral bands selected by obra and the relevant formulas are listed in table 3 sr was also employed with both the single band ratio and normalized difference ratio the same bands selected by obra were used as the optimal bands for sr from these derived formulas the four models were validated using the test dataset and the results are plotted in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 a lr and sr based on the single band ratio yielded similar results lr 1 underestimated the values at high concentrations while sr 1 provided slightly better predictions for high concentrations and showed a lower mape than lr 1 according to fig 12 b sr 2 showed the best performance for the prediction of high concentrations among obra based models lr 2 underestimated the results at high concentrations similar to lr 1 this tendency of linear models to underestimate the results at high concentrations was also reported in previous studies that obtained the concentration of fluorescent tracer and water depth based on remote sensing in shallow water baek et al 2019 legleiter and harrison 2019 these results demonstrate that the nonlinear models can more accurately retrieve the ssc using the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment compared to the linear models also the normalized difference ratio was more appropriate for the independent variable of nonlinear models than the single band ratio 4 2 implicit regression models in order to build the rf and svr models by learning the relevant spectral bands the optimal bands were selected in the 400 nm to 1000 nm wavelength for each model using rfe fig 13 shows the number of bands selected by rfe for each model rf selected 62 bands with the lowest rmse while svr selected 120 bands in terms of the wavelength of the selected bands the wavelength frequency selected by each model is presented in fig 14 the rf model identified particularly important wavelength ranges violet 400 440 nm red 640 680 nm and swir 920 960 nm among these ranges the red band was the only one that overlapped with the spectral bands indicating a high correlation with obra based lr it can be seen that rf additionally selected spectral bands with low variability according to sediment type on the other hand in svr the wavelength of the selected band was evenly distributed throughout the spectrum except violet 400 420 nm this result shows that the svr model is powerful in that high dimensional input data becomes simpler in the feature space as demonstrated in previous studies on svr kwon et al 2021 raghavendra and deka 2014 yao et al 2008 thus for svr the highest accuracy was obtained when 120 of the 150 spectral bands were used as shown in fig 13 after band selection by rfe the rf and svr models were trained and validated using the same dataset that was used for lr and sr the validation results are plotted in fig 15 which shows that the implicit regression models rf and svr yielded higher accuracy than the explicit regression models lr and sr fig 12 especially in terms of mape among the two implicit regression models svr showed better performance with r2 of 0 90 rmse of 17 07 ppm and mape of 14 18 while rf showed r2 of 0 79 and rmse of 25 37 ppm these results demonstrate that the svr model was the most accurate model for retrieval of ssc using hyperspectral images due to its outstanding performance in simplification of high dimensional data consequently the svr model was selected as the optimal model in this study fig 16 depicts a comparison of the retrieved btcs of ssc by the selected svr model with the in situ measured btcs this figure demonstrates that the estimated ssc from both the training and test datasets yielded good agreement with the in situ measured ssc additionally different segments of the retrieved btcs were assessed rising limb falling limb and tail choi et al 2020 kwon et al 2021 using these segmented btcs we assessed the influence of the concentration gradient on ssc error the results are summarized in table 4 which shows that the mape of the rising limb was the largest in all cases in particular case 3 showed the poorest performance for a rising limb with a mape of 7 76 and 27 76 for the training and test dataset respectively this result implies that the spectral reflectance is unstable when the ssc changes rapidly in terms of sediment type the lowest mape was found for quartz sand case 1 even though the lr model with quartz sand showed the lowest accuracy fig 11 4 3 mapping of spatio temporal distribution of ssc by applying the svr model the hyperspectral images acquired behind the measurement section with a drone were converted to the ssc distributions in order to map the ssc distribution in the water area the water body of the acquired hyperspectral images was extracted using the hyperspectral difference water index hdwi an improved water index that is used to separate water from water shadow eq 11 xie et al 2014 11 h d w i 650 n m 700 n m r λ d λ 700 n m 850 n m r λ d λ 650 n m 700 n m r λ d λ 700 n m 850 n m r λ d λ fig 17 shows the spatial ssc variation in each case in the transverse direction over time as shown in this figure the range of mapped ssc distribution over time was similar to the in situ measured ssc in all cases the mapped results of the svr model clearly delineate the transverse distribution of ssc over time for all cases even though the cloud of quartz sand was invisible in the rgb image due to the high settling velocity and invisibility of the mineral as shown in fig 17 a furthermore a comparison of this result with the pca result fig 10 reveals that the transverse distribution of ssc over time according to the svr model was quite similar to the distribution of pc 1 in all three cases fig 17 b shows that the transverse distribution of ssc for yellow loess swung from the right bank to the left over time while the cloud of ssc for quartz sand did not migrate transversely over time regarding the tails of the btcs fig 17 shows that the suspended sediment was completely mixed in the transverse direction near the peak of the btc the ssc gradually decreased after the peak and a tail appeared the proportion of the tail in the overall ssc distribution was larger in cases 1 and 3 in which the tailing effect was caused by the friction at the channel bed since the quartz sand in cases 1 and 3 has a high propensity to settle and the concentration of quartz was greater near the channel bed than the water surface the bottom friction forced quartz sand particles to be retained longer inside channel irregularities which induced the longer tail in the btcs 4 4 assessment of global applicability in order to assess the global applicability of trained empirical models the sr2 svr and rf models were validated using the dataset acquired in hwang river in south korea as described in section 2 1 2 forty nine point data of hyperspectral spectrum and corresponding in situ measured ssc was used to validate these models the validation results of each model are shown in fig 18 which compares the in situ measured ssc and the estimated ssc from each model at sampling points shown in fig 2 b according to the in situ measurement result the ssc around 25 ppm was uniformly distributed at all points nevertheless it was difficult to accurately predict ssc in this area since the water depth of the measurement points varied considerably this difference in water depth caused a discrepancy in the effect of the bottom reflectance thus this depth variation might cause significant uncertainty in remote sensing based ssc prediction baek et al 2019 ma et al 2011 tolk et al 2000 volpe et al 2011 for this reason the sr2 model yielded a highly overestimated result overally except two shallow points as shown in fig 18 a on the other hand both implicit ml regression models svr and rf produced results which showed the agreement with the in situ measured ssc the svr gave the most accurate result with rmse of 1 06 ppm and mape of 3 67 fig 18 b while rf showed rmse of 1 99 ppm and mape of 7 02 these results demonstrated that the proposed ml regression models could successfully consider water depth differences and were more globally applicable than the explicit regression model the reason for this result is that the ml regression models learned spectral bands in wider wavelength ranges which represented the effects of variability of suspended sediment properties and water depth difference fig 19 shows the ssc distribution map retrieved by each model this result revealed that ssc spatial distribution map fig 19 a estimated from the svr model was reproduced clearly compared to the results calculated by the other two models rf and sr2 fig 19 b and c as also shown in the retrieved map the svr model did not generate any noise compared to results by other two models as aforementioned the site specific problem of remote sensing in the water environment is the most critical problem reported in many studies dethier et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 liu et al 2003 montanher et al 2014 pyo et al 2019 in this regard to overcome this site specific problem the proposed svr model was validated using an independent dataset acquired from an untrained region of hwang river the results demonstrated that the proposed svr model had the potential for applying as global models and thus it could be applied universally to the hyperspectral images taken in different places and at different times 5 conclusions the key objective of this study was to develop a robust estimation model for remotely sensed ssc in rivers based on hyperspectral images acquired by uavs therefore we obtained various datasets of in situ ssc measurements and hyperspectral images through the sediment injection experiment in the field scale channel then we developed novel ml regression models using this dataset with relevant spectral bands selected by rfe in a wide range of wavelengths in this study to overcomes the site specific problem of the regression models the variability of optical images of ssc was incorporated in the proposed ml regression models the field scale experiments were conducted in a straight channel with a length of 51 m using three types of sediments quartz sand yellow loess and a mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess with different mineral contents and psds during the experiment the ssc was measured using a laser diffraction based sensor and hyperspectral images were acquired by a push room line scan type hyperspectral camera at the same time and point in the channel the experimental results showed that the spectral profiles of hyperspectral images have a similar tendency at the same ssc regardless of sediment type but a discrepancy occurred at wavelengths above 550 nm to explore this optical variability pca was applied to the spectral profiles of hyperspectral images the results of pca showed that the dimension reduced hyperspectral image pc 1 reveals critical heterogeneity due to sediment type the fraction of fine sand and d50 showed a strong positive correlation with pc 1 of the hyperspectral spectrum in the pca analysis this result implied that the high ssc and large suspended sediment particles induced strong back scattering in the water body using these heterogeneous datasets of suspended sediments with optical variability both explicit models obra based lr and sr and implicit models rfe based svr and rf were developed to estimate the ssc from hyperspectral images the obra based lr model using a single band ratio was limited in its ability to detect quartz sand which had a high settling velocity and low visibility the r2 of this model was relatively low for quartz sand at 0 57 while the r2 values for yellow loess and the mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess ranged from 0 80 to 0 87 using the whole dataset of all three cases combined lr and sr models using both single band ratio and the normalized difference ratio of two bands were developed to be compared with ml regression models the results showed that both lr and sr using the normalized difference ratio of two bands were more accurate than the models using the single band ratio the sr 2 model which is a nonlinear ga model that uses the normalized difference ratio showed the best performance for the prediction of high concentrations among obra based models these results demonstrated that the nonlinear models were more feasible to retrieval of the ssc using the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment than linear models furthermore for the independent variable of nonlinear explicit models the normalized difference ratio was better than the single band ratio the evaluation of implicit ml regression models revealed that the rfe based svr model was more accurate than the rf model it showed an improvement of up to 15 in r2 39 in rmse and 36 in mape in terms of rfe 120 spectral bands were selected uniformly across the entire range from 420 nm to 1000 nm in svr this even distribution in wavelength importance enables robust estimation of ssc with optical variability using the best performing of the four explicit and two implicit models the svr model the detailed spatio temporal ssc distribution was achieved for the three types of sediments the results showed that the high resolution spatio temporal distribution of ssc was clearly retrieved for all three different sediments including an invisible suspended sediment quartz sand to overcome this site specific problem the proposed svr model was validated using an independent dataset acquired from an untrained region of hwang river the results demonstrated that the proposed svr model yielded the robust estimation in the uncalibrated region which is a challenging site due to various water depth conditions the svr model outperformed the other regression models in terms of accuracy of ssc estimation and mapping of ssc distribution from the results of this study it can be concluded that the proposed model would be used for large regional or global scale estimation of ssc using hyperspectral imagery furthermore the retrieved ssc distribution from this model can enhance the accuracy of suspended sediment load prediction the suspended sediment transport simulation accuracy from numerical models can also be improved by using the sophisticated ssc distribution as input data however further experimental studies are needed to expand the present findings and clarify the uncertainty in the estimation of ssc by remote sensing in future studies we expect to develop more robust remote sensing based ssc measurement techniques in which the effects of hydrodynamic factors various vertical profiles of ssc and other site specific problems are adequately addressed credit authorship contribution statement siyoon kwon conceptualization formal analysis

215,since conventional in situ measurements of suspended sediments in the river system are labor intensive and time consuming remote sensing approaches using multi or hyper spectral cameras have widely been applied to obtain high resolution suspended sediment concentration ssc distributions in rivers and streams however in nature the properties of heterogeneous sediment such as the mineral content and particle size distribution induce a strong variability in the optical images of the suspended sediments for this reason the robust estimation of the suspended sediment using the remote sensing technique is challenging due to the optical variability of the suspended sediment thus it is necessary to deal with this variability of the optical images to improve the accuracy of remote sensing based ssc measurements and extend them to the global estimator in this study a robust machine learning ml model for ssc estimation based on hyperspectral images was developed by considering the optical variability of the suspended sediment in water bodies a series of field scale tracer experiments were conducted in open channels with three different sediment types in order to obtain both the ssc using laser diffraction sensors and hyperspectral images using a uav camera the experimental results showed that the optical characteristics of ssc were critically heterogeneous due to the properties of the sediment using these experimental dataset four explicit regression models and two implicit ml regression models were developed and compared to select an optimal estimator consequently a support vector regression svr model using relevant spectral bands in a wide wavelength range yielded the most accurate results with an r2 of 0 90 for the whole dataset however linear regression models which could not consider various spectral bands and the nonlinear effect of the optical variability of ssc were limited in their ability to retrieve ssc from hyperspectral images furthermore the svr model accurately reproduced the spatio temporal ssc distributions in all study cases including low visibility suspended sediments thus successfully resolved the optical variability of ssc with widely selected spectral bands from recursive feature elimination rfe the svr model also successfully retrieved the ssc distribution in uncalibrated rivers the results of this study demonstrated that the proposed ml regression models based on the hyperspectral imagery achieved a significant improvement in ssc estimation in terms of accuracy and global applicability keywords

suspended sediment exert a significant impact on river morphology and the ecosystem while also affecting flow and pollutant transport behaviors derakhshannia et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 leite ribeiro et al 2012 ostad ali askari et al 2018 umar et al 2018 to improve our understanding of the suspended sediment transport mechanisms in riverine systems high resolution spatio temporal data are required for the analysis of the complex interactions between suspended sediments and environmental factors ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 vercruysse et al 2017 in the conventional method observation of the suspended sediment concentration ssc generally relies on in situ measurements obtained by sampling of the river water this in situ measurement approach is extremely labor intensive and time consuming and it provides low resolution temporal data at discrete spatial points ostad ali askar et al 2018 qu et al 2016 in recent years laser diffraction based optical sensors have frequently been utilized to obtain high resolution temporal ssc data based on its high measurement frequency haun et al 2013 lokhov et al 2020 pedocchi and garcía 2006 pomázi and baranya 2020 however this method also required high labor cost to produce high resolution spatial data since only point measurement is available pomázi and baranya 2020 rai and kumar 2015 as an alternative to these point based measurement methods acoustics based ssc measurement using adcp has been frequently applied which can obtain cross sectional distribution of suspended sediment simmons et al 2020 son et al 2021 wosiacki et al 2021 despite the distinct advantage over other methods adcp has a limitation in differentiating the change between ssc and particle size distribution psd since single or multi frequencies are able to be used in adcp aggarwal et al 2011 for this reason the errors increase with variations in psd and it is appropriate in a limited psd range depending on a specific frequency in adcp thorne and hanes 2002 thorne and hurther 2014 with the recent advances in image processing techniques numerous studies have used remote sensing approaches to retrieve high resolution spatial data on the quality of large bodies of water from multispectral or hyperspectral satellite images arisanty and nur saputra 2017 caballero et al 2018 dekker et al 2001 dethier et al 2020 ismail et al 2019 kabir and ahmari 2020 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2020 pirnazar et al 2018 ross et al 2019 topp et al 2020 umar et al 2018 the remote sensing ssc measurement approach used in aquatic environments is based on the optical characteristics of sunlight which is strongly absorbed by water by sensing the sunlight intensity the spectral signals of solar radiation at visible vis and near infrared nir wavelengths can be captured by multispectral or hyperspectral cameras dethier et al 2020 fonstad and marcus 2005 kwon et al 2020 ostad ali askari et al 2017b wei et al 2019 these spectral signals of solar radiation are recorded as the radiance of discrete spectral bands with respect to wavelength to be more specific the radiance in the water environment can be divided into four sub radiance categories the radiance reflected from the river bed lb the back scattered radiance from the water body lc the radiance reflected from the interface between the atmosphere and the water body ls and the path radiance of the atmosphere lp baek et al 2019 golian et al 2020 legleiter et al 2004 niroumand jadidi et al 2018 ostad ali askari et al 2020 vercruysse et al 2017 among these four sub radiances the ssc is most highly sensitive to lc which is backscattered by the particles in the water column therefore lc is higher in a turbid water body with a high concentration of suspended sediments than a pure water body in addition this optical phenomenon can be observed in the nir region which has longer wavelengths than the vis region so many previous studies used the nir band to measure ssc even though the nir band cannot fully explain the optical characteristics of ssc bhargava and mariam 1991 chen et al 1991 novo et al 1989 to address this problem recent studies considered both the vis and nir regions to determine the most relevant spectral band that best represents ssc based on the correlation between ssc and the radiance of those bands doxaran et al 2003 espinoza villar et al 2013 islam et al 2001 liu et al 2017 ma and dai 2005 montanher et al 2014 ostad ali askari et al 2019 pereira et al 2019 schiebe et al 1992 shen et al 2010 talebmorad et al 2021 topliss et al 1990 vanani et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2009a wang et al 2009b liu et al 2017 developed exponential and power law equations for ssc retrievals using reflectance of single band from multispectral satellite image in lake this study suggested the optimal equation and spectral band by comparing two types of equation and each of the nine spectral bands in the multispectral image as an independent variable wang et al 2017 proposed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformed red band and nir band using satellite image in estuaries and coasts espinoza villar 2013 also used the ratio of red band and nir as an independent variable of a power law equation to map the ssc distribution in large rivers montanher et al 2014 compared the reflectance of single band and the ratio of reflectance of the spectral bands as an independent input variable for the linear regression model to estimate the ssc in rivers additionally machine learning approaches were also proposed to improve the accuracy of the regression model with additional spectral bands effectively resolving the nonlinearity between the input spectral values and the target ssc values peterson et al 2018 umar et al 2018 most previous remote sensing studies were conducted in marine and coastal environments because it is possible to acquire a sufficient amount of relevant spatial data from satellite images and the effect of bottom reflectance is less pronounced in marine and coastal areas due to the relative narrowness of rivers remote sensing based ssc measurements have rarely been applied to riverine systems pham et al 2018 although the recently launched sentinel 2 and sentinel 3 satellites have improved the spatial resolution of available images by up to 5 10 m coarse spectral resolution which has a bandwidth of 60 80 nm is still a crucial shortcoming of satellite based remote sensing for the measurement of water quality and ssc in rivers kwon et al 2020 wei et al 2019 recently to overcome this limitation uav unmanned aerial vehicle based hyperspectral remote sensing has been carried out to measure water depth algal blooms and cyanobacteria concentration with higher spatio temporal resolution and a narrower spectral band width than provided by multispectral sensors kwon et al 2020 legleiter et al 2019 legleiter and harrison 2019 ostad ali askari et al 2017a pyo et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2021 however the amount of research on hyperspectral measurement of ssc in rivers is currently insufficient due to the regional characteristics of suspended sediment while other targets in rivers are easier to measure dethier et al 2020 gebreslassie et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 salehi hafshejani et al 2019 in this respect previous studies mainly focused on improving the prediction accuracy in the specific study areas where regression equations had been built and the main wavelengths of the spectral bands involved in the regression equations were spread over a rather wide range pereira et al 2019 this regionality of previous research occurred because the optical characteristics of suspended sediment vary according to the particle size mineral content and sediment color of the suspended sediment these variables are collectively referred to as the optical variability of suspended sediment kabir and ahmari 2020 therefore several empirical and semi empirical models have been developed to account for the optical variability of suspended sediment gebreslassie et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 qu et al 2016 a semi empirical model spectral mixing analysis sma showed relatively accurate performance regardless of the optical variability from sediment color and particle size distribution gebreslassie et al 2020 qu et al 2016 this model can be developed from laboratory analysis to obtain the individual spectrum of constituents including clean water and dry sediment then the spectral mixing abundance of each constituent can be estimated by decomposing the measured spectrum of river waters based on sma the spectral mixing abundance is finally used as the independent variable of the ssc regression model however this study has limitations in extending to the spatial mapping of ssc since it can be validated and applied only at the points where river water is sampled likewise a number of suspended sediment samples are required to represent the sediment characteristics of the target river it is also difficult to consider the suspended sediment to be a single constituent if the sediment properties have a bimodal distribution of particle size or varied mineral contents to develop an empirical model kabir and ahmari 2020 established log linear regression equations according to sediment color using an rgb camera based on laboratory experiments they developed practical and accurate models and demonstrated the necessity of classification for the ssc estimator according to suspended sediment variability nevertheless their model showed limitations in that the amount of available data was inadequate and the performance in the field was relatively poor due to the discrepancy between the particle size distributions psds of the suspended sediment samples used in model development and application therefore there have been efforts to improve the accuracy of ssc estimation by developing a model that can consider the optical variability however there are no studies that have clearly identified the causes of variability in the optical images few models that considered the optical variability had limitations in applying them globally consequently analysis of the optical variability of the suspended sediment is the most important task to achieve the robustly successful estimation of ssc from remote sensing technique the key objective in this study was maximizing the accuracy of the mapping of ssc via remote sensing and accomplishing global application of models while understanding the confounding factors of optical variability as a significant uncertainty cause to achieve this objective based on the exploration of the effect of suspended sediment properties with optical variability on hyperspectral images we developed a robust empirical model for remote sensed ssc in rivers in specific we first obtained both in situ measured ssc using a laser diffraction sensor and remotely sensed hyperspectral images by the uav camera this was done by conducting tracer tests with three types of sediments in a field scale open channel then we explored the impact of the optical variability of the suspended sediment according to sediment properties we then developed a robust machine learning ml based regression model of the suspended sediment using recursive feature elimination rfe and compared the results with those of other regression models finally we retrieved the spatio temporal map of ssc even for low visibility suspended sediment from hyperspectral images and analyzed the influence of sediment properties on the hyperspectral image based estimation of ssc in addition the global applicability of the proposed model was assessed in an uncalibrated region using spectral data from the natural rivers with shallow depth 2 experiments 2 1 experimental set up 2 1 1 tracer experiments as mentioned above the optical properties of suspended sediment vary with the mineral content and particle size distribution of the sediment dethier et al 2020 qu et al 2016 this study investigated the effect of such optical variability on the spectral properties of suspended sediment for this purpose tracer tests were conducted with three types of sediment in order to collect a dataset containing both hyperspectral images and in situ measured ssc values given various sediment characteristics the sediment tracers used in the experiment consisted of quartz sand yellow loess and a mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess the experiments were conducted in the river experimental center rec of the korea institute of civil engineering and building technology kict located at andong south korea as shown in fig 1 a the experiments were performed in a straight channel with a river scale trapezoidal section with a length of 500 m top width of 11 m depth of 2 m and side slope of 1 2 the channel bed consists of natural sand and the side bank consists of concrete blocks the water used in the experiments was pumped in from the nakdong river which is located near the rec fig 1 b shows the tracer injection point and measurement section in the experimental channel the injection point was located at the center of the upstream bridge at this point using a mixer sediment solution diluted in river water was injected in a completely mixed state as shown in fig 1 c it was injected underwater to minimize the effect of the drop in momentum of the initial sediment tracer injection as shown in fig 1 d at the measurement section two different measurements were taken to obtain both hyperspectral images and ssc values first hyperspectral images were taken at two locations in front of and behind the bridge via different techniques hyperspectral images were taken in front of the bridge in order to extract the ground based hyperspectral spectrum of the corresponding pixels with the in situ sensor to minimize the effect of the atmosphere on the hyperspectral images a push room line scan type hyperspectral camera was installed at the center of the bridge 1 85 m above the water surface using a dji ronin 3 axis handheld gimbal for the images taken behind the bridge spatial information including the width of the channel was obtained using a uav mounted hyperspectral camera these images were used to retrieve the spatio temporal distribution of suspended sediment the hyperspectral camera used in this study a microhsi 410 shark is a push broom type sensor with a size of 13 6 8 7 7 0 cm and a weight of 680 g this sensor covers the 400 1000 nm spectral range with 150 spectral bands and 682 spatial pixels per line this sensor spatially records the light entering through the prism by arranging multiple optical sensors linearly fowler 2014 since hyperspectral images of transverse lines over time were acquired by this sensor the hyperspectral spectrum line was captured continuously as the water flowed while the sensor was fixed at the measurement section accordingly the dimensions of the hyperspectral images obtained in this experiment were width y time t wavelength λ for the in situ ssc measurement a sequoia scientific lisst 200x which measures particle size using light scattering based on underwater laser diffraction was used to measure the sediment concentration particle size distribution psd and temperature the lisst 200x used in this study is capable of measuring a sufficient range of psd and ssc the psd range consists of 36 bins that are distributed from 1 to 500 μm in logarithmic increments while the range of ssc is from 0 5 to 700 ppm this sensor was installed at the iron rod connected to the center of the bridge to measure the temporal concentration of suspended sediment as shown in fig 1d to obtain the concentration near both the water surface and the bed two lisst 200x devices were deployed at fixed depths of 0 675 and 0 225 m from the bed which was 0 75 and 0 25 times the water depth the sampling rate of both sensors was set to 0 67 hz in this study three cases were examined with three different sediment tracer types quartz sand yellow loess and the quartz sand and yellow loess mixture as shown in fig 1 e and table 1 all sediment used for injection was first passed through a 0 2 mm filter using a stainless steel sieve to remove large particles the solution of sediment and river water that was injected had the same volume in all cases the hydraulic data discharge mean velocity and water depth were obtained using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the sontek river surveyor s5 at the measurement section all experimental cases were carried out under the same hydraulic conditions which are summarized in table 1 2 1 2 field experiment in order to validate the trained model with a completely independent dataset we conducted a field experiment in the hwang river tributary to the nakdong rivers in south korea the hwang river has a total length of 107 6 km and its total river basin area is 1329 km2 shin and julien 2010 the experimental reach was located 450 m upstream of the confluence of the nakdong river and the hwang river and its length was 250 m as shown in fig 2 a the experiment was conducted on march 30 2021 at this time the water depth condition of the experimental site was 0 6 2 6 m but most of the area was deeper than the condition of the field scale experiment in section 2 1 1 during this experiment the ssc was measured at 49 monitoring points using a lisst 200x attached to the side of a hydroboard as shown in fig 2 b additional hydraulic data such as water depth and vertical flow velocity profile were obtained using the adcp river surveyor m9 by sontek usa and gps installed on the hydroboard kwak et al 2020 son et al 2021 the hyperspectral images were simultaneously acquired using the same uav platform used for the tracer experiment in the field scale channels while the hyperspectral images were acquired by hovering the drone in the field scale experiment we manipulated the uav to scan in the river width direction to cover the entire target area in the field experiments for this reason several flight strips were designed and the separately acquired hyperspectral images according to their strips were integrated to obtain the hyperspectral images covering a large area 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 analysis of suspended sediment data in this study the lisst 200x was used to measure particle size psd and ssc in the experiment the background turbidity was high enough to neglect the effect of bottom reflectance since the water used in the experiment was pumped in from the nakdong river which has high turbidity after a flood a sample of background water was taken using a horizontal van dorn water sampler this sample was moved to the laboratory and dried to measure the psd the psd was measured using both the hydrometer test and the lisst 200x the psds measured by the two methods were similar and silt of size ranging from 0 004 to 0 062 mm accounted for approximately 50 of total psd as shown in fig 3 a nevertheless the psds from the two methods showed a slightly different percentage of fine particulate matter under 0 004 mm which may introduce some uncertainty into this study since the background psd and the particle size of the sediment tracer in each case were under 0 2 mm psd values ranging from 0 001 to 0 2 mm were considered in this study therefore the range of psd in this study included four classes of sediment according to particle size fine sand range 125 200 μm very fine sand range 62 125 μm silt range 4 62 μm and clay 1 4 μm merten et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the density of the used quartz sand and yellow loess was estimated from the volume concentration measured by lisst 200x and the weight concentration from the dry weight of each sediment in this procedure distilled water was placed in a 1 l beaker and the amount of the sample was increased while measuring by lisst 200x the full path flow through chamber was utilized to circulate water and pass through the lisst 200x each concentration was measured for 1 min and mean concentration was used to estimate the density of each sediment the validation curve with lisst 200x and the estimated density of each sediment were shown in fig 3 b and c as a result the volume concentration measured by lisst 200x and weight concentration resulted in a high r2 value it was confirmed that both the known psd and ssc were in reasonable agreement with this instrument the psd at the maximum concentration in each case and in the background water are illustrated in figs 3 5 as shown in fig 4 the proportion of sand increased significantly near both the water surface and the river bed after the injection of quartz sand case 1 compared to the background water in which clay and silt were dominant the relative frequency of sand was higher near the river bed than near the water surface because quartz sand tends to settle to the bottom of a body of water as shown in fig 5 in case of yellow loess case 2 the concentration of particles with the size of silt and very fine sand increased at the maximum overall particle concentration however in this case the variations in concentration near the water surface and river bed were similar which implies that the settling velocity was not very high as shown in fig 6 for the mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess case 3 the relative frequency of silt and fine sand increased similar to the yellow loess case case 2 the relative frequency of fine sand increased to a greater extent than in case 2 due to the effect of quartz sand similarly the relative frequency of fine sand at the sampling depth of 0 25h was greater than the relative frequency of fine sand at the sampling depth of 0 75h due to the settling property of quartz sand breakthrough curves btcs of ssc measured at 0 75h and 0 25h of the three experimental cases are plotted in fig 7 as shown in the figure the ssc for case 1 were lower than those of case 2 even though the same amount of mass was discharged at the injection point in all three cases this is because due to the high fall velocity the quartz sand in case 1 settled down to the channel bed faster than the yellow loess in case 2 when it was transported downstream of the injection point in the channel the suspended sediment cloud images captured by the rgb camera fig 1 e also clearly reveal this difference the suspended sediment cloud of quartz sand in case 1 is less vivid than the cloud of yellow loess in case 2 a comparison of two btcs of quartz sand in case 1 shown in fig 7 a also revealed that the concentration measured near the bed 0 25 h was greater than the concentration measured near the water surface 0 75 h the mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess case 3 showed intermediate behavior between the behavior in cases 1 and 2 as shown in fig 7 the time to peak concentration and time to centroid of btc were almost the same in all three cases furthermore the tails of the btcs in all three cases were not persistent because the storage effects due to the boundary irregularities in the prismatic straight channel were not significant 2 2 2 hyperspectral image analysis from all of the acquired raw hyperspectral images radiometric correction was first conducted to convert digital number dn which stores the radiance as an integer on the hyperspectral camera to relative reflectance since the radiance recorded in the hyperspectral camera did not coincide with the actual energy emitted or reflected by the surface due to the azimuth angle and elevation of the sun a radiometric correction process using calibration tarps which provides reference reflectance values was used to enhance the interpretability and quality of the hyperspectral data booysen et al 2020 jakob et al 2017 in this study calibration tarps offering lambertian reflectance of 0 84 0 56 0 24 and 0 03 were used the lambertian reflectance denotes the isotropic reflected light intensity which serves as a reference for radiometric correction regardless of the camera angle baek et al 2019 the reference reflectance values were obtained before each experiment by placing the tarp on a flat plate from the reference values the radiance was normalized to relative reflectance using eq 1 1 r λ g a i n l λ o f f s e t where r λ is relative reflectance and l λ w m2 sr is radiance hyperspectral images usually include noise which can arise from sensor sensitivity sun glint and solar conditions e g cloud coverage mishra et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 also in a river measurement suspended substances or bubbles on the surface of the water significantly increase the ls λ which prevents lc λ the back scattered radiance from the water body from reaching the sensor thus in this study the median filter which replaces the noise with the median value of a moving window was used to minimize the noise in both the spatial and the spectral domains the median filter was employed by a 4 point 20 cm window with a length of approximately 2 of stream width since a large window induces the blurring effect in this study the median filter was employed using median filter function in the scipy library in python 3 7 from the preprocessed ground based hyperspectral images the five central pixels corresponding to the in situ sensor location were extracted and averaged to be analyzed with the measured ssc by applying the median filter to a hyperspectral spectrum where a bubble passed on the water surface the high noise value was attenuated and the spectrum was smoothed overall fig 8 shows the spectral reflectance along the entire measured wavelength range 400 1000 nm according to ssc variation for each case in the spectral profiles of all sediment types the highest reflectance values appeared near red wavelengths 650 nm also apparent variation due to an increase in ssc was observed near the red 650 nm and red nir 750 nm wavelengths these wavelengths were also identified as sensitive ranges in previous studies doxaran et al 2003 gebreslassie et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 as shown in the figure although the spectral profiles of all sediment types had similar tendencies the reflectance values over 550 nm differed at the same ssc according to sediment type for this reason the optical variability of sediment type caused uncertainty in the remotely sensed estimation of ssc in order to evaluate the effect of certain properties of suspended sediment sediment type psd sampling depth and temperature on the hyperspectral spectrum principal component analysis pca was applied to the acquired hyperspectral images the hyperspectral image was a high dimensional dataset with vast spectral information and thus it was difficult to directly investigate the relation between properties of suspended sediment and corresponding spectral band values in the hyperspectral spectrum in this respect pca could reduce the hyperspectral images with 150 spectral bands into a few orthogonally transformed variables which retained the maximum variation of the original data this dimensional reduction technique has been widely used for feature extraction of hyperspectral images in various fields kim et al 2020 qin et al 2013 sváb et al 2005 whetton et al 2017 in this study we compared the condensed spectral characteristics of hyperspectral images acquired by pca to the properties of suspended sediment to identify the dominant properties each point in fig 9 represents a hyperspectral spectrum corresponding to the in situ measured ssc projected into principal component pc 1 and pc 2 defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix these two components showed that 80 of pc 1 and 16 of pc 2 of variance were retained in the space defined by pc 1 and pc 2 there was little difference in the reflectance characteristics of each case in background water however as pc 1 increased each case changed in a different direction and the cases were clearly distinguished from each other pc 1 showed a strong correlation with ssc as noted in table 2 which indicates that the spectral characteristics of the three types of sediments differed moreover the lower the settling velocity and visibility the more parallel the spectrum data was with the pc 1 axis thus if pc 2 is less affected the spectral characteristics are more related to ssc in this study pca was also applied to spatial hyperspectral images acquired by the drone fig 10 shows the original rgb pc 1 and pc 2 images as shown in this figure pc 1 successfully captured the distribution of suspended sediment in all cases not only cases 2 and 3 with high visibility even in the rgb image but also case 1 with low visibility can be observed in the pc 1 image hence the correlation between pc 1 which implies the optical characteristics of the hyperspectral spectrum and the properties of suspended sediment was calculated table 2 referring to table 2 ssc showed a high correlation with pc 1 and the fine sand and d50 also showed a strong positive correlation with pc 1 in the aspect of psd such correlations mean that the larger the concentration and the more large particles the stronger the lc reaching the hyperspectral sensor thus this result implies that reflectance at the same ssc can differ according to the psd the same result was also reported by koestner et al 2020 who found that the larger the particles the stronger the back scattering in the water body on the other hand despite the large particle size of quartz sand the reflectance value was lower than that of yellow loess due to its high settling velocity and the invisibility of the mineral 3 model development 3 1 index based regression models in order to retrieve the ssc using the regression approach with hyperspectral images we employed optimal band ratio analysis obra based linear regression lr and symbolic regression sr as explicit regression approaches obra the most popular algorithm for retrieval of water depth and water quality parameters uses the ratio of spectral bands to isolate the lc λ back scattered by the suspended sediment in water bodies legleiter et al 2019 2004 legleiter and harrison 2019 niroumand jadidi et al 2020 2019 2018 the optimal band ratio in obra was determined by calculating the band ratio according to all pairs of bands λ1 λ2 and yields the highest accuracy of regression of ssc on band ratio in this study the log transformed single band ratio eq 2 and normalized difference ratio eq 3 were used as the lr and sr input variables respectively 2 x ln r λ 1 r λ 2 3 x ln r λ 1 r λ 2 r λ 1 r λ 2 on the other hand the relationship between hyperspectral radiance and ssc in the open channel flows is complicated since the radiance of ssc is influenced by many factors such as the existence of various types of substrate in the water varying water depth according to discharge and surface scattering effect of glinting sunlight thus in this study nonlinear regression was additionally employed to represent the optical complexity in shallow open channel waters baek et al 2019 binding et al 2005 fraser 1998 legleiter and harrison 2019 schiebe et al 1992 sr was chosen from various nonlinear regression approaches sr does not require the fixed functional form as prior knowledge since it aims to identify the optimal functional form using an evolutionary optimization algorithm the genetic algorithm ga hristov et al 2020 searson et al 2010 weng et al 2019 in the sr optimization process the functional form was continuously evolved through the operators in ga such as mutation recombination and selection until the mean squared error mse reached the termination criteria the input variable was selected in the same manner as the lr these are the two types of optimal band ratio with the forms shown in eqs 2 and 3 in this study only simple operators x x ln x were selected to avoid overcomplicating the functional form and overfitting the sr was implemented using the gplearn library in python 3 7 3 2 machine learning ml regression models in this study among various ml based regression models random forest rf and support vector regression svr were employed and compared to the band ratio based explicit regression models these two ml models which are the most popular ml based regression models show superior performance when the given dataset is highly nonlinear and complicated due to high dimensionality choi and seo 2018 kwon et al 2021 thus unlike the explicit regression which makes the equation more complex and causes overfitting in the presence of many variables the ml models have an advantage in analyzing high dimensional data like hyperspectral images in this respect a wide range of spectral information can be considered in these models and thus we developed rf and svr models to predict the ssc using reflectance values of several spectral bands in a wide range of wavelengths rf is an ensemble decision tree model that minimizes the variance of predictions from a single decision tree breiman 2001 with respect to the structure of rf each decision tree in rf divides the space of the input variable into multiple hierarchies according to the value of the output variable based on the tree structure specifically this model selects samples and variables randomly then divides the input variable into each node of decision trees according to the value of the output variable in this study the sample was generated by bootstrap sampling with random replacement in the bagging process breiman 1996 in the training process of this model the split for each node was determined by maximizing the reduction in overall error in nodes the error was estimated by mean square error mse when the decision tree was used for regression as given in eq 4 4 m s e 1 n σ y i y i 2 where n is a number of the dataset yi is the in situ measured ssc y i was estimated ssc by hsi based on these criteria the casual relationship between input and output variables can be known through the constructed model structure of rf svr was proposed by vapnik et al 1997 and extended to a regression problem through application of a support vector machine svm which is a machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification problems svr has the advantage of finding a globally optimal solution because it uses convex optimization to generate a function for the relationship between data inputs and outputs this yields more accurate prediction results than other ml algorithms when the amount of available data is insufficient chi et al 2008 pal and foody 2010 in this study the relationship between ssc and the reflectance value which is defined by eq 4 was derived by solving the optimization problem with eq 5 as the objective function and eq 6 as the constraint to solve for the f xij that is distributed within one deviation ε thus eq 4 was derived as the flattest regression function that was less than one deviation ε from the actual ssc values yi for all reflectance values of each band xij 4 f x i j i 1 n w i g x i j b i 5 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ ξ i 6 y i f x i j b i ε ξ i f x i j b i y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where f xij is the convex function wi are weight coefficients bi is the bias g xij is the kernel function for nonlinear transformation c is the penalty factor and ξ i and ξ i are slack variables that determine the degree of penalty if the error exceeds ε in this study to build the ml models with the relevant spectral bands for ssc recursive feature elimination rfe a thorough feature selection method based on model performance was employed guyon et al 2002 rfe eliminated the least important band according to the particular feature importance criteria of each model this algorithm first trained the model using all of the spectral bands in the hyperspectral image it then repeatedly removed any redundant bands until the performance of the continuously trained model was reduced the remaining bands were finally selected as the relevant spectral bands for ssc the root mean square error rmse eq 7 was adopted as the performance criteria with 5 fold cross validation at each step to reduce bias 7 r m s e 1 n i y i y i 2 where yi is the in situ measured ssc and y i is the remotely sensed ssc in rfe the two suggested ml models used the different feature importance criteria to eliminate irrelevant bands in the rf model the mean decrease impurity was used the impurity was estimated by the normalized total reduction of mse by each variable eq 8 of the decision trees which determined the splitting variables and the split nodes in the decision trees biau and scornet 2016 for each spectral band i in the spectrum the band importance i averaged n of decision trees in rf was calculated as 8 i i n δ m s e i n where k represents the number of target values and p m k is the proportion of the kth target values in node m in case of the svr model the weight coefficient wi in eq 4 indicates the effect of the reflectance value of the ith band on the prediction using the variable importance criteria of the rf and svr models the optimal band subsets selected by rfe served as the input variables for each model 4 evaluation of regression models 4 1 obra based explicit models as explicit regression models the obra based lr and sr were applied to three individual cases and the entire dataset that combined all three cases first obra was implemented with the single band ratio to identify the optimal bands by using all data in each case without splitting the data into training and testing datasets fig 11 a shows that the wavelengths of the selected optimal bands for case 1 quartz sand were near the red part of the spectrum 582 93 and 663 02 nm this was one of the sensitive bands to ssc as shown in fig 7a the yellow loess was regressed by the red edge and nir bands 703 06 and 883 25 with the highest value of r2 as shown in fig 11 b fig 11 c shows that the wavelengths of the selected optimal bands for the mixture ranged between red and red edge 747 11 and 703 06 nm given these results the obra based lr model with the single band ratio selected different spectral bands according to sediment type which implies that different types of suspended sediment have spectrally unique characteristics as demonstrated by the pc analysis in terms of accuracy even though the lr model showed an r2 of over 0 80 for cases 2 and 3 it showed relatively poor performance for case 1 with an r2 of 0 57 when it was applied to the combined dataset from all three cases obra based lr showed an r2 of 0 75 with optimal bands in the nir range 791 15 and 855 22 nm as shown in fig 11 d which means that the effect of the yellow loess data was more dominant than that of quartz sand these results indicate that the obra based lr model is limited in its ability to retrieve the characteristics of suspended sediment with a high settling property and low visibility like quartz sand to overcome this limitation we implemented two other approaches the obra based lr approach with a normalized difference ratio eq 3 and sr as described in the previous section these two approaches were applied only to the whole dataset which was split into 80 training data and 20 testing data the train test split function in the scikit learn package in python was utilized to split the datasets randomly validation of the trained regression models was carried out using the test dataset to measure the quantitative error of each model r2 the coefficient of determination rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape were utilized 9 r 2 1 i y i y i 2 i y i y 2 10 m a p e 1 n i y i y i y i 100 the obra model selected the optimal bands for the normalized difference ratio eq 3 the wavelengths of the spectral bands selected by obra and the relevant formulas are listed in table 3 sr was also employed with both the single band ratio and normalized difference ratio the same bands selected by obra were used as the optimal bands for sr from these derived formulas the four models were validated using the test dataset and the results are plotted in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 a lr and sr based on the single band ratio yielded similar results lr 1 underestimated the values at high concentrations while sr 1 provided slightly better predictions for high concentrations and showed a lower mape than lr 1 according to fig 12 b sr 2 showed the best performance for the prediction of high concentrations among obra based models lr 2 underestimated the results at high concentrations similar to lr 1 this tendency of linear models to underestimate the results at high concentrations was also reported in previous studies that obtained the concentration of fluorescent tracer and water depth based on remote sensing in shallow water baek et al 2019 legleiter and harrison 2019 these results demonstrate that the nonlinear models can more accurately retrieve the ssc using the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment compared to the linear models also the normalized difference ratio was more appropriate for the independent variable of nonlinear models than the single band ratio 4 2 implicit regression models in order to build the rf and svr models by learning the relevant spectral bands the optimal bands were selected in the 400 nm to 1000 nm wavelength for each model using rfe fig 13 shows the number of bands selected by rfe for each model rf selected 62 bands with the lowest rmse while svr selected 120 bands in terms of the wavelength of the selected bands the wavelength frequency selected by each model is presented in fig 14 the rf model identified particularly important wavelength ranges violet 400 440 nm red 640 680 nm and swir 920 960 nm among these ranges the red band was the only one that overlapped with the spectral bands indicating a high correlation with obra based lr it can be seen that rf additionally selected spectral bands with low variability according to sediment type on the other hand in svr the wavelength of the selected band was evenly distributed throughout the spectrum except violet 400 420 nm this result shows that the svr model is powerful in that high dimensional input data becomes simpler in the feature space as demonstrated in previous studies on svr kwon et al 2021 raghavendra and deka 2014 yao et al 2008 thus for svr the highest accuracy was obtained when 120 of the 150 spectral bands were used as shown in fig 13 after band selection by rfe the rf and svr models were trained and validated using the same dataset that was used for lr and sr the validation results are plotted in fig 15 which shows that the implicit regression models rf and svr yielded higher accuracy than the explicit regression models lr and sr fig 12 especially in terms of mape among the two implicit regression models svr showed better performance with r2 of 0 90 rmse of 17 07 ppm and mape of 14 18 while rf showed r2 of 0 79 and rmse of 25 37 ppm these results demonstrate that the svr model was the most accurate model for retrieval of ssc using hyperspectral images due to its outstanding performance in simplification of high dimensional data consequently the svr model was selected as the optimal model in this study fig 16 depicts a comparison of the retrieved btcs of ssc by the selected svr model with the in situ measured btcs this figure demonstrates that the estimated ssc from both the training and test datasets yielded good agreement with the in situ measured ssc additionally different segments of the retrieved btcs were assessed rising limb falling limb and tail choi et al 2020 kwon et al 2021 using these segmented btcs we assessed the influence of the concentration gradient on ssc error the results are summarized in table 4 which shows that the mape of the rising limb was the largest in all cases in particular case 3 showed the poorest performance for a rising limb with a mape of 7 76 and 27 76 for the training and test dataset respectively this result implies that the spectral reflectance is unstable when the ssc changes rapidly in terms of sediment type the lowest mape was found for quartz sand case 1 even though the lr model with quartz sand showed the lowest accuracy fig 11 4 3 mapping of spatio temporal distribution of ssc by applying the svr model the hyperspectral images acquired behind the measurement section with a drone were converted to the ssc distributions in order to map the ssc distribution in the water area the water body of the acquired hyperspectral images was extracted using the hyperspectral difference water index hdwi an improved water index that is used to separate water from water shadow eq 11 xie et al 2014 11 h d w i 650 n m 700 n m r λ d λ 700 n m 850 n m r λ d λ 650 n m 700 n m r λ d λ 700 n m 850 n m r λ d λ fig 17 shows the spatial ssc variation in each case in the transverse direction over time as shown in this figure the range of mapped ssc distribution over time was similar to the in situ measured ssc in all cases the mapped results of the svr model clearly delineate the transverse distribution of ssc over time for all cases even though the cloud of quartz sand was invisible in the rgb image due to the high settling velocity and invisibility of the mineral as shown in fig 17 a furthermore a comparison of this result with the pca result fig 10 reveals that the transverse distribution of ssc over time according to the svr model was quite similar to the distribution of pc 1 in all three cases fig 17 b shows that the transverse distribution of ssc for yellow loess swung from the right bank to the left over time while the cloud of ssc for quartz sand did not migrate transversely over time regarding the tails of the btcs fig 17 shows that the suspended sediment was completely mixed in the transverse direction near the peak of the btc the ssc gradually decreased after the peak and a tail appeared the proportion of the tail in the overall ssc distribution was larger in cases 1 and 3 in which the tailing effect was caused by the friction at the channel bed since the quartz sand in cases 1 and 3 has a high propensity to settle and the concentration of quartz was greater near the channel bed than the water surface the bottom friction forced quartz sand particles to be retained longer inside channel irregularities which induced the longer tail in the btcs 4 4 assessment of global applicability in order to assess the global applicability of trained empirical models the sr2 svr and rf models were validated using the dataset acquired in hwang river in south korea as described in section 2 1 2 forty nine point data of hyperspectral spectrum and corresponding in situ measured ssc was used to validate these models the validation results of each model are shown in fig 18 which compares the in situ measured ssc and the estimated ssc from each model at sampling points shown in fig 2 b according to the in situ measurement result the ssc around 25 ppm was uniformly distributed at all points nevertheless it was difficult to accurately predict ssc in this area since the water depth of the measurement points varied considerably this difference in water depth caused a discrepancy in the effect of the bottom reflectance thus this depth variation might cause significant uncertainty in remote sensing based ssc prediction baek et al 2019 ma et al 2011 tolk et al 2000 volpe et al 2011 for this reason the sr2 model yielded a highly overestimated result overally except two shallow points as shown in fig 18 a on the other hand both implicit ml regression models svr and rf produced results which showed the agreement with the in situ measured ssc the svr gave the most accurate result with rmse of 1 06 ppm and mape of 3 67 fig 18 b while rf showed rmse of 1 99 ppm and mape of 7 02 these results demonstrated that the proposed ml regression models could successfully consider water depth differences and were more globally applicable than the explicit regression model the reason for this result is that the ml regression models learned spectral bands in wider wavelength ranges which represented the effects of variability of suspended sediment properties and water depth difference fig 19 shows the ssc distribution map retrieved by each model this result revealed that ssc spatial distribution map fig 19 a estimated from the svr model was reproduced clearly compared to the results calculated by the other two models rf and sr2 fig 19 b and c as also shown in the retrieved map the svr model did not generate any noise compared to results by other two models as aforementioned the site specific problem of remote sensing in the water environment is the most critical problem reported in many studies dethier et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 liu et al 2003 montanher et al 2014 pyo et al 2019 in this regard to overcome this site specific problem the proposed svr model was validated using an independent dataset acquired from an untrained region of hwang river the results demonstrated that the proposed svr model had the potential for applying as global models and thus it could be applied universally to the hyperspectral images taken in different places and at different times 5 conclusions the key objective of this study was to develop a robust estimation model for remotely sensed ssc in rivers based on hyperspectral images acquired by uavs therefore we obtained various datasets of in situ ssc measurements and hyperspectral images through the sediment injection experiment in the field scale channel then we developed novel ml regression models using this dataset with relevant spectral bands selected by rfe in a wide range of wavelengths in this study to overcomes the site specific problem of the regression models the variability of optical images of ssc was incorporated in the proposed ml regression models the field scale experiments were conducted in a straight channel with a length of 51 m using three types of sediments quartz sand yellow loess and a mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess with different mineral contents and psds during the experiment the ssc was measured using a laser diffraction based sensor and hyperspectral images were acquired by a push room line scan type hyperspectral camera at the same time and point in the channel the experimental results showed that the spectral profiles of hyperspectral images have a similar tendency at the same ssc regardless of sediment type but a discrepancy occurred at wavelengths above 550 nm to explore this optical variability pca was applied to the spectral profiles of hyperspectral images the results of pca showed that the dimension reduced hyperspectral image pc 1 reveals critical heterogeneity due to sediment type the fraction of fine sand and d50 showed a strong positive correlation with pc 1 of the hyperspectral spectrum in the pca analysis this result implied that the high ssc and large suspended sediment particles induced strong back scattering in the water body using these heterogeneous datasets of suspended sediments with optical variability both explicit models obra based lr and sr and implicit models rfe based svr and rf were developed to estimate the ssc from hyperspectral images the obra based lr model using a single band ratio was limited in its ability to detect quartz sand which had a high settling velocity and low visibility the r2 of this model was relatively low for quartz sand at 0 57 while the r2 values for yellow loess and the mixture of quartz sand and yellow loess ranged from 0 80 to 0 87 using the whole dataset of all three cases combined lr and sr models using both single band ratio and the normalized difference ratio of two bands were developed to be compared with ml regression models the results showed that both lr and sr using the normalized difference ratio of two bands were more accurate than the models using the single band ratio the sr 2 model which is a nonlinear ga model that uses the normalized difference ratio showed the best performance for the prediction of high concentrations among obra based models these results demonstrated that the nonlinear models were more feasible to retrieval of the ssc using the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment than linear models furthermore for the independent variable of nonlinear explicit models the normalized difference ratio was better than the single band ratio the evaluation of implicit ml regression models revealed that the rfe based svr model was more accurate than the rf model it showed an improvement of up to 15 in r2 39 in rmse and 36 in mape in terms of rfe 120 spectral bands were selected uniformly across the entire range from 420 nm to 1000 nm in svr this even distribution in wavelength importance enables robust estimation of ssc with optical variability using the best performing of the four explicit and two implicit models the svr model the detailed spatio temporal ssc distribution was achieved for the three types of sediments the results showed that the high resolution spatio temporal distribution of ssc was clearly retrieved for all three different sediments including an invisible suspended sediment quartz sand to overcome this site specific problem the proposed svr model was validated using an independent dataset acquired from an untrained region of hwang river the results demonstrated that the proposed svr model yielded the robust estimation in the uncalibrated region which is a challenging site due to various water depth conditions the svr model outperformed the other regression models in terms of accuracy of ssc estimation and mapping of ssc distribution from the results of this study it can be concluded that the proposed model would be used for large regional or global scale estimation of ssc using hyperspectral imagery furthermore the retrieved ssc distribution from this model can enhance the accuracy of suspended sediment load prediction the suspended sediment transport simulation accuracy from numerical models can also be improved by using the sophisticated ssc distribution as input data however further experimental studies are needed to expand the present findings and clarify the uncertainty in the estimation of ssc by remote sensing in future studies we expect to develop more robust remote sensing based ssc measurement techniques in which the effects of hydrodynamic factors various vertical profiles of ssc and other site specific problems are adequately addressed credit authorship contribution statement siyoon kwon conceptualization formal analysis

216,elevation based hydrogeomorphic models are widely used to parsimoniously delineate floodplains with limited input data using topographic gradients to distinguish floodplain areas from hillslopes hydrogeomorphic models generally use scaling laws to assess flood flow depths as a function of contributing drainage areas floodplains are consequently mapped as those areas underlying maximum flood levels recent scientific literature has demonstrated that hydrogeomorphic models consistently perform from regional to global scale validating geomorphic floodplain delineations in diverse morphological and hydroclimatic river settings nevertheless the relationship between model fidelity basin morphology and basin hydroclimatic conditions is still unclear specifically further investigations on the applicability of scaling laws in semi arid and low gradient basins is needed in this work we investigated how climatic variability and basin slope can influence the parameterization of the abovementioned scaling laws in support of hydrogeomorphic floodplain modeling eleven basins in the west central united states were selected as case studies this research demonstrated that sub basins slope and annual rainfall are the most influential morphometric and climatic parameters on scaling law regressions specifically we found that scaling relationships are inconsistent in defining semi arid basin floodplains average annual rainfall lower than 570 mm with low gradient valley slopes lower than 5 1 introduction floodplain landscape evolution is controlled by a diverse and interlinked set of geologic geomorphic and hydrologic processes and conditions schumm 1985 the morphology of alluvial rivers depend on flow variability sediment supplies bank vegetation and the erosivity of underlying geology while floodplain shaping factors are driven by high magnitude discharges erosion and depositional patterns and river valley confinement beechie et al 2006 galloway and hobday 1996 gurnell et al 2012 montgomery and buffington 1997 furthermore flow and sediment variability depend on watershed scale hydrologic patterns and river gradients are governed by climate tectonic dynamics and geological settings empirical analyses provide geomorphic and hydrologic thresholds at which river morphology moves from meandering to braided conditions knighton and nanson 1993 leopold and wolman 1970 and the evolution of river morphology due to changes in river discharge and sediment load can also be caused by legacy of watershed and river alterations wohl et al 2017 and ongoing changes in climate hickin 2009 the spatial and temporal evolution of river patterns largely due to water driven erosion and deposition processes occurring for thousands of years results in a floodplain geomorphic footprint that can be extracted from topographic datasets such as digital elevation models dems as the spatial resolution and accuracy of dems have increased several dem based hydrogeomorphic models have been proposed for capturing the floodplain extension as natural landscape features dodov and foufoula georgiou 2006 jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 manfreda et al 2014 2015 nardi et al 2006 c samela et al 2017b sangwan and merwade 2015 sechu et al 2020 some of these approaches manfreda et al 2015 nardi et al 2006 2013 c samela et al 2017b employ scaling laws that relate channel geometry depth and width to discharge leopold and maddock 1953 or to contributing area dodov and foufoula georgiou 2004a scaling laws have been also investigated to hold for overbank flow conditions being validated to support floodplain hydraulic geometry analyses bhowmik 1984 nardi et al 2006 these hydrogeomorphic approaches have been applied at basin annis et al 2019 nardi et al 2013 f 2018 c samela et al 2017b continental c samela et al 2017a and global di baldassarre et al 2020 nardi et al 2019 scales hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation approaches do not require the estimation of flood hydrographs and detailed surveyed cross sections and instead require only dems that are widely available globally at different resolution and accuracy therefore hydrogeomorphic approaches are less sensitive to data scarcity and are more computationally efficient compared to hydraulic modeling however hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation approaches are not always defined based on a specific flooding recurrence interval and do not take in to account the role of hydraulic structures and climate change because they are conceptualized to delineate natural landscape features that have been historically shaped by the accumulated effects of floods of varying magnitudes di baldassarre et al 2020 therefore in lieu of identifying flood hazard areas for policy purposes hydrogeomorphic floodplain datasets can be adopted to quantitatively assess anthropogenic effects on natural floodplain environments such as evaluating for impact of levees on wetlands morrison et al 2018 or investigating floodplain connectivity patterns scheel et al 2019 moreover their computational efficiency and parsimony in terms of requested input data allow them to easily delineate floodplains of secondary river networks with greater coverage even in data scarce regions river basin morphology and specific landscape parameters such as channel slope hypsometric curve valley confinement and upstream channel initiation can influence how hydrogeomorphic models identify floodplain areas for example c samela et al 2017b determined different threshold values of their geomorphic flood index for flat versus hilly basins annis et al 2019 identified optimal scaling parameters for a hydrogeomorphic model by considering both dem resolution and stream order hierarchy which is related to river basin morphometry however since low order streams can also occur in the lower basin domains e g small tributaries in flat areas close to the river mouth it was found that a morphology driven scaling law parameterization based only on stream orders would not properly estimate floodplains along flat downstream small tributaries investigations in annis et al 2019 suggest that scaling law parameter regionalization should also consider climate drivers and in particular interdependencies of climatic variability with hydrogeomorphic forcing parametrizations studies on the impacts of integrated hydrogeomorphic and climate variability on floodplain delineations are sparse climatic conditions have a strong influence on the applicability of hydraulic geometry scaling laws at floodplain scales scaling relationships using contributing areas a as morphometric descriptor of channel flow depths d and channel width w hereafter referred to as d a and w a relationships tend to be subject of significant uncertainties when used to assess out of banks floodplain flow levels in humid environments channel dimensions tend to increase with contributing area such that downstream river segments are larger and convey more flow compared to upstream sections dodov and foufoula georgiou 2005 ferguson 1986 knighton 2014 semi arid and arid regions are more prone to have ephemeral rivers whose widths can oscillate decrease dunkerley 1992 or reach asymptotic values knighton and nanson 1993 tooth 2000 for example in arid australian rivers tooth 2009 observed a decrease in channel width as contributing areas increased in relatively small rivers but in larger rivers the relationship between channel width and contributing area was not consistent due to geological discontinuities merritt wohl 2003 observed that channel widths in an ephemeral arid stream were most sensitive to precipitation regimes as compared to channel depths furthermore the channel hydraulic geometry and floodplain areas are difficult to define in semi arid and arid environments bourke and pickup 1999 in low gradient dryland rivers well defined floodplains may be entirely absent tooth 2000 and in braided channel systems floodplains may exist as areas above low terraces graf 1988 or undefined zones adjacent to the channel characterized by a composite mixture of alluvial features parsons 1994 we believe there is a research gap in the quantitative estimation of scaling law parameters for large scale floodplain delineation based on varying climate and river basin morphometry in fact current continental or global hydrogeomorphic floodplain datasets provide constant power laws parameters regardless the abovementioned factors that influence the floodplain morphology therefore this work seeks to address this challenging knowledge gap and more specifically seeks to quantify the ranges of validity of d a relationship parameters for producing consistent floodplain delineations when applied in varying morphologic and climates regimes in this study we identify the morphometric and climatic attributes of a basin that most influence d a relationships for floodplains in semi arid and arid river systems unlike other studies focused on developing very accurate and high resolution floodplain datasets from lidar data clubb et al 2017 stout and belmont 2014 this work is focused on providing ranges of d a scaling laws parameters for continental global scale floodplain datasets the results of this work support the refinement of the hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification method developed by authors gfplain dataset and algorithm annis et al 2019 nardi et al 2019 by means of a novel regionalized application of scaling law parameters that reflect classified geomorphic and hydrologic conditions we used eleven river basins located in the central unites states as case study basins 2 study basins and available data we analysed eleven neighbouring river basins located in the states of colorado kansas nebraska new mexico oklahoma utah and wyoming usa fig 1 which we selected because of their significant variability in morphology and climate the basins are defined by the boundaries of their 2 digit hydrologic unit codes huc 2 seaber et al 1987 the total area of the adjoining basins is approximately 790 960 km2 selected climatic and morphometric parameters of the study basins are reported in table 1 and include basin areas elevation ranges slopes and average annual rainfall in addition the basins hydrologic monitoring network include a total of 583 u s geological survey usgs stage gages fig 1 the rivers of the eastern arid basins of study area experience large seasonal discharge fluctuations due to snow melt infiltration and evaporation losses the selected study domain is thus expected to be characterized by a complex set of large scale meteo climatic and tectonic changing dynamics interplaying with varying local geomorphic and hydrologic conditions to influence the floodplain and river geometry moreover significant human alterations to the watersheds and rivers have occurred in large portions of the study basins nadler and schumm 1981 including agriculture land use changes and irrigation diversions causing increased return flow higher water tables and the transformation of some rivers from intermittent to perennial systems lurtz et al 2020 these hydrologic alterations have led to dramatically changing floodplain vegetation and surface water patterns nadler and schumm 1981 and could influence the scaling law parameterization in the selected study area however since river alterations are globally widespread döll et al 2009 this work constitutes an opportunity to test the effectiveness of scaling laws in river basins with human alterations 2 1 topography rainfall and temperature data we used the nasadem dataset crippen et al 2016 at 1 arc resolution equivalent to approximately 28 8 m projected to the north american datum of 1983 universal transverse mercator 13 north nad83 utm13n nasadem reprocessed the original srtm radar signal and telemetry data with updated algorithms and auxiliary data not available at the time of the original srtm processing among the globally freely available dems the nasadem represents one of the most accurate high resolution topographic dataset available to date the usgs s high resolution national hydrography dataset nhdplus was used to recondition the dem avoiding potential stream network mapping artefacts due to flat areas or dem hydrologic impurities e g internal outlets planar slopes parallel channels we used the prism climate group s average annual rainfall dataset characterized by 865 m of horizontal spatial resolution for the 30 year period between 1981 and 2010 daly and bryant 2013 for average annual rainfall to each basin the basins are characterized by elevations ranging from 200 to 4400 m above sea level m asl the nasadem derived basin slope and average annual rainfall mm variables are shown respectively in fig 2 a and b the largest basin slopes and average annual rainfall observations are located in the central west part of the study area corresponding to the rocky mountains the areas surrounding the rocky mountains are relatively dry while higher an average rainfall is observed in the eastern part of the study domain we also used the global aridity index dataset trabucco a and zomer a 2018 zomer et al 2008 for the 1970 2000 period to characterize climatic variability in the basins the global aridity index is calculated as p pet where p and pet are the mean annual precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration unep 1997 zomer et al 2008 fig 2 c shows a wide variability of the aridity index in the study area where the rocky mountain region and the eastern portion of the study area are classified as sub humid to humid and the areas surrounding the rocky mountains vary from semi arid to arid 3 methodology this section depicts the methodology adopted in this study including preliminary steps for estimating the 100 years flood stages section 3 1 1 and the dem pre processing procedure section 3 1 2 then the methods employed to identify the morphological and climatic parameters that may have stronger influence on d a relationship performances in each basin sections 3 2 and 3 3 thus an assessment method is described to evaluate the suitability of d a scaling relationships to identify floodplains in basins with various ranges of climatic and geomorphic conditions section 3 4 and the procedure implemented for improving the application of the selected hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification model section 3 5 a general schematic flowchart of the entire methodology employed in this work is depicted in fig 3 3 1 preliminary steps 3 1 1 estimation of the flood stages at usgs gages we performed flood frequency analyses using discharge observations from usgs gages within each huc 2 basin to estimate the 100 year flood flow following the procedures outline in bulletin 17c u s water resources council hydrology committee 1981 we used data from gages that contained more than 30 years of records filtering out gages that did not contain peak annual data and flow records that had error codes to obtain the flood stage corresponding to the 100 year flood event the annual peak discharge and stage data reported for each gage was used to create a rating curve for each gage different regression distributions and a non parametrized generalized additive model gam hastie and tibshirani 1990 were fitted to these historical stage and discharge data so that the rating curve could be used to compute stage for any given discharge including extrapolating above observed values we found that the gam fitting method produced a higher nash sutcliffe efficiency for almost all gages additionally a visual inspection showed that the gam caught the breaks in slope of stage discharge curves more accurately than parameterized models such as generalized extreme value gev regressions a total of 570 gages were used for this study see supplementary material for detailed information on the selected usgs gages for each study basin note that almost every gage can be influenced by at least one weir or dam located in the upstream drainage area 3 1 2 dem pre processing we reconditioned the nasadem by means of the nhdplus high resolution stream network dataset using the archydro toolbox we derived a dataset of stream networks within each basin by applying pit filling flow direction and flow accumulation algorithms jenson and domingue 1988 to the reconditioned nasadem dataset following the criterion proposed by annis et al 2019 we chose a threshold area for the stream network extraction equal to 10 km2 for the 28 m cell sized nasadem for each usgs gages basins and sub basins and their related morphometric and climatic parameters were delineated according to the methodology illustrated in section 3 3 3 2 regression analysis of the d a scaling laws for each basin we represented 100 years flow depth gradients along the stream network produced during the dem pre processing step described in section 3 1 2 using a scaling law that relates contributing area a to flow depths d dodov and foufoula georgiou 2004b leopold and maddock 1953 as shown in the eq 1 this relationship includes parameters a and b which we determined by using flow depths and contributing areas at usgs gages within each huc 2 basin nardi et al 2006 f 2018 1 d a a b 3 3 analysis of the most influential morphometric and climatic parameters on the d a scaling law to evaluate the impact of basin morphology and climate on the d a scaling relationships we determined different morphometric and climatic characteristics see table 2 for each drainage area contributing to each of the 570 stage gages considered in the study area some of the characteristics reported in table 2 are related to an entire huc 2 basin while others are related to the partial sub basins created by gages located within each huc 2 we defined a sub basin as the drainage area associated with a particular gage excluding the drainage areas of other gages located upstream note that basins and sub basins are coincident where gages do not have other stage gages in their upstream drainage areas we sorted the 570 gages into classes bins according to each of the above mentioned characteristics with equal numbers of sub basins in each the number of classes were varied from 3 to 6 such that the minimum number of gauges per bin varies from 55 6 bins to 110 3 bins we developed power regressions of d a scaling relationships for each bin according to eq 1 we evaluated the fit of each regression using coefficient of determination values r2 and we assessed the pearson correlation between morphometric and climatic characteristics andd a regression fits by using r2 values furthermore we tested the sensitivity of bin sizing on changes the correlations between the fit of d a regression fits and different morphometric and climatic variables 3 4 scaling law regression analysis with varying morphometry and climate characteristics after determining the appropriate scaling parameters to use in d a scaling functions according to differences in basin morphometric and climate characteristics we evaluated the scaling functions along different strahler stream order hierarchies specifically we used pearson correlation coefficients standard deviation errors and p values with a significance level of 0 05 to relate the log log linear regression to varying morphometric and climatic characteristics within each stream order 3 5 development and application of a modified hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation model we explored whether the hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification algorithms nardi et al 2006 can be improved by using updated scaling parameters a and b from eq 1 for different ranges of morphometric and climate characteristics specifically we chose to evaluate the gfplain algorithm developed by nardi et al 2006 and simplified by nardi et al 2013 f 2018 in the gfplain model the scaling laws are applied in gis environment to each flow accumulation cell belonging to the stream network delineated as illustrated in section 3 1 2 then the water level derived by the scaling law is used to flag as floodplain all the low lying cells of the basin hydrologically connected to the abovementioned channel cell nardi et al 2019 note that the difference between the river bed elevation and the dem derived elevation at the stream network is neglected since the purpose of the gfplain model is not to replicate the same extension of the 100 years flood hazard maps but to have consistent scaling law parameters across varying climatic and morphometric basin settings this implies that the width of the hydrogeomorphic floodplain is usually wider than flood hazard maps especially because flood control structures are usually not included in current global dtms previous scientific studies applied the gfplain algorithm across a wide range of varying morphological and climatic conditions with fixed scaling law parameters and obtained consistent results as compared to standard flood hazard maps nardi et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2020 we compared the performance of the gfplain algorithm with updated scaling parameters to the original gfplain model using the critical success index csi and the true positive rate using as reference the fema flood maps https www fema gov flood maps in the study area these maps can be considered as an official dataset of floodplain extension related to a specific probability of occurrence and therefore can be considered a good reference for our proposed hydrogeomorphic floodplain dataset 4 results 4 1 regression of the d a relationships log log regression plots of d a relationships in each basin are reported in fig 4 and show that scaling law relationships widely vary among the basins all the basins with significant coefficient of determination values r2 show a positive trends in the d a relationship while other basins with flat e g north platte and smoky hill or negative republican curve are not significant in terms of r2 coefficient all regression results are statistically significant based on a p value of 0 05 except for cimarron north platte republican and smoky hill basins see table sm1 of the supplementary material this indicates that increases in drainage contributing areas do not always correlate with an increase of flow depths this is consistent with the climatic and morphometric nature of the selected non hortonian basins 4 2 sensitivity of regression analysis to sub basins morphometric and climatic parameters we assessed correlations between various morphometric and climatic variables and the overall fit of d a scaling relationships using r2 calculations as illustrated in section 3 2 fig 5 shows the r2 correlations between each variable and the fit of d a regressions using equally sized bins of sub basins varied between three and six according to their corresponding ranges of morphometric and climatic variables the partial slope psl 0 657 r2 0 961 and total basin circularity ratio tcr 0 772 r2 0 963 are the morphometric variables that have the strongest influence on the fit of d a regressions while the partial annual rainfall par 0 771 r2 0 968 is the most correlated climatic variable to the fit of d a regressions because psl pbr and tcr are strongly correlated to each other see correlation matrix in figure sm2 of the supplementary material the psl of a sub basin can serve as a single reference morphometric parameter for differentiating d a scaling relationships likewise the par can serve as a single reference climatic parameter for differentiating d a scaling relationships within a sub basin note that sub basins have a minimum partial contributing area of 10 km2 therefore psl and par can be considered representative variables of at least the lower portion of each sub basin near gage locations 4 3 regression analysis varying slope ranges the strength of d a scaling relationships varied for different ranges of sub basin slopes fig 6 the linear correlation of d a relationships strengthens as sub basin slopes increase with r2 0 008 for slopes between 2 and 5 and r2 0 626 for slopes between 26 and 56 similar results were obtained considering the tsl instead of the psl see section 1 6 of the supplementary material these results confirm that higher energy gradients tend to increase the flow peak and the water level with the increasing of contributing areas fig 7 shows increasing of person s correlation coefficient related to the d a regressions and the corresponding decreasing of standard deviation errors with increasing slope the d a regression for the lowest slope range is not statistically significant according to the p value test at 0 05 level see table sm 2 in the supplementary material in addition the slope of the d a relationship decreases as sub basin slope also decreases represented by the b parameter values in fig 7 indicating lower correlations between contributing areas and flow depth as average slope decreases we further analysed differences in d a relationships across sub basin slopes using the heat maps of variable slope ranges fig 8 p values fig 8b close to the northwest southeast diagonal are close or higher than 0 05 because of the small sample size fig 8a and should not be considered in the analysis it is clear that r2 fig 8c and standard deviations fig 8d tend to increase and decrease at both the lower and higher slope range thresholds 4 4 regression analysis varying slope and rainfall ranges the d a scaling relationships were found to slightly improve when considering higher ranges of average annual precipitation fig 9 shows heat maps of correlation coefficients top left panel and standard deviations top right panel of d a regressions for a range of sub basin slope rainfall combinations at higher slope ranges where d a regressions are strongest correlation coefficients generally increase and standard deviation errors generally decrease with increasing rainfall values though exceptions are noted such as the values related to the 16 26 and 439 574 mm ranges of sub basin slope and annual rainfall on the other hand similar patterns are not evident in flat areas slopes 5 where d a regressions perform poorly regardless the annual rainfall of the basins this is also confirmed by the lower panels of fig 9 which shows that b parameters increase bottom right panel and a parameters decrease bottom left panel with increasing average annual rainfall particularly for slopes greater than 5 moreover regression analyses for slopes greater than 16 are statistically significant according to their related p values table sm 3 fig 10 shows how regression performances vary after changing the lower limits of sub basin slopes and rainfall ranges in the sample values of r2 fig 10c and standard deviations fig 10d tend to improve when both the lower slope and rainfall thresholds are increased thus confirming that sub basin average rainfall influences the effectiveness of the d a regressions regardless of the sub basin slopes 4 5 regression analysis varying strahler stream orders we also considered the role of strahler stream orders in the variability of d a regression fits within the basins by using disparate slope and rainfall ranges for each stream order fig 11 we considered only two slope and rainfall ranges for each stream order to maintain larger sample sizes of each regression fig 11 shows that correlation coefficients and standard deviation errors generally improve for larger stream orders furthermore the a parameters generally decrease and the b parameters increase as slope and rainfall increase for smaller strahler stream orders e g order 2 3 higher stream order do not show clear patterns with varying slope and rainfall sets and p values are much higher than 0 05 see supplementary material this could be due to the fact that the analysis for higher stream orders is affected by the presence of hydraulic control structures in the study area see supplementary material 4 6 comparison of the different regression models before comparing the performance of the regression models an analysis of variance anova of the different classes of the regression models were done to test if the classes belong to different populations and differences in results were not due to stochastic errors inside each class the anova analysis was performed variables of both contributing areas and 100 years flow depths table 3 shows the anova results for the regression models described in sections 4 3 4 4 4 5 using a level of significance of 5 for all the regression models fisher snedecor f values and p values reject the null hypothesis p 0 05 indicating statistical significant differences among classes we compared the results of three regression models that estimated flow depths associated with the 100 year recurrence interval the three regression models included a simple d a regression illustrated in section 4 1 m0 a regression model with scaling parameters updated based on sub basins partial slope and annual rainfall m1 and a regression model with scaling parameters updated based on sub basins stream orders partial slope and annual rainfall m2 note that in stream orders where p values were greater than 0 05 we assigned the regression parameters obtained with the closer stream order at the same slope and rainfall range based on root mean square error values results from both m1 and m2 demonstrated an improvement in flow depth estimation compared to m0 table 4 the selected case study is characterized by several flow control structures e g dams weirs that affect almost all the analysed subbasins flow control structures can have a negative influence on the regression model performances using the national inventory of dams nid dataset usace 2015 we observed higher values of rmse with the increase of the total regulation volumes of the flow control structures aggregated per stream orders see figure sm7 of the supplementary material 4 7 gfplain hydrogeomorphic floodplain refined parametrization adopting the proposed climate and morphometry varying scaling law furthermore to explore whether the hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification algorithms can be improved by using flexible scaling parameters we modified the gfplain hydrogeomorphic model developed by nardi et al 2006 f 2018 to automatically vary the parameterization of the scaling laws with the defined ranges of partial slopes and average annual rainfall of the drainage basins belonging to each stream of the computational domain m2 and we compared the floodplain areas produced by updated gfplain algorithm to standard flood hazard maps fema return period 100 years using csi and tp indices we also compared the simulated floodplain areas identified using gfplain without updated scaling parameters based on sub basin slope and rainfall m0 the csi and tp values comparing the two hydrogeomorphic floodplain results to the standard flood hazard maps in each sub basin where fema maps were available are showed in fig 12 note that standard flood hazard maps are not expected to be perfectly aligned with results from the hydrogeomorphic floodplain models since the latter is aimed to delineate floodplain areas derived by the erosion and deposition processes occurring over millennial without considering recent anthropic modifications to rivers such as levees bridges weirs and dams therefore absolute values of csi are not relevant but relative values of csi obtained for different hydrogeomorphic models can give information on their suitability since standard flood maps are derived by hydrologic and hydraulic models that consider climate and morphometry of the study areas both the csi and tp values for m2 are respectively higher compared to values for m0 most notably tp values this indicates that the hydrogeomorphic floodplain model can reduce the underestimation of the floodplain extension confirming that parameterization of the d a scaling law considering slope and rainfall ranges is able to delineate more accurate floodplain extensions a map of the hydrogeomorphic delineated floodplain dataset is showed in fig 13 insets show a comparison with the gfplain250m dataset nardi et al 2019 in areas with different climate and morphometry note that m2 and gfplain datasets are characterized by different resolution respectively 30 and 250 m however different floodplain extents illustrated in the 5 insets of fig 13 are mostly due to the different d a scaling law parameterization that led to different flow depths distributions 5 discussion the proposed analysis demonstrated that partial sub basins slope psl and partial average annual rainfall apr are among the most influential morphometric and climatic factors in the applicability of the depth contributing area d a regression laws psl and par are also suitable for performing fast large scale analysis in gis environment since they can be easily determined with a simple zonal statistic using available datasets for sub basin boundaries slope and rainfall on the other hand variables such tcr tsl and tar require a much higher computational effort the mean basin slope strongly correlated with the partial sub basin slope as showed in figure sm2 of the supplementary material has been shown to be one of the most relevant morphological correlated with inundation extent jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 and processes of channel floodplain morphology such as sediment dynamics are related to annual precipitation langbein and schumm 1958 similar regression results in terms of scaling law parameters and performance metrics were obtained considering tsl and tar ranges see section 1 6 of the supplementary material confirming that psl and par for sub basins with at least 10 km2 of partial area can be considered adequate variables for disaggregating scaling laws parameterizations when d a regression law is disaggregated for different ranges of the above mentioned parameters low values of person s correlation coefficient are obtained for sub basins with small slope ranges this behavior underlines the strong limitation of using scaling laws in dry and flat areas were basin gradients are unable to generate the sufficient energy to increase the flow peak with the increasing of contributing areas on the other hand d a scaling law regressions give higher correlation and lower standard deviation errors average annual rainfall increases regardless of the slope range this indicates that the effectiveness of scaling laws in steep basins is weakly depending on the dryness of the studied areas the adopted gfplain model was previously applied using constant parametrization of the scaling law producing consistent results of floodplain delineations maps nardi et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2020 and demonstrated the model can consistently identify floodplain surfaces created by fluvial erosion deposition processes at a global scale regardless of the climatic and morphometric basins settings nevertheless when evaluating the gfplain results at smaller scales it is clear that inaccuracies may be present especially where the topography based principle does not hold as it may happen in arid regions and in river basins where hortonian surface runoff are not the major drivers of fluvial shaping dynamics as a result this study provided an improvement of the gfplain model by suggesting a regionalized d a scaling law that takes into account the morpho climatic conditions results confirm that the validity or range of inapplicability of the scaling law in particular our results suggest the following range of validity for the selected study basins sub basins slope higher than 5 average annual rainfall higher than 570 mm moreover for the scaling laws corresponding to 100 years return period depths the following regionalized scaling law parametrization may be applied a parameter varies from 1 5 slopes lower than 16 to 0 054 slopes greater than 26 and average annual rainfall higher than 725 mm b parameter varies from 0 05 slopes lower than 16 to 1 18 slopes greater than 26 and average annual rainfall higher than 725 mm since these parameters ranges proved to be effective at improving a hydrogeomorphic model with a widely available dem nasadem crippen et al 2016 they can be adopted in other river basins with similar ranges of slopes and rainfall we recognize that water management infrastructure such as dams diversions and levees can influence floodplain connectivity and flood recurrence calculations further investigations should be conducted to understand how basins with flow control structures can influence d a scaling law regressions compared to unregulated river basins this work demonstrated some influence of reservoir storage on parameterization within stream orders see figure sm7 in the supplementary material but further comparisons should be carried out specifically a comparison of scaling law parameterizations of the analysed case study with other unregulated river basins with same ranges of basin slope and rainfall are needed the outcomes of the proposed analysis may pave the way for improving large scale floodplain delineation datasets such as gfplain considering morphometric and climatic factors that are freely available at global scale moreover these outcomes can support improvements of other floodplain delineation methods based on scaling laws c samela et al 2017c or refinement of datasets aimed to provide channel depth estimations for large scale e g continental or global flood models andreadis et al 2013 6 conclusions in this paper we investigated the applicability and the parameterization of contributing areas a floodplain flow depths d scaling laws for different ranges of partial sub basins slope and average annual rainfall to improve a hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation model partial sub basin slope and mean annual rainfall were chosen after a preliminary analysis on the most influential factor of several basins parameters on the effectiveness of d a regression laws as case studies we selected eleven river basins in the united states characterized by high variability of slopes elevations and average annual rainfall the main conclusions derived by the analyses are summarized below low correlation coefficients related to the regression laws were observed for sub basins characterized by mean slopes lower than 5 for the sub basins with mean slopes higher than 5 the scaling law parameters are correlated to intervals of sub basins slopes specifically the a parameter tends decrease while the exponent b tend to increase with the increasing of mean slope intervals for the same mean slope ranges the a parameter weakly tends decrease while the exponent b and the correlation coefficient tend to increase with the increasing of average annual rainfall a hydro geomorphic floodplain model based on the d a scaling law formula application has been improved considering parameterizations for different stream orders and intervals of slopes and average annual rainfall the modified model provided better results in terms of floodplain extensions compared to the standard hazard flood maps as respect to the standard regression model further investigations for improving the hydrogeomorphic model are required in different climatic areas and in flat and dry areas where scaling laws have poor correlations and where

216,elevation based hydrogeomorphic models are widely used to parsimoniously delineate floodplains with limited input data using topographic gradients to distinguish floodplain areas from hillslopes hydrogeomorphic models generally use scaling laws to assess flood flow depths as a function of contributing drainage areas floodplains are consequently mapped as those areas underlying maximum flood levels recent scientific literature has demonstrated that hydrogeomorphic models consistently perform from regional to global scale validating geomorphic floodplain delineations in diverse morphological and hydroclimatic river settings nevertheless the relationship between model fidelity basin morphology and basin hydroclimatic conditions is still unclear specifically further investigations on the applicability of scaling laws in semi arid and low gradient basins is needed in this work we investigated how climatic variability and basin slope can influence the parameterization of the abovementioned scaling laws in support of hydrogeomorphic floodplain modeling eleven basins in the west central united states were selected as case studies this research demonstrated that sub basins slope and annual rainfall are the most influential morphometric and climatic parameters on scaling law regressions specifically we found that scaling relationships are inconsistent in defining semi arid basin floodplains average annual rainfall lower than 570 mm with low gradient valley slopes lower than 5 1 introduction floodplain landscape evolution is controlled by a diverse and interlinked set of geologic geomorphic and hydrologic processes and conditions schumm 1985 the morphology of alluvial rivers depend on flow variability sediment supplies bank vegetation and the erosivity of underlying geology while floodplain shaping factors are driven by high magnitude discharges erosion and depositional patterns and river valley confinement beechie et al 2006 galloway and hobday 1996 gurnell et al 2012 montgomery and buffington 1997 furthermore flow and sediment variability depend on watershed scale hydrologic patterns and river gradients are governed by climate tectonic dynamics and geological settings empirical analyses provide geomorphic and hydrologic thresholds at which river morphology moves from meandering to braided conditions knighton and nanson 1993 leopold and wolman 1970 and the evolution of river morphology due to changes in river discharge and sediment load can also be caused by legacy of watershed and river alterations wohl et al 2017 and ongoing changes in climate hickin 2009 the spatial and temporal evolution of river patterns largely due to water driven erosion and deposition processes occurring for thousands of years results in a floodplain geomorphic footprint that can be extracted from topographic datasets such as digital elevation models dems as the spatial resolution and accuracy of dems have increased several dem based hydrogeomorphic models have been proposed for capturing the floodplain extension as natural landscape features dodov and foufoula georgiou 2006 jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 manfreda et al 2014 2015 nardi et al 2006 c samela et al 2017b sangwan and merwade 2015 sechu et al 2020 some of these approaches manfreda et al 2015 nardi et al 2006 2013 c samela et al 2017b employ scaling laws that relate channel geometry depth and width to discharge leopold and maddock 1953 or to contributing area dodov and foufoula georgiou 2004a scaling laws have been also investigated to hold for overbank flow conditions being validated to support floodplain hydraulic geometry analyses bhowmik 1984 nardi et al 2006 these hydrogeomorphic approaches have been applied at basin annis et al 2019 nardi et al 2013 f 2018 c samela et al 2017b continental c samela et al 2017a and global di baldassarre et al 2020 nardi et al 2019 scales hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation approaches do not require the estimation of flood hydrographs and detailed surveyed cross sections and instead require only dems that are widely available globally at different resolution and accuracy therefore hydrogeomorphic approaches are less sensitive to data scarcity and are more computationally efficient compared to hydraulic modeling however hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation approaches are not always defined based on a specific flooding recurrence interval and do not take in to account the role of hydraulic structures and climate change because they are conceptualized to delineate natural landscape features that have been historically shaped by the accumulated effects of floods of varying magnitudes di baldassarre et al 2020 therefore in lieu of identifying flood hazard areas for policy purposes hydrogeomorphic floodplain datasets can be adopted to quantitatively assess anthropogenic effects on natural floodplain environments such as evaluating for impact of levees on wetlands morrison et al 2018 or investigating floodplain connectivity patterns scheel et al 2019 moreover their computational efficiency and parsimony in terms of requested input data allow them to easily delineate floodplains of secondary river networks with greater coverage even in data scarce regions river basin morphology and specific landscape parameters such as channel slope hypsometric curve valley confinement and upstream channel initiation can influence how hydrogeomorphic models identify floodplain areas for example c samela et al 2017b determined different threshold values of their geomorphic flood index for flat versus hilly basins annis et al 2019 identified optimal scaling parameters for a hydrogeomorphic model by considering both dem resolution and stream order hierarchy which is related to river basin morphometry however since low order streams can also occur in the lower basin domains e g small tributaries in flat areas close to the river mouth it was found that a morphology driven scaling law parameterization based only on stream orders would not properly estimate floodplains along flat downstream small tributaries investigations in annis et al 2019 suggest that scaling law parameter regionalization should also consider climate drivers and in particular interdependencies of climatic variability with hydrogeomorphic forcing parametrizations studies on the impacts of integrated hydrogeomorphic and climate variability on floodplain delineations are sparse climatic conditions have a strong influence on the applicability of hydraulic geometry scaling laws at floodplain scales scaling relationships using contributing areas a as morphometric descriptor of channel flow depths d and channel width w hereafter referred to as d a and w a relationships tend to be subject of significant uncertainties when used to assess out of banks floodplain flow levels in humid environments channel dimensions tend to increase with contributing area such that downstream river segments are larger and convey more flow compared to upstream sections dodov and foufoula georgiou 2005 ferguson 1986 knighton 2014 semi arid and arid regions are more prone to have ephemeral rivers whose widths can oscillate decrease dunkerley 1992 or reach asymptotic values knighton and nanson 1993 tooth 2000 for example in arid australian rivers tooth 2009 observed a decrease in channel width as contributing areas increased in relatively small rivers but in larger rivers the relationship between channel width and contributing area was not consistent due to geological discontinuities merritt wohl 2003 observed that channel widths in an ephemeral arid stream were most sensitive to precipitation regimes as compared to channel depths furthermore the channel hydraulic geometry and floodplain areas are difficult to define in semi arid and arid environments bourke and pickup 1999 in low gradient dryland rivers well defined floodplains may be entirely absent tooth 2000 and in braided channel systems floodplains may exist as areas above low terraces graf 1988 or undefined zones adjacent to the channel characterized by a composite mixture of alluvial features parsons 1994 we believe there is a research gap in the quantitative estimation of scaling law parameters for large scale floodplain delineation based on varying climate and river basin morphometry in fact current continental or global hydrogeomorphic floodplain datasets provide constant power laws parameters regardless the abovementioned factors that influence the floodplain morphology therefore this work seeks to address this challenging knowledge gap and more specifically seeks to quantify the ranges of validity of d a relationship parameters for producing consistent floodplain delineations when applied in varying morphologic and climates regimes in this study we identify the morphometric and climatic attributes of a basin that most influence d a relationships for floodplains in semi arid and arid river systems unlike other studies focused on developing very accurate and high resolution floodplain datasets from lidar data clubb et al 2017 stout and belmont 2014 this work is focused on providing ranges of d a scaling laws parameters for continental global scale floodplain datasets the results of this work support the refinement of the hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification method developed by authors gfplain dataset and algorithm annis et al 2019 nardi et al 2019 by means of a novel regionalized application of scaling law parameters that reflect classified geomorphic and hydrologic conditions we used eleven river basins located in the central unites states as case study basins 2 study basins and available data we analysed eleven neighbouring river basins located in the states of colorado kansas nebraska new mexico oklahoma utah and wyoming usa fig 1 which we selected because of their significant variability in morphology and climate the basins are defined by the boundaries of their 2 digit hydrologic unit codes huc 2 seaber et al 1987 the total area of the adjoining basins is approximately 790 960 km2 selected climatic and morphometric parameters of the study basins are reported in table 1 and include basin areas elevation ranges slopes and average annual rainfall in addition the basins hydrologic monitoring network include a total of 583 u s geological survey usgs stage gages fig 1 the rivers of the eastern arid basins of study area experience large seasonal discharge fluctuations due to snow melt infiltration and evaporation losses the selected study domain is thus expected to be characterized by a complex set of large scale meteo climatic and tectonic changing dynamics interplaying with varying local geomorphic and hydrologic conditions to influence the floodplain and river geometry moreover significant human alterations to the watersheds and rivers have occurred in large portions of the study basins nadler and schumm 1981 including agriculture land use changes and irrigation diversions causing increased return flow higher water tables and the transformation of some rivers from intermittent to perennial systems lurtz et al 2020 these hydrologic alterations have led to dramatically changing floodplain vegetation and surface water patterns nadler and schumm 1981 and could influence the scaling law parameterization in the selected study area however since river alterations are globally widespread döll et al 2009 this work constitutes an opportunity to test the effectiveness of scaling laws in river basins with human alterations 2 1 topography rainfall and temperature data we used the nasadem dataset crippen et al 2016 at 1 arc resolution equivalent to approximately 28 8 m projected to the north american datum of 1983 universal transverse mercator 13 north nad83 utm13n nasadem reprocessed the original srtm radar signal and telemetry data with updated algorithms and auxiliary data not available at the time of the original srtm processing among the globally freely available dems the nasadem represents one of the most accurate high resolution topographic dataset available to date the usgs s high resolution national hydrography dataset nhdplus was used to recondition the dem avoiding potential stream network mapping artefacts due to flat areas or dem hydrologic impurities e g internal outlets planar slopes parallel channels we used the prism climate group s average annual rainfall dataset characterized by 865 m of horizontal spatial resolution for the 30 year period between 1981 and 2010 daly and bryant 2013 for average annual rainfall to each basin the basins are characterized by elevations ranging from 200 to 4400 m above sea level m asl the nasadem derived basin slope and average annual rainfall mm variables are shown respectively in fig 2 a and b the largest basin slopes and average annual rainfall observations are located in the central west part of the study area corresponding to the rocky mountains the areas surrounding the rocky mountains are relatively dry while higher an average rainfall is observed in the eastern part of the study domain we also used the global aridity index dataset trabucco a and zomer a 2018 zomer et al 2008 for the 1970 2000 period to characterize climatic variability in the basins the global aridity index is calculated as p pet where p and pet are the mean annual precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration unep 1997 zomer et al 2008 fig 2 c shows a wide variability of the aridity index in the study area where the rocky mountain region and the eastern portion of the study area are classified as sub humid to humid and the areas surrounding the rocky mountains vary from semi arid to arid 3 methodology this section depicts the methodology adopted in this study including preliminary steps for estimating the 100 years flood stages section 3 1 1 and the dem pre processing procedure section 3 1 2 then the methods employed to identify the morphological and climatic parameters that may have stronger influence on d a relationship performances in each basin sections 3 2 and 3 3 thus an assessment method is described to evaluate the suitability of d a scaling relationships to identify floodplains in basins with various ranges of climatic and geomorphic conditions section 3 4 and the procedure implemented for improving the application of the selected hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification model section 3 5 a general schematic flowchart of the entire methodology employed in this work is depicted in fig 3 3 1 preliminary steps 3 1 1 estimation of the flood stages at usgs gages we performed flood frequency analyses using discharge observations from usgs gages within each huc 2 basin to estimate the 100 year flood flow following the procedures outline in bulletin 17c u s water resources council hydrology committee 1981 we used data from gages that contained more than 30 years of records filtering out gages that did not contain peak annual data and flow records that had error codes to obtain the flood stage corresponding to the 100 year flood event the annual peak discharge and stage data reported for each gage was used to create a rating curve for each gage different regression distributions and a non parametrized generalized additive model gam hastie and tibshirani 1990 were fitted to these historical stage and discharge data so that the rating curve could be used to compute stage for any given discharge including extrapolating above observed values we found that the gam fitting method produced a higher nash sutcliffe efficiency for almost all gages additionally a visual inspection showed that the gam caught the breaks in slope of stage discharge curves more accurately than parameterized models such as generalized extreme value gev regressions a total of 570 gages were used for this study see supplementary material for detailed information on the selected usgs gages for each study basin note that almost every gage can be influenced by at least one weir or dam located in the upstream drainage area 3 1 2 dem pre processing we reconditioned the nasadem by means of the nhdplus high resolution stream network dataset using the archydro toolbox we derived a dataset of stream networks within each basin by applying pit filling flow direction and flow accumulation algorithms jenson and domingue 1988 to the reconditioned nasadem dataset following the criterion proposed by annis et al 2019 we chose a threshold area for the stream network extraction equal to 10 km2 for the 28 m cell sized nasadem for each usgs gages basins and sub basins and their related morphometric and climatic parameters were delineated according to the methodology illustrated in section 3 3 3 2 regression analysis of the d a scaling laws for each basin we represented 100 years flow depth gradients along the stream network produced during the dem pre processing step described in section 3 1 2 using a scaling law that relates contributing area a to flow depths d dodov and foufoula georgiou 2004b leopold and maddock 1953 as shown in the eq 1 this relationship includes parameters a and b which we determined by using flow depths and contributing areas at usgs gages within each huc 2 basin nardi et al 2006 f 2018 1 d a a b 3 3 analysis of the most influential morphometric and climatic parameters on the d a scaling law to evaluate the impact of basin morphology and climate on the d a scaling relationships we determined different morphometric and climatic characteristics see table 2 for each drainage area contributing to each of the 570 stage gages considered in the study area some of the characteristics reported in table 2 are related to an entire huc 2 basin while others are related to the partial sub basins created by gages located within each huc 2 we defined a sub basin as the drainage area associated with a particular gage excluding the drainage areas of other gages located upstream note that basins and sub basins are coincident where gages do not have other stage gages in their upstream drainage areas we sorted the 570 gages into classes bins according to each of the above mentioned characteristics with equal numbers of sub basins in each the number of classes were varied from 3 to 6 such that the minimum number of gauges per bin varies from 55 6 bins to 110 3 bins we developed power regressions of d a scaling relationships for each bin according to eq 1 we evaluated the fit of each regression using coefficient of determination values r2 and we assessed the pearson correlation between morphometric and climatic characteristics andd a regression fits by using r2 values furthermore we tested the sensitivity of bin sizing on changes the correlations between the fit of d a regression fits and different morphometric and climatic variables 3 4 scaling law regression analysis with varying morphometry and climate characteristics after determining the appropriate scaling parameters to use in d a scaling functions according to differences in basin morphometric and climate characteristics we evaluated the scaling functions along different strahler stream order hierarchies specifically we used pearson correlation coefficients standard deviation errors and p values with a significance level of 0 05 to relate the log log linear regression to varying morphometric and climatic characteristics within each stream order 3 5 development and application of a modified hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation model we explored whether the hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification algorithms nardi et al 2006 can be improved by using updated scaling parameters a and b from eq 1 for different ranges of morphometric and climate characteristics specifically we chose to evaluate the gfplain algorithm developed by nardi et al 2006 and simplified by nardi et al 2013 f 2018 in the gfplain model the scaling laws are applied in gis environment to each flow accumulation cell belonging to the stream network delineated as illustrated in section 3 1 2 then the water level derived by the scaling law is used to flag as floodplain all the low lying cells of the basin hydrologically connected to the abovementioned channel cell nardi et al 2019 note that the difference between the river bed elevation and the dem derived elevation at the stream network is neglected since the purpose of the gfplain model is not to replicate the same extension of the 100 years flood hazard maps but to have consistent scaling law parameters across varying climatic and morphometric basin settings this implies that the width of the hydrogeomorphic floodplain is usually wider than flood hazard maps especially because flood control structures are usually not included in current global dtms previous scientific studies applied the gfplain algorithm across a wide range of varying morphological and climatic conditions with fixed scaling law parameters and obtained consistent results as compared to standard flood hazard maps nardi et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2020 we compared the performance of the gfplain algorithm with updated scaling parameters to the original gfplain model using the critical success index csi and the true positive rate using as reference the fema flood maps https www fema gov flood maps in the study area these maps can be considered as an official dataset of floodplain extension related to a specific probability of occurrence and therefore can be considered a good reference for our proposed hydrogeomorphic floodplain dataset 4 results 4 1 regression of the d a relationships log log regression plots of d a relationships in each basin are reported in fig 4 and show that scaling law relationships widely vary among the basins all the basins with significant coefficient of determination values r2 show a positive trends in the d a relationship while other basins with flat e g north platte and smoky hill or negative republican curve are not significant in terms of r2 coefficient all regression results are statistically significant based on a p value of 0 05 except for cimarron north platte republican and smoky hill basins see table sm1 of the supplementary material this indicates that increases in drainage contributing areas do not always correlate with an increase of flow depths this is consistent with the climatic and morphometric nature of the selected non hortonian basins 4 2 sensitivity of regression analysis to sub basins morphometric and climatic parameters we assessed correlations between various morphometric and climatic variables and the overall fit of d a scaling relationships using r2 calculations as illustrated in section 3 2 fig 5 shows the r2 correlations between each variable and the fit of d a regressions using equally sized bins of sub basins varied between three and six according to their corresponding ranges of morphometric and climatic variables the partial slope psl 0 657 r2 0 961 and total basin circularity ratio tcr 0 772 r2 0 963 are the morphometric variables that have the strongest influence on the fit of d a regressions while the partial annual rainfall par 0 771 r2 0 968 is the most correlated climatic variable to the fit of d a regressions because psl pbr and tcr are strongly correlated to each other see correlation matrix in figure sm2 of the supplementary material the psl of a sub basin can serve as a single reference morphometric parameter for differentiating d a scaling relationships likewise the par can serve as a single reference climatic parameter for differentiating d a scaling relationships within a sub basin note that sub basins have a minimum partial contributing area of 10 km2 therefore psl and par can be considered representative variables of at least the lower portion of each sub basin near gage locations 4 3 regression analysis varying slope ranges the strength of d a scaling relationships varied for different ranges of sub basin slopes fig 6 the linear correlation of d a relationships strengthens as sub basin slopes increase with r2 0 008 for slopes between 2 and 5 and r2 0 626 for slopes between 26 and 56 similar results were obtained considering the tsl instead of the psl see section 1 6 of the supplementary material these results confirm that higher energy gradients tend to increase the flow peak and the water level with the increasing of contributing areas fig 7 shows increasing of person s correlation coefficient related to the d a regressions and the corresponding decreasing of standard deviation errors with increasing slope the d a regression for the lowest slope range is not statistically significant according to the p value test at 0 05 level see table sm 2 in the supplementary material in addition the slope of the d a relationship decreases as sub basin slope also decreases represented by the b parameter values in fig 7 indicating lower correlations between contributing areas and flow depth as average slope decreases we further analysed differences in d a relationships across sub basin slopes using the heat maps of variable slope ranges fig 8 p values fig 8b close to the northwest southeast diagonal are close or higher than 0 05 because of the small sample size fig 8a and should not be considered in the analysis it is clear that r2 fig 8c and standard deviations fig 8d tend to increase and decrease at both the lower and higher slope range thresholds 4 4 regression analysis varying slope and rainfall ranges the d a scaling relationships were found to slightly improve when considering higher ranges of average annual precipitation fig 9 shows heat maps of correlation coefficients top left panel and standard deviations top right panel of d a regressions for a range of sub basin slope rainfall combinations at higher slope ranges where d a regressions are strongest correlation coefficients generally increase and standard deviation errors generally decrease with increasing rainfall values though exceptions are noted such as the values related to the 16 26 and 439 574 mm ranges of sub basin slope and annual rainfall on the other hand similar patterns are not evident in flat areas slopes 5 where d a regressions perform poorly regardless the annual rainfall of the basins this is also confirmed by the lower panels of fig 9 which shows that b parameters increase bottom right panel and a parameters decrease bottom left panel with increasing average annual rainfall particularly for slopes greater than 5 moreover regression analyses for slopes greater than 16 are statistically significant according to their related p values table sm 3 fig 10 shows how regression performances vary after changing the lower limits of sub basin slopes and rainfall ranges in the sample values of r2 fig 10c and standard deviations fig 10d tend to improve when both the lower slope and rainfall thresholds are increased thus confirming that sub basin average rainfall influences the effectiveness of the d a regressions regardless of the sub basin slopes 4 5 regression analysis varying strahler stream orders we also considered the role of strahler stream orders in the variability of d a regression fits within the basins by using disparate slope and rainfall ranges for each stream order fig 11 we considered only two slope and rainfall ranges for each stream order to maintain larger sample sizes of each regression fig 11 shows that correlation coefficients and standard deviation errors generally improve for larger stream orders furthermore the a parameters generally decrease and the b parameters increase as slope and rainfall increase for smaller strahler stream orders e g order 2 3 higher stream order do not show clear patterns with varying slope and rainfall sets and p values are much higher than 0 05 see supplementary material this could be due to the fact that the analysis for higher stream orders is affected by the presence of hydraulic control structures in the study area see supplementary material 4 6 comparison of the different regression models before comparing the performance of the regression models an analysis of variance anova of the different classes of the regression models were done to test if the classes belong to different populations and differences in results were not due to stochastic errors inside each class the anova analysis was performed variables of both contributing areas and 100 years flow depths table 3 shows the anova results for the regression models described in sections 4 3 4 4 4 5 using a level of significance of 5 for all the regression models fisher snedecor f values and p values reject the null hypothesis p 0 05 indicating statistical significant differences among classes we compared the results of three regression models that estimated flow depths associated with the 100 year recurrence interval the three regression models included a simple d a regression illustrated in section 4 1 m0 a regression model with scaling parameters updated based on sub basins partial slope and annual rainfall m1 and a regression model with scaling parameters updated based on sub basins stream orders partial slope and annual rainfall m2 note that in stream orders where p values were greater than 0 05 we assigned the regression parameters obtained with the closer stream order at the same slope and rainfall range based on root mean square error values results from both m1 and m2 demonstrated an improvement in flow depth estimation compared to m0 table 4 the selected case study is characterized by several flow control structures e g dams weirs that affect almost all the analysed subbasins flow control structures can have a negative influence on the regression model performances using the national inventory of dams nid dataset usace 2015 we observed higher values of rmse with the increase of the total regulation volumes of the flow control structures aggregated per stream orders see figure sm7 of the supplementary material 4 7 gfplain hydrogeomorphic floodplain refined parametrization adopting the proposed climate and morphometry varying scaling law furthermore to explore whether the hydrogeomorphic floodplain identification algorithms can be improved by using flexible scaling parameters we modified the gfplain hydrogeomorphic model developed by nardi et al 2006 f 2018 to automatically vary the parameterization of the scaling laws with the defined ranges of partial slopes and average annual rainfall of the drainage basins belonging to each stream of the computational domain m2 and we compared the floodplain areas produced by updated gfplain algorithm to standard flood hazard maps fema return period 100 years using csi and tp indices we also compared the simulated floodplain areas identified using gfplain without updated scaling parameters based on sub basin slope and rainfall m0 the csi and tp values comparing the two hydrogeomorphic floodplain results to the standard flood hazard maps in each sub basin where fema maps were available are showed in fig 12 note that standard flood hazard maps are not expected to be perfectly aligned with results from the hydrogeomorphic floodplain models since the latter is aimed to delineate floodplain areas derived by the erosion and deposition processes occurring over millennial without considering recent anthropic modifications to rivers such as levees bridges weirs and dams therefore absolute values of csi are not relevant but relative values of csi obtained for different hydrogeomorphic models can give information on their suitability since standard flood maps are derived by hydrologic and hydraulic models that consider climate and morphometry of the study areas both the csi and tp values for m2 are respectively higher compared to values for m0 most notably tp values this indicates that the hydrogeomorphic floodplain model can reduce the underestimation of the floodplain extension confirming that parameterization of the d a scaling law considering slope and rainfall ranges is able to delineate more accurate floodplain extensions a map of the hydrogeomorphic delineated floodplain dataset is showed in fig 13 insets show a comparison with the gfplain250m dataset nardi et al 2019 in areas with different climate and morphometry note that m2 and gfplain datasets are characterized by different resolution respectively 30 and 250 m however different floodplain extents illustrated in the 5 insets of fig 13 are mostly due to the different d a scaling law parameterization that led to different flow depths distributions 5 discussion the proposed analysis demonstrated that partial sub basins slope psl and partial average annual rainfall apr are among the most influential morphometric and climatic factors in the applicability of the depth contributing area d a regression laws psl and par are also suitable for performing fast large scale analysis in gis environment since they can be easily determined with a simple zonal statistic using available datasets for sub basin boundaries slope and rainfall on the other hand variables such tcr tsl and tar require a much higher computational effort the mean basin slope strongly correlated with the partial sub basin slope as showed in figure sm2 of the supplementary material has been shown to be one of the most relevant morphological correlated with inundation extent jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 and processes of channel floodplain morphology such as sediment dynamics are related to annual precipitation langbein and schumm 1958 similar regression results in terms of scaling law parameters and performance metrics were obtained considering tsl and tar ranges see section 1 6 of the supplementary material confirming that psl and par for sub basins with at least 10 km2 of partial area can be considered adequate variables for disaggregating scaling laws parameterizations when d a regression law is disaggregated for different ranges of the above mentioned parameters low values of person s correlation coefficient are obtained for sub basins with small slope ranges this behavior underlines the strong limitation of using scaling laws in dry and flat areas were basin gradients are unable to generate the sufficient energy to increase the flow peak with the increasing of contributing areas on the other hand d a scaling law regressions give higher correlation and lower standard deviation errors average annual rainfall increases regardless of the slope range this indicates that the effectiveness of scaling laws in steep basins is weakly depending on the dryness of the studied areas the adopted gfplain model was previously applied using constant parametrization of the scaling law producing consistent results of floodplain delineations maps nardi et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2020 and demonstrated the model can consistently identify floodplain surfaces created by fluvial erosion deposition processes at a global scale regardless of the climatic and morphometric basins settings nevertheless when evaluating the gfplain results at smaller scales it is clear that inaccuracies may be present especially where the topography based principle does not hold as it may happen in arid regions and in river basins where hortonian surface runoff are not the major drivers of fluvial shaping dynamics as a result this study provided an improvement of the gfplain model by suggesting a regionalized d a scaling law that takes into account the morpho climatic conditions results confirm that the validity or range of inapplicability of the scaling law in particular our results suggest the following range of validity for the selected study basins sub basins slope higher than 5 average annual rainfall higher than 570 mm moreover for the scaling laws corresponding to 100 years return period depths the following regionalized scaling law parametrization may be applied a parameter varies from 1 5 slopes lower than 16 to 0 054 slopes greater than 26 and average annual rainfall higher than 725 mm b parameter varies from 0 05 slopes lower than 16 to 1 18 slopes greater than 26 and average annual rainfall higher than 725 mm since these parameters ranges proved to be effective at improving a hydrogeomorphic model with a widely available dem nasadem crippen et al 2016 they can be adopted in other river basins with similar ranges of slopes and rainfall we recognize that water management infrastructure such as dams diversions and levees can influence floodplain connectivity and flood recurrence calculations further investigations should be conducted to understand how basins with flow control structures

hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation model partial sub basin slope and mean annual rainfall were chosen after a preliminary analysis on the most influential factor of several basins parameters on the effectiveness of d a regression laws as case studies we selected eleven river basins in the united states characterized by high variability of slopes elevations and average annual rainfall the main conclusions derived by the analyses are summarized below low correlation coefficients related to the regression laws were observed for sub basins characterized by mean slopes lower than 5 for the sub basins with mean slopes higher than 5 the scaling law parameters are correlated to intervals of sub basins slopes specifically the a parameter tends decrease while the exponent b tend to increase with the increasing of mean slope intervals for the same mean slope ranges the a parameter weakly tends decrease while the exponent b and the correlation coefficient tend to increase with the increasing of average annual rainfall a hydro geomorphic floodplain model based on the d a scaling law formula application has been improved considering parameterizations for different stream orders and intervals of slopes and average annual rainfall the modified model provided better results in terms of floodplain extensions compared to the standard hazard flood maps as respect to the standard

velocity from 0 5 to 10 m d to a capillary opening of a toluene or phenol source respectively the authors reported the greater accumulations in p putida f1 and e coli near the napl source decreased as the flow velocity increased in porous media the pore scale confinement regulates bacterial movement and chemotactic migration bhattacharjee and datta 2019 bhattacharjee et al 2020 for example modeling of bacterial transport in porous media required a higher dispersion coefficient compared with that in liquid media long and ford 2009 de anna et al 2020 in singh and olson s study singh and olson 2012 chemotactic e coli hcb33 flowed through a dual permeability microfluidic device where the attractant dl aspartic acid was released from the low permeability region as a result the low permeability region experienced an increase in the total cell counts of e coli hcb33 especially in the pore throats just outside of it in a heterogeneous porous media de anna et al 2020 observed that flow disorder shaped the chemotactic response and bacillus subtilis persisted longer in low flow regions of the pore space in addition to pore scale confinement the presence of napls introduces oil as a second liquid phase which impacts chemotactic movement inevitably in adadevoh et al s experiments adadevoh et al 2018 where p putida g7 flowed through sand columns with randomly distributed napl ganglia fewer bacteria were recovered even without chemoattractant upon visual inspection yang et al 2019 modeled the transport of p putida g7 in porous media via convection dispersion equation cde and used first order attachment coefficients to exclusively account for cell collision in chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria with napl however it remains unclear the extent that bacterial transport is altered by chemotaxis to napl in porous media in this work we investigated the effects of chemotaxis on bacterial transport in porous media in the presence of discrete chemoattractant containing napl ganglia inspired by the experiments of adadevoh et al 2018 we extended the cde model equations to incorporate chemotactic velocity to account for chemotactic movement toward napl and first order kinetics for sorption to napl and porous matrix in our simulations we treated napl ganglia as immobile discrete sources randomly distributed along a sand column and we developed a transport model at continuum scale based on two assumptions 1 the only difference in chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacterial transport was chemotaxis toward chemoattractant 2 bacteria have different sorption and desorption rates on oil phase napl from those on solid granular surfaces simulations provided insight into bacterial transport in porous media associated with chemotaxis and collision with napl ganglia our model advances quantitative prediction of bacterial transport to chemoeffector releasing napl in porous media by delineating the different sorption kinetics on napl and solid matrix within a homogenous continuum column 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental systems in adadevoh et al 2018 our numerical simulation and analysis are inspired and validated by the experiments in adadevoh et al 2018 in brief adadevoh et al dry packed glass chromatography columns diameter 4 8 cm length 15 5 cm with quartz sand to the porosity of 0 4 chemoattractant naphthalene was dissolved in a model napl 2 2 4 4 6 8 8 heptamethylnonane hmn and the oily mixture was introduced into sand columns the columns were then flooded with 10 random motility buffer until the residual hmn naphthalene mixture occupied 19 of the pore space oil mixture was trapped as small ganglia which remained an immobile phase during the experiment effluent naphthalene concentrations from naphthalene dissolution remained at a steady state value of 10 0 1 mg l or 0 08 mol m3 throughout the experiment in bacterial transport experiments a mixture containing the same concentrations of chemotactic bacteria ppg7 and a nonchemotactic mutant ppg7 y1 that were distinguishable by different fluorescent markers was injected into the columns at a superficial velocity of 0 72 m d against gravity control experiments were performed by introducing the bacterial mixture into columns without napl ganglia bacterial concentrations in the effluent solution were measured as a function of time and plotted as breakthrough curves btcs a visual inspection of experimental btcs circles and diamonds in fig 1 c and d suggests no significant difference between ppg7 and ppg7 y1 in the absence of napl ganglia as expected notably the presence of napl ganglia caused reductions in both chemotactic ppg7 and nonchemotactic ppg7 y1 in the effluent fig 1a and b more importantly a greater number of ppg7 than ppg7 y1 was lost inside the columns which is expected as a result of chemotactic response to naphthalene containing napl ganglia we provide quantitative metrics of btcs in table 1 where bmax represents the peak values of the normalized bacterial concentrations in the effluent 2 2 transport models for bacteria with a focus on the transport phenomena of bacteria inside the column we ignored the growth and decay of biomass no nutrient was provided during experiments 2 h except naphthalene as the chemoattractant we assumed that the loss of introduced cells was caused by the sorption on napl ganglia and quartz sand bacterial adhesion at oil surfaces followed langmuir first order kinetics dewangan and conrad 2018 therefore bacterial transport inside the column was governed by convection dispersion chemotaxis and kinetic sorption as discussed earlier in the introduction we adopted a convection like chemotactic velocity rivero et al 1989 chen et al 1998 to predict chemotactic movement given a chemoeffector we treated the sand column as a homogenous continuum column and used first order kinetic terms km t 1 to account for bacterial sorption and α t 1 for bacterial desorption to capture the tailing phenomenon in btcs leading to a three dimensional conservation equation for bacteria in the aqueous phase underflow written as 1 r b t d b b v v c b k m b α ρ b ε s where b is bacterial concentration in the aqueous phase ml 3 t is time t 1 ε is the porosity of the sand column ρ b is the dry bulk density of the porous media ml 3 d b is hydrodynamic dispersion tensor of bacteria l2t 1 v is the interstitial velocity of aqueous fluid lt 1 v c is chemotactic velocity of bacterial population lt 1 and r is the retardation coefficient describing reversible bacterial sorption at equilibrium sites in the column initial input values of km and α in our simulations were estimated using cxtfit analysis fig s1 and table s2 in supplementary material and values of km were consistent with those previously reported for p putida wang and ford 2009 bacteria were observed adhering at oil surfaces to a greater extent than solid surfaces conrad 2020 wan et al 1994 in our model we assume that bacterial sorption on napl ganglia differs from that on sand particles with the definition and fitted values of km as the following k m 0 58 h 1 solid matrix 564 h 1 napl ganglia we extended the previously reported cde model adadevoh et al 2017 by differentiating bacterial sorption on napl from sand and including bacterial desorption from sand the differentiation of sorption on napl and sand is critical because a single sorption coefficient failed to capture the retention of chemotactic bacteria in the presence of napl as shown in fig s2 s is the bacterial concentration on the kinetic sites of the column m m which is governed by 2 d s d t k m ε ρ b b α s the chemotactic velocity of a bacterial population is defined by rivero et al 1989 chen et al 1998 3 v c 2 v 3 tanh χ o eff 2 v ε

is the concentration of a chemoattractant in the aqueous phase ml 3 according to the first assumption v c is zero for nonchemotactic ppg7 y1 2 3 transport models for chemoattractant naphthalene in our model we assumed that napl ganglia were randomly distributed as immobile point sources with a diameter d l along the column domain and naphthalene was released from these oily ganglia into the ambient aqueous phase a convection dispersion equation with source terms was used to model the transport of chemoattractant naphthalene as previously described in adadevoh et al 2017 4 a t d a a v a 1 ε j 1 j n q j δ x x j where d a is the dispersion tensor of the chemoattractant l2t 1 qj ml 3t 1 represents the mass flux from a discrete set of napl ganglia δ x x j is the dirac delta function where x j is the location of jth napl ganglia and n is the number of discrete napl ganglia in the column note that in this context δ should be interpreted as having units of volume when integrated in the weak form used for the finite element scheme this yields a source term that spreads out over the element in which it appears and has the correct units the source term qj from a single napl ganglia is defined as 5 q j π d 2 k i a s a t a where d is the diameter of napl ganglia l asat is the attractant saturation concentration in the aqueous phase in equilibrium with that in the napl ml 3 and ki is the interfacial mass transfer coefficient for naphthalene released from napl to the aqueous phase lt 1 the ganglia size distribution which impacts the exposure area for bacterial adsorption was not experimentally assessed therefore we lumped this unknown area into the adsorption rate on napl km to capture the observed loss of biomass associated with napl ganglia comsol multiphysics simulation software version 5 3a was used to solve the system of differential equations a cylinder with randomly distributed point sources was built within the code to mimic the distribution of immobile napl ganglia in sand columns we decreased the diameter of the cylinder from 4 8 cm to 1 56 cm to improve the calculation efficiency according to adadevoh et al a smaller dimension in diameter 1 56 cm had no effect on the solution adadevoh et al 2017 but the execution time was reduced to one tenth of that for full scale simulation 4 8 cm given our computation resources our system of differential equations was solved using the transport of diluted species in porous media module in comsol for the chemoattractant chemotactic bacteria and nonchemotactic bacteria a domain ordinary differential equation ode was coupled to transport equations of bacteria to solve the adsorption desorption process on the kinetic sites eq 2 adadevoh et al 2017 obtained an optimal mesh size range of 6 10 6 to 6 10 4 m from a mesh convergence study a mesh converged solution is important but challenging for this study mainly because of resolving chemoattractant gradients near point sources as shown in fig s4 supplementary material we applied the same range of mesh size in our simulations with smaller meshes generated near point sources its influence on naphthalene gradients and chemotactic response is presented in figs 3 and 4 we implemented our models into comsol multiphysics to mimic the same experimental setup in adadevoh et al 2018 briefly at the initial time the bacterial concentration was zero inside the column and a step function in time of the bacterial mixture was introduced at the inlet surface to simulate the pulse input for the chemoattractant the initial concentration was set by the point napl sources no additional chemoattractant was introduced into the column the boundaries at the column walls were represented by no flux conditions for all aqueous components our simulations were conducted to predict the transport and distribution of chemotactic ppg7 and nonchemotactic ppg7 y1 in two scenarios 1 those with the hmn naphthalene mixture as immobile napl ganglia and 2 those without napl as the control some important parameter values in this study are superficial longitudinal fluid velocity vf 0 72 m d adadevoh et al 2018 porosity of sand column ε 0 4 no napl or 0 32 with napl adadevoh et al 2018 napl ganglia diameter d 840 μm adadevoh et al 2017 naphthalene saturation concentration asat 0 12 mol m3 adadevoh et al 2018 naphthalene concentration in the effluent a eff 0

et al 2018 effective chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χ o eff 5 10 3 cm2 s adadevoh et al 2017 and chemotactic receptor constant kc 0 016 mol m3 adadevoh et al 2017 a full list of parameter values and how they were implemented into comsol can be found in the supplementary material simulated bacterial effluent concentration was an average of concentrations solved at the nodes of all mesh grids at the effluent plane and plotted against time as btcs 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated bacterial breakthrough curves the spatial concentrations of chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria were simulated by producing numerical solutions to our transport model equations eq 1 2 and 4 the averaged bacterial concentrations over the effluent plane were plotted as a function of pore volume i e dimensionless time and were overlaid on experimental data from adadevoh et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 the simulations are visually consistent with experimental observations quantitative comparisons between the simulation and experiments are provided in table s3 supplementary material in the presence of napl ganglia fig 1a and b fewer chemotactic bacteria exited the column than nonchemotactic bacteria during the observed period of time the simulated btcs in fig 1a and b were produced from a single comsol algorithm with the same parameters the only difference between the bacteria was that the chemotactic velocity eq 3 was set to zero for the nonchemotactic mutant in fig 1b therefore the observed reduction in percent recovery of chemotactic bacteria in fig 1a was solely attributed to chemotactic response to napl ganglia that contained a chemoattractant naphthalene in other words more chemotactic bacteria were retained inside the column because of their preferential migration toward naphthalene which had partitioned into the aqueous phase from napl ganglia in the absence of napl fig 1c and d chemotactic velocity was zero and therefore no significant difference was observed between the btcs of chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria interestingly fewer nonchemotactic bacteria were recovered from columns with napl fig 1b compared to those without napl fig 1d also as summarized in table 1 and our model revealed that bacteria had greater sorption rates on oily ganglia than on solid sand grains bacteria can accumulate to a greater extent on an oil water surface due to motility alone law and aitken 2003 and moreover they have stronger affinity for an oil water interface than a glass water interface wan et al 1994 it is noteworthy that the tails of all btcs were above zero which represents continuous desorption of bacteria from the column fig 1a shows a smaller area below the tail compared with fig 1b c and d which suggests a relatively slower desorption of chemotactic bacteria or longer retention of chemotactic bacteria within the column 3 2 prediction of bacterial distribution in granular media our numerical simulations more importantly provide insights into the transport processes by allowing visualization of bacterial distributions inside the columns as shown in fig 2 bacterial distributions are presented at two different time points 47 and 71 min or pvs equal to 0 4 and 0 6 in the presence of discrete napl ganglia chemotactic bacteria displayed patchy and heterogeneous distributions within the columns columns on the left side in fig 2a and b due to chemotactic responses to naphthalene sources elevated bacterial concentrations were observed especially near the bottom of the column which suggests that chemotactic bacteria were able to detect naphthalene gradients underflow even though the concentration of naphthalene in the aqueous phase was reduced when dissolved in hmn compared to a solid crystalline form table 2 simulated nonchemotactic bacteria traveled through the column as expected for a pulse input spreading out due to convective dispersion in contrast chemotactic bacteria moved independent of the convective flow upon sensing the naphthalene sources and redistributed throughout the entire column over the observation period as depicted by the isosurface plots of chemotactic bacteria at 0 06 mol m3 in green gray columns middle columns in fig 2a and b chemotactic bacteria were retained within the column for longer time periods than nonchemotactic bacteria especially in the bottom of the column due to chemotactic response to napl ganglia this observation is consistent with a report of longer retention times near chemoattractant sources in porous media based on molecular dynamics simulations duffy and ford 1997 chemotactic bacteria in the vicinity of napl ganglia could sense the chemoattractant gradients and therefore preferentially swam toward it resulting in localized bacterial hotspots the rest of chemotactic bacteria were carried by fluid flow through the column in the same manner as nonchemotactic bacteria therefore the plume velocity in fig 2 and peak arrival time in fig 1 were similar between chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria visualization of bacterial distributions along the column indicates that localized accumulations of chemotactic bacteria around napl ganglia at the pore scale caused the reductions in bacterial recovery and peak value of btcs fig 1a at core scale 3 3 naphthalene spatial gradients in granular media a visualization of naphthalene distribution in the aqueous phase fig 3 a shows a general increase in concentration along the column in the flow direction with elevated concentrations at the assigned point sources the simulated naphthalene concentration in the effluent was 0 08 mol 3 consistent with experimental data at steady state in fig 3b an enlarged view showed the naphthalene gradients overlaid with mesh elements that were generated in the vicinity of point sources a smaller mesh can better resolve naphthalene gradients therefore it is challenging to obtain a mesh converged solution for naphthalene as mentioned earlier the upper band in fig 3c corresponds to the elevated naphthalene concentrations near point sources in fig 3a and the lower band to the rest of the column the concentration difference between upper and lower bands represents the transverse naphthalene gradients as depicted by color gradient in fig 3b naphthalene gradients served as the driving force for bacterial retention around napl ganglia the gradients were steeper near the bottom of column which may explain the observed hotspots of bacteria in fig 2 similarly ahmed and stocker ahmed and stocker 2008 found that bacteria exhibited greater chemotaxis when chemoattractant concentrations were low while gradients were steep the retention of bacteria due to chemotaxis was impacted by the forms of chemoattractant sources in table 2 when naphthalene was dissolved in hmn the naphthalene saturation concentration decreased from 0 25 the solubility of naphthalene crystals in water to 0 12 mol m3 due to partitioning between the oil and water phases despite the decrease in naphthalene concentrations released from napl ganglia more chemotactic bacteria were retained inside the column as the percent recovery of chemotactic bacteria ppg7 was reduced by 70 compared to 59 in naphthalene crystals the existence of napl mixtures which is common in natural groundwater aquifers poses a challenge for in situ bioremediation when target hydrocarbons are less accessible to bacteria however our model revealed a successful and even greater retention of bacteria because of chemotaxis aided sorption on chemoattractant releasing napl driven by the concentration gradients shown in fig 3c chemotaxis guides bacteria to swim toward napl ganglia where bacteria adsorb on the oil surfaces and digest oil components this is one explanation of how bacterial chemotaxis overcomes the limitation of chemoattractant oil components availability hindered by napl mixtures and accelerates the bioremediation of oil contaminants process in situ 3 4 analysis of effective chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χ o eff the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χ o quantifies the strength of chemotactic response of a bacterial population to a particular chemoattractant according to its definition χ o depends on intrinsic cellular process and is expected to be constant for a pairing of chemotactic bacteria and chemoattractant in bulk aqueous media χ o can be measured experimentally with typical values falling in the range of 1 0 5 1 0 4 cm2 s marx and aitken 1999 ford and harvey 2006 to model chemotaxis in porous media the effective sensitivity coefficient χ o eff in chemotactic velocity eq 3 is often treated as a fitting parameter in our simulations fig 4 the greater loss in chemotactic bacteria red line were captured by solely turning on chemotactic velocity for bacteria black line however the chemotactic velocity required an increase in χ0 eff by two orders of magnitude 5 10 3 cm2 s compared to the value in bulk liquid 7 2 10 5 cm2 s the increment in χ o eff caused reductions in the peaks of bacterial btcs and increased the number of bacteria retained in the column in long et al long and ford 2009 effective values of 100 times the aqueous phase coefficient χ o were also required in their continuum model to simulate chemotactic response in a microfluidic porous medium porter et al porter et al 2011 resolved pore scale chemoattractant gradients for calculating the chemotactic velocity valdés parada et al 2009 and for relating the microscale physics to prediction for the macroscale sensitivity coefficient χ o eff yielding values that were more consistent with reported ones pore structures highly regulates the landscape of chemoattractant gradients which were often not explicitly incorporated into continuum models instead bacterial transport parameters were adjusted to capture their migration in porous media bhattacharjee et al 2020 long and ford 2009 de anna et al 2020 chemoattractant gradients at pore scale are important to solve chemotactic velocity from the simulations we found that smaller values in χ0 eff were obtained when local naphthalene gradients were steeper decreasing the mesh sizes can improve the accuracy in solving local gradients and χ0 eff but it demands significant computation resources especially in a large three dimensional domain our algorithm can efficiently model bacterial chemotaxis toward napl ganglia at a macroscopic scale with a reasonable adjustment on χ o eff whose dependence on pore structures requires further investigation at pore scale 4 conclusions in this study a continuum scale convection dispersion model with chemotaxis was applied to describe the transport of chemotactic bacteria in a new scenario where chemoattractants were trapped as napl ganglia in sand columns in our simulations the differences observed in experimental btcs between chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria were captured by solely turning on chemotactic velocity the modeling and numerical fitting processes advanced our understanding of bacterial chemotaxis toward oily napl ganglia the existence of napl ganglia poses a challenge to bioremediation by reducing the bioavailability of hydrocarbon chemoattractants which may be overcome by additional sorption of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria on oil surfaces chemotactic bacteria accumulated around napls to a greater extent due to greater sorption associated with oily ganglia surface therefore we expect the biodegradation reactions to be accelerated by chemotaxis which brings more bacteria to napl hotspots to trigger the breakdown of hydrocarbons our transport model has been advanced by including kinetic sorption desorption on a second immobile oil phase and more importantly by differentiating oily chemoattractant sources from solid porous matrix in terms of sorption rates for bacteria at continuum scale level our model is efficient in predicting bacterial transport at macroscopic scale while capturing chemotactic movement near local point sources by the chemotactic velocity however our model did not explicitly incorporate the effects of pore scale structure on chemical gradients which

region experienced an increase in the total cell counts of e coli hcb33 especially in the pore throats just outside of it in a heterogeneous porous media de anna et al 2020 observed that flow disorder shaped the chemotactic response and bacillus subtilis persisted longer in low flow regions of the pore space in addition to pore scale confinement the presence of napls introduces oil as a second liquid phase which impacts chemotactic movement inevitably in adadevoh et al s experiments adadevoh et al 2018 where p putida g7 flowed through sand columns with randomly distributed napl ganglia fewer bacteria were recovered even without chemoattractant upon visual inspection yang et al 2019 modeled the transport of p putida g7 in porous media via convection dispersion equation cde and used first order attachment coefficients to exclusively account for cell collision in chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria with napl however it remains unclear the extent that bacterial transport is altered by chemotaxis to napl in porous media in this work we investigated the effects of chemotaxis on bacterial transport in porous media in the presence of discrete chemoattractant containing napl ganglia inspired by the experiments of adadevoh et al 2018 we extended the cde model equations to incorporate chemotactic velocity to account for chemotactic movement toward napl and first order kinetics for sorption to napl and porous matrix in our simulations we treated napl ganglia as immobile discrete sources randomly distributed along a sand column and we developed a transport model at continuum scale based on two assumptions 1 the only difference in chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacterial transport was chemotaxis toward chemoattractant 2 bacteria have different sorption and desorption rates on oil phase napl from those on solid granular surfaces simulations provided insight into bacterial transport in porous media associated with chemotaxis and collision with napl ganglia our model advances quantitative prediction of bacterial transport to chemoeffector releasing napl in porous media by delineating the different sorption kinetics on napl and solid matrix within a homogenous continuum column 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental systems in adadevoh et al 2018 our numerical simulation and analysis are inspired and validated by the experiments in adadevoh et al 2018 in brief adadevoh et al dry packed glass chromatography columns diameter 4 8 cm length 15 5 cm with quartz sand to the porosity of 0 4 chemoattractant naphthalene was dissolved in a model napl 2 2 4 4 6 8 8 heptamethylnonane hmn and the oily mixture was introduced into sand columns the columns were then flooded with 10 random motility buffer until the residual hmn naphthalene mixture occupied 19 of the pore space oil mixture was trapped as small ganglia which remained an immobile phase during the experiment effluent naphthalene concentrations from naphthalene dissolution remained at a steady state value of 10 0 1 mg l or 0 08 mol m3 throughout the experiment in bacterial transport experiments a mixture containing the same concentrations of chemotactic bacteria ppg7 and a nonchemotactic mutant ppg7 y1 that were distinguishable by different fluorescent markers was injected into the columns at a superficial velocity of 0 72 m d against gravity control experiments were performed by introducing the bacterial mixture into columns without napl ganglia bacterial concentrations in the effluent solution were measured as a function of time and plotted as breakthrough curves btcs a visual inspection of experimental btcs circles and diamonds in fig 1 c and d suggests no significant difference between ppg7 and ppg7 y1 in the absence of napl ganglia as expected notably the presence of napl ganglia caused reductions in both chemotactic ppg7 and nonchemotactic ppg7 y1 in the effluent fig 1a and b more importantly a greater number of ppg7 than ppg7 y1 was lost inside the columns which is expected as a result of chemotactic response to naphthalene containing napl ganglia we provide quantitative metrics of btcs in table 1 where bmax represents the peak values of the normalized bacterial concentrations in the effluent 2 2 transport models for bacteria with a focus on the transport phenomena of bacteria inside the column we ignored the growth and decay of biomass no nutrient was provided during experiments 2 h except naphthalene as the chemoattractant we assumed that the loss of introduced cells was caused by the sorption on napl ganglia and quartz sand bacterial adhesion at oil surfaces followed langmuir first order kinetics dewangan and conrad 2018 therefore bacterial transport inside the column was governed by convection dispersion chemotaxis and kinetic sorption as discussed earlier in the introduction we adopted a convection like chemotactic velocity rivero et al 1989 chen et al 1998 to predict chemotactic movement given a chemoeffector we treated the sand column as a homogenous continuum column and used first order kinetic terms km t 1 to account for bacterial sorption and α t 1 for bacterial desorption to capture the tailing phenomenon in btcs leading to a three dimensional conservation equation for bacteria in the aqueous phase underflow written as 1 r b t d b b v v c b k m b α ρ b ε s where b is bacterial concentration in the aqueous phase ml 3 t is time t 1 ε is the porosity of the sand column ρ b is the dry bulk density of the porous media ml 3 d b is hydrodynamic dispersion tensor of bacteria l2t 1 v is the interstitial velocity of aqueous fluid lt 1 v c is chemotactic velocity of bacterial population lt 1 and r is the retardation coefficient describing reversible bacterial sorption at equilibrium sites in the column initial input values of km and α in our simulations were estimated using cxtfit analysis fig s1 and table s2 in supplementary material and values of km were consistent with those previously reported for p putida wang and ford 2009 bacteria were observed adhering at oil surfaces to a greater extent than solid surfaces conrad 2020 wan et al 1994 in our model we assume that bacterial sorption on napl ganglia differs from that on sand particles with the definition and fitted values of km as the following k m 0 58 h 1 solid matrix 564 h 1 napl ganglia we extended the previously reported cde model adadevoh et al 2017 by differentiating bacterial sorption on napl from sand and including bacterial desorption from sand the differentiation of sorption on napl and sand is critical because a single sorption coefficient failed to capture the retention of chemotactic bacteria in the presence of napl as shown in fig s2 s is the bacterial concentration on the kinetic sites of the column m m which is governed by 2 d s d t k m ε ρ b b α s the chemotactic velocity of a bacterial population is defined by rivero et al 1989 chen et al 1998 3 v c 2 v 3 tanh χ o eff 2 v ε

is the concentration of a chemoattractant in the aqueous phase ml 3 according to the first assumption v c is zero for nonchemotactic ppg7 y1 2 3 transport models for chemoattractant naphthalene in our model we assumed that napl ganglia were randomly distributed as immobile point sources with a diameter d l along the column domain and naphthalene was released from these oily ganglia into the ambient aqueous phase a convection dispersion equation with source terms was used to model the transport of chemoattractant naphthalene as previously described in adadevoh et al 2017 4 a t d a a v a 1 ε j 1 j n q j δ x x j where d a is the dispersion tensor of the chemoattractant l2t 1 qj ml 3t 1 represents the mass flux from a discrete set of napl ganglia δ x x j is the dirac delta function where x j is the location of jth napl ganglia and n is the number of discrete napl ganglia in the column note that in this context δ should be interpreted as having units of volume when integrated in the weak form used for the finite element scheme this yields a source term that spreads out over the element in which it appears and has the correct units the source term qj from a single napl ganglia is defined as 5 q j π d 2 k i a s a t a where d is the diameter of napl ganglia l asat is the attractant saturation concentration in the aqueous phase in equilibrium with that in the napl ml 3 and ki is the interfacial mass transfer coefficient for naphthalene released from napl to the aqueous phase lt 1 the ganglia size distribution which impacts the exposure area for bacterial adsorption was not experimentally assessed therefore we lumped this unknown area into the adsorption rate on napl km to capture the observed loss of biomass associated with napl ganglia comsol multiphysics simulation software version 5 3a was used to solve the system of differential equations a cylinder with randomly distributed point sources was built within the code to mimic the distribution of immobile napl ganglia in sand columns we decreased the diameter of the cylinder from 4 8 cm to 1 56 cm to improve the calculation efficiency according to adadevoh et al a smaller dimension in diameter 1 56 cm had no effect on the solution adadevoh et al 2017 but the execution time was reduced to one tenth of that for full scale simulation 4 8 cm given our computation resources our system of differential equations was solved using the transport of diluted species in porous media module in comsol for the chemoattractant chemotactic bacteria and nonchemotactic bacteria a domain ordinary differential equation ode was coupled to transport equations of bacteria to solve the adsorption desorption process on the kinetic sites eq 2 adadevoh et al 2017 obtained an optimal mesh size range of 6 10 6 to 6 10 4 m from a mesh convergence study a mesh converged solution is important but challenging for this study mainly because of resolving chemoattractant gradients near point sources as shown in fig s4 supplementary material we applied the same range of mesh size in our simulations with smaller meshes generated near point sources its influence on naphthalene gradients and chemotactic response is presented in figs 3 and 4 we implemented our models into comsol multiphysics to mimic the same experimental setup in adadevoh et al 2018 briefly at the initial time the bacterial concentration was zero inside the column and a step function in time of the bacterial mixture was introduced at the inlet surface to simulate the pulse input for the chemoattractant the initial concentration was set by the point napl sources no additional chemoattractant was introduced into the column the boundaries at the column walls were represented by no flux conditions for all aqueous components our simulations were conducted to predict the transport and distribution of chemotactic ppg7 and nonchemotactic ppg7 y1 in two scenarios 1 those with the hmn naphthalene mixture as immobile napl ganglia and 2 those without napl as the control some important parameter values in this study are superficial longitudinal fluid velocity vf 0 72 m d adadevoh et al 2018 porosity of sand column ε 0 4 no napl or 0 32 with napl adadevoh et al 2018 napl ganglia diameter d 840 μm adadevoh et al 2017 naphthalene saturation concentration asat 0 12 mol m3 adadevoh et al 2018 naphthalene concentration in the effluent a eff 0 08 mol m3 adadevoh et al 2018 mass transfer coefficient of naphthalene ki 1 9 10 3 cm s adadevoh et al 2017 bacterial concentration in the pulse input b 0 1 mol m3 normalized 2 1 0 8 cells ml adadevoh et al 2018 effective chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χ o eff 5 10 3 cm2 s adadevoh et al 2017 and chemotactic receptor constant kc 0 016 mol m3 adadevoh et al 2017 a full list of parameter values and how they were implemented into comsol can be found in the supplementary material simulated bacterial effluent concentration was an average of concentrations solved at the nodes of all mesh grids at the effluent plane and plotted against time as btcs 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated bacterial breakthrough curves the spatial concentrations of chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria were simulated by producing numerical solutions to our transport model equations eq 1 2 and 4 the averaged bacterial concentrations over the effluent plane were plotted as a function of pore volume i e dimensionless time and were overlaid on experimental data from adadevoh et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 the simulations are visually consistent with experimental observations quantitative comparisons between the simulation and experiments are provided in table s3 supplementary material in the presence of napl ganglia fig 1a and b fewer chemotactic bacteria exited the column than nonchemotactic bacteria during the observed period of time the simulated btcs in fig 1a and b were produced from a single comsol algorithm with the same parameters the only difference between the bacteria was that the chemotactic velocity eq 3 was set to zero for the nonchemotactic mutant in fig 1b therefore the observed reduction in percent recovery of chemotactic bacteria in fig 1a was solely attributed to chemotactic response to napl ganglia that contained a chemoattractant naphthalene in other words more chemotactic bacteria were retained inside the column because of their preferential migration toward naphthalene which had partitioned into the aqueous phase from napl ganglia in the absence of napl fig 1c and d chemotactic velocity was zero and therefore no significant difference was observed between the btcs of chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria interestingly fewer nonchemotactic bacteria were recovered from columns with napl fig 1b compared to those without napl fig 1d also as summarized in table 1 and our model revealed that bacteria had greater sorption rates on oily ganglia than on solid sand grains bacteria can accumulate to a greater extent on an oil water surface due to motility alone law and aitken 2003 and moreover they have stronger affinity for an oil water interface than a glass water interface wan et al 1994 it is noteworthy that the tails of all btcs were above zero which represents continuous desorption of bacteria from the column fig 1a shows a smaller area below the tail compared with fig 1b c and d which suggests a relatively slower desorption of chemotactic bacteria or longer retention of chemotactic bacteria within the column 3 2 prediction of bacterial distribution in granular media our numerical simulations more importantly provide insights into the transport processes by allowing visualization of bacterial distributions inside the columns as shown in fig 2 bacterial distributions are presented at two different time points 47 and 71 min or pvs equal to 0 4 and 0 6 in the presence of discrete napl ganglia chemotactic bacteria displayed patchy and heterogeneous distributions within the columns columns on the left side in fig 2a and b due to chemotactic responses to naphthalene sources elevated bacterial concentrations were observed especially near the bottom of the column which suggests that chemotactic bacteria were able to detect naphthalene gradients underflow even though the concentration of naphthalene in the aqueous phase was reduced when dissolved in hmn compared to a solid crystalline form table 2 simulated nonchemotactic bacteria traveled through the column as expected for a pulse input spreading out due to convective dispersion in contrast chemotactic bacteria moved independent of the convective flow upon sensing the naphthalene sources and redistributed throughout the entire column over the observation period as depicted by the isosurface plots of chemotactic bacteria at 0 06 mol m3 in green gray columns middle columns in fig 2a and b chemotactic bacteria were retained within the column for longer time periods than nonchemotactic bacteria especially in the bottom of the column due to chemotactic response to napl ganglia this observation is consistent with a report of longer retention times near chemoattractant sources in porous media based on molecular dynamics simulations duffy and ford 1997 chemotactic bacteria in the vicinity of napl ganglia could sense the chemoattractant gradients and therefore preferentially swam toward it resulting in localized bacterial hotspots the rest of chemotactic bacteria were carried by fluid flow through the column in the same manner as nonchemotactic bacteria therefore the plume velocity in fig 2 and peak arrival time in fig 1 were similar between chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria visualization of bacterial distributions along the column indicates that localized accumulations of chemotactic bacteria around napl ganglia at the pore scale caused the reductions in bacterial recovery and peak value of btcs fig 1a at core scale 3 3 naphthalene spatial gradients in granular media a visualization of naphthalene distribution in the aqueous phase fig 3 a shows a general increase in concentration along the column in the flow direction with elevated concentrations at the assigned point sources the simulated naphthalene concentration in the effluent was 0 08 mol 3 consistent with experimental data at steady state in fig 3b an enlarged view showed the naphthalene gradients overlaid with mesh elements that were generated in the vicinity of point sources a smaller mesh can better resolve naphthalene gradients therefore it is challenging to obtain a mesh converged solution for naphthalene as mentioned earlier the upper band in fig 3c corresponds to the elevated naphthalene concentrations near point sources in fig 3a and the lower band to the rest of the column the concentration difference between upper and lower bands represents the transverse naphthalene gradients as depicted by color gradient in fig 3b naphthalene gradients served as the driving force for bacterial retention around napl ganglia the gradients were steeper near the bottom of column which may explain the observed hotspots of bacteria in fig 2 similarly ahmed and stocker ahmed and stocker 2008 found that bacteria exhibited greater chemotaxis when chemoattractant concentrations were low while gradients were steep the retention of bacteria due to chemotaxis was impacted by the forms of chemoattractant sources in table 2 when naphthalene was dissolved in hmn the naphthalene saturation concentration decreased from 0 25 the solubility of naphthalene crystals in water to 0 12 mol m3 due to partitioning between the oil and water phases despite the decrease in naphthalene concentrations released from napl ganglia more chemotactic bacteria were retained inside the column as the percent recovery of chemotactic bacteria ppg7 was reduced by 70 compared to 59 in naphthalene crystals the existence of napl mixtures which is common in natural groundwater aquifers poses a challenge for in situ bioremediation when target hydrocarbons are less accessible to bacteria however our model revealed a successful and even greater retention of bacteria because of chemotaxis aided sorption on chemoattractant releasing napl driven by the concentration gradients shown in fig 3c chemotaxis guides bacteria to swim toward napl ganglia where bacteria adsorb on the oil surfaces and digest oil components this is one explanation of how bacterial chemotaxis overcomes the limitation of chemoattractant oil components availability hindered by napl mixtures and accelerates the bioremediation of oil contaminants process in situ 3 4 analysis of effective chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χ o eff the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χ o quantifies the strength of chemotactic response of a bacterial population to a particular chemoattractant according to its definition χ o depends on intrinsic cellular process and is expected to be constant for a pairing of chemotactic bacteria and chemoattractant in bulk aqueous media χ o can be measured experimentally with typical values falling in the range of 1 0 5 1 0 4 cm2 s marx and aitken 1999 ford and harvey 2006 to model chemotaxis in porous media the effective sensitivity coefficient χ o eff in chemotactic velocity eq 3 is often treated as a fitting parameter in our simulations fig 4 the greater loss in chemotactic bacteria red line were captured by solely turning on chemotactic velocity for bacteria black line however the chemotactic velocity required an increase in χ0 eff by two orders of magnitude 5 10 3 cm2 s compared to the value in bulk liquid 7 2 10 5 cm2 s the increment in χ o eff caused reductions in the peaks of bacterial btcs and increased the number of bacteria retained in the column in long et al long and ford 2009 effective values of 100 times the aqueous phase coefficient χ o were also required in their continuum model to simulate chemotactic response in a microfluidic porous medium porter et al porter et al 2011 resolved pore scale chemoattractant gradients for calculating the chemotactic velocity valdés parada et al 2009 and for relating the microscale physics to prediction for the macroscale sensitivity coefficient χ o eff yielding values that were more consistent with reported ones pore structures highly regulates the landscape of chemoattractant gradients which were often not explicitly incorporated into continuum models instead bacterial transport parameters were adjusted to capture their migration in porous media bhattacharjee et al 2020 long and ford 2009 de anna et al 2020 chemoattractant gradients at pore scale are important to solve chemotactic velocity from the simulations we found that smaller values in χ0 eff were obtained when local naphthalene gradients were steeper decreasing the mesh sizes can improve the accuracy in solving local gradients and χ0 eff but it demands significant computation resources especially in a large three dimensional domain our algorithm can efficiently model bacterial chemotaxis toward napl ganglia at a macroscopic scale with a reasonable adjustment on χ o eff whose dependence on pore structures requires further investigation at pore scale 4 conclusions in this study a continuum scale convection dispersion model with chemotaxis was applied to describe the transport of chemotactic bacteria in a new scenario where chemoattractants were trapped as napl ganglia in sand columns in our simulations the differences observed in experimental btcs between chemotactic and nonchemotactic bacteria were captured by solely turning on chemotactic velocity the modeling and numerical fitting processes advanced our understanding of bacterial chemotaxis toward oily napl ganglia the existence of napl ganglia poses a challenge to bioremediation by reducing the bioavailability of hydrocarbon chemoattractants which may be overcome by additional sorption of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria on oil surfaces chemotactic bacteria accumulated around napls to a greater extent due to greater sorption associated with oily ganglia surface therefore we expect the biodegradation reactions to be accelerated by chemotaxis which brings more bacteria to napl hotspots to trigger the breakdown of hydrocarbons our transport model has been advanced by including kinetic sorption desorption on a second immobile oil phase and more importantly by differentiating oily chemoattractant sources from solid porous matrix in terms of sorption rates for bacteria at continuum scale level our model is efficient in predicting bacterial transport at macroscopic scale while capturing chemotactic movement near local point sources by the chemotactic velocity however our model did not explicitly incorporate the effects of pore scale structure on chemical gradients which

218,extreme precipitation of multiple durations is responsible for major natural hazards in mountainous regions such as flash floods and debris flows understanding the orographic impact on the statistics of precipitation extremes is therefore crucial for improving hydrological design and risk management strategies here we use a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events to improve our understanding of the orographic impact on extreme precipitation of durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h we focus on trentino a rough orographic region in the eastern italia alps and use data from 78 quality controlled rain gauges with 5 minute resolution we show that our framework well reproduces the statistical properties of the observed annual maxima nash sutcliffe 0 82 0 95 bias from 4 to 7 as well as their relation with orography we then exploit the reduced uncertainty of this approach to quantify the orographic impact on precipitation right tail statistics and on extreme return levels using a regression analysis we identify two main modes of orographic relationship a reverse orographic effect for hourly and sub hourly durations 10 20 decrease per 1000 m elevation and an orographic enhancement for durations of 8 h or longer 7 5 10 increase per 1000 m elevation we observe that these two modes result from three main precipitation regimes which show different proportion between extreme and very extreme events and which emerge at very short durations 20 min or shorter mid durations 30 min 1 hour and long durations 2 h or longer these findings are of interest for risk management applications and climate change impact studies keywords sub daily extreme precipitation extreme value analysis orographic effects on extreme precipitation 1 introduction extreme precipitation in mountainous regions is the main trigger of hydrological hazards such as flash floods and debris flows e g georgakakos 1986 borga et al 2014 archer

feyen 2019 mountains with their complex relief significantly influence weather and climate including altered distribution of precipitation smith 2019 and of its extremes with different impacts at different durations understanding the impact of complex orography on the probability distribution of extreme precipitation over short sub daily and sub hourly temporal scales and on the causative processes behind these extremes is thus critical for risk management of rainfall triggered natural hazards e g katz et al 2002 francipane et al 2021 this is even more important in a changing climate where enhanced convective activity and changes in some of the precipitation generating processes are expected e g yan et al 2021 ipcc 2019 napoli et al 2019 precipitation patterns in mountain areas are highly variable and are determined by the interaction of atmospheric large scale air motions with complex local scale topographic features e g johnson and hanson 1995 orographic lifting of air masses along the windward slope of the mountains enhances the condensation of water vapor and the formation of clouds increasing the overall precipitation yield in the so called orographic enhancement e g roe 2005 houze 2012 avanzi et al 2021 while the leeward air descent tends to inhibit this process this effect has been observed in climatological analysis worldwide and pertains relatively long durations daily or longer e g frei and schär 1998 malby et al 2007 harris et al 1996 recent studies found that the orographic enhancement is influenced by several factors including static atmospheric or aerosol conditions and local terrain slope and that anthropogenic forcing and aerosol load could be possible explanations of its temporal changes e g napoli et al 2019 conversely the effect of complex orography on extreme rainfall of short duration is still unclear and often reported with contrasting results most studies focused on the identification of the topographic dependence of rainfall extremes for the purpose of spatial interpolation of rainfall statistics e g johnson et al 2016 wagner et al 2012 nalder and wein 1998 some works are focused on the assessment of the orographic impact on the statistics of annual maxima prudhomme and reed 1998 analyzed the relationship between the median of the daily annual maxima and topographic variables including elevation based on data from 1003 stations covering scotland the reported relationships with elevation either computed at site or for the average elevation of areas surrounding the rain gauges were not significant in an analysis of daily annual maxima over campania region in italy furcolo et al 2016 reported a negligible dependence on elevation on average 2 increment over 1000 m of elevation annual maxima of sub daily rainfall from more than 550 stations located in northern italy were found to significantly decrease with elevation allamano et al 2009 very few studies examined the topographic relationships on extreme return levels speculatively this reflects the limitations of the statistical approaches for extreme value analysis usually based on annual maxima or the values exceeding a high threshold which require long records of homogeneous data when these are not available regionalization approaches are used to pool data from multiple locations buishand 1991 thus inevitably smoothing existing orographic relationships alternatively extremes from multiple durations are pooled e g scaling and multi scaling approaches thus smoothing existing differential orographic impacts at different durations examining the 100 year return levels rossi et al 2020 reported a roughly linear decrease of the 2 hourly rainfall rates with elevation and a non monotonic relationship for daily rainfall rates with an increase up to 2500 m a s l followed by a decrease at higher elevations similar results are presented for 2 years return period avanzi et al 2015 found similar results analyzing annual rainfall maxima form 1494 stations across italy with duration from 1 h to 24 h the results showed a significant decrease of the mean of the annual precipitation maxima of hourly duration with elevation whereas the absolute slope decreases with increasing rainfall duration these authors termed reverse orographic effect the decrease of the mean of the annual maxima at short hourly duration with elevation marra et al 2021a investigated the effect of the orography on sub hourly extreme rainfall analyzing the data collected from 25 stations located in the southeastern mediterranean area in order to increase the signal to noise ratio these authors used a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on the so called ordinary events which are all the independent realizations of the process of interest they are defined as the finite independent samples of the analyzed stochastic process e g marra et al 2019 marra et al 2021a focused on the peculiar atmosphere orography interaction occurring between mediterranean cyclones and a regular orographic barrier in the southeastern mediterranean and found a decrease with elevation of the typical maximum intensities of short duration and a nonmonotonic change with duration of the tail heaviness of the extreme rainfall distribution namely they reported a decrease in tail heaviness for durations increasing from 10 min to about 1 h and an increase in tail heaviness for longer durations this tail behavior implies that the assumptions underlying multi scaling approaches could be violated in orographic areas however these findings were drawn only considering the windward side of the orographic barrier and focusing on very local conditions i e mediterranean cyclones in the southeastern mediterranean and a relatively smooth orographic barrier not exceeding 1000 m a s l moreover as other types of weather systems contribute to extremes in the region the study could not address the direct impact of orography on extreme return levels it still remains an open question whether these findings hold in more general climatic and orographic conditions in which multiple types of weather systems propagate in different directions while interacting with orography in this paper we extend these earlier results by i leveraging the statistical framework for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events ii investigating the impact of orography on both extreme precipitation statistics and on extreme return levels for durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h and iii focusing on a complex orographic region in the alps where precipitation extremes are generated by the interaction of multiple weather systems with the terrain to reach these goals we make leverage on an updated and quality controlled dataset of continuous short duration rainfall time series for 78 stations in the eastern italian alps with at least 10 valid years per stations the assessment is carried out on the study area considered as whole and by different sub regions the paper is organized in 6 sections the study area and the methodology are presented in section 2 and 3 the results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 finally section 6 reports the main conclusions 2 study area and collected data this study focuses on trentino a mountainous and orographically complex region in the north eastern italian alps fig 1 the region is around 6000 km2 in size with altitudes varying between 150 and 3600 m a s l the area is particularly interesting for its orographic complexity fliri 1975 which plays a crucial role in determining i high climatic heterogeneity and ii small scale atmospheric effects in the precipitation spatial distribution the central and northern parts of the region receive relatively low amounts of precipitation about 900 mm yr 1 due to the protection effect played by the surrounding mountains while larger amounts are typically observed in the southeastern and southwestern parts about 1300 mm yr 1 e g borga et al 2005 and references therein we used continuous quality controlled rainfall data with 5 minute temporal resolution collected at 78 reheated rain gauges we considered only rain gauges with at least 10 valid years where a valid year is defined as a calendar year during which less than 10 of the 5 minutes time intervals are flagged as missing or low quality marra et al 2021a the record lengths range from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 35 valid years with an average value across all the rain gauges of 20 valid years previous studies have demonstrated that metastastistical extreme value mev like methods as the one we used in this study are able to provides robust and reliable estimates of high rainfall quantiles also in case of short records marra et al 2018 zorzetto et al 2016 so that these record lengths are deemed sufficient for the scopes of this study it is worth pointing out here that possible negative impacts of the larger parameter estimation uncertainty expected to characterize the shorter records are reduced in our weighted regression analyses see below in order to disentangle the orographic effects from possible spatial effects due to horizontal gradients e g latitudinal and or longitudinal we conduct our analysis by focusing on i the trentino region as whole as well as on ii three sub regions defined also in previous studies e g borga et al 2005 characterized by different elevation ranges and geographic location the central c dark gray in fig 1a the eastern e light gray and the western w medium gray sub region the western and the eastern sub regions present higher elevations compared to the central part which includes the valley of a large river the adige river and the northern portion of a large lake elongated on the south north direction the garda lake this difference in elevation is detailed in fig 1b which shows the number of stations available for each sub region in 500 meter elevation bands 3 methodology 3 1 quantification of the right tail statistics and of extreme return levels in order to define the yearly non exceedance probability g x of an extreme precipitation intensity x mm h 1 we adopt the simplified metastatistical extreme value smev framework presented in marra et al 2019 and 2020 1 g x f x θ n where i f x θ is the cumulative distribution function of the ordinary events described by the parameters θ which according to marani and ignoccolo 2015 are defined as the finite independent samples of the analyzed stochastic process and ii n is the average yearly number of ordinary events the smev formulation can be related to ordinary statistics of n sized block maxima under independence serinaldi et al 2020 differently from the original metastatistical extreme value approach marani and ignoccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 smev relaxes the hypothesis of stochasticity for the distribution parameters θ and the yearly number n of the ordinary events marra et al 2019 this favors a simpler formulation for the non exceedance probabilities of extreme precipitation intensities and a more robust parameter estimation with a reduced parameter estimation uncertainty marra et al 2020 that is even more evident in case of data scarcity i e when rain gauges report a limited number of ordinary events per year marra et al 2019 it is worth noting that previous results could not distinguish between inter annual variability of the parameters and parameter estimation uncertainty marra et al 2020 the two parameter weibull distribution was proposed by wilson and toumi 2005 as a theoretical formulation for the tail of the precipitation intensity distributions and has been used in several studies for modeling precipitation ordinary events with different durations daily e g zorzetto et al 2016 hourly e g papalexiou et al 2018 and sub hourly e g marra et al 2021a the two parameter weibull distribution can be written as 2 f x θ 1 e x p x λ k with θ λ κ where λ 0 mm h 1 is the scale parameter and κ 0 is the shape or tail parameter by definition the scale parameter λ multiplies al the values of the precipitation distribution by a common factor so that larger scales correspond to larger precipitation events and vice versa the shape parameter affects the distribution tail heaviness and low values of the shape κ are related to larger extremes with respect to the average and vice versa shape parameter equal to one reduces the weibull distribution to an exponential one using the smev methodology with a weibull distribution to describe the ordinary events f x θ eq 1 becomes an exponentiated weibull nadarajah et al 2013 3 g x 1 e x λ κ n eq 3 also shows the relationship between the tail of the distribution and n number of yearly ordinary events for typical values of κ usually 1 wilson and toumi 2005 the tail heaviness of the extreme value distribution g x decreases for increasing n and vice versa we recall here that according to wilson and tuomi 2005 the two parameter weibull distribution is expected to describe the right tail of the distribution of ordinary precipitation events and not their entire distribution the increased parameter estimation accuracy of smev allows to tailor the statistical model to the tail characteristics of a study area of interest by left censoring the portion of ordinary events which do not belong to this tail for example marra et al 2019 in israel used the largest 25 to estimate the weibull parameters here after sensitivity analysis carried out following the methodology detailed in marra et al 2020 we selected for this study a left censoring threshold of 75 this means that the largest 25 of the ordinary events are used to quantify the parameters of the weibull distribution describing the tail the intensity of the lowest 75 is thus ignored and only their weight in probability is retained see marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2020 this threshold is in line with the tail definition in marra et al 2019 and marra et al 2020 which examined a mediterranean convective environment while is lower than the one in wang et al 2020 and miniussi and marra 2021 which examined the continental climate of germany starting from 5 minute continuous rainfall time series we define storms which can be interpreted as independent meteorological objects see marra et al 2020 as consecutive wet time intervals separated by dry intervals 0 1 mm in each of the 5 minute time intervals of at least 24 h restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 tarolli et al 2012 ordinary events of multiple durations are then computed for each storm by calculating the maximum intensities observed within each storm using moving windows of the duration of interest marra et al 2020 in this study we considered durations of 5 10 15 30 45minutes and 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 12 24 h since the storms are defined as meteorological objects and ordinary events of all durations are calculated for each storm the parameter n at a given location eq 3 represents the average number of storms per year and is the same at all durations this fundamental property allows us to consistently examine the intensity distribution parameters and thus the characteristics of the precipitation processes across durations marra et al 2020 we estimate the smev distribution parameters at site i e for each rain gage and duration independently the weibull parameters i e θ d λ d κ d are estimated using the ordinary events time series for each duration of interest d left censoring the lowest 75 of the ordinary events and using a linear regression in weibull transformed coordinates see marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2020 last we compute extreme quantiles corresponding to assigned return periods t 2 10 and 50 years also termed return levels q d t mm h 1 by inverting eq 3 uncertainty in the estimated parameters and return levels is quantified via bootstrap with replacement among the years in the record as proposed by overeem et al 2008 years in the record are randomly sampled with replacement and parameters estimated from the obtained data record the procedure is repeated 1000 times and uncertainty is quantified as the 90 confidence interval 3 2 assessment of the modeling framework in order to assess the reliability of a statistical framework based on ordinary events in representing the properties of extremes we compared the mean of the observed annual maxima against stochastic realizations of annual maxima resulting from monte carlo simulations drawn from the smev model at each iteration l annual maxima with l being the number of valid years in the examined station were synthetically generated for each station by taking the maximum value of a set of n ordinary events in case n is not an integer we used the closest integer drawn from a weibull distribution characterized by the previously estimated parameters these synthetic simulations represent many possible realizations of reality under the assumption that the hypotheses behind smev are verified i e that annual maxima are samples from a finite number of ordinary events whose tail the largest 25 in our case is described by a two parameter weibull distribution if our assumptions are correct we expect the observed annual maxima the reality to be a possible sample from these synthetic realizations as proposed in several studies e g soltani et al 2017 ayuso muñoz et al 2015 we selected the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percentage bias pb as metrics to quantify the agreement between simulated x s i and observed x o i mean annual maxima across all the stations i 4 n s e 1 i 1 s x o i x s i 2 i 1 n x o i x o 2 5 p b 100 i 1 s x s i x o i i 1 n x o i where s is the number of stations and x o is the arithmetic mean of the observed variable the nse varies in the range 1 with nse 1 in case of perfect match between modeled and observed data and with nse 0 indicating that the modeling framework is a less powerful predictor than the mean of the observed data the pb measures the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observed values in order to further verify the reliability of the proposed statistical framework to investigate orographic impacts we compared the relations with elevation of modeled monte carlo and observed mean annual maxima a total of 1000 monte carlo iterations were found to be sufficient to reliably estimate the validation metrics and the 90 confidence intervals of the regressions 3 3 quantification of the orographic impact on extreme precipitation statistics and return levels in order to examine and quantify the role of orography on extreme precipitation we performed the regression analysis y a elev b where elev m is the stations elevation and y is in turn the annual maxima the smev parameters and the extreme quantiles finally a and b represent the slope and the intercept of the regression respectively to this purpose we use a weighted linear regression model between the considered dependent variable mean of observed annual maxima smev parameters extreme rainfall quantiles and the elevation independent variable weights in the regression are used as inversely proportional to the 90 confidence interval see previous section of the considered dependent variable so to account for estimation uncertainty we test the statistical significance of the slope of the regression equation against the null hypothesis of absence of dependence i e slope equal zero e g see slater et al 2021 papalexiou and montanari 2019 4 results 4 1 orographic effect on mean annual maxima and assessment of the statistical model the comparison between the mean of the observed and of the smev stochastically generated annual maxima see fig 2 for rainfall durations 5 min for 1 and 24 h shows a good agreement both in terms of quantitative values and in terms of spatial variability within the entire study area the nse computed for each analyzed duration ranges from a minimum of 0 82 for 10 min duration to a maximum of 0 95 for 45 min and the pb ranges from 4 for 2 h duration to 7 for 5 min in the supplementary material figure s 1 we show the scatterplot between the mean of the observed and of the smev stochastically generated annual maxima for all the durations reporting the nse and the pb for each of them the ability of the smev statistical model to capture and represent the orographic impact on extremes is assessed by comparing the elevation dependence in the observed annual maxima with the one of the annual maxima stochastically generated according to the smev hypotheses the slopes and their statistical significance of the regression models between observed and simulated median and 90 confidence interval of the monte carlo realizations are displayed mean annual maxima and elevation are reported in fig 3 the slope of the regression is normalized according to the corresponding median value and reported in units of percent per 1000 m of elevation examining the entire study area the mean of observed annual maxima dots in fig 3 shows a statistically significant p value 0 05 decrease with elevation for durations shorter or equal to 1 h and significant increase with elevation for durations longer or equal to 12 h the slope in the observed mean annual maxima lie well within the 90 confidence intervals of the slopes identified by the synthetic monte carlo realizations implying that reality is indeed a likely sample from the smev hypotheses this means that although based on ordinary events our statistical model is able to reproduce the behavior of annual maxima annual maxima are thus samples from the ordinary events distribution s tail as defined here the observed trends for the entire region range from 20 and 10 reduction per 1000 m elevation 5 min and 1 h duration respectively to 7 5 and 10 increase 12 h and 24 h respectively these findings are in line with the so called reverse orographic effect for short rainfall durations e g avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a and the well known orographic enhancement at multi hour 12 in our case or longer durations e g bonacina 1945 these patterns result from the combination of qualitatively analogous but quantitatively different effects occurring in the three identified sub regions fig 3 statistically significant decrease of short duration 1 h intensities with elevation is observed in the western fig 3 c and easter part fig 3 d and statistically significant increase is observed for longer durations 3 h in the central part fig 3 b in the following we investigate the statistical mechanisms behind these observed behaviors by examining the orographic impact on the parameters of our extreme value model 4 2 orographic effect on the weibull distribution parameters the slopes and their statistical significance of the regression models between ordinary events distribution parameters and elevation for each duration are reported in fig 4 for the weibull shape parameter we present the slope of the regression expressed in units of 1 per 1000 m of elevation while for the weibull scale parameter we normalized the slope of the regression according to the corresponding median value so to have comparable magnitudes across durations and reported in units of percent per 1000 m of elevation to recall and visualize the impact of the scale and shape parameter on the right tail weibull distribution we provide figure s 2 in the supplementary material the shape parameter fig 4 a shows a statistically significant increasing trend with elevation for durations up to 1 h with a peak between 30 min and 1 h at short durations lighter tailed distributions characterize the locations at higher elevation at multi hour durations 3 24 h statistically significant negative relationships between the shape and elevation are observed at long durations heavier tailed distributions characterize the locations at higher elevation at durations between 2 and 3 h the behavior transitions between the two and no significant trend can be identified three behaviors emerge for the scale parameter fig 4 e statistically significant negative trends with elevation are found for short 5 20 min and long 4 12 h durations while between 30 min and 3 h the dependence is not statistically significant with a peak around 1 hour duration interestingly these intervals of durations are similar to the ones observed for the dependence of the shape with elevation the behavior of tail heaviness observed over the entire region is qualitatively confirmed in the three sub regions although quantitative differences emerge all regions show a peak in the shape parameter trends around 30 60 min and generally increasing trends decreasing tail heaviness with elevation at short durations and decreasing trends increasing tail heaviness at multi hour durations although differences emerge in terms of statistical significance fig 4 b to 4 d this is likely due to the reduction of the number of stations fig 1 in particular the central sub region fig 4 b which samples typically lower elevations fig 1 shows no significant changes in tail heaviness at short durations while the eastern sub region fig 4 d shows no significant change at long durations the behavior of the scale parameter is qualitatively analogous across the sub regions fig 4 f to 4 h but no significant signal can be extracted from the individual sub regions finally the n parameter of the distribution which represents the mean number of storms per year and therefore is constant across all the durations median value and standard deviation across the gauged stations equal to 54 6 and 2 96 respectively shows a positive significative trend with elevation 7 2 1000 m at the entire region scale it shows a statistically significant lower increase with elevation in the central sub region 4 4 1000 m and a statistically significant higher increase with elevation in the western and eastern sub regions 7 and 8 1000 m respectively 4 3 orographic effect on rainfall quantiles the slope and statistical significance of the regression models between 2 10 and 50 years return levels and elevation at different durations are reported in fig 5 we normalized the slope of the regression according to the corresponding median value and reported it units of percent per 1000 m of elevation the combined effect observed for the slope of the shape scale parameters with elevation for different durations reflects into the behavior of extreme return levels fig 5 results over the entire area show statistically significant negative trends with elevation for durations up to 1 h which imply larger return levels at lower elevations and statistically significant positive trends at duration from 6 to 24 h this means that return levels are both decreased short durations and intensified long durations by orography for durations between 2 and 3 h the observed trends shift from the short duration to the long duration behavior changing sign and loosing statistical significance interestingly the statistical significance of these trends increases with return period especially for long durations despite the larger uncertainty characterizing the estimates of longer return levels results for the 50 years return period show a statistically significant trend not only for 12 and 24 but also for the 8 h rainfall durations quantitatively the reverse orographic effect short durations ranges from 20 25 to 10 10 decrease per 1000 m of elevation for the 2 50 years return levels moving from 5 min to 1 h durations the orographic enhancement long durations ranges from 8 10 to 10 13 of increasing rainfall per 1000 m of elevation for the 2 50 years years return period quantiles moving from 8 to 24 h duration results for the sub regions show similar patterns to the ones observed for the entire area with some notable quantitative differences fig 5 the central region with more stations at lower elevation presents no statistically significant reverse orographic effect at short durations but shows a more intense and statistically significant orographic enhancement at longer durations 3 to 24 h conversely orographic enhancement at long durations is not significant in the eastern and western regions 5 discussion 5 1 orographic impact on the precipitation processes leading to extremes the different atmospheric processes dominating extremes at different durations could easily explain the differential orographic effects we observe analyzing the response of the smev parameters to elevation we observe three different regimes emerging at very short durations between 5 and 20 min mid durations between 30 min and 1 h and long durations between around 2 and 24 h at short durations the peak rain intensity of convective cores is the dominant process generating extremes here we observed a slightly decreasing tail heaviness coupled with a strongly decreasing scale which combined result in a strong reduction of extremes with elevation the reverse orographic effect at mid durations the local yield of individual convective cells tends to play the more prominent role in generating the extreme rainfall here we found a strong decrease in tail heaviness coupled with a mild or no decrease in the scale which result in a mild decrease of extremes with elevation at long durations extreme precipitation is generated by long lasting stratiform processes as well as successions of multiple convective cells combination of stratiform like and convective processes and eventually snowfall e g minder et al 2015 roe 2005 here we observed an increase in tail heaviness and a mild decrease in the scale which result in an increase of extremes orographic enhancement this interpretation is supported by fig 6 which compares the seasonality of the ordinary events defining the distribution tail their largest 25 in gray for short 5 min medium 1 h and long durations 24 h with the one of all the storms black in particular it can be noted that the seasonality of 5 minute and 1 hour extremes largely overlap and have the typical summer peak characterizing convection in the region while the seasonality of 24 hour extremes is more homogeneously distributed in the year reflecting the multitude of processes contributing to longer duration extremes finally the interaction of local conditions such as orographic changes and valleys morphology and large scale atmospheric processes may explain the fact that the orographic enhancement resulted more intense and statistically significative for the central region where most of the rain gage stations have elevations between 500 and 1500 m and therefore locally connected to this elevation range 5 2 orographic impact on annual maxima and extreme return levels differently from the weibull parameters annual maxima and extreme return levels only show two broad modes short durations below 1 h with a significant decrease of extreme intensities with elevation and long durations above 3 h with a significant increase of extreme intensities with elevation given the high accuracy of our statistical model in reproducing the behavior of annual maxima these two modes need to be interpreted as the superimposition of the three regimes highlighted above for short durations the decrease of the scale parameter with elevation indicates an overall decrease in extreme rainfall and the mild increase of the shape parameter with elevation indicates that very extreme and extreme rainfall events are quantitatively more similar the interactions of the two parameters results in a decrease of extreme return levels with elevation for mid durations the shape continues to increase while the scale doesn t show strong variations with elevation this type of interaction between the two parameters results in a slight decrease of extreme return levels with elevation which is mainly driven by the decreased tail heaviness shape parameter finally for long durations we observed a strong increase of the tail heaviness with elevation which indicates an increase of more extreme rainfall events combined with a decrease of the scale parameter with elevation which indicates an overall decrease this results in an increase of extreme return levels with elevation again driven by the tail heaviness shape parameter as climate change is expected to differently impact the peak intensities and the spatiotemporal organization of convective cells and storms e g wasko et al 2016 peleg et al 2018 fowler et al 2021 knowledge about the different response of these three regimes to orographic forcing is deemed crucial for accurately predicting future changes in precipitation extremes in mountainous regions as a final observation we note that it is possible that some mixed precipitation events snow or mixed rain and snow which we considered as liquid events are involved in our statistical analysis from one side reheated rain gauges are used so that the possible inaccuracy of the measurement of mixed rain and snow events should be minimized from the other side it should be noted that the most relevant natural hazards of interest for hydrological impact studies are related to precipitation in the liquid form so that the problem should be less relevant last we recall that most of the storms of interest for short and mid duration extremes occur in spring summer greys boxplot in fig 6 when precipitation is usually in liquid form 5 3 sub regional variability of the orographic effect different behaviors have been observed within the three examined sub regions specifically the central sub region characterized by lower elevations seem to have different behaviors than the eastern and western sub regions which are characterized by higher elevations the elevation dependence of mean annual maxima showed a significant reverse orographic effect for short rainfall durations only in the western and eastern subregions whereas the orographic enhancement at multi hour durations is statistically significant only in the central sub region additionally although all the regions show similar patterns of tail heaviness to the one observed in the entire region the central sub region shows a statistically significant decreasing trend only at multi hour durations as it concerns the elevation dependence of the quantiles the central region only shows statistically significant dependence and more intense orographic enhancement at longer durations 3 to 24 h the peculiarities of the central sub region are possibly to be attributed to i lower elevations and complex orography ii higher number of stations below 1000 m and iii presence of the adige river and of the garda lake valleys which are regularly oriented in the south north direction and may dominate the local wind directions the combination of these aspects may influence the generating processes of extreme precipitation in the sub regions future research should investigate these impacts and try to draw possible conclusions on their relations with the local terrain 5 4 relations with previous studies our results confirm the reverse orographic effect reported by previous studies for short duration extremes allamano et al 2009 avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a at short durations our results confirm the effect in tail heaviness with peak at hourly durations reported by marra et al 2021a while at multi hour durations our results differ as marra et al 2021a reported not statistically significant but positive trends for the scale parameter this could be explained by the different climatology of the analyzed area and by the fact that we were able to explore these relationships using a larger number of rain gauges at higher elevations and considering all the synoptic systems impacting the area while marra et al 2021a focused on systematic windward conditions and on a relatively low mountain barrier moreover we separate storms using 24 hour dry hiatuses in order to examine durations up to 24 h while marra et al 2021a used 6 hour dry hiatuses similarly to marra et al 2021a our results differ from papalexiou et al 2018 this is explained by the fact that different definitions of the tails are analyzed see also marra et al 2021a papalexiou et al 2018 examined the largest p where p ranged from 10 to 0 5 of the non zero hourly time intervals while we focus on the peak intensity of individual weather processes we identify three precipitation regimes as being differently impacted by the orographic effects these regimes were also very recently identified in the analysis of the interaction of precipitation systems with low orography and with sea land interfaces in the southeastern mediterranean marra et al 2021b in review this suggests that these regimes could be of more general interest at least in regions in which convection dominates the short duration extremes additional efforts should be invested in the understanding of their response to local forcing and to climate change 6 conclusions in this paper we quantified and interpreted the effects of complex orographic environment on extreme precipitation statistics across a wide range of durations from 5 min to 24 h first we showed that the recently proposed smev statistical framework for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events is capable to quantitatively reproduce i the observed mean annual maxima spatial patterns in a orographically complex area across all durations nash sutcliffe coefficient between observed and smev generated annual maxima is 0 82 0 95 with bias ranging from 4 to 7 as well as ii their dependence on elevation second we estimated the orographic effect on both the smev weibull parameters shape and scale and 2 10 and 50 years return levels results reveal two different modes in the orographic impact on extreme return levels i reverse orographic effect for durations between 5 min and 1 h with 20 to 10 decrease per 1000 m elevation average across the analyzed return levels and ii orographic enhancement for durations between 8 and 24 h with 7 5 to 10 increase per 1000 m elevation average across the analyzed return levels we show that these two modes are related to three different regimes in the interaction of precipitation systems with orography short durations between 5 and 20 min which are mainly dominated by convective peak intensity mid durations between 30 min and 1 h which are related to the yield of individual convective cells and long durations between 2 and 24 h which are associated to stratiform processes superposition or convective cells or combinations of the two the work allowed to disentangle the different effects of the orography extreme precipitations ranging from very short to long durations and to connect them both to three different behaviors of the weibull parameters distribution with elevation and to three possible atmospheric processes the insights provided in this paper although influenced by local morphology and climate may provide a valid framework to better quantify future changes in precipitation extremes in regions with complex orography which shows different behavior for different regimes convective peak intensity convective cell yield multiple convective cells and or stratiform phenomena finally the flexibility of the proposed framework allows applications in other regions of complex orography the density of the observational network may influence the linear regressions fitting and trends estimation high density networks will provide more robust regression fitting and trends evaluation however recent works showed that mev smev type of statistical approaches provide reliable estimate also in case of observational network with short record lengths e g zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 therefore this limitation can be reduced by increasing the

218,extreme precipitation of multiple durations is responsible for major natural hazards in mountainous regions such as flash floods and debris flows understanding the orographic impact on the statistics of precipitation extremes is therefore crucial for improving hydrological design and risk management strategies here we use a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events to improve our understanding of the orographic impact on extreme precipitation of durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h we focus on trentino a rough orographic region in the eastern italia alps and use data from 78 quality controlled rain gauges with 5 minute resolution we show that our framework well reproduces the statistical properties of the observed annual maxima nash sutcliffe 0 82 0 95 bias from 4 to 7 as well as their relation with orography we then exploit the reduced uncertainty of this approach to quantify the orographic impact on precipitation right tail statistics and on extreme return levels using a regression analysis we identify two main modes of orographic relationship a reverse orographic effect for hourly and sub hourly durations 10 20 decrease per 1000 m elevation and an orographic enhancement for durations of 8 h or longer 7 5 10 increase per 1000 m elevation we observe that these two modes result from three main precipitation regimes which show different proportion between extreme and very extreme events and which emerge at very short durations 20 min or shorter mid durations 30 min 1 hour and long durations 2 h or longer

complex orography on extreme rainfall of short duration is still unclear and often reported with contrasting results most studies focused on the identification of the topographic dependence of rainfall extremes for the purpose of spatial interpolation of rainfall statistics e g johnson et al 2016 wagner et al 2012 nalder and wein 1998 some works are focused on the assessment of the orographic impact on the statistics of annual maxima prudhomme and reed 1998 analyzed the relationship between the median of the daily annual maxima and topographic variables including elevation based on data from 1003 stations covering scotland the reported relationships with elevation either computed at site or for the average elevation of areas surrounding the rain gauges were not significant in an analysis of daily annual maxima over campania region in italy furcolo et al 2016 reported a negligible dependence on elevation on average 2 increment over 1000 m of elevation annual maxima of sub daily rainfall from more than 550 stations located in northern italy were found to significantly decrease with elevation allamano et al 2009 very few studies examined the topographic relationships on extreme return levels speculatively this reflects the limitations of the statistical approaches for extreme value analysis usually based on annual maxima or the values exceeding a high threshold which require long records of homogeneous data when these are not available regionalization approaches are used to pool data from multiple locations buishand 1991 thus inevitably smoothing existing orographic relationships alternatively extremes from multiple durations are pooled e g scaling and multi scaling approaches thus smoothing existing differential orographic impacts at different durations examining the 100 year return levels rossi et al 2020 reported a roughly linear decrease of the 2 hourly rainfall rates with elevation and a non monotonic relationship for daily rainfall rates with an increase up to 2500 m a s l followed by a decrease at higher elevations similar results are presented for 2 years return period avanzi et al 2015 found similar results analyzing annual rainfall maxima form 1494 stations across italy with duration from 1 h to 24 h the results showed a significant decrease of the mean of the annual precipitation maxima of hourly duration with elevation whereas the absolute slope decreases with increasing rainfall duration these authors termed reverse orographic effect the decrease of the mean of the annual maxima at short hourly duration with elevation marra et al 2021a investigated the effect of the orography on sub hourly extreme rainfall analyzing the data collected from 25 stations located in the southeastern mediterranean area in order to increase the signal to noise ratio these authors used a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on the so called ordinary events which are all the independent realizations of the process of interest they are defined as the finite independent samples of the analyzed stochastic process e g marra et al 2019 marra et al 2021a focused on the peculiar atmosphere orography interaction occurring between mediterranean cyclones and a regular orographic barrier in the southeastern mediterranean and found a decrease with elevation of the typical maximum intensities of short duration and a nonmonotonic change with duration of the tail heaviness of the extreme rainfall distribution namely they reported a decrease in tail heaviness for durations increasing from 10 min to about 1 h and an increase in tail heaviness for longer durations this tail behavior implies that the assumptions underlying multi scaling approaches could be violated in orographic areas however these findings were drawn only considering the windward side of the orographic barrier and focusing on very local conditions i e mediterranean cyclones in the southeastern mediterranean and a relatively smooth orographic barrier not exceeding 1000 m a s l moreover as other types of weather systems contribute to extremes in the region the study could not address the direct impact of orography on extreme return levels it still remains an open question whether these findings hold in more general climatic and orographic conditions in which multiple types of weather systems propagate in different directions while interacting with orography in this paper we extend these earlier results by i leveraging the statistical framework for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events ii investigating the impact of orography on both extreme precipitation statistics and on extreme return levels for durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h and iii focusing on a complex orographic region in the alps where precipitation extremes are generated by the interaction of multiple weather systems with the terrain to reach these goals we make leverage on an updated and quality controlled dataset of continuous short duration rainfall time series for 78 stations in the eastern italian alps with at least 10 valid years per stations the assessment is carried out on the study area considered as whole and by different sub regions the paper is organized in 6 sections the study area and the methodology are presented in section 2 and 3 the results are presented in section 4 and

plays a crucial role in determining i high climatic heterogeneity and ii small scale atmospheric effects in the precipitation spatial distribution the central and northern parts of the region receive relatively low amounts of precipitation about 900 mm yr 1 due to the protection effect played by the surrounding mountains while larger amounts are typically observed in the southeastern and southwestern parts about 1300 mm yr 1 e g borga et al 2005 and references therein we used continuous quality controlled rainfall data with 5 minute temporal resolution collected at 78 reheated rain gauges we considered only rain gauges with at least 10 valid years where a valid year is defined as a calendar year during which less than 10 of the 5 minutes time intervals are flagged as missing or low quality marra et al 2021a the record lengths range from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 35 valid years with an average value across all the rain gauges of 20 valid years previous studies have demonstrated that metastastistical extreme value mev like methods as the one we used in this study are able to provides robust and reliable estimates of high rainfall quantiles also in case of short records marra et al 2018 zorzetto et al 2016 so that these record lengths are deemed sufficient for the scopes of this study it is worth pointing out here that possible negative impacts of the larger parameter estimation uncertainty expected to characterize the shorter records are reduced in our weighted regression analyses see below in order to disentangle the orographic effects from possible spatial effects due to horizontal gradients e g latitudinal and or longitudinal we conduct our analysis by focusing on i the trentino region as whole as well as on ii three sub regions defined also in previous studies e g borga et al 2005 characterized by different elevation ranges and geographic location the central c dark gray in fig 1a the eastern e light gray and the western w medium gray sub region the western and the eastern sub regions present higher elevations compared to the central part which includes the valley of a large river the adige river and the northern portion of a large lake elongated on the south north direction the garda lake this difference in elevation is detailed in fig 1b which shows the number of stations available for each sub region in 500 meter elevation bands 3 methodology 3 1 quantification of the right tail statistics and of extreme return levels in order to define the yearly non exceedance probability g x of an extreme precipitation intensity x mm h 1 we adopt the simplified metastatistical extreme value smev framework presented in marra et al 2019 and 2020 1 g x f x θ n where i f x θ is the cumulative distribution function of the ordinary events described by the parameters θ which according to marani and ignoccolo 2015 are defined as the finite independent samples of the analyzed stochastic process and ii n is the average yearly number of ordinary events the smev formulation can be related to ordinary statistics of n sized block maxima under independence serinaldi et al 2020 differently from the original metastatistical extreme value approach marani and ignoccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 smev relaxes the hypothesis of stochasticity for the distribution parameters θ and the yearly number n of the ordinary events marra et al 2019 this favors a simpler formulation for the non exceedance probabilities of extreme precipitation intensities and a more robust parameter estimation with a reduced parameter estimation uncertainty marra et al 2020 that is even more evident in case of data scarcity i e when rain gauges report a limited number of ordinary events per year marra et al 2019 it is worth noting that previous results could not distinguish between inter annual variability of the parameters and parameter estimation uncertainty marra et al 2020 the two parameter weibull distribution was proposed by wilson and toumi 2005 as a theoretical formulation for the tail of the precipitation intensity distributions and has been used in several studies for modeling precipitation ordinary events with different durations daily e g zorzetto et al 2016 hourly e g papalexiou et al 2018 and sub hourly e g marra et al 2021a the two parameter weibull distribution can be written as 2 f x θ 1 e x p x λ k with θ λ κ where λ 0 mm h 1 is the scale parameter and κ 0 is the shape or tail parameter by definition the scale parameter λ multiplies al the values of the precipitation distribution by a common factor so that larger scales correspond to larger precipitation events and vice versa the shape parameter affects the distribution tail heaviness and low values of the shape κ are related to larger extremes with respect to the average and vice versa shape parameter equal to one reduces the weibull distribution to an exponential one using the smev methodology with a weibull distribution to describe the ordinary events f x θ eq 1 becomes an exponentiated weibull nadarajah et al 2013 3 g x 1 e x λ κ n eq 3 also shows the relationship between the tail of the distribution and n number of yearly ordinary events for typical values of κ usually 1 wilson and toumi 2005 the tail heaviness of the extreme value distribution g x decreases for increasing n and vice versa we recall here that according to wilson and tuomi 2005 the two parameter weibull distribution is expected to describe the right tail of the distribution of ordinary precipitation events and not their entire distribution the increased parameter estimation accuracy of smev allows to tailor the statistical model to the tail characteristics of a study area of interest by left censoring the portion of ordinary events which do not belong to this tail for example marra et al 2019 in israel used the largest 25 to estimate the weibull parameters here after sensitivity analysis carried out following the methodology detailed in marra et al 2020 we selected for this study a left censoring threshold of 75 this means that the largest 25 of the ordinary events are used to quantify the parameters of the weibull distribution describing the tail the intensity of the lowest 75 is thus ignored and only their weight in probability is retained see marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2020 this threshold is in line with the tail definition in marra et al 2019 and marra et al 2020 which examined a mediterranean convective environment while is lower than the one in wang et al 2020 and miniussi and marra 2021 which examined the continental climate of germany starting from 5 minute continuous rainfall time series we define storms which can be interpreted as independent meteorological objects see marra et al 2020 as consecutive wet time intervals separated by dry intervals 0 1 mm in each of the 5 minute time intervals of at least 24 h restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 tarolli et al 2012 ordinary events of multiple durations are then computed for each storm by calculating the maximum intensities observed within each storm using moving windows of the duration of interest marra et al 2020 in this study we considered durations of 5 10 15 30 45minutes and 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 12 24 h since the storms are defined as meteorological objects and ordinary events of all durations are calculated for each storm the parameter n at a given location eq 3 represents the average number of storms per year and is the same at all durations this fundamental property allows us to consistently examine the intensity distribution parameters and thus the characteristics of the precipitation processes across durations marra et al 2020 we estimate the smev distribution parameters at site i e for each rain gage and duration independently the weibull parameters i e θ d λ d κ d are estimated using the ordinary events time series for each duration of interest d left censoring the lowest 75 of the ordinary events and using a linear regression in weibull transformed coordinates see marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2020 last we compute extreme quantiles corresponding to assigned return periods t 2 10 and 50 years also termed return levels q d t mm h 1 by inverting eq 3 uncertainty in the estimated parameters and return levels is quantified via bootstrap with replacement among the years in the record as proposed by overeem et al 2008 years in the record are randomly sampled with replacement and parameters estimated from the obtained data record the procedure is repeated 1000 times and uncertainty is quantified as the 90 confidence interval 3 2 assessment of the modeling framework in order to assess the reliability of a statistical framework based on ordinary events in representing the properties of extremes we compared the mean of the observed annual maxima against stochastic realizations of annual maxima resulting from monte carlo simulations drawn from the smev model at each iteration l annual maxima with l being the number of valid years in the examined station were synthetically generated for each station by taking the maximum value of a set of n ordinary events in case n is not an integer we used the closest integer drawn from a weibull distribution characterized by the previously estimated parameters these synthetic simulations represent many possible realizations of reality under the assumption that the hypotheses behind smev are verified i e that annual maxima are samples from a finite number of ordinary events whose tail the largest 25 in our case is described by a two parameter weibull distribution if our assumptions are correct we expect the observed annual maxima the reality to be a possible sample from these synthetic realizations as proposed in several studies e g soltani et al 2017 ayuso muñoz et al 2015 we selected the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percentage bias pb as metrics to quantify the agreement between simulated x s i and observed x o i mean annual maxima across all the stations i 4 n s e 1 i 1 s x o i x s i 2 i 1 n x o i x o 2 5 p b 100 i 1 s x s i x o i i 1 n x o i where s is the number of stations and x o is the arithmetic mean of the observed variable the nse varies in the range 1 with nse 1 in case of perfect match between modeled and observed data and with nse 0 indicating that the modeling framework is a less powerful predictor than the mean of the observed data the pb measures the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observed values in order to further verify the reliability of the proposed statistical framework to investigate orographic impacts we compared the relations with elevation of modeled monte carlo and observed mean annual maxima a total of 1000 monte carlo iterations were found to be sufficient to reliably estimate the validation metrics and the 90 confidence intervals of the regressions 3 3 quantification of the orographic impact on extreme precipitation statistics and return levels in order to examine and quantify the role of orography on extreme precipitation we performed the regression analysis y a elev b where elev m is the stations elevation and y is in turn the annual maxima the smev parameters and the extreme quantiles finally a and b represent the slope and the intercept of the regression respectively to this purpose we use a weighted linear regression model between the considered dependent variable mean of observed annual maxima smev parameters extreme rainfall quantiles and the elevation independent variable weights in the regression are used as inversely proportional to the 90 confidence interval see previous section of the considered dependent variable so to account for estimation uncertainty we test the statistical significance of the slope of the regression equation against the null hypothesis of absence of dependence i e slope equal zero e g see slater et al 2021 papalexiou and montanari 2019 4 results 4 1 orographic effect on mean annual maxima and assessment of the statistical model the comparison between the mean of the observed and of the smev stochastically generated annual maxima see fig 2 for rainfall durations 5 min for 1 and 24 h shows a good agreement both in terms of quantitative values and in terms of spatial variability within the entire study area the nse computed for each analyzed duration ranges from a minimum of 0 82 for 10 min duration to a maximum of 0 95 for 45 min and the pb ranges from 4 for 2 h duration to 7 for 5 min in the supplementary material figure s 1 we show the scatterplot between the mean of the observed and of the smev stochastically generated annual maxima for all the durations reporting the nse and the pb for each of them the ability of the smev statistical model to capture and represent the orographic impact on extremes is assessed by comparing the elevation dependence in the observed annual maxima with the one of the annual maxima stochastically generated according to the smev hypotheses the slopes and their statistical significance of the regression models between observed and simulated median and 90 confidence interval of the monte carlo realizations are displayed mean annual maxima and elevation are reported in fig 3 the slope of the regression is normalized according to the corresponding median value and reported in units of percent per 1000 m of elevation examining the entire study area the mean of observed annual maxima dots in fig 3 shows a statistically significant p value 0 05 decrease with elevation for durations shorter or equal to 1 h and significant increase with elevation for durations longer or equal to 12 h the slope in the observed mean annual maxima lie well within the 90 confidence intervals of the slopes identified by the synthetic monte carlo realizations implying that reality is indeed a likely sample from the smev hypotheses this means that although based on ordinary events our statistical model is able to reproduce the behavior of annual maxima annual maxima are thus samples from the ordinary events distribution s tail as defined here the observed trends for the entire region range from 20 and 10 reduction per 1000 m elevation 5 min and 1 h duration respectively to 7 5 and 10 increase 12 h and 24 h respectively these findings are in line with the so called reverse orographic effect for short rainfall durations e g avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a and the well known orographic enhancement at multi hour 12 in our case or longer durations e g bonacina 1945 these patterns result from the combination of qualitatively analogous but quantitatively different effects occurring in the three identified sub regions fig 3 statistically significant decrease of short duration 1 h intensities with elevation is observed in the western fig 3 c and easter part fig 3 d and statistically significant increase is observed for longer durations 3 h in the central part fig 3 b in the following we investigate the statistical mechanisms behind these observed behaviors by examining the orographic impact on the parameters of our extreme value model 4 2 orographic effect on the weibull distribution parameters the slopes and their statistical significance of the regression models between ordinary events distribution parameters and elevation for each duration are reported in fig 4 for the weibull shape parameter we present the slope of the regression expressed in units of 1 per 1000 m of elevation while for the weibull scale parameter we normalized the slope of the regression according to the corresponding median value so to have comparable magnitudes across durations and reported in units of percent per 1000 m of elevation to recall and visualize the impact of the scale and shape parameter on the right tail weibull distribution we provide figure s 2 in the supplementary material the shape parameter fig 4 a shows a statistically significant increasing trend with elevation for durations up to 1 h with a peak between 30 min and 1 h at short durations lighter tailed distributions characterize the locations at higher elevation at multi hour durations 3 24 h statistically significant negative relationships between the shape and elevation are observed at long durations heavier tailed distributions characterize the locations at higher elevation at durations between 2 and 3 h the behavior transitions between the two and no significant trend can be identified three behaviors emerge for the scale parameter fig 4 e statistically significant negative trends with elevation are found for short 5 20 min and long 4 12 h durations while between 30 min and 3 h the dependence is not statistically significant with a peak around 1 hour duration interestingly these intervals of durations are similar to the ones observed for the dependence of the shape with elevation the behavior of tail heaviness observed over the entire region is qualitatively confirmed in the three sub regions although quantitative differences emerge all regions show a peak in the shape parameter trends around 30 60 min and generally increasing trends decreasing tail heaviness with elevation at short durations and decreasing trends increasing tail heaviness at multi hour durations although differences emerge in terms of statistical significance fig 4 b to 4 d this is likely due to the reduction of the number of stations fig 1 in particular the central sub region fig 4 b which samples typically lower elevations fig 1 shows no significant changes in tail heaviness at short durations while the eastern sub region fig 4 d shows no significant change at long durations the behavior of the scale parameter is qualitatively analogous across the sub regions fig 4 f to 4 h but no significant signal can be extracted from the individual sub regions finally the n parameter of the distribution which represents the mean number of storms per year and therefore is constant across all the durations median value and standard deviation across the gauged stations equal to 54 6 and 2 96 respectively shows a positive significative trend with elevation 7 2 1000 m at the entire region scale it shows a statistically significant lower increase with elevation in the central sub region 4 4 1000 m and a statistically significant higher increase with elevation in the western and eastern sub regions 7 and 8 1000 m respectively 4 3 orographic effect on rainfall quantiles the slope and statistical significance of the regression models between 2 10 and 50 years return levels and elevation at different durations are reported in fig 5 we normalized the slope of the regression according to the corresponding median value and reported it units of percent per 1000 m of elevation the combined effect observed for the slope of the shape scale parameters with elevation for different durations reflects into the behavior of extreme return levels fig 5 results over the entire area show statistically significant negative trends with elevation for durations up to 1 h which imply larger return levels at lower elevations and statistically significant positive trends at duration from 6 to 24 h this means that return levels are both decreased short durations and intensified long durations by orography for durations between 2 and 3 h the observed trends shift from the short duration to the long duration behavior changing sign and loosing statistical significance interestingly the statistical significance of these trends increases with return period especially for long durations despite the larger uncertainty characterizing the estimates of longer return levels results for the 50 years return period show a statistically significant trend not only for 12 and 24 but also for the 8 h rainfall durations quantitatively the reverse orographic effect short durations ranges from 20 25 to 10 10 decrease per 1000 m of elevation for the 2 50 years return levels moving from 5 min to 1 h durations the orographic enhancement long durations ranges from 8 10 to 10 13 of increasing rainfall per 1000 m of elevation for the 2 50 years years return period quantiles moving from 8 to 24 h duration results for the sub regions show similar patterns to the ones observed for the entire area with some notable quantitative differences fig 5 the central region with more stations at lower elevation presents no statistically significant reverse orographic effect at short durations but shows a more intense and statistically significant orographic enhancement at longer durations 3 to 24 h conversely orographic enhancement at long durations is not significant in the eastern and western regions 5 discussion 5 1 orographic impact on the precipitation processes leading to extremes the different atmospheric processes dominating extremes at different durations could easily explain the differential orographic effects we observe analyzing the response of the smev parameters to elevation we observe three different regimes emerging at very short durations between 5 and 20 min mid durations between 30 min and 1 h and long durations between around 2 and 24 h at short durations the peak rain intensity of convective cores is the dominant process generating extremes here we observed a slightly decreasing tail heaviness coupled with a strongly decreasing scale which combined result in a strong reduction of extremes with elevation the reverse orographic effect at mid durations the local yield of individual convective cells tends to play the more prominent role in generating the extreme rainfall here we found a strong decrease in tail heaviness coupled with a mild or no decrease in the scale which result in a mild decrease of extremes with elevation at long durations extreme precipitation is generated by long lasting stratiform processes as well as successions of multiple convective cells combination of stratiform like and convective processes and eventually snowfall e g minder et al 2015 roe 2005 here we observed an increase in tail heaviness and a mild decrease in the scale which result in an increase of extremes orographic enhancement this interpretation is supported by fig 6 which compares the seasonality of the ordinary events defining the distribution tail their largest 25 in gray for short 5 min medium 1 h and long durations 24 h with the one of all the storms black in particular it can be noted that the seasonality of 5 minute and 1 hour extremes largely overlap and have the typical summer peak characterizing convection in the region while the seasonality of 24 hour extremes is more homogeneously distributed in the year reflecting the multitude of processes contributing to longer duration extremes finally the interaction of local conditions such as orographic changes and valleys morphology and large scale atmospheric processes may explain the fact that the orographic enhancement resulted more intense and statistically significative for the central region where most of the rain gage stations have elevations between 500 and 1500 m and therefore locally connected to this elevation range 5 2 orographic impact on annual maxima and extreme return levels differently from the weibull parameters annual maxima and extreme return levels only show two broad modes short durations below 1 h with a significant decrease of extreme intensities with elevation and long durations above 3 h with a significant increase of extreme intensities with elevation given the high accuracy of our statistical model in reproducing the behavior of annual maxima these two modes need to be interpreted as the superimposition of the three regimes highlighted above for short durations the decrease of the scale parameter with elevation indicates an overall decrease in extreme rainfall and the mild increase of the shape parameter with elevation indicates that very extreme and extreme rainfall events are quantitatively more similar the interactions of the two parameters results in a decrease of extreme return levels with elevation for mid durations the shape continues to increase while the scale doesn t show strong variations with elevation this type of interaction between the two parameters results in a slight decrease of extreme return levels with elevation which is mainly driven by the decreased tail heaviness shape parameter finally for long durations we observed a strong increase of the tail heaviness with elevation which indicates an increase of more extreme rainfall events combined with a decrease of the scale parameter with elevation which indicates an overall decrease this results in an increase of extreme return levels with elevation again driven by the tail heaviness shape parameter as climate change is expected to differently impact the peak intensities and the spatiotemporal organization of convective cells and storms e g wasko et al 2016 peleg et al 2018 fowler et al 2021 knowledge about the different response of these three regimes to orographic forcing is deemed crucial for accurately predicting future changes in precipitation extremes in mountainous regions as a final observation we note that it is possible that some mixed precipitation events snow or mixed rain and snow which we considered as liquid events are involved in our statistical analysis from one side reheated rain gauges are used so that the possible inaccuracy of the measurement of mixed rain and snow events should be minimized from the other side it should be noted that the most relevant natural hazards of interest for hydrological impact studies are related to precipitation in the liquid form so that the problem should be less relevant last we recall that most of the storms of interest for short and mid duration extremes occur in spring summer greys boxplot in fig 6 when precipitation is usually in liquid form 5 3 sub regional variability of the orographic effect different behaviors have been observed within the three examined sub regions specifically the central sub region characterized by lower elevations seem to have different behaviors than the eastern and western sub regions which are characterized by higher elevations the elevation dependence of mean annual maxima showed a significant reverse orographic effect for short rainfall durations only in the western and eastern subregions whereas the orographic enhancement at multi hour durations is statistically significant only in the central sub region additionally although all the regions show similar patterns of tail heaviness to the one observed in the entire region the central sub region shows a statistically significant decreasing trend only at multi hour durations as it concerns the elevation dependence of the quantiles the central region only shows statistically significant dependence and more intense orographic enhancement at longer durations 3 to 24 h the peculiarities of the central sub region are possibly to be attributed to i lower elevations and complex orography ii higher number of stations below 1000 m and iii presence of the adige river and of the garda lake valleys which are regularly oriented in the south north direction and may dominate the local wind directions the combination of these aspects may influence the generating processes of extreme precipitation in the sub regions future research should investigate these impacts and try to draw possible conclusions on their relations with the local terrain 5 4 relations with previous studies our results confirm the reverse orographic effect reported by previous studies for short duration extremes allamano et al 2009 avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a at short durations our results confirm the effect in tail heaviness with peak at hourly durations reported by marra et al 2021a while at multi hour durations our results differ as marra et al 2021a reported not statistically significant but positive trends for the scale parameter this could be explained by the different climatology of the analyzed area and by the fact that we were able to explore these relationships using a larger number of rain gauges at higher elevations and considering all the synoptic systems impacting the area while marra et al 2021a focused on systematic windward conditions and on a relatively low mountain barrier moreover we separate storms using 24 hour dry hiatuses in order to examine durations up to 24 h while marra et al 2021a used 6 hour dry hiatuses similarly to marra et al 2021a our results differ from papalexiou et al 2018 this is explained by the fact that different definitions of the tails are analyzed see also marra et al 2021a papalexiou et al 2018 examined the largest p where p ranged from 10 to 0 5 of the non zero hourly time intervals while we focus on the peak intensity of individual weather processes we identify three precipitation regimes as being differently impacted by the orographic effects these regimes were also very recently identified in the analysis of the interaction of precipitation systems with low orography and with sea land interfaces in the southeastern mediterranean marra et al 2021b in review this suggests that these regimes could be of more general interest at least in regions in which convection dominates the short duration extremes additional efforts should be invested in the understanding of their response to local forcing and to climate change 6 conclusions in this paper we quantified and interpreted the effects of complex orographic environment on extreme precipitation statistics across a wide range of durations from 5 min to 24 h first we showed that the recently proposed smev statistical framework for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events is capable to quantitatively reproduce i the observed mean annual maxima spatial patterns in a orographically complex area across all durations nash sutcliffe coefficient between observed and smev generated annual maxima is 0 82 0 95 with bias ranging from 4 to 7 as well as ii their dependence on elevation second we estimated the orographic effect on both the smev weibull parameters shape and scale and 2 10 and 50 years return levels results reveal two different modes in the orographic impact on extreme return levels i reverse orographic effect for durations between 5 min and 1 h with 20 to 10 decrease per 1000 m elevation average across the analyzed return levels and ii orographic enhancement for durations between 8 and 24 h with 7 5 to 10 increase per 1000 m elevation average across the analyzed return levels we show that these two modes are related to three different regimes in the interaction of precipitation systems with orography short durations between 5 and 20 min which are mainly dominated by convective peak intensity mid durations between 30 min and 1 h which are related to the yield of individual convective cells and long durations between 2 and 24 h which are associated to stratiform processes superposition or convective cells or combinations of the two the work allowed to disentangle the different effects of the orography extreme precipitations ranging from very short to long durations and to connect them both to three different behaviors of the weibull parameters distribution with elevation and to three possible atmospheric processes the insights provided in this paper although influenced by local morphology and climate may provide a valid framework to better quantify future changes in precipitation extremes in regions with complex orography which shows different behavior for different regimes convective peak intensity convective cell yield multiple convective cells and or stratiform phenomena finally the flexibility of the proposed framework allows applications in other regions of complex orography the density of the observational network may influence the linear regressions fitting and trends estimation high density networks will provide more robust regression fitting and trends evaluation however recent works showed that mev smev type of statistical approaches provide reliable estimate also in case of observational network with short record lengths e g zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 therefore this limitation can be reduced by increasing the

219,release of colloids and their subsequent transport into the subsurface environments takes place during a wide range of applications such as industrial energy storage and agricultural activities therefore processes contributing to transport attachment and re mobilization of colloids in porous media are attracting attention a fraction of the released colloids may cross the soil vadose zone to reach the saturated groundwater in this study we explored colloid transport in a micromodel with high repulsion energy barrier where colloid retention is assumed to be low three major shortcomings were improved pore space domain size imaging resolution and speed of imaging the flow path of 1357 colloids with a size of 4 µm were tracked and these enabled precise determination of individual colloid transport mechanism as well as the integrated behavior of the system our direct observations have shown that even under unfavorable attachment conditions defined based on the dlvo theory colloids deposition occurred which was mainly due to the local flow velocity fluctuations and grain surface heterogeneity using the information from collective trajectories we have quantified the contribution of differently behaved colloids in the observed breakthrough curve which show an integrated macroscopic behavior of the system and is often the only available information when performing column or field scale experiments to explore colloid transport in porous media furthermore we have shown that attachment and remobilization of colloids increased the dispersion coefficient and consequently the dispersivity value of the media keywords colloid transport dlvo microfluidics colloid tracking 1 introduction the increased use of natural and engineered colloids and nanoparticles in agriculture industry and consumer products lead to more exposure of soils to these particles kretzschmar et al 1999 troester et al 2016 wang et al 2016 moreover in the recent years the subsurface environment is being extensively used for energy storage applications which promote creation and remobilization of colloids particle transport in the subsurface is therefore attracting much attention since particles are now being detected in larger amounts in the environment including in drinking water supplies which can pose health threats kretzschmar and schafer 2005 rodrigues et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the vadose zone of soil generally acts as a natural barrier against groundwater pollution therefore the groundwater is less prone to pollution than the surface water due to natural attenuation processes taking place in this section of the earth however once contaminated pollution in groundwater can remain for very long periods of time with groundwater remediation often being very complicated troester et al 2016 although a large fraction of pollutants may be filtered out by the vadose zone more intense land usage causes more pollution of groundwater i e the saturated zone where contaminants can be transported and spread relatively fast the subsurface is often very heterogeneous chemically and physically argent et al 2015 bradford et al 2015 with the transport of colloids being affected by several coupled processes mitropoulou et al 2013 sang et al 2013 therefore predicting the final state and transport of colloids in the subsurface is very complicated and requires a fundamental understanding of the main governing processes for surfaces with opposite charges particle deposition is favorable because van der waals and electric double layer type interactions are both attractive which allows colloid transport to be well predicted using colloid filtration theory cft yao et al 1971 baumann and werth 2004 massoudieh and ginn 2010 using cft the removal of particles from the bulk fluid can be calculated with a single collector efficiency however when the two surfaces are similarly charged which is often encountered in the earth subsurface electric double layer interactions are repulsive while van der waals interactions attractive an energy barrier against deposition can develop under these electrostatically unfavorable conditions in that case an extra parameter defined as the attachment efficiency is employed to account for the repulsive forces tufenkji and elimelech 2004 miele et al 2019 to determine the various parameters colloid transport experiments are often caried out at the column length scale syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2015 from which colloid breakthrough curves are obtained at the column exit empirical absorption coefficients can be estimated by fitting the breakthrough data using macroscopic formulations molnar et al 2015 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory may be used to determine the net interaction energy between a collector surface and a colloid or between colloids by combining van der waals attraction forces and the electrostatic repulsion forces ryan and elimelech 1996 peng et al 2010 the theory assumes smooth surfaces with uniform chemical properties although the approach does not consider local roughness argent et al 2015 and local surface charge fluctuations that may happen due to chemical nonuniformities bradford et al 2015 spatial variability in the pore water velocity is also known to affect colloid transport of colloids which is not included in the dlvo theory a wide range of adsorption processes act on colloids e g straining bridging electrostatic interaction and aggregation with their occurrence and frequency depending on the dynamics of flow and the surface properties bradford and torkzaban 2015 these processes interact with the spatially variable pore velocities to ultimately affect the attachment and remobilization of colloids observing such interactions requires relatively large samples where pore sizes and pore connectivity are considered to capture both velocity variations and the occurrence of different adsorption processes however large domain sizes together with the required imaging resolution to observe individual colloids provide major challenges for direct observations of colloid transport in porous media and therefore upscaling of colloid transport in porous media these challenges produce much uncertainty in linking the observed colloid breakthrough curves obtained to the basic processes wang et al 2012 bradford and torkzaban 2015 molnar et al 2015 to overcome these difficulties pore scale experiments should be performed where colloid transport adsorption and mobilization can be observed directly and simultaneously within a sufficient number of pores to accurately represent the target porous medium so far for porous media in the size ranges of sand i e grain sizes of around 100 µm direct observations have been carried out using microscopy methods such as confocal scanning microscopy lazouskaya et al 2011 2013 zhang et al 2013 these methods provide micrometer scale observations however for relatively small domain sizes the imaged domain sizes then often cover one pore or even smaller e g part of a pore located close to the collector surface local roughness and flow field variations between different pores in that case are left out when using single flow channels lazouskaya et al 2011 sun et al 2018 capillary tubes or in case of using limited number of pores or regular periodic pore structure auset and keller 2006a wang et al 2011 liu et al 2019 periodicity in porous media is known to lead to a dependency on the direction of the flow with respect to the periodicity of the medium nguyen et al 2017 reichhardt and reichhardt 2021 in this study we investigated colloid transport under unfavorable conditions using realistic pore structure composed of a large number of pores meanwhile the whole pore structure together with all individual colloids are imaged simultaneously and over time we developed for this purpose an optical set up allowing to image the micromodel with a resolution of 2 9 µm using a micromodel with a length and width of 10 mm with an irregular pore structure and a frame rate of 10 frames per second to track colloid trajectories the transport paths of the colloids involving a total of over 1300 separate trajectories within the domain were further categorized into three groups of colloids i mobile colloids ii immobilized colloids and ii remobilized particles transport properties of each category and then analyzed in detail the main goal is to capture the full trajectory of colloids flowing through the pore network and observe their dynamic behavior in the presence of a high repulsion energy barrier where retention is presumed to be low 2 materials and methods 2 1 pore space topology in this study we used real pore structures obtained by 3d imaging a sand sample using x ray tomography the 3d image was used to extract a 2d slice to develop a mask needed to fabricate a polydimethylsiloxane pdms micromodel the pore structures were fabricated using soft lithography techniques the pore domain had a physical size of 10 10 mm2 and the full micromodel including the inlet and the outlet structures had a size of 25 10 mm2with a depth of 20 µm and a porosity of 0 40 the micromodel allows for direct observation of colloid transport although due to the quasi 2d structure grain grain contacts are present although they do not accurately represent the contact points of a 3d porous media fig 1 shows the complete micromodel structure with table 1 providing details of the solid phase and the pore space detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials 2 2 the microscopy setup and the experimental procedure we developed a home build microscope setup to perform particle tracking the setup consisted of two 595 nm led s thorlabs m595 with band pass filters of 580 10 nm thorlabs fb580 10 to excite the colloids fig 2 we used 4 µm colloids fluospheres sulfate microspheres 580 605 thermofischer which emitted red light at a peak wavelength of 605 nm the emitted light was isolated and captured using a long pass filter of 600 nm thorlabs fel0600 placed in front of the camera basler aca5472 17um fluid flow was established using a syringe pump harvard apparatus pump 11 pico plus elite connected by a tube to the micromodel main inlet channel the main outlet channel was connected to a fluid reservoir fig 2 provides the configuration of the setup the pore space is initially fully saturated with ethanol afterward we injected 100 pore volumes pv of colloid free water into the pore space to provide fully saturated water flow and steady state condition the experiment was continued by injecting 5 pv of the solution containing colloids followed by 10 pv of a colloid free solution at an average pore water velocity of 12 0 m day ¹ a low input concentration was used to stay in the single colloid limit which is usually the case in the earth subsurface environment such as transport of pathogenic bacteria and viruses where they are present under low concentrations to increase their survival chances for long time periods of several months pekdeger and matthess 1983 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 under such low concentrations clogging and plugging of pores does not happen due to bridging and straining processes unlike other studies that focus on clogging of porous media under relevant conditions auset and keller 2006b reichhardt and reichhardt 2017 péter et al 2018 parvan et al 2021 accurate imaging required minimum disturbance and vibration of the setup during the injection experiments to achieve this the complete sequence of solutions i e the sequence of clean solutions and solutions having colloids were injected prior to the start of experiments into the inlet tube this approach allowed different target solutions to enter the micromodel without changing the tubing of the system or using any flow switch which can affect the accuracy of injection and imaging throughout the experiment images were recorded at a resolution of 2 9 µm with an imaging rate of 10 frames per second 2 3 the imaging processes an image of a fully rhodamine saturated micromodel was taken to serve as the reference image mask for the pore space during analyses comparisons of images taken during the experiments against the reference image provides images of only the pore space including the colloids we used image analysis to detect colloids within each individual image and tracking individual colloids between successive frames i e one to one paring of colloids in each frame n to colloids in a successive frame n 1 to obtain complete colloid trajectories laplacian of gaussian particle detection log detector was used to detect particles lindeberg 1998 and the linear assignment problem lap particle linking algorithm jaqaman et al 2008 applied in the trackmate package developed by tinevez et al 2017 for our experiments as it is optimized for non dense particle systems the obtained trajectories were further analyzed in matlab and details of the imaging process and analysis as well as the trajectory information are provided in the supplementary information as noted earlier the acquired trajectories were divided into three categories representing i mobile colloids ii remobilized colloids and iii permanently attached colloids i e immobilized colloids all trajectories describe the full path from the point of entry until the colloids either deposited or passed through the entire domain using the obtained comprehensive information from experiments several transport properties were calculated including the tortuosity of particle trajectories residence time of particles frequency of attachment and remobilization events for each particle as well as the penetration depth and the 1st and 2nd moments of the attached mass detailed information on the transport properties is provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 zeta potential the zeta potential measurements were carried out with a zetasizer nano zs analyser malvern instruments worcestershire uk the colloid solution was prepared with a specific concentration in deionized water to measure the electrophoretic mobility of the dispersed colloids in solution before the measurements the suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath measurements were taken at 20 c at neutral ph the zeta potential was derived from the electrophoretic mobility assuming applicability of henry s equation and smoluchowski approximation sze et al 2003 to calculate the dlvo forces the equations to calculate the dlvo forces are given in the supplementary materials 2 5 breakthrough curve btc traditionally concentration breakthrough curves i e btcs are measured at the outlet of the system by collecting the outflow solution when using micromodel experiments this is done by measuring fluorescence intensity at the outlet location of the domain zhang et al 2015 the breakthrough curve shows an integrated average behavior of the system and does not uniquely reveal the contribution of the internal local behaviors nevertheless btc s are of importance for upscaling using macroscopic continuum scale modeling baumann and werth 2004 in our experiments we simultaneously capture the internal pore scale behavior of colloids as well as the average behavior which is obtained using the btcs measured at the sample outlet 3 experimental results and analysis colloid transport experiments under unfavorable conditions resulted in a total of 1357 trajectories of the colloids of which 1309 were transported through the entire domain without any deposition 19 attached and then remobilized and 29 colloids permanently attached to a collector surface fig 3 shows the collection of trajectories that passed through the domain while a large number of colloids percolated through the sample we have observed several pores which never received any colloids these pores are mainly dead end pores and or pores oriented perpendicular to the overall flow direction i e normal to the generated pressure gradients leading to low flow velocities in what follows we first discuss the dlvo profile next we focus on the integrated behavior of colloids in the system followed by characterizing trajectories of the attached colloids and the breakthrough curves 3 1 dlvo profile the measured zeta potential of the colloids in deionized water was 47 mv the zeta potential for the pdms was taken as 80 mv sze et al 2003 kirby and hasselbrink 2004 almutairi et al 2012 and the ionic strength close to zero fig 4 shows that the dlvo profile between the colloids and the collector surface has a high primary minimum barrier but no secondary minimum due to the low ionic strength this indicates unfavorable conditions under which colloid attachment is not probable when only dlvo forces were taken into consideration however several other processes could contribute to attachment including local grain roughness surface charge heterogeneities and local flow conditions bradford and torkzaban 2015 bradford et al 2015 which could lead to lower effective energy barrier and cause colloid attachment 3 2 tortuosity normal distance to grain surface and trajectory average velocity fig 5 together with table 2 average values show the behavior of colloid trajectories divided into three categories of mobile remobilized and attached colloids the probability distributions for the parameters are given in the supplementary materials results show that colloids that moved closer to the grain surfaces had longer trajectories which increased their tortuosity fig 5a and caused lower observed transport velocities fig 5b although data points are scattered in fig 5c they show a general linear trend between the normal distance from the grains and the velocity of colloid trajectories the outliers may be impacted by the measurement procedure which is discussed in the supplementary materials for colloids that were permanently attached inside the pore network average values were calculated up to the moment of attachment the attached colloids generally show transport at close distances to the solid grains however they show a wide range of tortuosity values when colloids were attached close to the inlet the tortuosity of their trajectories remains close to 1 0 because of their short travel time and distance the attached colloids which deposited at larger distances within the pore space showed higher tortuosity values mainly because they followed the curved grain surfaces during their transport therefore the average tortuosity of colloids that became permanently attached inside the domain can be even lower compared to other colloids remobilized colloids showed an average tortuosity value of 1 225 which is larger than the average tortuosity of mobile colloids 1 205 this is mainly because remobilized colloids follow more twisted paths during their relatively large residence times across the pore network we can conclude that colloids subject to attachment have a higher tortuosity as they generally travel for longer times in the vicinity of solid surfaces and create longer paths compared to the colloids that were mobile and transported rather through the central regions of the pores overall the trajectory of remobilized and permanently attached colloids pass close to the grain surfaces which causes the average velocity to be lower than the mobile colloids local variations in the flow velocity distribution and dlvo forces will determine the ultimate attachment of colloids 3 3 remobilization in this section we will describe colloid remobilization events of the trajectories that became permanently attached none showed attachment and remobilization events before deposition whereas 19 colloids showed attachment and remobilization below we will explore the average and standard deviation i e sample scale transport properties and then describe two of the trajectories in more detail analysis have been done on the temporal evolution of adsorption using the 1st and the 2nd moments which are given in the supplementary materials the remobilized colloids spent on average of 42 1 48 5 s in the attached state immobile with the total time within the porous medium being on average 144 4 41 74 s this shows that the remobilized colloids spend on average 29 of the total residence time attached to the soil grains this compares with mobile colloid which on average spend 92 4 27 6 s within the domain comparing these residence times shows that remobilization requires on average 50 extra time for colloids to arrive at the outlet the trajectories of these colloids have a higher tortuosity compared to the mobile colloids and they often are transported closer to the solid grains and have lower average velocities in our experiments the maximum time that a colloid was immobilized before being remobilized was 208 s with this colloid residing 268 s inside the domain typical examples of the colloid velocity and distance to solid against time are given in fig 6 we found that colloid 615 closely followed free flow i e being mobile while being transported only slightly closer to the walls compared to the completely mobile colloids before attachment the colloids came closer to the collector surface before being immobile for 110 s while being immobile the colloid showed very little movement although very small fluctuations in the velocity are visible the velocities fall within the error margin an assessment is made in the supplementary materials colloid 548 also follows a free flow path before reaching a low velocity area where it is immobilized for 10 s after remobilization the colloid shows rolling along the collector surface before it is transported by bulk free flow similar behavior was found for the 18 other colloids that showed attachment and remobilization in this study only forward flow was applied and the results showed remobilization of colloids either by local flow velocity perturbations or rolling along the surface at very low rates while other mechanisms could lead to remobilization as well i e increased flow velocity bradford et al 2009 knappenberger et al 2014 moving interfaces aramrak et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 shift in chemical conditions mitropoulou et al 2013 samari kermani et al 2021 or reversed flow reichhardt and reichhardt 2018 3 4 permanently attached colloids fig 7 shows the location of the attached colloids together with their trajectories before attachment inside the transport domain additionally table 3 provides the average properties of the attached colloids fig 7 shows that although most of colloids were attached to the solid grain walls some of them were attached to the top or bottom section of the microfluidic the mean throat size in which colloid attachment has occurred is 0 107 mm probability density function is given in the supplementary materials and the average throat size of the domain is 0 145 mm therefore colloids have shown tendency to become attached within the smaller pores in several cases multiple colloids were attached at the same location when this occurs the first attached colloid may turn the situation more favorable for the newly arriving colloids to attach shown by blue markers in fig 7 the peak arrival time of mobile colloid concentration at the outlet was 90 s however a small fraction of colloids became attached at time later than 100 s these colloids mostly attached in regions close to the end of the domain and often had a lower average velocity compared the bulk flow travel times much higher than those of the mobile colloids would indicate a high amount of remobilization occurring in the system however our results show that the attached colloids were not subject to remobilization prior to permanent attachment furthermore from fig 7 it is evident that several colloids move for some time in close proximity to the collector surface prior to attachment this behavior shows that the attraction forces are relatively weak to hold the colloids strongly and that it takes some time for colloids to find an attachment location where the net forces are favorable for attraction fig 8 shows the trajectories of three colloids even though colloid 1290 was attached and the other two colloids were mobile throughout the flow domain however all three had very similar trajectories during most of their flow path colloid 1280 reached a low velocity zone after 100 s when it began rolling along the surface for another 70 s before attachment rolling of the colloid was due to the overall unfavorable conditions for attachment where colloids can attach at a smaller fraction of surfaces when a suitable site is found and the energy barrier is lower due to local roughness chemical heterogeneities and or lower local fluid flow velocities fig 8c shows the velocity profile i e along the sample for an ultimately attached colloid number 1280 as well as for another two trajectories passing through the whole domain without any deposition although the trajectories shown in fig 8a were very similar the velocity distribution was different for each track until 9 5 mm there was no indication that track 1278 would become attached at 9 5 mm the particle stagnates and rolled until becoming attached this observation reveals the challenge of using the location and shape of a trajectory to predict whether an attachment event will occur 3 5 bridging colloid sizes and surface properties together with a relatively low input concentration of colloids which is often the case in subsurface environments used in this study resulted in no straining clogging or aggregation in our experiments however local colloid bridging was observed at three locations where attachment took place in proximity of a previous attached colloid we should note that as bridging happens and more colloids attach at the same location the emission from the fluorescence particles intensifies but the resolution limit makes it difficult to distinguish each particle after they are attached nevertheless because of the trajectory that leads exactly to the previously attached particle see fig 7 blue dots and their trajectories we could detect the bridging process fig 9 shows the velocity of this category of colloids versus the longitudinal distance while the three trajectories were similar the transport velocities were different between these trajectories at location 0 25 mm we observed the highest velocity reached by colloid 402 and followed by colloids 883 and 1246 while at location 2 1 mm we observed the highest velocity reached by colloid 1246 and subsequently by 883 and 402 this indicates that the correlation of transport velocity between pores is relatively low which is often assumed to occur up to one pore alim et al 2017 miele et al 2019 it is difficult to foresee if a particle will bridge to another particle although the trajectories indicate that the flow velocities do not differentiate much between the trajectories this also indicates that the colloids were probably being transported at similar depth inside the micromodel and thus making it more likely to bridge to a previously attached colloid 3 6 breakthrough curves a major aim of this study was to capture full colloid trajectories throughout the domain as well as colloid concentrations at the outlet to provide insight into the breakthrough curves our micromodel was designed to have a uniform flux at the inlet of the sample however small discrepancies between the inlet channels were inevitable this will cause slight local differences in the velocity field and fluctuations in arrival times of colloids at the start of the pore network moreover hydrodynamic dispersion will likely occur also inside the inlet tube as well as inside the inlet channels of the micromodel these factors will turn the pulse input into a distributed and often skewed input concentration which may fluctuate over time however since the whole pore space was imaged the arrival time of each individual colloid at the start of the pore domain and when they surpass the outlet which corresponds to the residence time in the pore network of the colloid we can normalize colloid entrance times and construct a dirac delta input i e in the normalized form all the particles enter the domain instantaneously at t 0 which is equal to the probability density function of the residence time constructing the breakthrough curve in this way would assure that colloids migrate and interact with the solid grain individually i e no dominant colloid colloid interaction which is valid for our experiments based on our observations of colloid trajectories having the information of full trajectories for different categories of colloids we can construct various breakthrough curves from one dataset such as btc of all colloids entered the system btc of mobile colloids and btc of colloids only with detachment and or remobilization events this will a much better understanding of the influence of attachment and remobilization on the breakthrough curves fig 10 shows the normalized average concentration breakthrough curves btcs for colloids that were mobile in the domain and for all colloids the progression of colloids within the domain in form of concentration btcs are given in supplementary materials due to the small number of particles with attachment and detachment events compared to the bulk flow we see little influence on the shape of the obtained breakthrough curves all curves are only slightly asymmetrical which is due to the preferential nonequilibrium flow paths with colloid attachment detachment causing slight increase in late time tailing of the btcs when we exclude these processes one can analyze the obtained btcs in terms of the classic advection dispersion equation ade c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where c represents the colloid concentration v denotes the pore water velocity d is the dispersion coefficient t is time and x is the spatial coordinate as before it is also possible to use a advection dispersion sorption equation for example a one site or two site kinetic model to account for the sorption and desorption of colloids to and from the solid wall schijven and šimrunek 2002 molnar et al 2015 for example if the fraction of remobilized and attached colloids would increase which have longer residence time than the mobile colloids then the traditional ade would not suit for the observed btc in this case we chose to analyze both trajectory categories using the equilibrium ade as its was adequate to describe the observed attachment detachment processes fig 10 shows the multi fitted btcs single fit results are provided in supplementary materials and table 4 provides the optimized transport parameters d v and the dispersivity α dv obtained by cxtifit code in stanmod šimůnek et al 1999 as well the r² values for a single fit at only the location of 9 8 mm and a multi fit where the transport parameters were optimized simultaneously for btcs at two locations i e x 5 5 and 9 8 mm the single fits performed slightly better indicated by the r ² value and the fitted velocities are marginally lower than those obtained using the multi fit the fitted velocities are slightly lower than the estimated values as shown in table 2 the underestimation can be caused by the presence of the preferential flow paths the dispersion coefficient for multi fit optimization is higher than the single fit which is due to the stronger bell shape of the fitted btcs supplementary materials results show the influence of the attachment attachment detachment trajectories on the btcs as slightly higher estimated dispersion coefficient and hence also the dispersivity value 4 conclusions in this study we have developed a new microscopy setup to perform colloidal experiments at the cm scale while simultaneously observing transport attachment and remobilization of all individual colloids at the micrometer scale for each individual colloid that was transported through the domain the trajectory was captured and analyzed to explore the attachment we found that even under unfavorable conditions based on the dlvo interactions colloids were attached due to fluctuations in the local flow velocity i e fluctuating hydrodynamic forces and local roughness affecting local dlvo forces the observed trajectories were normalized into single breakthrough curves and fitted using analytical solutions which describes colloids transport as 1d macroscopic process along the general flow direction this study as particularly showed that the trajectory of the remobilized and permanently attached colloids overall passed close to the grain surfaces with a lower average velocity compared to the velocity of the bulk flow due to low input concentration no colloid aggregation was observed and therefore straining was not observed due to the low ratio in particle size versus the pore sizes a few instances of bridging were observed this retention processes as well as straining would be expected to be a higher contributor to retention at higher input concentrations the remobilized colloids spent on average 29 of the total residence time in the attached state at the soil grains after remobilization some colloids show rolling along the collector surface before being transported into the bulk free flow colloids with very similar trajectories i e transportation in close vicinity of each other could show different attachment behaviors and different flow velocities along their respective trajectories attached colloids showed clear rolling over the solid grains due to the overall unfavorable conditions for attachment before their depositions attachment and remobilization caused slight increase in estimated dispersion coefficient and subsequently the dispersivity value of the media obtained by fitting to the ade equation the developed microscopic set up demonstrates the potential to further investigate pore scale behavior at the cm scale by including various chemical conditions hydrophobicity changes flow conditions two phase flow colloid size and shape and different pore structure topologies furthermore the set up can be extended with an additional camera and light source to be able to observe two different species of colloids simultaneously

219,release of colloids and their subsequent transport into the subsurface environments takes place during a wide range of applications such as industrial energy storage and agricultural activities therefore processes contributing to transport attachment and re mobilization of colloids in porous media are attracting attention a fraction of the released colloids may cross the soil vadose zone to reach the saturated groundwater in this study we explored colloid transport in a micromodel with high repulsion energy barrier where colloid retention is assumed to be low three major shortcomings were improved pore space domain size imaging resolution and speed of imaging the flow path of 1357 colloids with a size of 4 µm were tracked and these enabled precise determination of individual colloid transport mechanism as well as the integrated behavior of the system our direct observations have shown that even under unfavorable attachment conditions defined based on the dlvo theory colloids deposition occurred which was mainly due to the local flow velocity fluctuations and grain surface heterogeneity using the information from collective trajectories we have quantified the contribution of differently behaved colloids in the observed breakthrough curve which show an integrated macroscopic behavior of the system and is often the only available information when performing column or field scale experiments to explore colloid transport in porous media furthermore we have shown that attachment and remobilization of colloids increased the dispersion coefficient and consequently the dispersivity value of the media keywords colloid transport dlvo microfluidics colloid tracking 1 introduction the increased use of natural and engineered colloids and nanoparticles in agriculture industry and consumer products lead to more exposure of soils to these particles kretzschmar et al 1999 troester et al 2016 wang et al 2016 moreover in the recent years the subsurface environment is being extensively used for energy storage applications which promote creation and remobilization of colloids particle transport in the subsurface is therefore attracting much attention since particles are now being detected in larger amounts in the environment including in drinking water supplies which can pose health threats kretzschmar and schafer 2005 rodrigues et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the vadose zone of soil generally acts as a natural barrier against groundwater pollution therefore the groundwater is less prone to pollution than the surface water due to natural attenuation processes taking place in this section of the earth however once contaminated pollution in groundwater can remain for very long periods of time with groundwater remediation often being very complicated troester et al 2016 although a large fraction of pollutants may be filtered out by the vadose zone more intense land usage causes more pollution of groundwater i e the saturated zone where contaminants can be transported and spread relatively fast the subsurface is often very heterogeneous chemically and physically argent et al 2015 bradford et al 2015 with the transport of colloids being affected by several coupled processes mitropoulou et al 2013 sang et al 2013 therefore predicting the final state and transport of colloids in the subsurface is very complicated and requires a fundamental understanding of the main governing processes for surfaces with opposite charges particle deposition is favorable because van der waals and electric double layer type interactions are both attractive which allows colloid transport to be well predicted using colloid filtration theory cft yao et al 1971 baumann and werth 2004 massoudieh and ginn 2010 using cft the removal of particles from the bulk fluid can be calculated with a single collector efficiency however when the two surfaces are similarly charged which is often encountered in the earth subsurface electric double layer interactions are repulsive while van der waals interactions attractive an energy barrier against deposition can develop under these electrostatically unfavorable conditions in that case an extra parameter defined as the attachment efficiency is employed to account for the repulsive forces tufenkji and elimelech 2004 miele et al 2019 to determine the various parameters colloid transport experiments are often caried out at the column length scale syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2015 from which colloid breakthrough curves are obtained at the column exit empirical absorption coefficients can be estimated by fitting the breakthrough data using macroscopic formulations molnar et al 2015 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory may be used to determine the net interaction energy between a collector surface and a colloid or between colloids by combining van der waals attraction forces and the electrostatic repulsion forces ryan and elimelech 1996 peng et al 2010 the theory assumes smooth surfaces with uniform chemical properties although the approach does not consider local roughness argent et al 2015 and local surface charge fluctuations that may happen due to chemical nonuniformities bradford et al 2015 spatial variability in the pore water velocity is also known to affect colloid transport of colloids which is not included in the dlvo theory a wide range of adsorption processes act on colloids e g straining bridging electrostatic interaction and aggregation with their occurrence and frequency depending on the dynamics of flow and the surface properties bradford and torkzaban 2015 these processes interact with the spatially variable pore velocities to ultimately affect the attachment and remobilization of colloids observing such interactions requires relatively large samples where pore sizes and pore connectivity are considered to capture both velocity variations and the occurrence of different adsorption processes however large domain sizes together with the required imaging resolution to observe individual colloids provide major challenges for direct observations of colloid transport in porous media and therefore upscaling of colloid transport in porous media these challenges produce much uncertainty in linking the observed colloid breakthrough curves obtained to the basic processes wang et al 2012 bradford and torkzaban 2015 molnar et al 2015 to overcome these difficulties pore scale experiments should be performed where colloid transport adsorption and mobilization can be observed directly and simultaneously within a sufficient number of pores to accurately represent the target porous medium so far for porous media in the size ranges of sand i e grain sizes of around 100 µm direct observations have been carried out using microscopy methods such as confocal scanning microscopy lazouskaya et al 2011 2013 zhang et al 2013 these methods provide micrometer scale observations however for relatively small domain sizes the imaged domain sizes then often cover one pore or even smaller e g part of a pore located close to the collector surface local roughness and flow field variations between different pores in that case are left out when using single flow channels lazouskaya et al 2011 sun et al 2018 capillary tubes or in case of using limited number of pores or regular periodic pore structure auset and keller 2006a wang et al 2011 liu et al 2019 periodicity in porous media is known to lead to a dependency on the direction of the flow with respect to the periodicity of the medium nguyen et al 2017 reichhardt and reichhardt 2021 in this study we investigated colloid transport under unfavorable conditions using realistic pore structure composed of a large number of pores meanwhile the whole pore structure together with all individual colloids are imaged simultaneously and over time we developed for this purpose an optical set up allowing to image the micromodel with a resolution of 2 9 µm using a micromodel with a length and width of 10 mm with an irregular pore structure and a frame rate of 10 frames per second to track colloid trajectories the transport paths of the colloids involving a total of over 1300 separate trajectories within the domain were further categorized into three groups of colloids i mobile colloids ii immobilized colloids and ii remobilized particles transport properties of each category and then analyzed in detail the main goal is to capture the full trajectory of colloids flowing through the pore network and observe their dynamic behavior in the presence of a high repulsion energy barrier where retention is presumed to be low 2 materials and methods 2 1 pore space topology in this study we used real pore structures obtained by 3d imaging a sand sample using x ray tomography the 3d image was used to extract a 2d slice to develop a mask needed to fabricate a polydimethylsiloxane pdms micromodel the pore structures were fabricated using soft lithography techniques the pore domain had a physical size of 10 10 mm2 and the full micromodel including the inlet and the outlet structures had a size of 25 10 mm2with a depth of 20 µm and a porosity of 0 40 the micromodel allows for direct observation of colloid transport although due to the quasi 2d structure grain grain contacts are present although they do not accurately represent the contact points of a 3d porous media fig 1 shows the complete micromodel structure with table 1 providing details of the solid phase and the pore space detailed information is provided in the

m595 with band pass filters of 580 10 nm thorlabs fb580 10 to excite the colloids fig 2 we used 4 µm colloids fluospheres sulfate microspheres 580 605 thermofischer which emitted red light at a peak wavelength of 605 nm the emitted light was isolated and captured using a long pass filter of 600 nm thorlabs fel0600 placed in front of the camera basler aca5472 17um fluid flow was established using a syringe pump harvard apparatus pump 11 pico plus elite connected by a tube to the micromodel main inlet channel the main outlet channel was connected to a fluid reservoir fig 2 provides the configuration of the setup the pore space is initially fully saturated with ethanol afterward we injected 100 pore volumes pv of colloid free water into the pore space to provide fully saturated water flow and steady state condition the experiment was continued by injecting 5 pv of the solution containing colloids followed by 10 pv of a colloid free solution at an average pore water velocity of 12 0 m day ¹ a low input concentration was used to stay in the single colloid limit which is usually the case in the earth subsurface environment such as transport of pathogenic bacteria and viruses where they are present under low concentrations to increase their survival chances for long time periods of several months pekdeger and matthess 1983 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 under such low concentrations clogging and plugging of pores does not happen due to bridging and straining processes unlike other studies that focus on clogging of porous media under relevant conditions auset and keller 2006b reichhardt and reichhardt 2017 péter et al 2018 parvan et al 2021 accurate imaging required minimum disturbance and vibration of the setup during the injection experiments to achieve this the complete sequence of solutions i e the sequence of clean solutions and solutions having colloids were injected prior to the start of experiments into the inlet tube this approach allowed different target solutions to enter the micromodel without changing the tubing of the system or using any flow switch which can affect the accuracy of injection and imaging throughout the experiment images were recorded at a resolution of 2 9 µm with an imaging rate of 10 frames per second 2 3 the imaging processes an image of a fully rhodamine saturated micromodel was taken to serve as the reference image mask for the pore space during analyses comparisons of images taken during the experiments against the reference image provides images of only the pore space including the colloids we used image analysis to detect colloids within each individual image and tracking individual colloids between successive frames i e one to one paring of colloids in each frame n to colloids in a successive frame n 1 to obtain complete colloid trajectories laplacian of gaussian particle detection log detector was used to detect particles lindeberg 1998 and the linear assignment problem lap particle linking algorithm jaqaman et al 2008 applied in the trackmate package developed by tinevez et al 2017 for our experiments as it is optimized for non dense particle systems the obtained trajectories were further analyzed in matlab and details of the imaging process and analysis as well as the trajectory information are provided in the supplementary information as noted earlier the acquired trajectories were divided into three categories representing i mobile colloids ii remobilized colloids and iii permanently attached colloids i e immobilized colloids all trajectories describe the full path from the point of entry until the colloids either deposited or passed through the entire domain using the obtained comprehensive information from experiments several transport properties were calculated including the tortuosity of particle trajectories residence time of particles frequency of attachment and remobilization events for each particle as well as the penetration depth and the 1st and 2nd moments of the attached mass detailed information on the transport properties is provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 zeta potential the zeta potential measurements were carried out with a zetasizer nano zs analyser malvern instruments worcestershire uk the colloid solution was prepared with a specific concentration in deionized water to measure the electrophoretic mobility of the dispersed colloids in solution before the measurements the suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath measurements were taken at 20 c at neutral ph the zeta potential was derived from the electrophoretic mobility assuming applicability of henry s equation and smoluchowski approximation sze et al 2003 to calculate the dlvo forces the equations to calculate the dlvo forces are given in the supplementary materials 2 5 breakthrough curve btc traditionally concentration breakthrough curves i e btcs are measured at the outlet of the system by collecting the outflow solution when using micromodel experiments this is done by measuring fluorescence intensity at the outlet location of the domain zhang et al 2015 the breakthrough curve shows an integrated average behavior of the system and does not uniquely reveal the contribution of the internal local behaviors nevertheless btc s are of importance for upscaling using macroscopic continuum scale modeling baumann and werth 2004 in our experiments we simultaneously capture the internal pore scale behavior of colloids as well as the average behavior which is obtained using the btcs measured at the sample outlet 3 experimental results and analysis colloid transport experiments under unfavorable conditions resulted in a total of 1357 trajectories of the colloids of which 1309 were transported through the entire domain without any deposition 19 attached and then remobilized and 29 colloids permanently attached to a collector surface fig 3 shows the collection of trajectories that passed through the domain while a large number of colloids percolated through the sample we have observed several pores which never received any colloids these pores are mainly dead end pores and or pores oriented perpendicular to the overall flow direction i e normal to the generated pressure gradients leading to low flow velocities in what follows we first discuss the dlvo profile next we focus on the integrated behavior of colloids in the system followed by characterizing trajectories of the attached colloids and the breakthrough curves 3 1 dlvo profile the measured zeta potential of the colloids in deionized water was 47 mv the zeta potential for the pdms was taken as 80 mv sze et al 2003 kirby and hasselbrink 2004 almutairi et al 2012 and the ionic strength close to zero fig 4 shows that the dlvo profile between the colloids and the collector surface has a high primary minimum barrier but no secondary minimum due to the low ionic strength this indicates unfavorable conditions under which colloid attachment is not probable when only dlvo forces were taken into consideration however several other processes could contribute to attachment including local grain roughness surface charge heterogeneities and local flow conditions bradford and torkzaban 2015 bradford et al 2015 which could lead to lower effective energy barrier and cause colloid attachment 3 2 tortuosity normal distance to grain surface and trajectory average velocity fig 5 together with table 2 average values show the behavior of colloid trajectories divided into three categories of mobile remobilized and attached colloids the probability distributions for the parameters are given in the supplementary materials results show that colloids that moved closer to the grain surfaces had longer trajectories which increased their tortuosity fig 5a and caused lower observed transport velocities fig 5b although data points are scattered in fig 5c they show a general linear trend between the normal distance from the grains and the velocity of colloid trajectories the outliers may be impacted by the measurement procedure which is discussed in the supplementary materials for colloids that were permanently attached inside the pore network average values were calculated up to the moment of attachment the attached colloids generally show transport at close distances to the solid grains however they show a wide range of tortuosity values when colloids were attached close to the inlet the tortuosity of their trajectories remains close to 1 0 because of their short travel time and distance the attached colloids which deposited at larger distances within the pore space showed higher tortuosity values mainly because they followed the curved grain surfaces during their transport therefore the average tortuosity of colloids that became permanently attached inside the domain can be even lower compared to other colloids remobilized colloids showed an average tortuosity value of 1 225 which is larger than the average tortuosity of mobile colloids 1 205 this is mainly because remobilized colloids follow more twisted paths during their relatively large residence times across the pore network we can conclude that colloids subject to attachment have a higher tortuosity as they generally travel for longer times in the vicinity of solid surfaces and create longer paths compared to the colloids that were mobile and transported rather through the central regions of the pores overall the trajectory of remobilized and permanently attached colloids pass close to the grain surfaces which causes the average velocity to be lower than the mobile colloids local variations in the flow velocity distribution and dlvo forces will determine the ultimate attachment of colloids 3 3 remobilization in this section we will describe colloid remobilization events of the trajectories that became permanently attached none showed attachment and remobilization events before deposition whereas 19 colloids showed attachment and remobilization below we will explore the average and standard deviation i e sample scale transport properties and then describe two of the trajectories in more detail analysis have been done on the temporal evolution of adsorption using the 1st and the 2nd moments which are given in the supplementary materials the remobilized colloids spent on average of 42 1 48 5 s in the attached state immobile with the total time within the porous medium being on average 144 4 41 74 s this shows that the remobilized colloids spend on average 29 of the total residence time attached to the soil grains this compares with mobile colloid which on average spend 92 4 27 6 s within the domain comparing these residence times shows that remobilization requires on average 50 extra time for colloids to arrive at the outlet the trajectories of these colloids have a higher tortuosity compared to the mobile colloids and they often are transported closer to the solid grains and have lower average velocities in our experiments the maximum time that a colloid was immobilized before being remobilized was 208 s with this colloid residing 268 s inside the domain typical examples of the colloid velocity and distance to solid against time are given in fig 6 we found that colloid 615 closely followed free flow i e being mobile while being transported only slightly closer to the walls compared to the completely mobile colloids before attachment the colloids came closer to the collector surface before being immobile for 110 s while being immobile the colloid showed very little movement although very small fluctuations in the velocity are visible the velocities fall within the error margin an assessment is made in the supplementary materials colloid 548 also follows a free flow path before reaching a low velocity area where it is immobilized for 10 s after remobilization the colloid shows rolling along the collector surface before it is transported by bulk free flow similar behavior was found for the 18 other colloids that showed attachment and remobilization in this study only forward flow was applied and the results showed remobilization of colloids either by local flow velocity perturbations or rolling along the surface at very low rates while other mechanisms could lead to remobilization as well i e increased flow velocity bradford et al 2009 knappenberger et al 2014 moving interfaces aramrak et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 shift in chemical conditions mitropoulou et al 2013 samari kermani et al 2021 or reversed flow reichhardt and reichhardt 2018 3 4 permanently attached colloids fig 7 shows the location of the attached colloids together with their trajectories before attachment inside the transport domain additionally table 3 provides the average properties of the attached colloids fig 7 shows that although most of colloids were attached to the solid grain walls some of them were attached to the top or bottom section of the microfluidic the mean throat size in which colloid attachment has occurred is 0 107 mm probability density function is given in the supplementary materials and the average throat size of the domain is 0 145 mm therefore colloids have shown tendency to become attached within the smaller pores in several cases multiple colloids were attached at the same location when this occurs the first attached colloid may turn the situation more favorable for the newly arriving colloids to attach shown by blue markers in fig 7 the peak arrival time of mobile colloid concentration at the outlet was 90 s however a small fraction of colloids became attached at time later than 100 s these colloids mostly attached in regions close to the end of the domain and often had a lower average velocity compared the bulk flow travel times much higher than those of the mobile colloids would indicate a high amount of remobilization occurring in the system however our results show that the attached colloids were not subject to remobilization prior to permanent attachment furthermore from fig 7 it is evident that several colloids move for some time in close proximity to the collector surface prior to attachment this behavior shows that the attraction forces are relatively weak to hold the colloids strongly and that it takes some time for colloids to find an attachment location where the net forces are favorable for attraction fig 8 shows the trajectories of three colloids even though colloid 1290 was attached and the other two colloids were mobile throughout the flow domain however all three had very similar trajectories during most of their flow path colloid 1280 reached a low velocity zone after 100 s when it began rolling along the surface for another 70 s before attachment rolling of the colloid was due to the overall unfavorable conditions for attachment where colloids can attach at a smaller fraction of surfaces when a suitable site is found and the energy barrier is lower due to local roughness chemical heterogeneities and or lower local fluid flow velocities fig 8c shows the velocity profile i e along the sample for an ultimately attached colloid number 1280 as well as for another two trajectories passing through the whole domain without any deposition although the trajectories shown in fig 8a were very similar the velocity distribution was different for each track until 9 5 mm there was no indication that track 1278 would become attached at 9 5 mm the particle stagnates and rolled until becoming attached this observation reveals the challenge of using the location and shape of a trajectory to predict whether an attachment event will occur 3 5 bridging colloid sizes and surface properties together with a relatively low input concentration of colloids which is often the case in subsurface environments used in this study resulted in no straining clogging or aggregation in our experiments however local colloid bridging was observed at three locations where attachment took place in proximity of a previous attached colloid we should note that as bridging happens and more colloids attach at the same location the emission from the fluorescence particles intensifies but the resolution limit makes it difficult to distinguish each particle after they are attached nevertheless because of the trajectory that leads exactly to the previously attached particle see fig 7 blue dots and their trajectories we could detect the bridging process fig 9 shows the velocity of this category of colloids versus the longitudinal distance while the three trajectories were similar the transport velocities were different between these trajectories at location 0 25 mm we observed the highest velocity reached by colloid 402 and followed by colloids 883 and 1246 while at location 2 1 mm we observed the highest velocity reached by colloid 1246 and subsequently by 883 and 402 this indicates that the correlation of transport velocity between pores is relatively low which is often assumed to occur up to one pore alim et al 2017 miele et al 2019 it is difficult to foresee if a particle will bridge to another particle although the trajectories indicate that the flow velocities do not differentiate much between the trajectories this also indicates that the colloids were probably being transported at similar depth inside the micromodel and thus making it more likely to bridge to a previously attached colloid 3 6 breakthrough curves a major aim of this study was to capture full colloid trajectories throughout the domain as well as colloid concentrations at the outlet to provide insight into the breakthrough curves our micromodel was designed to have a uniform flux at the inlet of the sample however small discrepancies between the inlet channels were inevitable this will cause slight local differences in the velocity field and fluctuations in arrival times of colloids at the start of the pore network moreover hydrodynamic dispersion will likely occur also inside the inlet tube as well as inside the inlet channels of the micromodel these factors will turn the pulse input into a distributed and often skewed input concentration which may fluctuate over time however since the whole pore space was imaged the arrival time of each individual colloid at the start of the pore domain and when they surpass the outlet which corresponds to the residence time in the pore network of the colloid we can normalize colloid entrance times and construct a dirac delta input i e in the normalized form all the particles enter the domain instantaneously at t 0 which is equal to the probability density function of the residence time constructing the breakthrough curve in this way would assure that colloids migrate and interact with the solid grain individually i e no dominant colloid colloid interaction which is valid for our experiments based on our observations of colloid trajectories having the information of full trajectories for different categories of colloids we can construct various breakthrough curves from one dataset such as btc of all colloids entered the system btc of mobile colloids and btc of colloids only with detachment and or remobilization events this will a much better understanding of the influence of attachment and remobilization on the breakthrough curves fig 10 shows the normalized average concentration breakthrough curves btcs for colloids that were mobile in the domain and for all colloids the progression of colloids within the domain in form of concentration btcs are given in supplementary materials due to the small number of particles with attachment and detachment events compared to the bulk flow we see little influence on the shape of the obtained breakthrough curves all curves are only slightly asymmetrical which is due to the preferential nonequilibrium flow paths with colloid attachment detachment causing slight increase in late time tailing of the btcs when we exclude these processes one can analyze the obtained btcs in terms of the classic advection dispersion equation ade c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where c represents the colloid concentration v denotes the pore water velocity d is the dispersion coefficient t is time and x is the spatial coordinate as before it is also possible to use a advection dispersion sorption equation for example a one site or two site kinetic model to account for the sorption and desorption of colloids to and from the solid wall schijven and šimrunek 2002 molnar et al 2015 for example if the fraction of remobilized and attached colloids would increase which have longer residence time than the mobile colloids then the traditional ade would not suit for the observed btc in this case we chose to analyze both trajectory categories using the equilibrium ade as its was adequate to describe the observed attachment detachment processes fig 10 shows the multi fitted btcs single fit results are provided in supplementary materials and table 4 provides the optimized transport parameters d v and the dispersivity α dv obtained by cxtifit code in stanmod šimůnek et al 1999 as well the r² values for a single fit at only the location of 9 8 mm and a multi fit where the transport parameters were optimized simultaneously for btcs at two locations i e x 5 5 and 9 8 mm the single fits performed slightly better indicated by the r ² value and the fitted velocities are marginally lower than those obtained using the multi fit the fitted velocities are slightly lower than the estimated values as shown in table 2 the underestimation can be caused by the presence of the preferential flow paths the dispersion coefficient for multi fit optimization is higher than the single fit which is due to the stronger bell shape of the fitted btcs supplementary materials results show the influence of the attachment attachment detachment trajectories on the btcs as slightly higher estimated dispersion coefficient and hence also the dispersivity value 4 conclusions in this study we have developed a new microscopy setup to perform colloidal experiments at the cm scale while simultaneously observing transport attachment and remobilization of all individual colloids at the micrometer scale for each individual colloid that was transported through the domain the trajectory was captured and analyzed to explore the attachment we found that even under unfavorable conditions based on the dlvo interactions colloids were attached due to fluctuations in the local flow velocity i e fluctuating hydrodynamic forces and local roughness affecting local dlvo forces the observed trajectories were normalized into single breakthrough curves and fitted using analytical solutions which describes colloids transport as 1d macroscopic process along the general flow direction this study as particularly showed that the trajectory of the remobilized and permanently attached colloids overall passed close to the grain surfaces with a lower average velocity compared to the velocity of the bulk flow due to low input concentration no colloid aggregation was observed and therefore straining was not observed due to the low ratio in particle size versus the pore sizes a few instances of bridging were observed this retention processes as well as straining would be expected to be a higher contributor to retention at higher input concentrations the remobilized colloids spent on average 29 of the total residence time in the attached state at the soil grains after remobilization some colloids show rolling along the collector surface before being transported into the bulk free flow colloids with very similar trajectories i e transportation in close vicinity of each other could show different attachment behaviors and different flow velocities along their respective trajectories attached colloids showed clear rolling over the solid grains due to the overall unfavorable conditions for attachment before their depositions attachment and remobilization caused slight increase in estimated dispersion coefficient and subsequently the dispersivity value of the media obtained by fitting to the ade equation the developed microscopic set up demonstrates the potential to further investigate pore scale behavior at the cm scale by including various chemical conditions hydrophobicity changes flow conditions two phase flow colloid size and shape and different pore structure topologies furthermore the set up can be extended with an additional camera and light source to be able to observe two different species of colloids simultaneously
