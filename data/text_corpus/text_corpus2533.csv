auckland 1142 new zealand department of civil and environmental engineering university of auckland auckland 1142 new zealand corresponding author nitrogen removal crash of denitrification in an anaerobic biofilm reactor abr occurred during tofu processing wastewater treatment this study discovered that the crash occurred due to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra based on the microbial community and their functional genes metagenomic analysis and enzyme activity measurements were carried out to identify variations of microbial communities and their functional genes encoded for denitrification and dnra total nitrogen removal efficiency of the abr was maintained at approximately 78 2 during stage 1 but decreased from 82 to 52 during stage 2 nitrogen removal crash phase moreover no2 n and nh4 n increased during this crash phase with stable no3 n removal rate 86 2 indicating dnra in the abr functional gene analysis found a decrease of bacteria with nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase especially nirk and norc excluding microorganisms containing nitrous oxide reductase variation during the abr operation most dnra bacteria increased and replaced denitrifies as the dominant nitrate reducing microorganisms in stage 2 moreover the activities of denitrification functional enzymes especially nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase decreased from stage 1 to stage 2 while the dnra nitrite reductase showed a noticeable increase during stages 1 and 2 the tofu processing wastewater contained a high cod tn ratio of 7 3 9 1 directly inhibiting denitrification and promoting dnra the cod tn ratio reduction in stage 3 led to denitrification recovery and dnra inhibition therefore the nitrogen removal crash in the abr was due to dnra which resulted from the high cod tn ratio graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen removal crash denitrification dnra biofilm functional genes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction denitrification is an important nitrate reduction process following a sequential pathway denitrification begins with nitrate reduction to nitrite by nitrate reductase narghi napab subsequently nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide by nitrite reductase nirk nirs next the reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide by nitric oxide reductase norbc occurs finally nitrous oxide is reduced to nitrogen gas with nitrous oxide reductase nosz 1 3 thus denitrification has been widely applied as the dominant nitrate biodegradation technology for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment especially in industrial wastewater treatment 4 however a nitrogen removal crash was discovered with denitrification inhibition occurring during wastewater treatment wan et al 5 reported that tetrabromobisphenol a inhibited denitrification and led to a nitrogen removal crash via regulating carbon metabolism to decrease electron donation and bacterial population yang et al 6 found that a high ammonia concentration inhibited nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase which further caused a nitrogen removal crash furthermore bacterial activity also directly resulted in a nitrogen removal crash through a decrease in extracellular polymeric substances which reduced denitrification 7 in addition nitrous oxide emission was also detected at 0 33 based on the total nitrogen concentration from a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant indicating incomplete denitrification and resulting in an indiscoverable nitrogen removal crash 8 chen et al 9 also expressed that there was nitrous oxide emission in an anaerobic biofilm reactor during denitrification but its mechanism was still unclear therefore a nitrogen removal crash is easily identified during reactor operation primarily due to bacterial activity and toxicity stress in wastewater treatment process nitrate is not only removed by canonical denitrification can also be reduced via alternative microbial pathways such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra 10 12 unlike denitrification dnra transforms nitrate into ammonia with nitrite as an intermediate with similar nitrate reductase narghi napab and dnra nitrite reductase nirbd nrfah 13 14 ammonia is a more favorable form of nitrogen for biological assimilation and dnra should have equal importance in nitrate reduction as denitrification in wastewater treatment conventional denitrification is selected via limitation control to reach nitrate removal 15 16 recently dnra and its microorganisms have been widely identified and applied in nature and wastewater treatment especially in municipal wastewater treatment plants wetlands and anaerobic digestion reactors 17 19 dnra has a similar reduction of nitrate to nitrite by the same nitrate reductase as denitrification meaning that there is competition between denitrification and dnra depending on the selection of nitrite reduction 16 previous studies 12 20 have reported that dnra can become dominant for nitrate reduction over denitrification and cause a nitrogen removal crash our previous researchers 21 22 identified that a cake layer similar to biofilm in industrial wastewater treatment plants also had this competition between dnra and denitrification that resulted in a nitrogen removal crash sun et al 23 even found a nitrogen removal crash with dnra enhancement via organic carbon quantity and quality thus competition between denitrification and dnra occurs in nature and wastewater treatment however effects of dnra on the nitrogen removal crash especially in industrial wastewater treatment is less considered hence it is still unknown whether the nitrogen removal crash resulted from dnra this study aims to identify the relationship between dnra and denitrification for a nitrogen removal crash based on functional genes to establish whether the nitrogen removal crash resulted from dnra a full scale denitrifying anaerobic biofilm reactor abr was operated to remove nitrogen for 160 days in a tofu processing wastewater treatment plant metagenomics and enzyme activity analysis was carried out to reveal functional bacteria and their nitrogen utilization functions operational control for nitrogen removal recovery from the crash was also carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale anaerobic biofilm reactor operation a full scale abr 24 m3 l w h 4 m 3 m 2 m was set up and operated in a tofu processing plant manufacturing tofu and tofu like products dried tofu bean curd skin in huizhou guangdong china for over 5 years the wastewater from the tofu processing plant was cooled to approximately 60 c with the cooling tower then treated with flocculation coagulation and sedimentation using a sloping plate settling tank to remove most of the suspended solids next the wastewater flowed into the abr for nitrogen removal with a denitrification process the abr was loaded with 12 15 m3 day wastewater and operated with a 22 24 h hrt hydraulic retention time ph and do dissolve oxygen in the abr were continuously monitored with a ph meter az8651 az instrument china and a do meter az8403 az instrument china respectively during the abr operation the ph was maintained at 7 1 7 8 with the addition of naoh while the do was maintained below 0 05 mg l in the abr tank to ensure an anaerobic environment in this study the tofu processing wastewater contained a chemical oxygen demand cod of 260 380 mg l on days 1 25 the cod increased to 400 460 mg l due to manufacture requirements from day 50 123 it was observed that the total nitrogen tn removal rate was stable from day 1 49 and thus this stage was considered a normal nitrogen removal performance stage called stage 1 however from day 50 a decrease in the tn removal performance was observed and regarded as a performance crash called stage 2 because only the cod had a noticeable change during operation the cod in the tofu processing wastewater was reduced to figure out the mechanism of the performance crash this stage is called stage 3 the detail of the three stages is shown in table 1 2 2 metagenomic analysis three parallel biofilm samples were collected for metagenomic analysis with 0 5 g from the abr at stage 1 day 8 15 29 43 stage 2 day 59 68 80 92 104 113 and stage 3 day 131 140 149 the samples were cleaned with a 0 9 nacl solution the detailed metagenomic analysis is referred to in the supporting information si and is similar to previous studies 21 22 2 3 analytical methods triplicated ammonium nh4 n cod tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n concentrations were measured following the standard methods procedure 24 nitrate reductase analysis kits bc3100 solarbio china nitrite reductase analysis kits bc2990 solarbio china nitric oxide reductase analysis kits f95026 fankew china and nitrous oxide reductase analysis kits zc 55377 zcibio china were used in functional denitrification gene activity measurements dnra nitrite reductase analysis kits bfne88937 bluefbio china were used for dnra functional gene activity measurements all enzyme analysis kits were operated according to their kit manuals statistical analysis is detailed in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen performance of the abr as shown in fig 1 a no3 n was maintained at 8 to 14 mg l in the effluent of the abr while the no3 n removal efficiency remained 86 2 during the operation period however no2 n and nh4 n started to increase from day 50 and thus this classified day 1 49 and day 50 123 as stage 1 and stage 2 respectively fig 1 b and c it was observed that no2 n increased from 1 1 mg l day 50 to 8 2 mg l day 83 and then decreased to 4 3 mg l day 123 throughout stage 2 nh4 n increased from 2 4 to 8 1 mg l the removal efficiency of tn remained at approximately 78 2 during stage 1 but then decreased in stage 2 from 82 to 52 this tn removal decrease is considered as a performance crash in wastewater treatment and indicates the inhibition of denitrification 25 therefore the nitrogen removal performance highlighted the denitrification crash in the abr from stage 1 to stage 2 and stage 2 showed the denitrification mitigation of the reactor in previous studies 26 27 a nitrogen removal crash has been readily observed during the bioreactor operation particularly in industrial wastewater treatment with a toxicity shock as jahangir et al 28 and pang et al 29 reported unlike denitrification dnra converted no2 n to nh4 n not no while both reduced nitrate to nitrite as their first step no3 n no2 n and nh4 n could be measured to compare denitrification and dnra in nitrate rich wastewater 19 21 thus a no2 n and nh4 n increase during the nitrogen removal crash with a stable no3 n removal rate indicated dnra in the abr due to dnra bacteria growth in the community 16 fig 2 further presents the denitrification and dnra rate during the abr operation the abr maintained a high denitrification rate of 75 81 in stage 1 however the denitrification rate had a noticeable decrease while the dnra rate increased from 0 2 to 7 7 indicating nitrogen removal crash with dnra performance zhang et al 30 and luo et al 31 both identified that a nitrogen removal crash occurred with a bacterial community shift principally the decrease of denitrifiers during reactor operation furthermore they also noted that a nitrogen removal crash typically happened at the latter end of the reactor operation which is also reflected in this study previous studies 21 22 also indicated that a nitrogen removal crash was accompanied by an increase in the dnra rate 3 2 functional genes encoding for enzymes of denitrification the key competition between denitrification and dnra is the reduction of nitrite thus nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are core enzymes in denitrification 21 as fig 3 a shows sequencing bdellovibrio bacteriovorus tessaracoccus rhizobium naphthalentivorans and rizobuium sphingomonas have been identified to contain nitrite reductase nirs while it is noted that magnetospirillum leptonema illini tepidiphilus bradyrhizobiaceae comamonadaceae dechloromonas hydrogenophaga and sulfuritortus caldifontis contain functional genes encoded to have nitrite reductase nirk the percentage of bacteria with nirk was slightly greater than that with nirs at stage 1 however bacteria with nirk displayed a noticeable decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 and microorganisms with nirs remained relatively stable showing only a slight decrease xiao et al 32 and liang et al 33 reported that nirk contributed more to nitrite reduction through denitrification than nirs this result indicated that nitrite reductase were partly inhibited especially nirk with its bacteria decrease during the abr operation paludibacter sp 47 17 flavihumibacter solisilvae cloacibacterium normanense capnocytophaga prosthecomicrobium hirschii magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense sphingomonas acidovorax hydrogenophaga dechloromonas agitata desulfomicrobium apsheronum tepidiphilus were identified to contain functional genes encoded for norb a nitric oxide reductase fig 3 b it was found that bacteria with norb had a slight decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 this phenomenon was mainly due to a percentage drop in leptonema illini tepidiphilus sphingomonas and prosthecomicrobium hirschii in contrast the percentage of cloacibacterium normanense and nitrosomonadales remained stable and magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense had a noticeable increase additionally bdellovibrio bacteriovorus tepidiphilus margaritifer dechloromonas agitata sterolibacteriaceae bacterium j5b hydrogenophaga acidovorax magnetospirilum prosthecomicrobium hirschii bradrhizobium caldilinea aerophila candidatus melainabacteria bacterium cloacibacterium normanense and chitinophagaceae bacterium bssc1 had norc functional genes for nitric oxide reduction in contrast all bacteria with norc except sterolibacteriaceae bacterium j5b and tepidiphilus margaritifer decreased from stage 1 to stage 2 indicating that bacteria with norc were inhibited during the abr operation therefore the decrease of bacteria with norc showed a more obvious variation than that of those with norb in the nitrogen removal crash of denitrification it is found that thauera dechloromonas agitata sterolibacteriaceae bacterium m52 magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense rhizobium bradyrhizobium sp y36 ignavibacterium ablum caldilineaceae candidatus kryptobacter tengchongensis cloacibacterium normanense contained the functional genes encoding for nosz fig 3 c the result differs from nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase as bacteria with nosz only slightly decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 moreover variations of microorganisms with nirs nirk norb norc and nosz indicated that the nitrite reductase and nitrite reduction pathways played a crucial role in denitrification the inhibition of nitrite reductase especially nirk contributed predominantly to the nitrogen removal crash liang et al 33 also noted that nitrite reductase showed an important controlling role in denitrification according to fig 3 no bacteria contain all the functional genes encoded for the whole denitrification pathway while the diversity of the biofilm community was low during the reactor s operation this result predicted that denitrification of the biofilm depended on the cooperation of muti microorganisms while previous studies reported that denitrification relied mainly on a bacterial network 34 high bacterial diversity guarantees the stability of denitrification 35 36 therefore the nitrogen removal crash was directly related to the decrease of bacteria with nitrite reductase and partly stemmed from a low bacterial diversity 3 3 functional gene encoding for enzymes of dnra fig 3 d shows the variation of bacteria encoding the dnra pathway including nitrate and nitrite reductase hydrogenophilales bacterium 28 61 23 desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus desulfatirhabdium butyrativorans azoarcus dechloromonas agitata thiobacillus tepidmonas fonticaldi hydrogenophaga extensimonas vulgaris acidovorax magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense xanthobacter dietzia cinnamea were identified as dnra bacteria most of the dnra bacteria increased from stage 1 to stage 2 especially over contributing to biofilm community than microorganisms with any functional genes for denitrification after day 80 especially acidovorax 37 xanthobacter 23 thiobacillus 38 and dechloromonas agitata 39 which had been identified as dnra bacteria in previous studies and showed a noticeable increase from stage 1 to stage 2 dietzia also displayed rapid growth and was reported to have a high biodegradation capacity 40 desulfurization microorganisms like desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus and desulfatirhabdium butyrativorans also play an important role in the biofilm of a dnra process recent literature 2 41 has reported that sulfur biodegradation could co occur and even co work with nitrogen removal in a bioreactor li et al 42 has further found that microorganisms involved in sulfur or nitrogen removal would dynamically grow in the biofilm sulfur driven nitrogen removal like autotrophic sulfur denitrification with thiosulfate has been widely studied and applied for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment 43 44 li et al 16 also figured out that thiobacillus and hydrogenophilales processing dnra with elemental sulfur showed an enriched population in a denitrification system which was similar to the results of our research 3 4 dnra inhibition for a nitrogen removal crash as the above results show it could be observed that dnra bacteria grew during stage 1 and replaced denitrifiers as the dominant bacteria related to the nitrogen cycle at stage 2 moreover the increase of nh4 n in the effluent corresponded to the growth of dnra bacteria in the bacterial community additionally nitrite increase from day 50 70 at stage 2 because of the drop in bacteria with nitrite reductase for denitrification further causing nitrite accumulation in the effluent as fig 4 shows nitrite reductase activities and nitric oxide reductase had an evident decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 responding to a denitrification drop phenomenon in contrast nitrous oxide reductase had no apparent variation moreover dnra nitrite reductase increased expressing that dnra enhancement after day 80 in stage 2 the dnra bacteria contributed over 10 of the bacterial community effectively transforming nitrite into ammonia and reducing nitrite in the effluent furthermore tn increased in stage 2 highlighting the nitrogen removal crash during stages 1 and 2 the tofu processing wastewater contained a high cod tn ratio of 7 3 9 1 van den berg et al 45 has reported that increasing the cod tn ratio could enrich a dnra culture and a cod tn ratio over 7 7 would effectively convert over 90 of the nitrite reduction via dnra in addition it was reported that denitrification could effectively proceed with a cod tn ratio of approximately 5 1 46 consequently the nitrogen removal crash was attributed to dnra inhibition with dnra bacteria growing to replace denitrifiers in the biofilm community primarily because of the high cod tn ratio to further demonstrate the nitrogen removal crash resulting from dnra inhibition do was increased to approximately 2 4 4 8 mg l in the abr at day 122 128 subsequently the do was reduced below 0 02 mg l from day 129 to 159 this was done to inhibit the growth of dnra and denitrification bacteria specifically dnra cells and then recover them the influent was also regulated to achieve a cod tn ratio of 3 8 5 2 from day 122 to 159 to optimize the best condition for denitrifiers this stage day 122 159 was classified as stage 3 of the abrs operation as shown in fig 3 there was a greater percentage of bacteria with nirs nirk norb norc and nosz in stage 3 than in stage 2 signifying that these regulations promoted the growth of denitrifiers in the biofilm community moreover dnra nitrite reductase activity was inhibited however the activity of nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase was recovered in stage 3 fig 4 this result corresponded to a tn decrease in the effluent fig 1d highlighting denitrification recovery in stage 3 microorganisms with nitrite reductase for denitrification were recovered back to approximately 10 of the bacterial community in the biofilm explaining the decrease in no2 n furthermore dnra bacteria showed an obvious reduction in the bacterial community in the biofilm from 12 9 day 120 to only 3 8 day 154 a 3 8 5 2 cod tn ratio inhibited dnra bacteria growth and promoted denitrifiers fig 1c shows a decrease in nh4 n indicating that the no2 n in the abr was beginning to be reduced via denitrification therefore the nitrogen removal crash was attributed to dnra in the abr 4 conclusions the tn removal efficiency of the abr was initially maintained at 78 2 but then progressively decreased from 82 to 52 no2 n and nh4 n increased while the no3 n removal rate remained stable during the nitrogen removal crash phase indicating dnra in the abr functional gene analysis showed that nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase were inhibited particularly nirk and norc with their bacteria decrease excluding microorganisms containing nitrous oxide reductase variation during the abr operation most dnra bacteria increased and replaced the denitrifiers as the dominant nitrate reducing microorganisms in the nitrogen removal crash phase as a result the nitrogen removal crash in the abr was due to the dnra credit authorship contribution

microbial community and their functional genes metagenomic analysis and enzyme activity measurements were carried out to identify variations of microbial communities and their functional genes encoded for denitrification and dnra total nitrogen removal efficiency of the abr was maintained at approximately 78 2 during stage 1 but decreased from 82 to 52 during stage 2 nitrogen removal crash phase moreover no2 n and nh4 n increased during this crash phase with stable no3 n removal rate 86 2 indicating dnra in the abr functional gene analysis found a decrease of bacteria with nitrite reductase

anaerobic biofilm reactor abr was operated to remove nitrogen for 160 days in a tofu processing wastewater treatment plant metagenomics and enzyme activity analysis was carried out to reveal functional bacteria and their nitrogen utilization functions operational control for nitrogen removal recovery from the crash was also carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale anaerobic biofilm reactor operation a full scale abr 24 m3 l w h 4 m 3 m 2 m was set up and operated in a tofu processing plant manufacturing tofu and tofu like products dried tofu bean curd skin in huizhou guangdong china for over 5 years the wastewater from the tofu processing plant was cooled to approximately 60 c with the cooling tower then treated with flocculation coagulation and sedimentation using a sloping plate settling tank to remove most of the suspended solids next the wastewater flowed into the abr for nitrogen removal with a denitrification process the abr was loaded with 12 15 m3 day wastewater and operated with a 22 24 h hrt hydraulic retention time ph and do dissolve oxygen in the abr were continuously monitored with a ph meter az8651 az instrument china and a do meter az8403 az instrument china respectively during the abr operation the ph was maintained at 7 1 7 8 with the addition of naoh while the do was maintained below 0 05 mg l in the abr tank to ensure an anaerobic environment in this study the tofu processing wastewater contained a chemical oxygen demand cod of 260 380 mg l on days 1 25 the cod increased to 400 460 mg l due to manufacture requirements from day 50 123 it was observed that the total nitrogen tn removal rate was stable from day 1 49 and thus this stage was considered a normal nitrogen removal performance stage called stage 1 however from day 50 a decrease in the tn removal performance was observed and regarded as a performance crash called stage 2 because only the cod had a noticeable change during operation the cod in the tofu processing wastewater was reduced to figure out the mechanism of the performance crash this stage is called stage 3 the detail of the three stages is shown in table 1 2 2 metagenomic analysis three parallel biofilm samples were collected for metagenomic analysis with 0 5 g from the abr at stage 1 day 8 15 29 43 stage 2 day 59 68 80 92 104 113 and stage 3 day 131 140 149 the samples were cleaned

according to their kit manuals statistical analysis is detailed in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen performance of the abr as shown in fig 1 a no3 n was maintained at 8 to 14 mg l in the effluent of the abr while the no3 n removal efficiency remained 86 2 during the operation period however no2 n and nh4 n started to increase from day 50 and thus this classified day 1 49 and day 50 123 as stage 1 and stage 2 respectively fig 1 b and c it was observed that no2 n increased from 1 1 mg l day 50 to 8 2 mg l day 83 and then decreased to 4 3 mg l day 123 throughout stage 2 nh4 n increased from 2 4 to 8 1 mg l the removal efficiency of tn remained at approximately 78 2 during stage 1 but then decreased in stage 2 from 82 to 52 this tn removal decrease is considered as a performance crash in wastewater treatment and indicates the inhibition of denitrification 25 therefore the nitrogen removal performance highlighted the denitrification crash in the abr from stage 1 to stage 2 and stage 2 showed the denitrification mitigation of the reactor in previous studies 26 27 a nitrogen removal crash has been readily observed during the bioreactor operation particularly in industrial wastewater treatment with a toxicity shock as jahangir et al 28 and pang et al 29 reported unlike denitrification dnra converted no2 n to nh4 n not no while both reduced nitrate to nitrite as their first step no3 n no2 n and nh4 n could be measured to compare denitrification and dnra in nitrate rich wastewater 19 21 thus a no2 n and nh4 n increase during the nitrogen removal crash with a stable no3 n removal rate indicated dnra in the abr due to dnra bacteria growth in the community 16 fig 2 further presents the denitrification and dnra rate during the abr operation the abr maintained a high denitrification rate of 75 81 in stage 1 however the denitrification rate had a noticeable decrease while the dnra rate increased from 0 2 to 7 7 indicating nitrogen removal crash with dnra performance zhang et al 30 and luo et al 31 both identified that a nitrogen removal crash occurred with a bacterial community shift principally the decrease of denitrifiers during reactor operation furthermore they also noted that a nitrogen removal crash typically happened at the latter end of the reactor operation which is also reflected in this study previous studies 21 22 also indicated that a nitrogen removal crash was accompanied by an increase in the dnra rate 3 2 functional genes encoding for enzymes of denitrification the key competition between denitrification and dnra is the reduction of nitrite thus nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are core enzymes in denitrification 21 as fig 3 a shows sequencing bdellovibrio bacteriovorus tessaracoccus rhizobium naphthalentivorans and rizobuium sphingomonas have been identified to contain nitrite reductase nirs while it is noted that magnetospirillum leptonema illini tepidiphilus bradyrhizobiaceae comamonadaceae dechloromonas hydrogenophaga and sulfuritortus caldifontis contain functional genes encoded to have nitrite reductase nirk the percentage of bacteria with nirk was slightly greater than that with nirs at stage 1 however bacteria with nirk displayed a noticeable decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 and microorganisms with nirs remained relatively stable showing only a slight decrease xiao et al 32 and liang et al 33 reported that nirk contributed more to nitrite reduction through denitrification than nirs this result indicated that nitrite reductase were partly inhibited especially nirk with its bacteria decrease during the abr operation paludibacter sp 47 17 flavihumibacter solisilvae cloacibacterium normanense capnocytophaga prosthecomicrobium hirschii magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense sphingomonas acidovorax hydrogenophaga dechloromonas agitata desulfomicrobium apsheronum tepidiphilus were identified to contain functional genes encoded for norb a nitric oxide reductase fig 3 b it was found that bacteria with norb had a slight decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 this phenomenon was mainly due to a percentage drop in leptonema illini tepidiphilus sphingomonas and prosthecomicrobium hirschii in contrast the percentage of cloacibacterium normanense and nitrosomonadales remained stable and magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense had a noticeable increase additionally bdellovibrio bacteriovorus tepidiphilus margaritifer dechloromonas agitata sterolibacteriaceae bacterium j5b hydrogenophaga acidovorax magnetospirilum prosthecomicrobium hirschii bradrhizobium caldilinea aerophila candidatus melainabacteria bacterium cloacibacterium normanense and chitinophagaceae bacterium bssc1 had norc functional genes for nitric oxide reduction in contrast all bacteria with norc except sterolibacteriaceae bacterium j5b and tepidiphilus margaritifer decreased from stage 1 to stage 2 indicating that bacteria with norc were inhibited during the abr operation therefore the decrease of bacteria with norc showed a more obvious variation than that of those with norb in the nitrogen removal crash of denitrification it is found that thauera dechloromonas agitata sterolibacteriaceae bacterium m52 magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense rhizobium bradyrhizobium sp y36 ignavibacterium ablum caldilineaceae candidatus kryptobacter tengchongensis cloacibacterium normanense contained the functional genes encoding for nosz fig 3 c the result differs from nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase as bacteria with nosz only slightly decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 moreover variations of microorganisms with nirs nirk norb norc and nosz indicated that the nitrite reductase and nitrite reduction pathways played a crucial role in denitrification the inhibition of nitrite reductase especially nirk contributed predominantly to the nitrogen removal crash liang et al 33 also noted that nitrite reductase showed an important controlling role in denitrification according to fig 3 no bacteria contain all the functional genes encoded for the whole denitrification pathway while the diversity of the biofilm community was low during the reactor s operation this result predicted that denitrification of the biofilm depended on the cooperation of muti microorganisms while previous studies reported that denitrification relied mainly on a bacterial network 34 high bacterial diversity guarantees the stability of denitrification 35 36 therefore the nitrogen removal crash was directly related to the decrease of bacteria with nitrite reductase and partly stemmed from a low bacterial diversity 3 3 functional gene encoding for enzymes of dnra fig 3 d shows the variation of bacteria encoding the dnra pathway including nitrate and nitrite reductase hydrogenophilales bacterium 28 61 23 desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus desulfatirhabdium butyrativorans azoarcus dechloromonas agitata thiobacillus tepidmonas fonticaldi hydrogenophaga extensimonas vulgaris acidovorax magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense xanthobacter dietzia cinnamea were identified as dnra bacteria most of the dnra bacteria increased from stage 1 to stage 2 especially over contributing to biofilm community than microorganisms with any functional genes for denitrification after day 80 especially acidovorax 37 xanthobacter 23 thiobacillus 38 and dechloromonas agitata 39 which had been identified as dnra bacteria in previous studies and showed a noticeable increase from stage 1 to stage 2 dietzia also displayed rapid growth and was reported to have a high biodegradation capacity 40 desulfurization microorganisms like desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus and desulfatirhabdium butyrativorans also play an important role in the biofilm of a dnra process recent literature 2 41 has reported that sulfur biodegradation could co occur and even co work with nitrogen removal in a bioreactor li et al 42 has further found that microorganisms involved in sulfur or nitrogen removal would dynamically grow in the biofilm sulfur driven nitrogen removal like autotrophic sulfur denitrification with thiosulfate has been widely studied and applied for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment 43 44 li et al 16 also figured out that thiobacillus and hydrogenophilales processing dnra with elemental sulfur showed an enriched population in a denitrification system which was similar to the results of our research 3 4 dnra inhibition for a nitrogen removal crash as the above results show it could be observed that dnra bacteria grew during stage 1 and replaced denitrifiers as the dominant bacteria related to the nitrogen cycle at stage 2 moreover the increase of nh4 n in the effluent corresponded to the growth of dnra bacteria in the bacterial community additionally nitrite increase from day 50 70 at stage 2 because of the drop in bacteria with nitrite reductase for denitrification further causing nitrite accumulation in the effluent as fig 4 shows nitrite reductase activities and nitric oxide reductase had an evident decrease from stage 1 to stage 2 responding to a denitrification drop phenomenon in contrast nitrous oxide reductase had no apparent variation moreover dnra nitrite reductase increased expressing that dnra enhancement after day 80 in stage 2 the dnra bacteria contributed over 10 of the bacterial community effectively transforming nitrite into ammonia and reducing nitrite in the effluent furthermore tn increased in stage 2 highlighting the nitrogen removal crash during stages 1 and 2 the tofu processing wastewater contained a high cod tn ratio of 7 3 9 1 van den berg et al 45 has reported that increasing the cod tn ratio could enrich a dnra culture and a cod tn ratio over 7 7 would effectively convert over 90 of the nitrite reduction via dnra in addition it was reported that denitrification could effectively proceed with a cod tn ratio of approximately 5 1 46 consequently the nitrogen removal crash was attributed to dnra inhibition with dnra bacteria growing to replace denitrifiers in the biofilm community primarily because of the high cod tn ratio to further demonstrate the nitrogen removal crash resulting from dnra inhibition do was increased to approximately 2 4 4 8 mg l in the abr at day 122 128 subsequently the do was reduced below 0 02 mg l from day 129 to 159 this was done to inhibit the growth of dnra and denitrification bacteria specifically dnra cells and then recover them the influent was also regulated to achieve a cod tn ratio of 3 8 5 2 from day 122 to 159 to optimize the best condition for denitrifiers this stage day 122 159 was classified as stage 3 of the abrs operation as shown in fig 3 there was a greater percentage of bacteria with nirs nirk norb norc and nosz in stage 3 than in stage 2 signifying that these regulations promoted the growth of denitrifiers in the biofilm community moreover dnra nitrite reductase activity was inhibited however the activity of nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase was recovered in stage 3 fig 4 this result corresponded to a tn decrease in the effluent fig 1d highlighting denitrification recovery in stage 3 microorganisms with nitrite reductase for denitrification were recovered back to approximately 10 of the bacterial community in the biofilm explaining the decrease in no2 n furthermore dnra bacteria showed an obvious reduction in the bacterial community in the biofilm from 12 9 day 120 to only 3 8 day 154 a 3 8 5 2 cod tn ratio inhibited dnra bacteria growth and promoted denitrifiers fig 1c shows a decrease in nh4 n indicating that the no2 n in the abr was beginning to be reduced via denitrification therefore the nitrogen removal crash was attributed to dnra in the abr 4 conclusions the tn removal efficiency of the abr was initially maintained at 78 2 but then progressively decreased from 82 to 52 no2 n and nh4 n increased while the no3 n removal rate remained stable during the nitrogen removal crash phase indicating dnra in the abr functional gene analysis showed that nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase were inhibited particularly nirk and norc with their bacteria decrease excluding microorganisms containing nitrous oxide reductase variation during the abr operation most dnra bacteria increased and replaced the denitrifiers as the dominant nitrate reducing microorganisms in the nitrogen removal crash phase as a result the nitrogen removal crash in the abr was due to the dnra credit authorship contribution

12666,the growing quantity of nuclear waste and the serious threats to the environment challenge researchers to innovate and target new waste form technologies in the past decades considerable efforts have been devoted to developing highly selective sorbents followed by safe disposal with the assurance of chemical stability and robust retention performance zeolite containing geopolymers are regarded as a possible 2 in 1 material able to both capture and sequester elements such as cs in bed fixed column application perspective these composites show promise for combining extraction properties of zeolite powder due to its crystalline structure high capacity and selective adsorption with the tunable microstructure and the shaping feasibility of the geopolymer binder for the development of materials devoted to cs immobilization porous zeolite geopolymer composites were prepared by dispersing nay zeolite particles in a geopolymer binder the influence of the structural properties of such composites on their ability to entrap a large amount of cs by an ionic exchange process was notably studied composites compositions porosities morphologies and crystallinity were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx x ray diffraction analysis xrd and nitrogen adsorption desorption studies experimental cs sorption in batch mode was used to follow the ionic exchange phenomenon in these materials along with 5 wt amount of zeolite in geopolymer improves the cs adsorption performance offering multiple new adsorption sites additionally the geopolymer mesopores are beneficial facilitating the access of cs and its role as a binder is advantageous to tailor granular hierarchical structure for safer industrial application keywords geopolymer zeolite composite cesium adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction cesium 137 is one of the main fission products resulting from nuclear power generation and an extremely hazardous radioisotope that could result in rapid environmental contamination the extraction and entrapment of cs from liquid effluent is consequently a significant challenge for the nuclear industry among the traditional methods used for cs removal ion exchange in a fixed bed process is a common technique for effluent decontamination due to the high selectivity and efficiency low production of secondary waste products reliability and cost effectiveness 1 2 depending on the radionuclides concentrations selective or capacitive materials and technologies are needed for trace decontamination or high amount incorporation respectively 3 for these reasons during the past decades considerable effort has been devoted to developing highly selective cs sorbents that can be disposed of safely and with the assurance of long term chemical stability and robust cs retention 4 5 as a result numerous material structures have been identified such as zirconyl phosphates 6 layered metal sulfides 7 or organic ligands nanoparticles immobilized on various supports such as hexacyanoferrate kcu hcf on silica 8 and zeolite based compounds 9 although the available literature on this subject is extensive it is clear that zeolites are certainly one of the most effective materials for the selective adsorption of ionic contaminants from liquid effluent due to their well defined crystal structures in general porous zeolitic structures are built up from corner sharing sio4 and alo4 tetrahedra with charge compensation for the anionic framework being provided by cations such as na ca2 or h located in the pores among the numerous types of zeolites gis cha mfi the faujasite structure x or y composed of supercages and sodalite cages has interesting advantages because of the large and three dimensional microporous frameworks the pore structure can be chemically altered by adjusting the si al ratio 10 11 the cation exchange capacity is directly linked to the amount of aluminum located in the aperture of the large cages which allows for efficient ion exchange behavior the exchange rate also depends on the nature of the host cations and of the guest cation and varies as a function of the solvent the temperature or the ph faujasite na zeolite is thus of great interest for different applications including catalysis 12 gas separation 13 or in the adsorption of radioactive waste from liquid effluent particularly cs 14 to be used for ion exchange in a column process zeolites have to be formed into a monolithic or granular hierarchical structure to limit the pollution risks from the spreading of particulates particles and furthermore produce an ideal breakthrough curve 1 15 17 specifically the materials must possess sufficient mechanical robustness and exhibit a hierarchical porous structure to optimize the transport properties of the ionic species diffusion while limiting the pressure drop across the monolithic structure hydrodynamic flow 8 however zeolite materials are generally synthesized as powders and consequently not suitable for a direct application in a column processes to resolve this issue different shaping methods have been proposed to directly obtain monolithic and hierarchical zeolites 18 19 as well as to create monolithic structures from pre synthesized zeolite powders 20 22 one simple way to obtain hierarchical granular zeolite containing materials from an as synthesized zeolite powder consists of using an effective binder this approach provides an optimized mesoporosity to make the zeolite powder accessible to the effluent to be decontaminated for that purpose some attention has been paid to using geopolymers as the binder matrix 23 24 geopolymers refer to a solid inorganic polymer made from an aluminosilicate solid precursor such as coal fly ash metakaolin or slag and cross linked with alkali metal ions 24 25 the primary application for geopolymers is as a replacement of portland cement as technology for the development of reduced co2 construction materials 26 however geopolymers have found even greater use in diverse applications that include photocatalysis membranes or for optical and medical applications 27 29 the traditional synthesis route involves alkali activation of the aluminosilicate solid precursor followed by curing at room temperature the solidification of the structure occurs via a dissolution and polycondensation mechanisms called geopolymerization this leads to large and robust monolithic samples having an alumino silicate structure with water entrapped in the pores these materials are porous and this porosity is closely linked to the specific geopolymer formulation 30 31 immense literature exists on the role of the si al ratio and of the initially entrapped amount of water on the geopolymer s microstructure and porosity 32 34 moreover the presence of charge balancing cations in their pore structure allows them to adsorb cationic species from aqueous solutions by ion exchange mechanisms notably cs 35 38 thus due to these very specific properties zeolite containing geopolymers are considered to be a possible 2 in 1 aluminosilicate adsorbent material that exhibit a desirable combination of a hierarchical and multiphase structure in our approach of designing composites to be used for the removal decontamination of cs from effluent zeolites have been employed to achieve a high adsorption capacity because of their high pore volume and large microporous surface area as crystalline filler the zeolites are dispersed in a continuous aluminosilicate matrix geopolymer providing the best properties of the two constituent phases and this has created significant industrial interest as an option for radioactive 137cs sequestration the geopolymer matrix phase introduces a mesoporous network allowing high adsorption kinetic as well as mechanical resistance moreover it binds the zeolites together and displays the role of a robust support that preserves the zeolite charge performance and reduces pollution risks related to unwanted particulate dispersal few examples report the use of zeolite added in the matrix geopolymer to improve properties as porosity density resistance compressive strength or co2 or heavy metals adsorption but barely investigated 39 40 furthermore studies on the synthesis of these composite are still limited with papers mentioning the microstructural characterization of zeolites in geopolymers the novelty of this study was to study and determine the best geopolymer composition able to incorporate faujasite na zeolite particles the impact of the microstructure through the variation of the si al ratio and the amount of zeolite to optimize the cs adsorption performance are also referred to in this article the originality is also to extract cs from contaminated effluents with nay particles dispersed into geopolymer binder without degrading the zeolite structure and maintaining easy access to ionic exchange sites this work described herein is focused on the synthesis and characterization of adaptable multi scale porous and hierarchical zeolite geopolymer materials their microstructural characterization as well as their cs sequestration possibilities by ion exchange mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the metakaolin mk metamax lavollée sa powder was used as the aluminosilicate source sio2 al2o3 molar ratio 2 for the synthesis of the geopolymer and the reaction was induced with sodium hydroxide naoh pellets merck and sodium silicate na2sio2 no betol 39 t wöllner gmbh 28 wt sio2 8 wt na2o and 63 9 wt h2o as alkali activators nay sio2 al2o3 molar ratio 5 2 zeolite powder enercat alsys group were used as 1 2 μm average particle size additive to generate the composite materials cesium nitrate csno3 alfa aesar 99 99 was used for isotherms and kinetics adsorption experiments to assess the ability of the geopolymer and composites to trap radioactive 137cs 2 2 synthesis of geopolymer and composite materials three geopolymers gp with different sio2 al2o3 molar ratios 2 3 and 4 were prepared as reference matrices as illustrated in fig 1 by mixing metakaolin with the alkali activator solution mixed of sodium silicate naoh and distilled water during 1 h to produce 15 g of a geopolymeric network at room temperature the starting molar compositions were xsio2 1al2o3 1na2o 15h2o and the samples are denoted as gp x where x represent the ratio of sio2 al2o3 the slurry mixture is cured at room temperature over a period of one week in an open mold the obtained monolith structures are removed from the mold prior to analysis following the same protocol four composites based on the gp 3 matrix were obtained after the addition of nay zeolite to the slurry geopolymer under vigorous stirring using different weight ratios of 5 10 20 and 50 wt fig 1 named yzgp 3 with y corresponding to the zeolite weight ratio 5 50 the stability of the commercial nay zeolite in alkaline media ph 13 at 25 c was investigated by measuring the si and al released from the structure as a function of time 2 g of nay particles was transferred into a 1 m naoh solution stirred for 24 h and filtered to determine the concentrations of si and al in solution 2 3 cs adsorption experiments to analyze the cs adsorption efficiency of the samples batch experiments duplicated twice were conducted on granular samples having 100 200 μm average particle sizes obtained by grinding and sieving the monolithic materials the pure zeolite with average particle size of 4 μm was used without modification to explore the effects of contact time 0 02 g m of adsorbent was contacted to 10 ml v of a 100 mg l 1 cs from csno3 solution also containing 0 05 m of nano3 the ph of this solution was equal to 5 1 the mixture was placed in a shaker for different contact times 5 min to 4 days at 25 c after centrifugation and supernatant filtration through a puradisc fp 30 cellulose acetate syringe filter 0 2 μm 30 mm atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to analyze the filtrate and to measure the residual concentration in cs the amount of cs extracted by the materials q was then calculated according to eq 1 1 q c 0 c t v m where c0 and ct are respectively the initial and the final concentration mg l 1 of cs in solution to explore the effect of the initial cs concentration in solution 0 02 g of adsorbent was added to 10 ml of solutions having different cs concentrations 10 800 mg l 1 for 48 h at this duration time equilibrium is always reached as determined thanks to kinetics study the amount of cs adsorbed by the geopolymer named qe equilibrium mg g 1 was calculated using eq 1 with ct equal to the equilibrium adsorption concentration named also ce mg l 1 2 4 characterizations materials were analyzed for phase purity and crystallinity by powder x ray diffraction pxrd using a panalytical x pert pro mpd copper anode λkα1 1 54056 å generated at 45 ma and 40 kv x celerator detector in the bragg brentano geometry the xrd patterns were collected over the 2θ range 5 70 with 0 017 steps corresponding to 0 625 s measurement time per step quantitative assessment of the crystalline phase concentration in the composites was determined by spiking each composite with a known mass of an al2o3 corundum standard and calculating the relative amounts of each phase by rietveld refinement of the x ray diffraction pattern diffraction patterns for refinement were measured on bruker d8 with lynxeye xe detector using cu kα radiation nitrogen sorption desorption isotherms were measured at 196 c using a quantachrome novatouch lx3 surface area and pore size analyzer samples were degassed at 90 c to 150 c for 24 h prior to analysis surface areas were calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method pore sizes were taken as the maximum of the corresponding distribution calculated using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method total pore volumes were obtained using the volume of adsorbed gas at p p0 1 the nitrogen sorption isotherm and pore size distribution calculated using the bjh method for each support atomic adsorption spectroscopy was conducted using a perkin elmer aanalyst 200 device to determine the cs concentration in the solution from the sorption experiments for scanning electron microscopy sem observations samples were embedded in an epoxy resin prior to mechanical polishing and thin carbon coating 4 nm the images were collected in a zeiss merlin sem with a gemini 2 column at 3 kv with a secondary electron detector energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds maps were acquired and processed with a bruker eds and bruker esprit software processing segmentation and analysis of the images was done using fiji 41 ilastik 42 and ipsdk 43 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of varying the si al ratio on the microstructure and cs adsorption properties of pure geopolymers the xrd pattern of geopolymers fig 2 with different si al ranging from 2 to 4 gp 2 to gp 4 show a typical broad amorphous background around 2θ 10 30 confirming the amorphous matrix structure sharp and weak diffraction peaks are due to the presence of an anatase impurity commonly found in the mk precursor of the geopolymer 1 7 wt of tio2 along with other oxide impurities 4 3 wt of fe2o3 1 9 wt of k2o and 1 of mgo cao p2o5 and so3 the sample with the lowest si al ratio gp 2 fig 2a displays a weak amorphous phase and the highly crystalline structure of the raw materials suggesting an incomplete geopolymerization process the mk powder seems partially dissolved in the alkali solution producing tetrahedral aluminosilicate units and oxide phases the increase of the si content enhances the geopolymerization rate resulting in an amorphous phase this is consistent with the literature indicating that decreasing the highly aluminous composition low si al amount leads to a sample containing a substantial amount of crystalline unreacted reagents due to a decrease in the hydrolysis condensation efficiency during the geopolymerization 44 fig 3 shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of each geopolymer sample their porous characteristics determined from the analysis using bet and bjh models are summarized in table 1 the gp 2 sample exhibits a type ii isotherm characteristic of a non porous adsorbent according to the iupac classification 45 leading to a low bet specific surface area 15 m2 g 1 and total pore volume at p p0 1 0 02 cm3 g 1 since mesopores in geopolymers result directly from the polycondensation step 31 32 this confirms that the geopolymerization is incomplete in gp 2 as observed above by xrd analysis gp 3 and gp 4 exhibit both type iv isotherms characterized by a saturation level attributed to the presence of mesopores in which a capillary condensation occurs at higher p p0 moreover a slight micropore size distribution is detected at the lowest relative pressures the pore volume and specific area both close to 0 2 cm3 g 1 and 40 m2 g 1 for gp 3 and gp 4 are higher than gp2 and nearly equal for the two samples as expected by literature data indicating that the variation of the sio2 al2o3 ratio in the range from 3 6 to 4 has little impact on the pore structure 3 only a slight pore size decrease is observed when sio2 al2o3 is increased from 3 gp 3 fig 3b to 4 gp 4 fig 3c adsorption kinetics were used to study the adsorption process of cs into the geopolymer structure and explore the adsorption mechanisms to determine the optimal contact time between cs and the gp x the cs adsorption capacities were measured and normalized using their equilibrium capacities to be able to compare the materials to each other the ratio q qe plotted as a function of t1 2 is shown in fig 4a the evolution of q as a function of time is given in fig s1 for all gp x samples the adsorbed amount of cs increases with contact time and the equilibrium time depends on the si al ratio of the geopolymers the diffusional weber morris model can be used to describe the adsorption phase with a linear relationship using the eq 2 46 47 2 qt k di t 1 2 c where qt is the amount of cs adsorbed at time t mg g 1 t is the time min and kdi is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 and c is linked to the thickness of the boundary layer according to this model this curve can be divided by linear zones corresponding to various diffusion limited steps in an initial phase the cs was rapidly adsorbed showing a low resistance of the boundary layer this very quick step is followed by two main stages describing i the cs intraparticle diffusion including pore diffusion and surface diffusion and ii the equilibrium period however gp 2 s pattern of cs adsorption shows the presence of a desorption step as indicated by the presence of a negative slope of the curve fit this phenomenon indicates a cs release shown as iii step on fig 4a after the pore and surface diffusion i and before the equilibrium stage at 1440 min ii as described previously the gp 2 sample displays the crystalline structure of unreacted raw precursors and an incomplete geopolymerization in addition for this non porous gp 2 a low cs adsorption happened with both chemi and physisorption mechanisms for shorter contact which can be explained by an incomplete geopolymerization of the material see xrd analysis thus for longer contact times physisorbed cs by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds is released because of the weakness of the adsorption energy before equilibrium is reached in contrast gp 3 and gp 4 show a pore diffusion in two steps stage i and a cs saturation near 2880 min with no desorption mechanism moreover the saturation states of gp 3 were faster than gp 2 and gp 4 adsorption isotherms were performed to determine the maximum cs adsorption capacity of the gp x and consequently their removal efficiencies fig 4b 2880 min was selected as the optimal saturation contact time from the first kinetics measurement with increasing cs concentrations the adsorption sites gradually become saturated and the maximum adsorption capacity was determined the maximum cs adsorption achieved by the gp 2 was 50 mg g 1 70 mg g 1 by gp 3 and 130 mg g 1 by gp 4 unless previous studies showing that increasing si al leads to an improvement of sorption capacity due to a higher amount of na in the structure these behaviors illustrate the complex mechanisms of cs adsorption in geopolymer phases this comes from both side chemistry and microstructure consideration indeed besides the intraparticle diffusion and the importance of a mesoporous network the adsorption process can be attributed to different phenomena of either chemi and or physisorption 37 38 48 the cs adsorption is linked to the aluminate tetrahedral units the substitution of sodium cations and their accessibilities to the microstructure of the geopolymer due to the larger amount of charge balancing cations in their structure the cs adsorption capacity should be higher for geopolymers having a lower sio2 al2o3 ratio however this is not the case here because of the very low pore volume of gp 2 making some parts of the exchange site inaccessible the gp 3 presents an intermediate cs adsorption capacity due to its large mesoporous network cs can easily diffuse into the granular material this leads to a fast adsorption kinetics and a larger accessibility of the exchange sites the higher capacity measured for gp 4 seems to be due to the difference in the microstructural formation as evidenced in the xrd patterns mentioning previously and a higher geopolymerization a higher porosity coupled to a homogeneous amorphous structure can also help to capture more cs ions into the geopolymeric structure and increase the adsorption capacity for the following study we choose gp 3 as the geopolymer matrix to provide a support for nay zeolite in the composite materials because it has the higher adsorption kinetics required for in flow application column operations in addition its sorption capacity allows efficient cs entrapment 3 2 composition structural and microstructural properties of composites nay geopolymers pictures of gp 3 and composites containing 5 to 50 wt of zeolite are shown in fig 5 the synthesis method demonstrates the feasibility of inserting the nay zeolite particles into the geopolymer matrix leading to the creation of a compact monolithic material the size and shape of these composites can be easily controlled by using different molds during the geopolymerization process as shown on fig 5 note however that 50zgp 3 was a little bit crumbly because of the high zeolite concentration which is not ideal for creating a homogenous mixture the volume of the geopolymer phase under these conditions is too low to maintain a cohesive structure and to bind the zeolite particles in order to evaluate the behavior of the nay zeolite particles during the geopolymerization alkaline conditions the stability of the nay zeolite in alkaline media was investigated by measuring the si and al released from the structure as a function of time and reported in fig s2b this experiment shows a slight loss of si and al during the first 3 days corresponding to 7 and 2 of si and al of the nay framework indeed in alkaline media desilication of the zeolite occurs because the zeolite surface is attacked by the high concentration of hydroxyl groups oh that cause some breaking of the si o si or si o al bonds 49 consequently the sio2 al2o3 ratio slightly decreased as a function of alkali exposure time note that the degradation of the zeolite seems insignificant after 3 days corresponding to the time required for solidification of the composite the zeolite could maintain its structural integrity under the conditions of geopolymer formation however the conditions of the geopolymerization are very alkaline ph 13 and the presence of residual water in the porous network may also degrade the nay zeolite particles that is why detailed analyses were performed by xrd and sem observations to determine the influence of the geopolymerization process on the microstructural properties of the zeolite nay particles xrd patterns of the nay zeolite particles gp 3 and the yzgp 3 samples are shown in fig 6a the corresponding diffraction patterns of the composites contain the major characteristics peaks of the zeolite phase at 2θ 6 10 12 15 24 27 32 and match closely the cubic fd 3m structure of nay with formula na2al2si4 5o13 xh2o according to pdf 00 043 0168 with increasing zeolite content the diffraction patterns exhibit an increase in the diffraction intensity along with sharper and narrower peaks indicating a higher amount of zeolite particles in the composite the diffuse broad peak related to amorphous geopolymer at 10 30 is clearly apparent and indicates that the zeolite phase exists in an amorphous matrix in addition the slight both peak shift and broadening show a possible prominent lattice defects microstrains or chemical heterogeneities on the crystal lattice distortion the results of rietveld refinement of the composite structures as well as the composite structures spiked with al2o3 corundum standard are tabulated in table 2 and in the fig s3 the average zeolite particle dimension changes by no more than 3 compared to the parent zeolite phase suggesting the polymerization step produces minimal dissolution of the crystallite zeolite phase a miscibility between the zeolite and the geopolymer can be effective on the size reduction broadenings and the peak shifts towards larger 2 theta angles the xrd pattern of the 20zgp 3 spiked with an al2o3 corundum standard is plotted in fig 6b with the calculated pattern from rietveld refinement also displayed from spiking a quantitative assessment of the relative amounts of crystalline and amorphous phase can be made for each composite the concentration of crystalline zeolite is slightly below the batched amount while the percentage in crystalline values suggest as much as 20 dissolution of the zeolite phase the error reported in crystalline amount is derived solely from errors in the fit quality other errors such as preferential settlement of particles from a given phase are hard to quantify fig 7 displays representative sem images of gp 3 and composites with different zeolite content three coexisting phases can be distinguished the amorphous geopolymer phase is predominant and functions as the binder for the zeolite particles observed by sem in the fig s2a the geopolymer matrix appears darker than the zeolite particles because of the presence of mesopores into which the resin can penetrate as observed on the zoomed images the zeolite phases were confirmed by eds spectrum fig s4 these images reveal that the zeolite crystalline particles are well dispersed in the geopolymer and the amount of zeolite increases from 5zgp 3 to 20zgp 3 their distribution in the mesoporous network can make them accessible for the contamination present in the effluent to be treated moreover residual metakaolin which did not react during the geopolymerization is visible as platelet shaped particles segmentation of the images was performed as shown in fig 8 at a high magnification and fig s5 with a larger scale to evaluate how the geopolymerization process influences the amounts of the different phases present this allows an estimation of the surface percentage of the zeolite and metakaolin residues which are plotted in fig 8e as a function of the theoretical weight percentage of zeolite in the material the percentage of surface zeolite in the material increases linearly with the zeolite weight percentage indeed the intrinsic density of both geopolymer and zeolite phase can be consider to be roughly equal because of their similar aluminosilicate chemical composition furthermore the size and shape of the nay zeolite particles do not seem significantly affected by their incorporation into the geopolymer phase this demonstrates that the dissolution phenomenon affecting the nay particles in the geopolymer alkaline media is minor and appears to be limited to the zeolite geopolymer interface furthermore the percentage of metakaolin residue decreases with increasing amount of zeolite indeed the slight dissolution of nay should promote a higher rate of geopolymerization involving less residual precursor phase the pore structures of each composite were determined using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig 9a pore volumes and bet specific surface areas are reported in table 3 pure nay zeolite particles are primarily microporous with a total pore volume of 0 33 cm3 g 1 and a bet specific surface area of 600 cm2 g 1 a small fraction of the mesopore volume can be attributed to the interparticle volume in this way the presence of the zeolite in the composites creates a large volume of micropores and contributes to a significant increase in the bet surface area of yzgp 3 composites compared to gp 3 which is mainly mesoporous as described above thus the shape of the n2 isotherm for the different composites is characteristic of microporous and mesoporous materials the total pore volume of the composites can be divided into two parts a microporous volume calculated at p p0 0 02 and a mesoporous volume equal to the total pore volume determined at p p0 1 without the microporous volume the variation of these two volumes microporous and mesoporous as a function of the fraction of zeolite particles in the materials is reported in fig 9b and c in fig 9b there is a proportional relationship between the microporous volume of yzgp 3 and the zeolite nay content where the dashed line represents the theoretical volume assuming a uniform contribution from each phase to the microporous volume as a function of their fraction in the materials this linear evolution shows the efficiency of the role of the geopolymer matrix as the binder in the composite samples allowing full access to the microporosity of the particles of nay zeolite due to the mesoporous network and the geopolymer and the uniform dispersion of the particles only 50zgp 3 exhibits a lower microporous volume than the theoretical value which can be due to a slight agglomeration of zeolite particles that cause some site non accessibility when they are present in too great an amount concerning the mesoporous volume the addition of nay should result in a decrease of this volume as some of the geopolymer phase is replaced the by the non mesoporous particles however on the other hand as shown in fig 9c adding a small amount of zeolite particles 5 wt into gp 3 leads to an increase in the mesoporous pore volume that deviates from the calculated mesoporous volume calculated assuming a uniform contribution from each phase to the mesoporous volume this deviation from the theoretical mesoporous volume is less apparent for samples with 10 wt and 20 wt zeolite and ultimately is not observed at all when the zeolite content reaches 50 wt thus only the addition of a small amount of nay during the geopolymerization leads to an increase of the mesoporous volume the pore size distributions from the desorption isotherm calculated using the bjh method confirms an increase in the mesopore volume of the composite when compared to a geopolymer without any zeolite content fig 9d the composite seems to be affected in its microstructure by an interaction between the zeolite and the geopolymer precursor solution influencing the geopolymerization process and the mesoporosity one possible cause might be the slight dissolution of the zeolite particles during the geopolymerization this induces a local increase in the si al ratio of the geopolymer phase and consequently could affect the mesoporous network the addition of a larger amount of zeolite 10 wt and 20 wt has a smaller impact on the geopolymerization or hydrolysis condensation which becomes negligible for a zeolite content of 50 wt indeed the geopolymer phase volume is lower in the composite which reduces the dissolution effect and consequently its influence on the mesoporous network finally only a small amount of zeolite contributes to a higher composite porosity which may induce faster cs sorption kinetics as well as a higher sorption capacity due to the sorption properties of the nay zeolite 3 3 cs ionic exchange results 3 3 1 kinetics the variation of the cs adsorption in nay gp 3 and the studied composites as a function of the square root of time kinetics curves in the diffusive model is plotted in fig 10a an intraparticle diffusion model was applied to fit the experimental data revealing an initial step of diffusion through the boundary layer followed by an intraparticle diffusion process i and finally an equilibrium step ii yzgp 3 composites exhibit kinetic profiles similar to zeolite nay at the beginning of adsorption process and then follow the gp 3 behavior of cs adsorption with time the slow first step of cs adsorption is limited by the presence of zeolites and follows a pore and surface diffusion stage stage i controlled by the gp matrix the differences in the time needed to reach equilibrium as a function of the zeolite content in the materials is presented in fig 10b pure nay zeolite particles take longer to reach equilibrium mainly because they contain no mesoporosity and exhibit slow diffusion in the micrometric aggregated particles in the composite on the other hand the adsorption of cs occurs mainly on the outer surface with a considerable intraparticle diffusion rate that increases with the zeolite content consequently equilibrium is achieved faster than in pure nay particles indeed the geopolymer adsorbs cs but its mesoporous network also creates easy access to the nay zeolite particles consequently for a low amount of nay particles the mesoporous volume is large and the particles are very well dispersed resulting in a very short time to reach equilibrium when the nay particle amount increases the mesoporous volume decreases and the particles could be a little bit more aggregated resulting in a longer time to reach equilibrium these results highlight that the cs adsorption mechanism depends on both the composition and the microstructure of the materials they also highlight the role of the micropores in preventing the physisorption at short time scales and that the mesopores are beneficial in facilitating the passage of cs inside the material and create access to the sorption site of the zeolite particles 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms cs adsorption isotherms for nay gp 3 and the studied composites are presented in fig 11a based on these experimental results both langmuir and freundlich models 51 described by the eqs 3 and 4 respectively have been applied in linear form and are shown in fig 11b and c respectively 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e with ce equal to the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l 1 qe equilibrium mg g 1 representing the amount of cs adsorbed at equilibrium the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g is represented by qm whereas the langmuir constant in l mg is denoted by kl which is related to the adsorbate s affinity to the adsorbent in the second equation the freundlich constant and exponent are denoted by kf and n and are related to the adsorption properties the langmuir model is only able to fit the data from the cs adsorption isotherm of the pure nay zeolite correctly achieving a high r2 value 0 999 indeed cs ions can be entrapped in the zeolite structure by a simple ionic exchange mechanism with na this gives a langmuir maximum cs sorption capacity of nay equal to 113 mg g 1 however for the materials containing a geopolymer phase the results can only be described through the linear freundlich model which achieves better correlation with the experimental data r2 values 0 991 for these materials complex mechanisms are involved including both chemical adsorption ion exchange with sodium species from the solid i e zeolite and or geopolymer phase and physical adsorption by the geopolymer due to van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding in addition the value 1 for the n parameter of the linear freundlich model eq 3 confirms the favorable sorption of cs for these materials consistent with multi mechanism adsorption this is consistent with the literature assuming that the adsorption is carried out on a heterogeneous site and by multilayer formation on the geopolymer phase 37 38 the fit yields a maximum adsorption capacity of 83 mg g 1 111 mg g 1 113 mg g 1 and 101 mg g 1 for gp 3 5zgp 3 10zgp 3 and 20zgp 3 respectively these values are same order of magnitude of alumino silicate sorbents 52 thus cs isotherm adsorption curves demonstrate that the addition of only a small amount of nay into a granular geopolymer binder increases its efficiency and allows it to reach a maximum sorption capacity close to that of the pure zeolite powder indeed this induces both a high pore volume and enables better accessibility to the sorption site for cs particularly those of the zeolite particles furthermore it is not necessary to add large quantities of zeolite to the material as the maximum capacity then starts to decrease slightly and the sorption kinetics are slowed certainly due to the lower pore volume of the geopolymer binder 4 conclusion granular and hierarchical aluminosilicate materials have been synthesized to extract and sequester cs from liquid effluents these materials consist of a dispersion of crystalline nay zeolite particles in an amorphous geopolymer binder this leads to a robust monolith that can be shaped under a tridimensional structure or ground to obtain granular materials with a desirable particle size with an adapted formulation the geopolymer phase consists of a mesoporous network that makes the adsorption sites accessible to contaminants such as cs moreover the presence of the nay zeolite improves the cs sorption properties interestingly only a small amount of zeolite particles is necessary to obtain the best cs adsorption performance by influencing the microstructure of the material with zeolite particles dispersed in the geopolymer binder the cs adsorption is faster with a time to reach the equilibrium plateau nearly divided by 2 by adding only 5 wt of zeolites and the maximum capacity is significantly greater around 30 higher for all composites than geopolymer binder almost reaching the cs adsorption capacity of the pure powder zeolite such materials can thus be used for cs extraction in batch static process as described here but also present all the necessary properties fast sorption kinetic and adequate porosity to be used in fixed bed process where the presence of the geopolymer allows them to be formed into a monolithic or granular hierarchical structure furthermore the geopolymer could be considered promising

12666,the growing quantity of nuclear waste and the serious threats to the environment challenge researchers to innovate and target new waste form technologies in the past decades considerable efforts have been devoted to developing highly selective sorbents followed by safe disposal with the assurance of chemical stability and robust retention performance zeolite containing geopolymers are regarded as a possible 2 in 1 material able to both capture and sequester elements such as cs in bed fixed column application perspective these composites show promise for combining extraction properties of zeolite powder due to its crystalline structure high capacity and selective adsorption with the tunable microstructure and the shaping feasibility of the geopolymer binder for the development of materials devoted to cs immobilization porous zeolite geopolymer composites were prepared by dispersing nay zeolite particles in a geopolymer binder the influence of the structural properties of such composites on their ability to entrap a large amount of cs by an ionic exchange process was notably studied composites compositions porosities morphologies and crystallinity were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx x ray diffraction analysis xrd and nitrogen adsorption desorption studies experimental cs sorption in batch mode was used to follow the ionic exchange phenomenon in these materials along with 5 wt amount of zeolite in geopolymer improves the cs adsorption performance offering multiple new adsorption sites additionally the geopolymer mesopores are beneficial facilitating the access of cs and its role as a binder is advantageous to tailor granular hierarchical structure for safer industrial application keywords geopolymer zeolite composite cesium adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction cesium 137 is one of the main fission products resulting from nuclear power generation and an extremely hazardous radioisotope that could result in rapid environmental contamination the extraction and entrapment of cs from liquid effluent is consequently a significant challenge for the nuclear industry among the traditional methods used for cs removal ion exchange in a fixed bed process is a common technique for effluent decontamination due to the high selectivity and efficiency low production of secondary waste products reliability and cost effectiveness 1 2 depending on the radionuclides concentrations selective or capacitive materials and technologies are needed for trace decontamination or high amount incorporation respectively 3 for these reasons during the past decades considerable effort has been devoted to developing highly selective cs sorbents that can be disposed of safely and with the assurance of long term chemical stability and robust cs retention 4 5 as a result numerous material structures have been identified such as zirconyl phosphates 6 layered metal sulfides 7 or organic ligands nanoparticles immobilized on various supports such as hexacyanoferrate kcu hcf on silica 8 and zeolite based compounds 9 although the available literature on this subject is extensive it is clear that zeolites are certainly one of the most effective materials for the selective adsorption of ionic contaminants from liquid effluent due to their well defined crystal structures in general porous zeolitic structures are built up from corner sharing sio4 and alo4 tetrahedra with charge compensation for the anionic framework being provided by cations such as na ca2 or h located in the pores among the numerous types of zeolites gis cha mfi the faujasite structure x or y composed of supercages and sodalite cages has interesting advantages because of the large and three dimensional microporous frameworks the pore structure can be chemically altered by adjusting the si al ratio 10 11 the cation exchange capacity is directly linked to the amount of aluminum located in the aperture of the large cages which allows for efficient ion exchange behavior the exchange rate also depends on the nature of the host cations and of the guest cation and varies as a function of the solvent the temperature or the ph faujasite na zeolite is thus of great interest for different applications including catalysis 12 gas separation 13 or in the adsorption of radioactive waste from liquid effluent particularly cs 14 to be used for ion exchange in a column process zeolites have to be formed into a monolithic or granular hierarchical structure to limit the pollution risks from the spreading of particulates particles and furthermore produce an ideal breakthrough curve 1 15 17 specifically the materials must possess sufficient mechanical robustness and exhibit a hierarchical porous structure to optimize the transport properties of the ionic species diffusion while limiting the pressure drop across the monolithic structure hydrodynamic flow 8 however zeolite materials are generally synthesized as powders and consequently not suitable for a direct application in a column processes to resolve this issue different shaping methods have been proposed to directly obtain monolithic and hierarchical zeolites 18 19 as well as to create monolithic structures from pre synthesized zeolite powders 20 22 one simple way to obtain hierarchical granular zeolite containing materials from an as synthesized zeolite powder consists of using an effective binder this approach provides an optimized mesoporosity to make the zeolite powder accessible to the effluent to be decontaminated for that purpose some attention has been paid to using geopolymers as the binder matrix 23 24 geopolymers refer to a solid inorganic polymer made from an aluminosilicate solid precursor such as coal fly ash metakaolin or slag and cross linked with alkali metal ions 24 25 the primary application for geopolymers is as a replacement of portland cement as technology for the development of reduced co2 construction materials 26 however geopolymers have found even greater use in diverse applications that include photocatalysis membranes or for optical and medical applications 27 29 the traditional synthesis route involves alkali activation of the aluminosilicate solid precursor followed by curing at room temperature the solidification of the structure occurs via a dissolution and polycondensation mechanisms called geopolymerization this leads to large and robust monolithic samples having an alumino silicate structure with water entrapped in the pores these materials are porous and this porosity is closely linked to the specific geopolymer formulation 30 31 immense literature exists on the role of the si al ratio and of the initially entrapped amount of water on the geopolymer s microstructure and porosity 32 34 moreover the presence of charge balancing cations in their pore structure allows them to adsorb cationic species from aqueous solutions by ion exchange mechanisms notably cs 35 38 thus due to these very specific properties zeolite containing geopolymers are considered to be a possible 2 in 1 aluminosilicate adsorbent material that exhibit a desirable combination of a hierarchical and multiphase structure in our approach of designing composites to be used for the removal decontamination of cs from effluent zeolites have been employed to achieve a high adsorption capacity because of their high pore volume and large microporous surface area as crystalline filler the zeolites are dispersed in a continuous aluminosilicate matrix geopolymer providing the best properties of the two constituent phases and this has created significant industrial interest as an option for radioactive 137cs sequestration the geopolymer matrix phase introduces a mesoporous network allowing high adsorption kinetic as well as mechanical resistance moreover it binds the zeolites together and displays the role of a robust support that preserves the zeolite charge performance and reduces pollution risks related to unwanted particulate dispersal few examples report the use of zeolite added in the matrix geopolymer to improve properties as porosity density resistance compressive strength or co2 or heavy metals adsorption but barely investigated 39 40 furthermore studies on the synthesis of these composite are still limited with papers mentioning the microstructural characterization of zeolites in geopolymers the novelty of this study was to study and determine the best geopolymer composition able to incorporate faujasite na zeolite particles the impact of the microstructure through the variation of the si al ratio and the amount of zeolite to optimize the cs adsorption performance are also referred to in this article the originality is also to extract cs from contaminated effluents with nay particles dispersed into geopolymer binder without degrading the zeolite structure and maintaining easy access to ionic exchange sites this work described herein is focused on the synthesis and characterization of adaptable multi scale porous and hierarchical zeolite geopolymer materials their microstructural characterization as well as their cs sequestration possibilities by ion exchange mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the metakaolin mk metamax lavollée sa powder was used as the aluminosilicate source sio2 al2o3 molar ratio 2 for the synthesis of the geopolymer and the reaction was induced with sodium hydroxide naoh pellets merck and sodium silicate na2sio2 no betol 39 t wöllner gmbh 28 wt sio2 8 wt na2o and 63 9 wt h2o as alkali activators nay sio2 al2o3 molar ratio 5 2 zeolite powder

experiments to assess the ability of the geopolymer and composites to trap radioactive 137cs 2 2 synthesis of geopolymer and composite materials three geopolymers gp with different sio2 al2o3 molar ratios 2 3 and 4 were prepared as reference matrices as illustrated in fig 1 by mixing metakaolin with the alkali activator solution mixed of sodium silicate naoh and distilled water during 1 h to produce 15 g of a geopolymeric network at room temperature the starting molar compositions were xsio2 1al2o3 1na2o 15h2o and the samples are denoted as gp x where x represent the ratio of sio2 al2o3 the slurry mixture is cured at room temperature over a period of one week in an open mold the obtained monolith structures are removed from the mold prior to analysis following the same protocol four composites based on the gp 3 matrix were obtained after the addition of nay zeolite to the slurry geopolymer under vigorous stirring using different weight ratios of 5 10 20 and 50 wt fig 1 named yzgp 3 with y corresponding to the zeolite weight ratio 5 50 the stability of the commercial nay zeolite in alkaline media ph 13 at 25 c was investigated by measuring the si and al released from the structure as a function of time 2 g of nay particles was transferred into a 1 m naoh solution stirred for 24 h and filtered to determine the concentrations of si and al in solution 2 3 cs adsorption experiments to analyze the cs adsorption efficiency of the samples batch experiments duplicated twice were conducted on granular samples having 100 200 μm average particle sizes obtained by grinding and sieving the monolithic materials the pure zeolite with average particle size of 4 μm was used without modification to explore the effects of contact time 0 02 g m of adsorbent was contacted to 10 ml v of a 100 mg l 1 cs from csno3 solution also containing 0 05 m of nano3 the ph of this solution was equal to 5 1 the mixture was placed in a shaker for different contact times 5 min to 4 days at 25 c after centrifugation and supernatant filtration through a puradisc fp 30 cellulose acetate syringe filter 0 2 μm 30 mm atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to analyze the filtrate and to measure the residual concentration in cs the amount of cs extracted by the materials q was then calculated according to eq 1 1 q c 0 c t v m where c0 and ct are respectively the initial and the final concentration mg l 1 of cs in solution to explore the effect of the initial cs concentration in solution 0 02 g of adsorbent was added to 10 ml of solutions having different cs concentrations 10 800

eq 1 with ct equal to the equilibrium adsorption concentration named also ce mg l 1 2 4 characterizations materials were analyzed for phase purity and crystallinity by powder x ray diffraction pxrd using a panalytical x pert pro mpd copper anode λkα1 1 54056 å generated at 45 ma and 40 kv x celerator detector in the bragg brentano geometry the xrd patterns were collected over the 2θ range 5 70 with 0 017 steps corresponding to 0 625 s measurement time per step quantitative assessment of the crystalline phase concentration in the composites was determined by spiking each composite with a known mass of an al2o3 corundum standard and calculating the relative amounts of each phase by rietveld refinement of the x ray diffraction pattern diffraction patterns for refinement were measured on bruker d8 with lynxeye xe detector using cu kα radiation nitrogen sorption desorption isotherms were measured at 196 c using a quantachrome novatouch lx3 surface area and pore size analyzer samples were degassed at 90 c to 150 c for 24 h prior to analysis surface areas were calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet method pore sizes were taken as the maximum of the corresponding distribution calculated using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method total pore volumes were obtained using the volume of adsorbed gas at p p0 1 the nitrogen sorption isotherm and pore size distribution calculated using the bjh method for each support atomic adsorption spectroscopy was conducted using a perkin elmer aanalyst 200 device to determine the cs concentration in the solution from the sorption experiments for scanning electron microscopy sem observations samples were embedded in an epoxy resin prior to mechanical polishing and thin carbon coating 4 nm the images were collected in a zeiss merlin sem with a gemini 2 column at 3 kv with a secondary electron detector energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds maps were acquired and processed with a bruker eds and bruker esprit software processing segmentation and analysis of the images was done using fiji 41 ilastik 42 and ipsdk 43 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of varying the si al ratio on the microstructure and cs adsorption properties of pure geopolymers the xrd pattern of geopolymers fig 2 with different si al ranging from 2 to 4 gp 2 to gp 4 show a typical broad amorphous background around 2θ 10 30 confirming the amorphous matrix structure sharp and weak diffraction peaks are due to the presence of an anatase impurity commonly found in the mk precursor of the geopolymer 1 7 wt of tio2 along with other oxide impurities 4 3 wt of fe2o3 1 9 wt of k2o and 1 of mgo cao p2o5 and so3 the sample with the lowest si al ratio gp 2 fig 2a displays a weak amorphous phase and the highly crystalline structure of the raw materials suggesting an incomplete geopolymerization process the mk powder seems partially dissolved in the alkali solution producing tetrahedral aluminosilicate units and oxide phases the increase of the si content enhances the geopolymerization rate resulting in an amorphous phase this is consistent with the literature indicating that decreasing the highly aluminous composition low si al amount leads to a sample containing a substantial amount of crystalline unreacted reagents due to a decrease in the hydrolysis condensation efficiency during the geopolymerization 44 fig 3 shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of each geopolymer sample their porous characteristics determined from the analysis using bet and bjh models are summarized in table 1 the gp 2 sample exhibits a type ii isotherm characteristic of a non porous adsorbent according to the iupac classification 45 leading to a low bet specific surface area 15 m2 g 1 and total pore volume at p p0 1 0 02 cm3 g 1 since mesopores in geopolymers result directly from the polycondensation step 31 32 this confirms that the geopolymerization is incomplete in gp 2 as observed above by xrd analysis gp 3 and gp 4 exhibit both type iv isotherms characterized by a saturation level attributed to the presence of mesopores in which a capillary condensation occurs at higher p p0 moreover a slight micropore size distribution is detected at the lowest relative pressures the pore volume and specific area both close to 0 2 cm3 g 1 and 40 m2 g 1 for gp 3 and gp 4 are higher than gp2 and nearly equal for the two samples as expected by literature data indicating that the variation of the sio2 al2o3 ratio in the range from 3 6 to 4 has little impact on the pore structure 3 only a slight pore size decrease is observed when sio2 al2o3 is increased from 3 gp 3 fig 3b to 4 gp 4 fig 3c adsorption kinetics were used to study the adsorption process of cs into the geopolymer structure and explore the adsorption mechanisms to determine the optimal contact time between cs and the gp x the cs adsorption capacities were measured and normalized using their equilibrium capacities to be able to compare the materials to each other the ratio q qe plotted as a function of t1 2 is shown in fig 4a the evolution of q as a function of time is given in fig s1 for all gp x samples the adsorbed amount of cs increases with contact time and the equilibrium time depends on the si al ratio of the geopolymers the diffusional weber morris model can be used to describe the adsorption phase with a linear relationship using the eq 2 46 47 2 qt k di t 1 2 c where qt is the amount of cs adsorbed at time t mg g 1 t is the time min and kdi is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 and c is linked to the thickness of the boundary layer according to this model this curve can be divided by linear zones corresponding to various diffusion limited steps in an initial phase the cs was rapidly adsorbed showing a low resistance of the boundary layer this very quick step is followed by two main stages describing i the cs intraparticle diffusion including pore diffusion and surface diffusion and ii the equilibrium period however gp 2 s pattern of cs adsorption shows the presence of a desorption step as indicated by the presence of a negative slope of the curve fit this phenomenon indicates a cs release shown as iii step on fig 4a after the pore and surface diffusion i and before the equilibrium stage at 1440 min ii as described previously the gp 2 sample displays the crystalline structure of unreacted raw precursors and an incomplete geopolymerization in addition for this non porous gp 2 a low cs adsorption happened with both chemi and physisorption mechanisms for shorter contact which can be explained by an incomplete geopolymerization of the material see xrd analysis thus for longer contact times physisorbed cs by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds is released because of the weakness of the adsorption energy before equilibrium is reached in contrast gp 3 and gp 4 show a pore diffusion in two steps stage i and a cs saturation near 2880 min with no desorption mechanism moreover the saturation states of gp 3 were faster than gp 2 and gp 4 adsorption isotherms were performed to determine the maximum cs adsorption capacity of the gp x and consequently their removal efficiencies fig 4b 2880 min was selected as the optimal saturation contact time from the first kinetics measurement with increasing cs concentrations the adsorption sites gradually become saturated and the maximum adsorption capacity was determined the maximum cs adsorption achieved by the gp 2 was 50 mg g 1 70 mg g 1 by gp 3 and 130 mg g 1 by gp 4 unless previous studies showing that increasing si al leads to an improvement of sorption capacity due to a higher amount of na in the structure these behaviors illustrate the complex mechanisms of cs adsorption in geopolymer phases this comes from both side chemistry and microstructure consideration indeed besides the intraparticle diffusion and the importance of a mesoporous network the adsorption process can be attributed to different phenomena of either chemi and or physisorption 37 38 48 the cs adsorption is linked to the aluminate tetrahedral units the substitution of sodium cations and their accessibilities to the microstructure of the geopolymer due to the larger amount of charge balancing cations in their structure the cs adsorption capacity should be higher for geopolymers having a lower sio2 al2o3 ratio however this is not the case here because of the very low pore volume of gp 2 making some parts of the exchange site inaccessible the gp 3 presents an intermediate cs adsorption capacity due to its large mesoporous network cs can easily diffuse into the granular material this leads to a fast adsorption kinetics and a larger accessibility of the exchange sites the higher capacity measured for gp 4 seems to be due to the difference in the microstructural formation as evidenced in the xrd patterns mentioning previously and a higher geopolymerization a higher porosity coupled to a homogeneous amorphous structure can also help to capture more cs ions into the geopolymeric structure and increase the adsorption capacity for the following study we choose gp 3 as the geopolymer matrix to provide a support for nay zeolite in the composite materials because it has the higher adsorption kinetics required for in flow application column operations in addition its sorption capacity allows efficient cs entrapment 3 2 composition structural and microstructural properties of composites nay geopolymers pictures of gp 3 and composites containing 5 to 50 wt of zeolite are shown in fig 5 the synthesis method demonstrates the feasibility of inserting the nay zeolite particles into the geopolymer matrix leading to the creation of a compact monolithic material the size and shape of these composites can be easily controlled by using different molds during the geopolymerization process as shown on fig 5 note however that 50zgp 3 was a little bit crumbly because of the high zeolite concentration which is not ideal for creating a homogenous mixture the volume of the geopolymer phase under these conditions is too low to maintain a cohesive structure and to bind the zeolite particles in order to evaluate the behavior of the nay zeolite particles during the geopolymerization alkaline conditions the stability of the nay zeolite in alkaline media was investigated by measuring the si and al released from the structure as a function of time and reported in fig s2b this experiment shows a slight loss of si and al during the first 3 days corresponding to 7 and 2 of si and al of the nay framework indeed in alkaline media desilication of the zeolite occurs because the zeolite surface is attacked by the high concentration of hydroxyl groups oh that cause some breaking of the si o si or si o al bonds 49 consequently the sio2 al2o3 ratio slightly decreased as a function of alkali exposure time note that the degradation of the zeolite seems insignificant after 3 days corresponding to the time required for solidification of the composite the zeolite could maintain its structural integrity under the conditions of geopolymer formation however the conditions of the geopolymerization are very alkaline ph 13 and the presence of residual water in the porous network may also degrade the nay zeolite particles that is why detailed analyses were performed by xrd and sem observations to determine the influence of the geopolymerization process on the microstructural properties of the zeolite nay particles xrd patterns of the nay zeolite particles gp 3 and the yzgp 3 samples are shown in fig 6a the corresponding diffraction patterns of the composites contain the major characteristics peaks of the zeolite phase at 2θ 6 10 12 15 24 27 32 and match closely the cubic fd 3m structure of nay with formula na2al2si4 5o13 xh2o according to pdf 00 043 0168 with increasing zeolite content the diffraction patterns exhibit an increase in the diffraction intensity along with sharper and narrower peaks indicating a higher amount of zeolite particles in the composite the diffuse broad peak related to amorphous geopolymer at 10 30 is clearly apparent and indicates that the zeolite phase exists in an amorphous matrix in addition the slight both peak shift and broadening show a possible prominent lattice defects microstrains or chemical heterogeneities on the crystal lattice distortion the results of rietveld refinement of the composite structures as well as the composite structures spiked with al2o3 corundum standard are tabulated in table 2 and in the fig s3 the average zeolite particle dimension changes by no more than 3 compared to the parent zeolite phase suggesting the polymerization step produces minimal dissolution of the crystallite zeolite phase a miscibility between the zeolite and the geopolymer can be effective on the size reduction broadenings and the peak shifts towards larger 2 theta angles the xrd pattern of the 20zgp 3 spiked with an al2o3 corundum standard is plotted in fig 6b with the calculated pattern from rietveld refinement also displayed from spiking a quantitative assessment of the relative amounts of crystalline and amorphous phase can be made for each composite the concentration of crystalline zeolite is slightly below the batched amount while the percentage in crystalline values suggest as much as 20 dissolution of the zeolite phase the error reported in crystalline amount is derived solely from errors in the fit quality other errors such as preferential settlement of particles from a given phase are hard to quantify fig 7 displays representative sem images of gp 3 and composites with different zeolite content three coexisting phases can be distinguished the amorphous geopolymer phase is predominant and functions as the binder for the zeolite particles observed by sem in the fig s2a the geopolymer matrix appears darker than the zeolite particles because of the presence of mesopores into which the resin can penetrate as observed on the zoomed images the zeolite phases were confirmed by eds spectrum fig s4 these images reveal that the zeolite crystalline particles are well dispersed in the geopolymer and the amount of zeolite increases from 5zgp 3 to 20zgp 3 their distribution in the mesoporous network can make them accessible for the contamination present in the effluent to be treated moreover residual metakaolin which did not react during the geopolymerization is visible as platelet shaped particles segmentation of the images was performed as shown in fig 8 at a high magnification and fig s5 with a larger scale to evaluate how the geopolymerization process influences the amounts of the different phases present this allows an estimation of the surface percentage of the zeolite and metakaolin residues which are plotted in fig 8e as a function of the theoretical weight percentage of zeolite in the material the percentage of surface zeolite in the material increases linearly with the zeolite weight percentage indeed the intrinsic density of both geopolymer and zeolite phase can be consider to be roughly equal because of their similar aluminosilicate chemical composition furthermore the size and shape of the nay zeolite particles do not seem significantly affected by their incorporation into the geopolymer phase this demonstrates that the dissolution phenomenon affecting the nay particles in the geopolymer alkaline media is minor and appears to be limited to the zeolite geopolymer interface furthermore the percentage of metakaolin residue decreases with increasing amount of zeolite indeed the slight dissolution of nay should promote a higher rate of geopolymerization involving less residual precursor phase the pore structures of each composite were determined using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig 9a pore volumes and bet specific surface areas are reported in table 3 pure nay zeolite particles are primarily microporous with a total pore volume of 0 33 cm3 g 1 and a bet specific surface area of 600 cm2 g 1 a small fraction of the mesopore volume can be attributed to the interparticle volume in this way the presence of the zeolite in the composites creates a large volume of micropores and contributes to a significant increase in the bet surface area of yzgp 3 composites compared to gp 3 which is mainly mesoporous as described above thus the shape of the n2 isotherm for the different composites is characteristic of microporous and mesoporous materials the total pore volume of the composites can be divided into two parts a microporous volume calculated at p p0 0 02 and a mesoporous volume equal to the total pore volume determined at p p0 1 without the microporous volume the variation of these two volumes microporous and mesoporous as a function of the fraction of zeolite particles in the materials is reported in fig 9b and c in fig 9b there is a proportional relationship between the microporous volume of yzgp 3 and the zeolite nay content where the dashed line represents the theoretical volume assuming a uniform contribution from each phase to the microporous volume as a function of their fraction in the materials this linear evolution shows the efficiency of the role of the geopolymer matrix as the binder in the composite samples allowing full access to the microporosity of the particles of nay zeolite due to the mesoporous network and the geopolymer and the uniform dispersion of the particles only 50zgp 3 exhibits a lower microporous volume than the theoretical value which can be due to a slight agglomeration of zeolite particles that cause some site non accessibility when they are present in too great an amount concerning the mesoporous volume the addition of nay should result in a decrease of this volume as some of the geopolymer phase is replaced the by the non mesoporous particles however on the other hand as shown in fig 9c adding a small amount of zeolite particles 5 wt into gp 3 leads to an increase in the mesoporous pore volume that deviates from the calculated mesoporous volume calculated assuming a uniform contribution from each phase to the mesoporous volume this deviation from the theoretical mesoporous volume is less apparent for samples with 10 wt and 20 wt zeolite and ultimately is not observed at all when the zeolite content reaches 50 wt thus only the addition of a small amount of nay during the geopolymerization leads to an increase of the mesoporous volume the pore size distributions from the desorption isotherm calculated using the bjh method confirms an increase in the mesopore volume of the composite when compared to a geopolymer without any zeolite content fig 9d the composite seems to be affected in its microstructure by an interaction between the zeolite and the geopolymer precursor solution influencing the geopolymerization process and the mesoporosity one possible cause might be the slight dissolution of the zeolite particles during the geopolymerization this induces a local increase in the si al ratio of the geopolymer phase and consequently could affect the mesoporous network the addition of a larger amount of zeolite 10 wt and 20 wt has a smaller impact on the geopolymerization or hydrolysis condensation which becomes negligible for a zeolite content of 50 wt indeed the geopolymer phase volume is lower in the composite which reduces the dissolution effect and consequently its influence on the mesoporous network finally only a small amount of zeolite contributes to a higher composite porosity which may induce faster cs sorption kinetics as well as a higher sorption capacity due to the sorption properties of the nay zeolite 3 3 cs ionic exchange results 3 3 1 kinetics the variation of the cs adsorption in nay gp 3 and the studied composites as a function of the square root of time kinetics curves in the diffusive model is plotted in fig 10a an intraparticle diffusion model was applied to fit the experimental data revealing an initial step of diffusion through the boundary layer followed by an intraparticle diffusion process i and finally an equilibrium step ii yzgp 3 composites exhibit kinetic profiles similar to zeolite nay at the beginning of adsorption process and then follow the gp 3 behavior of cs adsorption with time the slow first step of cs adsorption is limited by the presence of zeolites and follows a pore and surface diffusion stage stage i controlled by the gp matrix the differences in the time needed to reach equilibrium as a function of the zeolite content in the materials is presented in fig 10b pure nay zeolite particles take longer to reach equilibrium mainly because they contain no mesoporosity and exhibit slow diffusion in the micrometric aggregated particles in the composite on the other hand the adsorption of cs occurs mainly on the outer surface with a considerable intraparticle diffusion rate that increases with the zeolite content consequently equilibrium is achieved faster than in pure nay particles indeed the geopolymer adsorbs cs but its mesoporous network also creates easy access to the nay zeolite particles consequently for a low amount of nay particles the mesoporous volume is large and the particles are very well dispersed resulting in a very short time to reach equilibrium when the nay particle amount increases the mesoporous volume decreases and the particles could be a little bit more aggregated resulting in a longer time to reach equilibrium these results highlight that the cs adsorption mechanism depends on both the composition and the microstructure of the materials they also highlight the role of the micropores in preventing the physisorption at short time scales and that the mesopores are beneficial in facilitating the passage of cs inside the material and create access to the sorption site of the zeolite particles 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms cs adsorption isotherms for nay gp 3 and the studied composites are presented in fig 11a based on these experimental results both langmuir and freundlich models 51 described by the eqs 3 and 4 respectively have been applied in linear form and are shown in fig 11b and c respectively 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e with ce equal to the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l 1 qe equilibrium mg g 1 representing the amount of cs adsorbed at equilibrium the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g is represented by qm whereas the langmuir constant in l mg is denoted by kl which is related to the adsorbate s affinity to the adsorbent in the second equation the freundlich constant and exponent are denoted by kf and n and are related to the adsorption properties the langmuir model is only able to fit the data from the cs adsorption isotherm of the pure nay zeolite correctly achieving a high r2 value 0 999 indeed cs ions can be entrapped in the zeolite structure by a simple ionic exchange mechanism with na this gives a langmuir maximum cs sorption capacity of nay equal to 113 mg g 1 however for the materials containing a geopolymer phase the results can only be described through the linear freundlich model which achieves better correlation with the experimental data r2 values 0 991 for these materials complex mechanisms are involved including both chemical adsorption ion exchange with sodium species from the solid i e zeolite and or geopolymer phase and physical adsorption by the geopolymer due to van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding in addition the value 1 for the n parameter of the linear freundlich model eq 3 confirms the favorable sorption of cs for these materials consistent with multi mechanism adsorption this is consistent with the literature assuming that the adsorption is carried out on a heterogeneous site and by multilayer formation on the geopolymer phase 37 38 the fit yields a maximum adsorption capacity of 83 mg g 1 111 mg g 1 113 mg g 1 and 101 mg g 1 for gp 3 5zgp 3 10zgp 3 and 20zgp 3 respectively these values are same order of magnitude of alumino silicate sorbents 52 thus cs isotherm adsorption curves demonstrate that the addition of only a small amount of nay into a granular geopolymer binder increases its efficiency and allows it to reach a maximum sorption capacity close to that of the pure zeolite powder indeed this induces both a high pore volume and enables better accessibility to the sorption site for cs particularly those of the zeolite particles furthermore it is not necessary to add large quantities of zeolite to the material as the maximum capacity then starts to decrease slightly and the sorption kinetics are slowed certainly due to the lower pore volume of the geopolymer binder 4 conclusion granular and hierarchical aluminosilicate materials have been synthesized to extract and sequester cs from liquid effluents these materials consist of a dispersion of crystalline nay zeolite particles in an amorphous geopolymer binder this leads to a robust monolith that can be shaped under a tridimensional structure or ground to obtain granular materials with a desirable particle size with an adapted formulation the geopolymer phase consists of a mesoporous network that makes the adsorption sites accessible to contaminants such as cs moreover the presence of the nay zeolite improves the cs sorption properties interestingly only a small amount of zeolite particles is necessary to obtain the best cs adsorption performance by influencing the microstructure of the material with zeolite particles dispersed in the geopolymer binder the cs adsorption is faster with a time to reach the equilibrium plateau nearly divided by 2 by adding only 5 wt of zeolites and the maximum capacity is significantly greater around 30 higher for all composites than geopolymer binder almost reaching the cs adsorption capacity of the pure powder zeolite such materials can thus be used for cs extraction in batch static process as described here but also present all the necessary properties fast sorption kinetic and adequate porosity to be used in fixed bed process where the presence of the geopolymer allows them to be formed into a monolithic or granular hierarchical structure furthermore the geopolymer could be considered promising materials as a nuclear waste matrix these materials have the potential for both trapping and disposal in further studies resistance to irradiation as well as cs ions leaching will be investigated on

12667,pesticide pollution is an arduous challenge encountered in the field of industrial wastewater treatment as a fenton like metal catalyst multifunctional biochar has attracted more and more attention in the dissolution of insoluble organic chemical pollutants in this study the magnetic municipal sludge biochars msdbc were synthesized by one step pyrolysis of sludge from sewage treatment plant the biochars prepared at different temperatures have great differences in surface functional groups and composition of iron phase msdbc prepared at 400 c has a better catalytic oxidation capacity while msdbc prepared at 800 c has a stronger adsorption capacity the reason is that the morphology and iron phase composition distribution of biochar are different more pore structures were formed on the surface of biochar prepared at 800 c which not only has better adsorption performance but also makes the impregnated fe3 enter the interior of biochar and transform during pyrolysis however the iron phase of msdbc prepared at 400 c is mostly located on the surface and the content of fe2 is higher notably iron compounds embedded in the magnetic biochar have been proved to be the main catalysts for activating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals oh radical quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance epr detection confirmed the production of oh and its important role in the oxidative degradation of thiamethoxam thx in the thx degradation msdbc h2o2 fenton like system showed excellent effect at neutral ph environment finally the innovative use of msdbc h2o2 fenton like technology in the degradation of complex actual wastewater showed good practicability and stability this research provides a new idea for the treatment of pesticide wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fenton like thiamethoxam magnetic biochar pyrolysis municipal sludge 1 introduction thiamethoxam thx c8h10cln5o3s is a second generation nicotine insecticide which kills insects by attacking the central nervous system 1 3 it is widely utilized in numerous crops due to its broad spectrum insecticidal efficacy and unusual physicochemical features 4 its affinity for soil is also very low which means that they are easy to transfer from soil to water so they can be found in soil surface water groundwater and urban sewage treatment plants 5 7 many pharmaceuticals like pesticides can be detected in urban sewage treatment plants 8 because pharmaceuticals and pesticides are refractory organics with the characteristics of long half life high solubility and significant toxicity to most aquatic arthropods 9 its pollution to the aquatic environment cannot be ignored biochar is a kind of carbon material prepared by pyrolysis of biomass under anoxic conditions 10 because of its large specific surface area developed pore structure and rich functional group biochar can be used as adsorbent to remove a variety of organic pollutants 11 13 fernandes j o et al demonstrated that biochar prepared from sugarcane filter cake can remove about 70 0 of thiamethoxam within 60 min 14 however biochar materials had a restricted adsorption capability and it is difficult to degrade thiamethoxam completely and efficiently at the same time it exists desorption poor stability and reuse problems 15 municipal sludge is a kind of waste biomass material with large output and difficult to dispose 16 the preparation of biochar is considered to be a good resource utilization method of municipal sludge advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively remove a variety of organic pollutants antibiotics pesticides phenols etc and they appear to be a viable option for removing thiamethoxam 17 20 in recent years the degradation of thiamethoxam has been successfully achieved via photocatalytic and electro fenton methods 21 23 in addition some researchers use combined processes to degrade thiamethoxam patil et al demonstrated that thiamethoxam can be successfully degraded using a combination of ultrasonic cavitation and photo fenton technology 24 however the combined process is difficult to be applied in the actual wastewater treatment and the practical advanced oxidation process has attracted more and more attention compared with other aops fenton process based on fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 has attracted more attention because of its strong free radical oxidation ability more convenient use and less impact on the environment compared with traditional fenton technology the benefits of heterogenous iron catalysts include a wider ph condition less secondary contamination and a higher utilization rate 25 based on the large specific surface area and electron transfer capacity of biochar iron substances can be supported by carbonaceous carrier 26 27 and used as a catalyst to activate hydrogen peroxide to produce active species the impregnation approach for creating heterogeneous fenton like catalysts allows for one step pyrolysis and magnetization considerably simplifying the1 synthesis procedure however previous research has found that temperature has a significant impact on the magnetism and composition of materials and the impregnated iron phase in sludge biochar will undergo a series of phase transformations with the change of temperature 28 29 for instance wang et al made magnetic biochar using rattan sawdust impregnation and pyrolysis it was found that the iron phase generated at 600 800 c was mainly magnetite and the phase shift from iron oxides to α fe occurred about 900 c 30 in addition temperature also significantly affects the catalytic performance of the materials 31 shin j et al reported that the preparation of iron embedded in biochar from coffee grounds its catalytic degradation of food dyes at ph 3 decreases with increasing pyrolysis temperature 500 c 600 c and 700 c 32 however the features of iron impregnated biochar generated at medium to high pyrolysis temperatures 400 800 c as well as their impact on the efficiency and mechanism of fenton like oxidation are still unclear in this study municipal sludge and ferrous chloride were utilized as raw materials to prepare msdbc through impregnation pyrolysis the physicochemical characteristics of magnetic biochar prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures 400 c 600 c and 800 c were analyzed by xrd ftir xps sem bet and vsm the effects of materials prepared at various temperatures and operating conditions on thx removal by a fenton like were studied the reaction mechanism of pyrolysis temperature on the thiamethoxam pesticide degradation by magnetic biochar fenton like technology was explored finally the practical application potential of the msdbc material is proved by the actual pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials thx cas 153719 23 4 97 0 and acetonitrile were purchased from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china chemicals of ferric

purchased from deyang special gas co ltd jinan china 2 2 catalyst synthesis the raw materials of municipal sludge were chosen for the preparation of magnetic biochar which originated from a sewage treatment plant in shandong province of china the details of municipal sludge were shown in table s1 the municipal sludge was cleaned and ground after natural air drying and dried in a drying oven at 60 0 c overnight a one step method was used to prepare msdbc the preparation process was shown in fig s1 the pretreated sludge particles 10 0 g were added to 100 ml fecl3 6h2o solution with concentration of 0 5 mol l then the mixed solution was shaken in an oscillator at 160 rpm at 25 0 c for 20 h the mixture was dried at 80 c for 12 h under air subsequently the above pretreated mixture was pyrolyzed in muffle furnaces at 5 c min using nitrogen atmosphere protection and kept 2 h at 400 c 600 c and 800 c respectively then it was taken out after it was naturally cooled to room temperature finally the acquired sample was ground and sieved through 80 mesh screen and named as msdbc400 msdbc600 and msdbc800 respectively moreover pyrolysis condition of fe3 concentration 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 mol l was also optimized fig s2 sludge biochars sdbc were made under the same process at 400 c 600 c and 800 c except without fecl3 6h2o solution impregnation referred as sdbc400 sdbc600 and sdbc800 respectively 2 3 fenton like degradation of thx the fenton like degradation of thx was carried out in a 150 ml beaker 0 40 g l msdbc and 3 mm h2o2 were added into the flask containing 100 ml of thx 50 mg l solution and then the ph of the thx solution was adjusted to 7 0 with 0 10 m hcl or naoh solution after that the conical flask was stirred on a thermostatic oscillator 25 c 200 0 r min for complete reaction at each predetermined time interval a 1 ml liquid sample was removed and passed through a 0 22 μm filter before being quenched with absolute ethanol to stop the reaction the concentration of thx was determined by hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan detection wavelength for thx was set at 254 nm and the temperature was maintained to 40 c acetonitrile water 70 30 v v were used as the mobile phases with flow rate 0 8 ml min all experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 4 actual wastewater experiment the experiment was carried out in six parallel systems using a conical flask with a working volume of 150 ml each bottle contains 100 ml of pharmaceutical wastewater the actual wastewater was taken from the effluent after biological section treatment of chemical pharmaceutical plant in shandong province of china it passed through 0 45 μm filter membrane to remove surface suspended solids the ph of the wastewater was 8 2 and its initial cod and toc values were 319 mg l and 90 1 mg l respectively a specific concentration of catalyst and oxidant were added to the bottle msdbc 2 0 g l h2o2 7 mm then the conical flask was stirred on a constant temperature oscillator 25 c 200 r min for complete reaction after reacted 1 h the sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and quenched with absolute ethanol to stop the reaction the cod value in the solution is determined by cod rapid detection reagent hash and a total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu toc ltph was used to determine the toc concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of msdbc fig 1 a shows the xrd spectrum of msdbc the purpose is to characterize its crystal structure with the three types of magnetic biochar several evident characteristic diffraction peaks of sio2 jcpds no 01 070 2517 fe2o3 jcpds no 01 089 0598 fe3o4 jcpds no 65 3107 α feooh jcpds card no 29 0713 fe0 95c0 05 jcpds no 00 023 0298 and fe0 jcpds no 01 087 0721 were found all msdbc samples obtained at 400 800 c had quartz as the main crystalline phase it s worth noting that the iron phase of magnetic biochar prepared at different temperatures varies markedly msdbc400 has the main diffraction peaks corresponding to fe2o3 2θ 22 4 32 7 41 0 64 2 fe3o4 2θ 29 7 35 1 42 4 60 1 and α feooh 2θ 35 2 44 7 55 8 60 0 respectively msdbc600 has a few characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to fe2o3 2θ 32 6 and fe3o4 2θ 30 0 and 35 4 msdbc800 has the main diffraction peaks corresponding to fe3o4 2θ 29 9 35 2 59 9 fe0 95c0 05 2θ 42 9 51 8 and fe0 2θ 44 7 it can be found that with the increase of temperature 400 c 600 c and 800 c the valence state of iron phase gradually decreases and transforms from fe2o3 α feooh to fe3o4 and then to fe0 95c0 05 fe0 the reason is that reducing gases such as co and h2 etc increases with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature this leads to the reduction of iron ions impregnated on biochar and the valence state of iron ions gradually declines with temperature increasing 33 these results show that temperature significantly affects the composition of iron phase in msdbc other researchers have reached similar conclusions 32 fig 1 b shows the functional groups of the msdbc synthesized at various temperatures as revealed by the ft ir spectrum similarly the typical peaks at 463 and 560 cm 1 correspond to feo 34 indicating that iron oxide or iron oxide complex is formed due to the interaction of iron and oxygen on the surface of biochar during pyrolysis the difference is that with the increase of preparation temperature the strong peak co at 1033 cm 1 35 the h c h peak at 1400 cm 1 the peak attributed to cc or co at 1500 1720 cm 1 36 37 and the wide peak oh attributed to alcohol or phenol at 3400 cm 1 38 are significantly weakened or even disappeared the peak assigned to h c h 1400 cm 1 group weakened with increasing temperature suggesting that the dehydrogenation reaction occurred to enhance aromaticity 39 xps analysis is used to further identify the functional groups and surface element valence states of msdbc fig 2 the c1s of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are shown in fig 2 a b the peaks of 284 4 ev 285 7 ev 288 4 ev and 292 8 ev correspond to cc c oh cooh and π π shake up respectively the proportion of cc is 65 8 msdbc400 and 80 3 msdbc800 and the proportion of c oh is 25 5 msdbc400 and 9 1 msdbc800 cooh accounted for 8 7 msdbc400 and 7 2 msdbc800 it can be clearly observed that the magnetic sludge biochar prepared at 800 c has a higher proportion of cc bond whereas the sludge biochar prepared at 400 c has a higher proportion of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups these results are consistent with the infrared spectrum in addition the π π shake up accounting for 3 4 in msdbc800 also verifies its high carbonization and the formation of aromatic structure 37 the fe 2p of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are shown in fig 2 c d the fe 2p xps spectra contained two main peaks centered at around 725 7 and 711 9 ev which correspond to the binding energies of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 respectively 40 the fe 2p3 2 peak in msdbc400 could be deconvoluted into two peaks representing fe2 710 78 ev and fe3 714 68 ev in both fe3o4 and fe2o3 and the binding energy of msdbc800 at 707 8 ev and 710 88 ev correspond to fe0 and fe3o4 respectively xps results show the proportion of fe2 in msdbc400 is higher than that in msdbc800 in addition compared with msdbc400 msdbc800 has fe0 signal which is consistent with the results of xrd based on the above analysis it can be found that the pyrolysis temperature affects the valence state of iron in msdbc and their relative content the sem images in fig 3 a b show that msdbc400 and msdbc800 are attached by iron oxides when the preparation temperature rises from 400 c to 800 c the pores of msdbc are more abundant through bet characterization the specific surface areas of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are 35 0m2 g and 205 2m2 g respectively indicating that the preparation temperature can significantly affect the pore size of biochar materials it is easier to expand pores at high temperature resulting in higher graphitization degree of the material increasing its specific surface area and providing more adsorption sites which indirectly explains the stronger adsorption capacity of msdbc800 for thx fig 5 a moreover the element map c d e of msdbc shows that c o and fe elements are evenly distributed indicating that their iron containing compounds are evenly dispersed on the surface of biochar without obvious aggregation in addition the saturation hysteresis curve of msdbc fig 4 were measured magnetic saturation values of the two forms of magnetic biochar were 16 7 msdbc400 and 25 5 msdbc800 emu g indicating that the magnetic biochar could be easily isolated from the reaction medium 3 2 removal of thx by adsorption and fenton like systems first thx was degraded using biochar without iron fig s3 a and biochar h2o2 system fig s3 b the removal rates of thx by biochar prepared at different temperatures were 2 0 sdbc400 5 9 sdbc600 and 14 2 sdbc800 respectively indicating that sdbc adsorption capacity for thx is weak meanwhile after adding h2o2 the elimination rate of thx increased to 5 7 sdbc400 8 2 sdbc600 and 24 9 sdbc800 respectively the results demonstrate that sdbc has low catalytic efficiency for h2o2 according to some studies persistent free radicals pfrs in biochar assistance in the activation of h2o2 and promote the decomposition of contaminants 41 this study indirectly showed that pfrs had little effect on h2o2 activation and thx degradation as shown in fig 5 a msdbc prepared at various temperatures has a wide range of adsorption capacity the removal rates of thx are 2 4 msdbc400 5 9 msdbc600 and 51 1 msdbc800 respectively compared with sdbc the adsorption effect is improved but it is hard to eliminate all thx only by msdbc adsorption as shown in fig 5 b h2o2 alone hardly degrade thx however when msdbc and h2o2 were added to the solution simultaneously the degradation effect of thx is significantly improved the msdbc h2o2 system removed 98 7 msdbc400 29 9 msdbc600 and 77 6 msdbc800 of thx in 2 h respectively the proportion of adsorption in total thx degradation was 2 4 msdbc400 19 7 msdbc600 and 65 8 msdbc800 respectively this indicates with pyrolysis temperature increases msdbc has stronger adsorption capacity for higher specific surface nevertheless msdbc400 reflects best catalytic performance activating h2o2 to produce more active free radicals to decompose thx for more oxygen containing function groups in favor of electron transfer at low pyrolysis temperature 41 3 3 the effects of ph on thx degradation the influence of ph in the msdbc400 h2o2 synergistic system was explored as shown in fig 6 which is an essential parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of fenton like system the degradation of thx at 2 h reached 99 8 99 7 96 6 93 4 and 83 0 when the ph of the solution was 4 6 7 8 and 10 respectively the rate of degradation kept excellent from acidic to neutral condition and only decreased little at alkalinity ph 10 the acidic environment is conducive to the degradation of thx by the fenton like of msdbc400 h2o2 which may be due to the easier dissolution of fe2 in msdbc 42 and the rapid activation of h2o2 to form active free radicals but in alkaline environment may be that oh in the solution may form iron hydroxide complex with iron ions on the surface of msdbc thus hindering the formation of active free radicals 43 44 in general compared to traditional fenton msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like has good degradation effect on thx in a wide range of ph which proves its wide environmental applicability in the degradation of organic pollutant 3 4 fenton like degradation mechanism of thx the effect of reactive oxygen species formed in the msdbc h2o2 system on catalytic degradation of thx was investigated using a quenching experiment fig 7 a and the major reactive oxygen species were identified quenching experiments were carried out with tert butanol and benzoquinone to test the effects of oh and o2 on the degradation of thx in msdbc400 h2o2 system after adding 1 0 mmol l tert butanol and p benzoquinone the degradation of thx decreased to 15 4 and 75 5 respectively indicating oh was the key active substance and o2 was the secondary in order to analyze whether iron ions leached from msdbc participated in fenton reaction directly the controlled experiments were carried out the iron ions leached from the solution were 3 1 mg l msdbc400 and 2 7 mg l msdbc800 respectively an equal amount of ferrous sulfate calculated as fe2 was used to activate h2o2 to degrade thx which only achieved 6 3 msdbc400 and 4 0 msdbc800 removal rate respectively far less than msdbc h2o2 system implying that thx degeneration is not caused by the leaching iron ion in these materials through quenching experiment oh radical was determined as the main reactive oxygen radical in order to discover more about the reactive oxygen species involved in the reaction process the relative strength of the two systems msdbc400 h2o2 msdbc800 h2o2 was determined by epr qualitative analysis fig 7 b significant signals of dmpo oh adducts with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 in msdbc h2o2 system prepared at different temperatures were observed in the experiment the signal intensity of dmpo oh in msdbc400 h2o2 was much higher than that in msdbc800 h2o2 this is commensurate with their removal efficiency further verifying that oh plays a leading role in thx degradation some intermediates were produced during the degradation process of thx and many scholars have done relevant researches 45 initially thx molecule may be decomposed into a more toxic by product c8h9o2n3scl than the parent under the action of oh and then into a more stable and less toxic intermediate c4h5n2scl which is further decomposed to form volatile compounds carbonyl sulfide and isocyanate finally the small molecular byproducts of thx degradation can be further mineralized into co2 and h2o 3 5 the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the catalytic mechanism the composition of iron on msdbc after the reaction by xps was shown as fig 7 c and d the different valence of iron ratios before and after the catalytic reaction of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are contrasted in table 1 compared with fresh msdbc400 fig 2c the relative content of fe2 decreased by 40 3 and the ratio of fe3 fe2 fe0 increased by 0 88 while compared with fresh msdbc800 fig 2d the relative contents of fe0 and fe2 in the biochar after reaction decreased by 2 1 and 3 9 respectively and the ratio of fe3 fe2 fe0 increased by 0 14 after reaction under the same reaction conditions the conversion rate of fe2 in msdbc400 was significantly higher than msdbc800 which indicates that more fe2 was involved in the activation of h2o2 and produced more oh to participate in the degradation of thx to sum up in msdbc h2o2 fenton like system iron compounds dominated by fe2 are the key reasons for participating in thx degradation while the composition and content of iron compounds in magnetic biochar are affected by pyrolysis temperature thus affecting the removal of thx in the degradation system of msdbc800 h2o2 firstly high temperature makes biochar produced more pore structure and larger specific surface area so that it can adsorbed more thx but at the same time a considerable number of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of biochar are also destroyed by high temperatures aggravating the graphitization degree of msdbc800 secondly the impregnated fe3 is reduced at high temperature to form lower valence iron containing compounds such as fe3o4 fe0 95c0 05 and fe0 which leads to less iron containing compounds containing fe2 than msdbc400 among them fe2 and fe0 can activate h2o2 to produce oh eqs 1 3 however the proportion of fe0 in total iron is low and the fenton reaction effect is worse in neutral environment 46 at the same time there is less amount of fe2 involved in the activated h2o2 reaction in iron containing compounds resulting in less oh production which leads to the slower catalytic degradation rate of thx in msdbc800 h2o2 than that in msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like system 1 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe 2 2h 2 o 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 2ho 3 oh o 2 thx intermediates mineralization in the degradation system of msdbc400 h2o2 firstly biochar as matrix provided attachment sites for a variety of iron compounds and also greatly reduced the aggregation of iron at the preparation temperature of 400 c iron compounds composed of fe2o3 and fe3o4 are grown and attached to the surface of biochar which have the ability to activate h2o2 to generate free radicals through xps analysis before and after the reaction a large amount of fe2 was consumed during the reaction and fe3 increased after the reaction indicating that the degradation of thx was completed by fe2 activating h2o2 to generate reactive oh in addition the quenching experiment confirmed that o2 also played a secondary role in the degradation of thx by msdbc400 h2o2 the fenton like reaction produced by msdbc400 h2o2 can be described as 4 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh ho 5 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 o 2 h o 2 h 6 fe 3 o 2 h fe 2 o 2 h 7 fe 3 o 2 fe 2 o 2 8 oh o 2 thx intermediates mineralization 3 6 stability and cost analysis of msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like technology in order to explore the possible application potential of msdbc h2o2 fenton like technology stability and cost were analyzed fig 8 shows the removal of thx in ten rounds of degradation by msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like in the tenth round the degradation rate of thx by msdbc400 h2o2 system was about 60 0 the results showed that the degradation rate of thx gradually decreased with the increase of repetition times but in the first three degradation processes the degradation efficiency was relatively stable the decrease of degradation rate may be due to the blockage of active catalytic sites by attached organics and the oxidation of some divalent iron 47 however after five repeated tests msdbc400 h2o2 system still has a degradation rate of 76 5 for thx compared with the repeated tests of other researchers table s2 msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like technology in our research maintains good reusability in the degradation of organic pollutants the raw materials power and chemical reagent consumption in the preparation of msdbc were simulated and calculated on the laboratory and industrial scale respectively based on the simulation calculation without labor and machine costs the price of treating a ton of thiamethoxam pesticide wastewater was us 1 08 ton at the same time its cost per kilogram is about us 0 81 estimated according to the production cost of manufacturing industry labor and machine costs account for about 60 of the total cost the cost is us 2 03 kg which is lower than the global average cost of biochar us 2 65 48 and activated carbon us 2 2 49 the detailed calculation process is in the supporting information and table s3 s4 considering good recyclability and heterogeneous catalytic performance msdbc has great economic cost advantage in the degradation of pollutants 3 7 actual wastewater degradation experiment the impacts of different adsorption and oxidation systems on actual pharmaceutical wastewater treatment at alkalescence of ph 8 2 were explored as shown in fig 9 after the simple addition of hydrogen peroxide cod increases and toc almost remains unchanged this is because the oxidation potential of potassium dichromate in cod detection reagent is stronger than that of hydrogen peroxide resulting in the increase of cod 50 after adding msdbc800 and msdbc400 alone the cod value decreased by 8 5 and 1 4 respectively and the toc value decreased by 8 9 and 3 7 respectively in the fenton like system of msdbc800 h2o2 and msdbc400 h2o2 within 1 h the cod removal rates reached 11 3 and 22 0 respectively and the toc were abated by 12 2 and 22 3 respectively it can be seen that msdbc800 mainly remove the actual wastewater through adsorption while msdbc400 mainly degrades the wastewater through catalytic oxidation which is similar to the degradation of thx the practical wastewater experiment verified the application potential of msdbc fenton like system in complex practical wastewater 4 conclusions magnetic sludge biochar was successfully prepared from municipal sludge its fenton like catalytic performance was explored after it was used to activate h2o2 to degrade thiamethoxam the analysis indicated that the msdbc prepared at 400 c has good catalytic degradation effect on thx it can maintain good degradation efficiency in a wide environment ph condition from 4 to 10 epr and quenching experiments showed that oh was the key factor of thx degradation in msdbc h2o2 system the preparation temperature significantly influenced the morphology and surface iron phase composition of biochar and then affected the degradation of thx by msdbc h2o2 fenton like system finally msdbc h2o2 fenton like technology can still achieve good degradation efficiency to treat actual pharmaceutical wastewater in alkaline ph condition in general this study provides a possible idea for the resource utilization of municipal sludge and the efficient treatment of pesticide wastewater however the repeatability of biochar based fenton like catalysts was generally reduced in continuous use therefore other technologies such as photo fenton and electro fenton can be considered to be combined with biochar materials to improve

12667,pesticide pollution is an arduous challenge encountered in the field of industrial wastewater treatment as a fenton like metal catalyst multifunctional biochar has attracted more and more attention in the dissolution of insoluble organic chemical pollutants in this study the magnetic municipal sludge biochars msdbc were synthesized by one step pyrolysis of sludge from sewage treatment plant the biochars prepared at different temperatures have great differences in surface functional groups and composition of iron phase msdbc prepared at 400 c has a better catalytic oxidation capacity while msdbc prepared at 800 c has a stronger adsorption capacity the reason is that the morphology and iron phase composition distribution of biochar are different more pore structures were formed on the surface of biochar prepared at 800 c which not only has better adsorption performance but also makes the impregnated fe3 enter the interior of biochar and transform during pyrolysis however the iron phase of msdbc prepared at 400 c is mostly located on the surface and the content of fe2 is higher notably iron compounds embedded in the magnetic biochar have been proved to be the main catalysts for activating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals oh radical quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance epr detection confirmed the production of oh and its important role in the oxidative degradation of thiamethoxam thx in the thx degradation msdbc h2o2 fenton like system showed excellent effect at neutral ph environment finally the innovative use of msdbc h2o2 fenton like technology in the degradation of complex actual wastewater showed good practicability and stability this research provides a new idea for the treatment of pesticide wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fenton like thiamethoxam magnetic biochar pyrolysis municipal sludge 1 introduction thiamethoxam thx c8h10cln5o3s is a second generation nicotine insecticide which kills insects by attacking the central nervous system 1 3 it is widely utilized in numerous crops due to its broad spectrum insecticidal efficacy and unusual physicochemical features 4 its affinity for soil is also very low which means that they are easy to transfer from soil to water so they can be found in soil surface water groundwater and urban sewage treatment plants 5 7 many pharmaceuticals like pesticides can be detected in urban sewage treatment plants 8 because pharmaceuticals and pesticides are refractory organics with the characteristics of long half life high solubility and significant toxicity to most aquatic arthropods 9 its pollution to the aquatic environment cannot be ignored biochar is a kind of carbon material prepared by pyrolysis of biomass under anoxic conditions 10 because of its large specific surface area developed pore structure and rich functional group biochar can be used as adsorbent to remove a variety of organic pollutants 11 13 fernandes j o et al demonstrated that biochar prepared from sugarcane filter cake can remove about 70 0 of thiamethoxam within 60 min 14 however biochar materials had a restricted adsorption capability and it is difficult to degrade thiamethoxam completely and efficiently at the same time it exists desorption poor stability and reuse problems 15 municipal sludge is a kind of waste biomass material with large output and difficult to dispose 16 the preparation of biochar is considered to be a good resource utilization method of municipal sludge advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively remove a variety of organic pollutants antibiotics pesticides phenols etc and they appear to be a viable option for removing thiamethoxam 17 20 in recent years the degradation of thiamethoxam has been successfully achieved via photocatalytic and electro fenton methods 21 23 in addition some researchers use combined processes to degrade thiamethoxam patil et al demonstrated that thiamethoxam can be successfully degraded using a combination of ultrasonic cavitation and photo fenton technology 24 however the combined process is difficult to be applied in the actual wastewater treatment and the practical advanced oxidation process has attracted more and more attention compared with other aops fenton process based on fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 has attracted more attention because of its strong free radical oxidation ability more convenient use and less impact on the environment compared with traditional fenton technology the benefits of heterogenous iron catalysts include a wider ph condition less secondary contamination and a higher utilization rate 25 based on the large specific surface area and electron transfer capacity of biochar iron substances can be supported by carbonaceous carrier 26 27 and used as a catalyst to activate hydrogen peroxide to produce active species the impregnation approach for creating heterogeneous fenton like catalysts allows for one step pyrolysis and magnetization considerably simplifying the1 synthesis procedure however previous research has found that temperature has a significant impact on the magnetism and composition of materials and the impregnated iron phase in sludge biochar will undergo a series of phase transformations with the change of temperature 28 29 for instance wang et al made magnetic biochar using rattan sawdust impregnation and pyrolysis it was found that the iron phase generated at 600 800 c was mainly magnetite and the phase shift from iron oxides to α fe occurred about 900 c 30 in addition temperature also significantly affects the catalytic performance of the materials 31 shin j et al reported that the preparation of iron embedded in biochar from coffee grounds its catalytic degradation of food dyes at ph 3 decreases with increasing pyrolysis temperature 500 c 600 c and 700 c 32 however the features of iron impregnated biochar generated at medium to high pyrolysis temperatures 400 800 c as well as their impact on the efficiency and mechanism of fenton like oxidation are still unclear in this study municipal sludge and ferrous chloride were utilized as raw materials to prepare msdbc through impregnation pyrolysis the physicochemical characteristics of magnetic biochar prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures 400 c 600 c and 800 c were analyzed by xrd ftir xps sem bet and vsm the effects of materials prepared at various temperatures and operating conditions on thx removal by a fenton like were studied the reaction mechanism of pyrolysis temperature on the thiamethoxam pesticide degradation by magnetic biochar fenton like technology was explored finally the practical application potential of the msdbc material is proved by the actual pharmaceutical wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials thx cas 153719 23 4 97 0 and acetonitrile were purchased from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china chemicals of ferric

purchased from deyang special gas co ltd jinan china 2 2 catalyst synthesis the raw materials of municipal sludge were chosen for the preparation of magnetic biochar which originated from a sewage treatment plant in shandong province of china the details of municipal sludge were shown in table s1 the municipal sludge was cleaned and ground after natural air drying and dried in a drying oven at 60 0 c overnight a one step method was used to prepare msdbc the preparation process was shown in fig s1 the pretreated sludge particles 10 0 g were added to 100 ml fecl3 6h2o solution with concentration of 0 5 mol l then the mixed solution was shaken in an oscillator at 160 rpm at 25 0 c for 20 h the mixture was dried at 80 c for 12 h under air subsequently the above pretreated mixture was pyrolyzed in muffle furnaces at 5 c min using nitrogen atmosphere protection and kept 2 h at 400 c 600 c and 800 c respectively then it was taken out after it was naturally cooled to room temperature finally the acquired sample was ground and sieved through 80 mesh screen and named as msdbc400 msdbc600 and msdbc800 respectively moreover pyrolysis condition of fe3 concentration 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 mol l was also optimized fig s2 sludge biochars sdbc were made under the same process at 400 c 600 c and 800 c except without fecl3 6h2o solution impregnation referred as sdbc400 sdbc600 and sdbc800 respectively 2 3 fenton like degradation of thx the fenton like degradation of thx was carried out in a 150 ml beaker 0 40 g l msdbc and 3 mm h2o2 were added into the flask containing 100 ml of thx 50 mg l solution and then the ph of the thx solution was adjusted to 7 0 with 0 10 m hcl or naoh solution after that the conical flask was stirred on a thermostatic oscillator 25 c 200 0 r min for complete reaction at each predetermined time interval a 1 ml liquid sample was removed and passed through a 0 22 μm filter before being quenched with absolute ethanol to stop the reaction the concentration of thx was determined by hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan detection wavelength for thx was set at 254 nm and the temperature was maintained to 40 c acetonitrile water 70 30 v v were used as the mobile phases with flow rate 0 8 ml min all experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 4 actual wastewater experiment the experiment was carried out in six parallel systems using a conical flask with a working volume of 150 ml each bottle contains 100 ml of pharmaceutical wastewater the actual wastewater was taken from the effluent after biological section treatment of chemical pharmaceutical plant in shandong province of china it passed through 0 45 μm filter membrane to remove surface suspended solids the ph of the wastewater was 8 2 and its initial cod and toc values were 319 mg l and 90 1 mg l respectively a specific concentration of catalyst and oxidant were added to the bottle msdbc 2 0 g l h2o2 7 mm then the conical flask was stirred on a constant temperature oscillator 25 c 200 r min for complete reaction after reacted 1 h the sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and quenched with absolute ethanol to stop the reaction the cod value in the solution is determined by cod rapid detection reagent hash and a total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu toc ltph was used to determine the toc concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of msdbc fig 1 a shows the xrd spectrum of msdbc the purpose is to characterize its crystal structure with the three types of magnetic biochar several evident characteristic diffraction peaks of sio2 jcpds no 01 070 2517 fe2o3 jcpds no 01 089 0598 fe3o4 jcpds no 65 3107 α feooh jcpds card no 29 0713 fe0 95c0 05 jcpds no 00 023 0298 and fe0 jcpds no 01 087 0721 were found all msdbc samples obtained at 400 800 c had quartz as the main crystalline phase it s worth noting that the iron phase of magnetic biochar prepared at different temperatures varies markedly msdbc400 has the main diffraction peaks corresponding to fe2o3 2θ 22 4 32 7 41 0 64 2 fe3o4 2θ 29 7 35 1 42 4 60 1 and α feooh 2θ 35 2 44 7 55 8 60 0 respectively msdbc600 has a few characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to fe2o3 2θ 32 6 and fe3o4 2θ 30 0 and 35 4 msdbc800 has the main diffraction peaks corresponding to fe3o4 2θ 29 9 35 2 59 9 fe0 95c0 05 2θ 42 9 51 8 and fe0 2θ 44 7 it can be found that with the increase of temperature 400 c 600 c and 800 c the valence state of iron phase gradually decreases and transforms from fe2o3 α feooh to fe3o4 and then to fe0 95c0 05 fe0 the reason is that reducing gases such as co and h2 etc increases with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature this leads to the reduction of iron ions impregnated on biochar and the valence state of iron ions gradually declines with temperature increasing 33 these results show that temperature significantly affects the composition of iron phase in msdbc other researchers have reached similar conclusions 32 fig 1 b shows the functional groups of the msdbc synthesized at various temperatures as revealed by the ft ir spectrum similarly the typical peaks at 463 and 560 cm 1 correspond to feo 34 indicating that iron oxide or iron oxide complex is formed due to the interaction of iron and oxygen on the surface of biochar during pyrolysis the difference is that with the increase of preparation temperature the strong peak co at 1033 cm 1 35 the h c h peak at 1400 cm 1 the peak attributed to cc or co at 1500 1720 cm 1 36 37 and the wide peak oh attributed to alcohol or phenol at 3400 cm 1 38 are significantly weakened or even disappeared the peak assigned to h c h 1400 cm 1 group weakened with increasing temperature suggesting that the dehydrogenation reaction occurred to enhance aromaticity 39 xps analysis is used to further identify the functional groups and surface element valence states of msdbc fig 2 the c1s of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are shown in fig 2 a b the peaks of 284 4 ev 285 7 ev 288 4 ev and 292 8 ev correspond to cc c oh cooh and π π shake up respectively the proportion of cc is 65 8 msdbc400 and 80 3 msdbc800 and the proportion of c oh is 25 5 msdbc400 and 9 1 msdbc800 cooh accounted for 8 7 msdbc400 and 7 2 msdbc800 it can be clearly observed that the magnetic sludge biochar prepared at 800 c has a higher proportion of cc bond whereas the sludge biochar prepared at 400 c has a higher proportion of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups these results are consistent with the infrared spectrum in addition the π π shake up accounting for 3 4 in msdbc800 also verifies its high carbonization and the formation of aromatic structure 37 the fe 2p of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are shown in fig 2 c d the fe 2p xps spectra contained two main peaks centered at around 725 7 and 711 9 ev which correspond to the binding energies of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 respectively 40 the fe 2p3 2 peak in msdbc400 could be deconvoluted into two peaks representing fe2 710 78 ev and fe3 714 68 ev in both fe3o4 and fe2o3 and the binding energy of msdbc800 at 707 8 ev and 710 88 ev correspond to fe0 and fe3o4 respectively xps results show the proportion of fe2 in msdbc400 is higher than that in msdbc800 in addition compared with msdbc400 msdbc800 has fe0 signal which is consistent with the results of xrd based on the above analysis it can be found that the pyrolysis temperature affects the valence state of iron in msdbc and their relative content the sem images in fig 3 a b show that msdbc400 and msdbc800 are attached by iron oxides when the preparation temperature rises from 400 c to 800 c the pores of msdbc are more abundant through bet characterization the specific surface areas of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are 35 0m2 g and 205 2m2 g respectively indicating that the preparation temperature can significantly affect the pore size of biochar materials it is easier to expand pores at high temperature resulting in higher graphitization degree of the material increasing its specific surface area and providing more adsorption sites which indirectly explains the stronger adsorption capacity of msdbc800 for thx fig 5 a moreover the element map c d e of msdbc shows that c o and fe elements are evenly distributed indicating that their iron containing compounds are evenly dispersed on the surface of biochar without obvious aggregation in addition the saturation hysteresis curve of msdbc fig 4 were measured magnetic saturation values of the two forms of magnetic biochar were 16 7 msdbc400 and 25 5 msdbc800 emu g indicating that the magnetic biochar could be easily isolated from the reaction medium 3 2 removal of thx by adsorption and fenton like systems first thx was degraded using biochar without iron fig s3 a and biochar h2o2 system fig s3 b the removal rates of thx by biochar prepared at different temperatures were 2 0 sdbc400 5 9 sdbc600 and 14 2 sdbc800 respectively indicating that sdbc adsorption capacity for thx is weak meanwhile after adding h2o2 the elimination rate of thx increased to 5 7 sdbc400 8 2 sdbc600 and 24 9 sdbc800 respectively the results demonstrate that sdbc has low catalytic efficiency for h2o2 according to some studies persistent free radicals pfrs in biochar assistance in the activation of h2o2 and promote the decomposition of contaminants 41 this study indirectly showed that pfrs had little effect on h2o2 activation and thx degradation as shown in fig 5 a msdbc prepared at various temperatures has a wide range of adsorption capacity the removal rates of thx are 2 4 msdbc400 5 9 msdbc600 and 51 1 msdbc800 respectively compared with sdbc the adsorption effect is improved but it is hard to eliminate all thx only by msdbc adsorption as shown in fig 5 b h2o2 alone hardly degrade thx however when msdbc and h2o2 were added to the solution simultaneously the degradation effect of thx is significantly improved the msdbc h2o2 system removed 98 7 msdbc400 29 9 msdbc600 and 77 6 msdbc800 of thx in 2 h respectively the proportion of adsorption in total thx degradation was 2 4 msdbc400 19 7 msdbc600 and 65 8 msdbc800 respectively this indicates with pyrolysis temperature increases msdbc has stronger adsorption capacity for higher specific surface nevertheless msdbc400 reflects best catalytic performance activating h2o2 to produce more active free radicals to decompose thx for more oxygen containing function groups in favor of electron transfer at low pyrolysis temperature 41 3 3 the effects of ph on thx degradation the influence of ph in the msdbc400 h2o2 synergistic system was explored as shown in fig 6 which is an essential parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of fenton like system the degradation of thx at 2 h reached 99 8 99 7 96 6 93 4 and 83 0 when the ph of the solution was 4 6 7 8 and 10 respectively the rate of degradation kept excellent from acidic to neutral condition and only decreased little at alkalinity ph 10 the acidic environment is conducive to the degradation of thx by the fenton like of msdbc400 h2o2 which may be due to the easier dissolution of fe2 in msdbc 42 and the rapid activation of h2o2 to form active free radicals but in alkaline environment may be that oh in the solution may form iron hydroxide complex with iron ions on the surface of msdbc thus hindering the formation of active free radicals 43 44 in general compared to traditional fenton msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like has good degradation effect on thx in a wide range of ph which proves its wide environmental applicability in the degradation of organic pollutant 3 4 fenton like degradation mechanism of thx the effect of reactive oxygen species formed in the msdbc h2o2 system on catalytic degradation of thx was investigated using a quenching experiment fig 7 a and the major reactive oxygen species were identified quenching experiments were carried out with tert butanol and benzoquinone to test the effects of oh and o2 on the degradation of thx in msdbc400 h2o2 system after adding 1 0 mmol l tert butanol and p benzoquinone the degradation of thx decreased to 15 4 and 75 5 respectively indicating oh was the key active substance and o2 was the secondary in order to analyze whether iron ions leached from msdbc participated in fenton reaction directly the controlled experiments were carried out the iron ions leached from the solution were 3 1 mg l msdbc400 and 2 7 mg l msdbc800 respectively an equal amount of ferrous sulfate calculated as fe2 was used to activate h2o2 to degrade thx which only achieved 6 3 msdbc400 and 4 0 msdbc800 removal rate respectively far less than msdbc h2o2 system implying that thx degeneration is not caused by the leaching iron ion in these materials through quenching experiment oh radical was determined as the main reactive oxygen radical in order to discover more about the reactive oxygen species involved in the reaction process the relative strength of the two systems msdbc400 h2o2 msdbc800 h2o2 was determined by epr qualitative analysis fig 7 b significant signals of dmpo oh adducts with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 in msdbc h2o2 system prepared at different temperatures were observed in the experiment the signal intensity of dmpo oh in msdbc400 h2o2 was much higher than that in msdbc800 h2o2 this is commensurate with their removal efficiency further verifying that oh plays a leading role in thx degradation some intermediates were produced during the degradation process of thx and many scholars have done relevant researches 45 initially thx molecule may be decomposed into a more toxic by product c8h9o2n3scl than the parent under the action of oh and then into a more stable and less toxic intermediate c4h5n2scl which is further decomposed to form volatile compounds carbonyl sulfide and isocyanate finally the small molecular byproducts of thx degradation can be further mineralized into co2 and h2o 3 5 the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the catalytic mechanism the composition of iron on msdbc after the reaction by xps was shown as fig 7 c and d the different valence of iron ratios before and after the catalytic reaction of msdbc400 and msdbc800 are contrasted in table 1 compared with fresh msdbc400 fig 2c the relative content of fe2 decreased by 40 3 and the ratio of fe3 fe2 fe0 increased by 0 88 while compared with fresh msdbc800 fig 2d the relative contents of fe0 and fe2 in the biochar after reaction decreased by 2 1 and 3 9 respectively and the ratio of fe3 fe2 fe0 increased by 0 14 after reaction under the same reaction conditions the conversion rate of fe2 in msdbc400 was significantly higher than msdbc800 which indicates that more fe2 was involved in the activation of h2o2 and produced more oh to participate in the degradation of thx to sum up in msdbc h2o2 fenton like system iron compounds dominated by fe2 are the key reasons for participating in thx degradation while the composition and content of iron compounds in magnetic biochar are affected by pyrolysis temperature thus affecting the removal of thx in the degradation system of msdbc800 h2o2 firstly high temperature makes biochar produced more pore structure and larger specific surface area so that it can adsorbed more thx but at the same time a considerable number of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of biochar are also destroyed by high temperatures aggravating the graphitization degree of msdbc800 secondly the impregnated fe3 is reduced at high temperature to form lower valence iron containing compounds such as fe3o4 fe0 95c0 05 and fe0 which leads to less iron containing compounds containing fe2 than msdbc400 among them fe2 and fe0 can activate h2o2 to produce oh eqs 1 3 however the proportion of fe0 in total iron is low and the fenton reaction effect is worse in neutral environment 46 at the same time there is less amount of fe2 involved in the activated h2o2 reaction in iron containing compounds resulting in less oh production which leads to the slower catalytic degradation rate of thx in msdbc800 h2o2 than that in msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like system 1 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe 2 2h 2 o 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 2ho 3 oh o 2 thx intermediates mineralization in the degradation system of msdbc400 h2o2 firstly biochar as matrix provided attachment sites for a variety of iron compounds and also greatly reduced the aggregation of iron at the preparation temperature of 400 c iron compounds composed of fe2o3 and fe3o4 are grown and attached to the surface of biochar which have the ability to activate h2o2 to generate free radicals through xps analysis before and after the reaction a large amount of fe2 was consumed during the reaction and fe3 increased after the reaction indicating that the degradation of thx was completed by fe2 activating h2o2 to generate reactive oh in addition the quenching experiment confirmed that o2 also played a secondary role in the degradation of thx by msdbc400 h2o2 the fenton like reaction produced by msdbc400 h2o2 can be described as 4 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh ho 5 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 o 2 h o 2 h 6 fe 3 o 2 h fe 2 o 2 h 7 fe 3 o 2 fe 2 o 2 8 oh o 2 thx intermediates mineralization 3 6 stability and cost analysis of msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like technology in order to explore the possible application potential of msdbc h2o2 fenton like technology stability and cost were analyzed fig 8 shows the removal of thx in ten rounds of degradation by msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like in the tenth round the degradation rate of thx by msdbc400 h2o2 system was about 60 0 the results showed that the degradation rate of thx gradually decreased with the increase of repetition times but in the first three degradation processes the degradation efficiency was relatively stable the decrease of degradation rate may be due to the blockage of active catalytic sites by attached organics and the oxidation of some divalent iron 47 however after five repeated tests msdbc400 h2o2 system still has a degradation rate of 76 5 for thx compared with the repeated tests of other researchers table s2 msdbc400 h2o2 fenton like technology in our research maintains good reusability in the degradation of organic pollutants the raw materials power and chemical reagent consumption in the preparation of msdbc were simulated and calculated on the laboratory and industrial scale respectively based on the simulation calculation without labor and machine costs the price of treating a ton of thiamethoxam pesticide wastewater was us 1 08 ton at the same time its cost per kilogram is about us 0 81 estimated according to the production cost of manufacturing industry labor and machine costs account for about 60 of the total cost the cost is us 2 03 kg which is lower than the global average cost of biochar us 2 65 48 and activated carbon us 2 2 49 the detailed calculation process is in the supporting information and table s3 s4 considering good recyclability and heterogeneous catalytic performance msdbc has great economic cost advantage in the degradation of pollutants 3 7 actual wastewater degradation experiment the impacts of different adsorption and oxidation systems on actual pharmaceutical wastewater treatment at alkalescence of ph 8 2 were explored as shown in fig 9 after the simple addition of hydrogen peroxide cod increases and toc almost remains unchanged this is because the oxidation potential of potassium dichromate in cod detection reagent is stronger than that of hydrogen peroxide resulting in the increase of cod 50 after adding msdbc800 and msdbc400 alone the cod value decreased by 8 5 and 1 4 respectively and the toc value decreased by 8 9 and 3 7 respectively in the fenton like system of msdbc800 h2o2 and msdbc400 h2o2 within 1 h the cod removal rates reached 11 3 and 22 0 respectively and the toc were abated by 12 2 and 22 3 respectively it can be seen that msdbc800 mainly remove the actual wastewater through adsorption while msdbc400 mainly degrades the wastewater through catalytic oxidation which is similar to the degradation of thx the practical wastewater experiment verified the application potential of msdbc fenton like system in complex practical wastewater 4 conclusions magnetic sludge biochar was successfully prepared from municipal sludge its fenton like catalytic performance was explored after it was used to activate h2o2 to degrade thiamethoxam the analysis indicated that the msdbc prepared at 400 c has good catalytic degradation effect on thx it can maintain good degradation efficiency in a wide environment ph condition from 4 to 10 epr and quenching experiments showed that oh was the key factor of thx degradation in msdbc h2o2 system the preparation temperature significantly influenced the morphology and surface iron phase composition of biochar and then affected the degradation of thx by msdbc h2o2 fenton like system finally msdbc h2o2 fenton like technology can still achieve good degradation efficiency to treat actual pharmaceutical wastewater in alkaline ph condition in general this study provides a possible idea for the resource utilization of municipal sludge and the efficient treatment of pesticide wastewater however the repeatability of biochar based fenton like catalysts was generally reduced in continuous use therefore other technologies such as photo fenton and electro fenton can be considered to be combined with biochar materials to improve

12668,electrocoagulation ec is considered to be a highly efficient and environment friendly water treatment technology the adsorption of flocs generated in situ contributes to the pollutant removal the iron flocs with various structures green rusts grs fe3o4 feooh are generated during in situ ec process with fe electrode however there is a lack of researches on the impact of flocs structures on pollutant adsorption as is well known the unsaturated adsorbent flocs are usually scraped out of the ec reactor as solid waste it has therefore become necessary to study the adsorption characteristics of the flocs both during and after the ec process in this work the in situ direct treatment of wastewater by ec and ex situ removal of pollutants in wastewater by dosing flocs produced by ec process adsorption were designed to investigate the flocs adsorption during and after ec process respectively flocs with different structure was generated by precise control of ec process for in situ and ex situ adsorption the pollutant removal by flocs during in situ adsorption was found to be higher than that of ex situ adsorption meanwhile grs outperformed fe3o4 and feooh especially during ex situ adsorption the ageing resistance of grs appeared to be superior to that of fe3o4 and feooh the structural transformation of flocs during ex situ adsorption showed that the evolution from grs to fe3o4 and feooh resulted in the change of morphology and adsorption capacity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocoagulation flocs adsorption green rusts magnetite data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction it has been well established that electrocoagulation ec is an eco friendly technology for wastewater treatment during ec process contaminants are mainly removed by flocs adsorption ligand adsorption surface complexation reactions co precipitation and so on 1 2 electro generated metal ions fe2 or al3 in ec solution undergo spontaneous hydrolysis reactions to form hydroxide flocs 3 4 these flocs play a key role in ec process taking advantage of the high specific surface area and high density of surface hydroxyl groups in addition a minimal amount of radical such as hydroxyl radical oh is generated during ec process which contributes to the elimination of limited amounts of pollutants by advanced oxidation 5 however the full potential of fe ec has not yet been realized because of limited research in regards to the formation of highly complex fe flocs and their ability to remove different pollutants fe ii released from sacrificial anodes are precursors for the formation of various iron oxy hydroxide flocs such as green rusts grs goethite α feooh lepidocrocite γ feooh hematite magnetite fe3o4 and ferric oxide fe2o3 under different conditions 2 6 8 the complexity of fe flocs means that different environments or conditions generate various fe flocs with key attributes fe flocs exhibit various crystal structural arrangements fig 1 contributing unique characteristics applications and different adsorption mechanisms towards pollutants for example while anaerobic conditions result in grs ferric oxy hydroxides are produced under aerobic conditions 9 fe3o4 is also generated under conditions of low dissolved oxygen do when carbonate and or sulfate are absent 9 10 other factors such as ph 6 8 11 14 of the solution current partition 11 12 15 co existing ions in solution 16 20 etc influence the structure of flocs and or performance of fe ec as well these results shed light on the importance of applying an appropriate ratio of o2 fe ii for in situ ec treatments fe flocs exhibit various crystal structural arrangements fig 1 contributing to unique characteristics applications and different adsorption mechanisms towards pollutants grs are layered double hydroxides ldhs characterized by positively charged fe oh 6 octahedral sheets and interlayers of anions monovalent anions oxygenated anions organic anions and surfactants and water molecules 13 21 22 the remarkable adsorption capacity of fe ii iii hydroxy gr can be considered to be closely related to its unique intercalated structure amphoteric surface hydroxyl groups and highly redox active fe ii fraction causing localized reductions 23 or a pseudo fenton process 24 as such grs have remarkable ability to eliminate smaller organics and negatively charged pollutants fe3o4 has a lower surface area than grs because of its compact octahedral nature resulting in less adsorption sites and lower charge density 24 ec generated fe3o4 has proven to be highly effective in removing arsenic because of partial arsenic incorporation near the particle surface 25 goethite α feooh presents a typical orthorhombic structure and thermodynamic stability at ambient temperature which has been widely applied as an important sorbent of soluble pollutants due to its relatively high surface area and surface hydroxyl 26 27 in particular it is worth mentioning that ga iii was reported to adsorb strongly to fe equivalent sites at the α feooh surface 28 it can be seen that the adsorption characteristics of the above flocs are quite different due to their different structures besides the structure of grs is extremely unstable and easily oxidized inevitably transforming into fe3o4 α feooh etc tong et al that a well controlled artificial oxidative precipitation of fe ii changing fe flocs from carbonate grs to lepidocrocite resulted in a subsequent oxidation and uptake of aqueous arsenic as as a remediation strategy for total as in groundwater 29 this research reveals the significance of flocs structural transformation presently despite the potential for fe ec for large scale wastewater treatment there are still some research gaps with respect to fe ec flocs utilization due to the difficulty of their real time in situ identification the adsorption mechanism of in situ generated functional fe flocs grs fe3o4 feooh etc and comparison of their adsorption capacity has been largely ignored by researchers although a few quantitative studies on the structural transformation of flocs during ec exist 10 the effect of flocs structure transformation on pollutant adsorption capacity warrants adequate attention as such the adsorption characteristics of grs fe3o4 and α feooh of ec process need to be clarified in the real fe ec system the oxygen evolution reaction oer occurring at the anode produces activated oxygen and strong oxidizing substances such as oh which could oxidize the flocs and induce the structural transformation of flocs furthermore the hydrogen evolution reaction her occurring at the cathode could release hydrogen bubbles into the electrolytic channel the h2 bubbles are absorbed by the loose and porous flocs that results in the floatation of unsaturated flocs which are then scraped off as solid waste and shortens the contact residence time between flocs and pollutants leading to poor adsorption efficiency thus the utilization rate of electro generated flocs is much lower in another respect low concentration wastewater and organic wastewater produced in actual industry usually contains less carrier content and has low conductivity thus traditional ec process brings on high energy consumption due to the high ohmic drop that is serious obstacle for ec to be used in some different situations 30 therefore it is necessary to explore both the in situ and ex situ adsorption characteristic of electrochemical generated flocs to support the reuse of post adsorption flocs and ex situ adsorption of low conductivity wastewater theoretically in this work an in situ ex situ ec process was designed to address the above mentioned research gaps fig 2 in order to avoid the effect of reactive oxygen ph variation and strong oxidizing agents generated during ec the typical iron flocs grs fe3o4 and α feooh were generated under precise control sodium sulfate solution as electrolyte the in situ adsorption and ex situ adsorption were then carried out to analyze the characteristic difference between them respectively to which mo ni2 and f were chosen however the flocs agglomerates and the structure of flocs changes during the long time of ex situ adsorption the structure of grs with superior intercalation damage especially to broaden the application scenarios of ex situ adsorption the ageing resistance of functional fe flocs was investigated furthermore the influence of flocs structural transformation on its morphology and adsorption capacity was examined in detail consequently this paper gives a deep understanding on the structural characteristics adsorption capacity and structural transformation behavior of different flocs produced by fe ec this study is expected to provide new schemes for the reuse of unsaturated flocs after traditional ec and the treatment of low conductivity wastewater by electrocoagulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were analytical grade ar all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm the target pollutants used were mo methyl orange ni2 niso4 6h2o and f naf the concentration of mo wastewater was 50 mg l while that of ni2 and f were 100 mg l sodium sulfate na2so4 0 1 m was used as the electrolyte solution in all experiments the ph values were adjusted by naoh 0 5 m and hcl 20 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure the experimental devices were shown in fig s1 the cuboid ec reactor was self designed and was made of pyrex glass with dimensions of 5 6 cm 2 3 cm 14 cm fe purity 99 98 electrodes 12 6 cm 0 46 cm 0 02 cm with effective surface area 50 cm2 were placed in the reactor as anode and cathode with a 10 mm gap between them prior to all experiments the electrode plates were polished with sand paper immersed in diluted hcl solution 5 wt for 20 min and rinsed three times with ultrapure water 2 2 1 scenario one controlled generation of flocs for in situ adsorption the initial ph and do were adjusted at the beginning for a controlled generation of flocs do was adjusted by n2 gas purity 99 99 air and o2 gas 80 the above gases were introduced into the system about 100 ml min from the gas inlet at the cell bottom through the gas pump and the system was seal with plastic film the ph values were adjusted by naoh 0 5 m and hcl 20 target pollutants mo niso4 6h2o and naf were dissolved in 60 ml electrolyte solution respectively the reactor was sealed during the ec process for controlled flocs generation and simultaneous in situ adsorption a constant current density of 20 a m2 was maintained for 30 min on the fe electrodes by a direct current power supply gps 3303c china 2 2 2 scenario two controlled generation of flocs for ex situ adsorption the initial ph and do were adjusted at the beginning for a controlled generation of flocs consistent with the scenario one 60 ml pure electrolyte solution were added to the electrochemical reactor to produce active adsorption flocs a constant current density of 20 a m2 was maintained for 30 min to produce flocs with typical structure under precise control then the electrodes and wires were removed and the target pollutants were dosed immediately for ex situ adsorption in order to prevent oxidation and deterioration of flocs solid pollutants were put into the suspension containing the flocs instead of filtering flocs into a simulated wastewater the whole process of ex situ adsorption was sealed with plastic wrap the initial content of pollutants during ex situ adsorption remained consistent with in situ adsorption 2 3 measurements and characterization the ph value was measured with ph meter rex electric chemical phs 3c china the do value was monitored with dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach pure electrolyte solution without pollutant was used for experiments conducted in section 3 1 model wastewater was prepared for studies conducted in sections 3 2 and 3 3 results from three parallel experiments were used to obtain the error bars after the ec treatment the sample was filtered by a vacuum filter shb iii china and aqueous phase micro filtration membrane 0 22 μm 50 mm to collect the flocs then the flocs collected were dried at 110 c in a vacuum drying oven dzf china x ray diffraction xrd 6000 japan was used to characterize the flocs the powder samples were analyzed by sem zeiss germany and ftir thermo fisher america the removal efficiency of mo and ni2 was measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3010 japan fluoride concentration was measured by the ionometric standard method 3 results and discussion 3 1 controlled generation of adsorptive flocs with typical structures during the ec process the formation of flocs is determined to a great extent by the do dissolved oxygen content aerobic and or anaerobic conditions of the electrolyte resulting in differing flocs structures in this work do was adjusted by controlling the flow rate of n2 air or o2 in ec process the xrd diagrams of flocs with typical structures generated under precise control of do are shown in fig 3 from fig 3 the speciation conditions of the fe flocs with various structures can be identified the xrd patterns of flocs generated at diverse do conditions show that at do 16 20 mg l magnetite was formed while a mixture of goethite hematite and magnetite were the main flocs components when do exceeded 22 mg l as illustrated in fig 3a the xrd patterns of the samples generated under lower do display narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with high intensity indicating the increased crystallinity of the magnetite phases the characteristic peaks of samples generated in lower do are stronger showing that a greater amount of pure magnetite was obtained at critical range of do magnetite and or goethite hematite and magnetite were obtained at aerobic conditions do 22 mg l goethite and hematite were the main flocs component fig 3b stronger characteristic peaks of goethite can be observed while the peaks of hematite are weaker the results are consistent with the previously reported observations of dubrawski et al and xu et al 9 10 as can be seen from fig 3c the xrd pattern with do 16 mg l shows a peak at 582 cm 1 which can be attributed to the vibration of feo indicating that the flocs were composed by fe3o4 a broad peak between 3200 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 is attributable to the stretching vibration of the oh group the peaks at 1430 cm 1 and 1624 cm 1 are identified as the bending vibrations of water molecules and oh respectively the peak at 1267 cm 1 is classified as an asymmetric stretching vibration of feohfe the peak at 1114 cm 1 is ascribed to the so stretching band of so4 2 therefore the generation of different kinds of flocs by ec could be achieved by regulating do do played a dominant role in the formation of flocs structure when do 12 mg l flocs were mainly composed of grs and oxidized in air at a visible rate at 12 mg l do 16 mg l grs and fe3o4 were main flocs components when do 16 20 mg l magnetite was formed but do exceeded 22 mg l a mixture of goethite hematite and magnetite was the main flocs component when do 25 mg l goethite was the dominant component of flocs however it should be emphasized that the flocs samples generated at do 16 mg l were extremely difficult to extract and characterize by conventional xrd and ft ir 3 2 the in situ and ex situ adsorption capacity of flocs for pollutants grs fe3o4 and α feooh are proven to be produced in fe ec process by controlling the dissolved oxygen precisely in section 3 1 in order to elucidate the adsorption characteristic of flocs in in situ process three target pollutants was investigated in this section as mentioned in introduction a large amount of flocs is wasted to floatation caused by h2 released at the cathode in order to improve the utilization of flocs the ex situ adsorption performance of typical flocs was also investigated in this section the adsorption characteristics of flocs in our ex situ case as obtained in this study could therefore serve as a guide for further research on industrial ex situ wastewater treatment processes the mo removal efficiency of flocs with do variation is illustrated in fig 4a for both in situ and ex situ scenario the residual concentrations of mo were the lowest at do 4 mg l this phenomenon is ascribed to the superior adsorption ability of grs since grs consist of fe ii fe iii hydroxide layers with large surface areas and high anion exchange capacity 9 24 although magnetite is also made up of fe ii fe iii hydroxides it has lower surface area than grs due to compact octahedral structure 24 therefore the adsorption and removal ability of mo is best suited to grs it can be seen from fig 4a that the mo removal efficiency decreased continually with the increment of do that implies the removal efficiency under anaerobic condition was significantly better than that under aerobic condition a further increase in do adversely influenced mo removal under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions for both in situ and ex situ adsorption it can be clearly seen that in situ removal efficiency was better than ex situ adsorption compared to ex situ adsorption the adsorption efficiency of in situ flocs was about 10 15 better it is noteworthy that ex situ removal efficiency was only a bit lower than in situ removal efficiency especially when the flocs was mainly composed of grs it could be suggested that the flocs adsorption played a major role in the process of mo removal from this point of view ex situ adsorption is valid for mo removal compared with fe3o4 and feooh which were generated at higher do grs exhibits excellent ex situ adsorption performance in mo removal in terms of affinity for fe flocs f was weaker than mo from fig 4b f removal efficiency through ex situ adsorption was much lower than in situ adsorption thus increasing do from 4 to 28 mg l failed to achieve a better removal efficiency indicating that the removal efficiency was highest at anaerobic conditions even though grs has strong adsorption capacity of contaminants the ex situ removal efficiency by grs was only 15 74 the removal efficiency was around 11 99 and 7 84 for flocs with the composition of fe3o4 and α feooh respectively these results are in stark contrast to ex situ removal of mo discussed above conclusively the removal of f cannot be realized through ex situ adsorption the reason of low removal efficiency can be explained by the size of fluoride ions the pore volume of active adsorption flocs may be too large for fluorine ions whose trapping effect was limited regardless of in situ or ex situ adsorption the removal efficiency of f by flocs was inherently lower than that of mo because of the larger size of organic compounds compared to f the f removal has been confirmed to be ion exchange between fluoride ions and the hydroxyl groups on the fe flocs surface 31 the ex situ removal efficiency was also much lower than in situ removal efficiency which could be attributed to spatial effects as such flocs are less able to capture f than larger sized pollutants during ex situ adsorption process in other words smaller sized pollutants such as f are less likely to enter the adsorption site of grs or fe3o4 or α feooh what s more the intercalations of grs are more suited to trap pollutants with larger size although ex situ removal efficiency was unsatisfactory the elimination of fluoride ions by grs is still the best which is attributable to the intercalated structure characteristics of grs such that f combines with fe ii and fe iii to generate gr f therefore the in situ removal efficiency being much higher than ex situ removal efficiency is due to the fact that fe flocs combined with f to form various hydroxide complexes and co precipitates during in situ ec process 32 33 different from f and mo the overall removal efficiency of ni by fe flocs is ideal fig 4c shows that the removal efficiency of ni2 decreased slightly with the increment of do under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions the removal efficiencies of ni2 were almost up to 90 there is little difference in the ni2 removal effects under the two removal scenarios the removal efficiency of ni2 was the best when the flocs were mainly composed of grs followed by fe3o4 and the α feooh indicating that grs had the largest adsorption capacity for ni2 this also can be ascribed to the structure of grs being similar to the layered bimetallic hydroxide and the unique layered structure being more conducive to the adsorption of pollutants additionally although fe3o4 is a mixed valent iron oxide similar to grs in composition its specific surface area is lower than that of grs hence its adsorption capacity of pollutants is lower than grs the ec removal mechanism of heavy metals is also largely attributed to complexation reactions sweep coagulation and co precipitation 16 ni ii fe ii exchange also occured at the edges of the grs particles resulting in ni ii replacement in the grs lattice during adsorption to form ni ii fe ii fe iii ldh with higher stability than grs 34 ni2 also precipitated with oh generated at the cathode during in situ adsorption process the removal efficiency of ni2 is high under alkaline conditions suggesting that precipitation reaction played a role it can be seen from fig 4c that the removal efficiency of ni2 through ex situ adsorption was lower than that through in situ adsorption this is owed to the removal mechanism of ni2 which is dominated by precipitation reaction when high initial ph appears the final ph of the solution at the end of ec is alkaline no matter what the initial dissolved oxygen was however it is important that more nife ldhs formed during in situ ec process than ex situ process 35 comparably the removal efficiency of ni2 through ex situ adsorption is significantly higher than that of mo and f the removal of ni2 is not dependent on the structure of the flocs ni2 can be adsorbed effectively by typical flocs in both in situ and ex situ process in practice flocs produced during ec process are the dominant adsorbent and play a leading role in the removal of pollutants during ec however because of factors such as floatation these flocs are wasted this section shows that grs produced in fe ec system had a greater adsorption efficiency than magnetite and feooh for both ex situ and in situ on this basis in situ adsorption is superior to ex situ adsorption for several reasons firstly in fe ec system the adsorption of flocs was dominant however subsequent operations on the flocs damaged their structures besides the flocs represented by grs have a unique intercalated structure similar to that of hydrotalcite which enables fluoride ions for example to enter the intercalation layer this phenomenon was more likely to occur during in situ adsorption nevertheless the present study found that the removal efficiency of heavy metals and organic matter by ex situ adsorption was also considerable the high ex situ ni2 removal efficiency reported in this work means flocs generated under precise control could be potential and effective in ex situ wastewater treatment conditions especially when the conductivity of the system is low ex situ adsorption is expected to significantly reduce energy consumption still more works are required to elucidate the real life industrial viability and applications of ex situ adsorption since the easy precipitation of ni2 in alkaline solution could interfere with the evaluation of the removal efficiency by flocs adsorption mo was selected to the ex situ adsorption characteristics study in the following part 3 3 the effect of flocs ageing time on ex situ adsorption the conclusion that can be drawn from in section 3 2 is that that fe4o3 feooh and grs are effective during ex situ adsorption in the view of the relationship between flocs structure and its adsorption capacity the evolution of flocs structure during long term ex situ adsorption still needs to be further explored as such the effect of ageing on the structure and adsorption capacity of flocs is studied in this section the three typical flocs generated under precise control were kept at their initial do and aged at room temperature for several hours before performing ex situ adsorption experiments as can be seen from fig 5a grs protected in nitrogen atmosphere slowly changed from light green to greyish brown as the ageing time increased magnetite gradually agglomerated from fluffy dark flocs when originally formed into small particles suspended in the solution after 12 h some degree of agglomeration also occurred with goethite which dispersed in solution with bright orange color unlike fe4o3 and feooh grs underwent some structure transformation during ageing the xrd patterns of grs with different ageing time ranging from 0 to 12 h are displayed in fig 5b the direct vacuum dried flocs samples without ageing eventually transformed into a mixture the xrd pattern of this sample gr aged 0 h displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with low intensities at 19 02 32 22 and 33 93 by visual comparison with the xrd spectra of sulfate gr in the literature 21 those are speculated to be the partial structure of grs preserved fragile grs tends to show peaks in the low angle region unfortunately the standard spectrum of gr was not found the xrd pattern of precipitates aged 3 h displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with high intensity at about 30 08 35 40 57 15 and 63 53 indicating fe3o4 phases with increased crystallinity were formed in the xrd pattern of aged 12 h sample the characteristic peaks of magnetite get stronger suggesting that a greater amount of pure magnetite was transformed from gr grs as highly reactive intermediate maintained a fairly significant advantage for mo removal when properly stored in a nitrogen atmosphere although its color changed to some extent after 12 h of ageing the adsorption capacity of grs on mo was even higher than when it was first generated fig 5c there are two possible reasons for this firstly under the protection of the nitrogen atmosphere the dissolved oxygen of the solution was effectively controlled and most of the grs still maintained the desired laminar ldhs structure with only a small fraction transformed to fe3o4 secondly as an intermediate part of the grs transformed to other flocs with adsorption activity and the increase in the overall flocs content in the system compensated for the oxidation of a small part of the grs hence grs were still excellent for the removal of mo after 12 h of ageing fe3o4 is moderately efficient in removing mo but over time its agglomeration greatly increased and quickly altered from porous flocs to relatively dense particles that implies the loss of a large number of surface hydroxyl groups and active adsorption sites resulting in the removal of mo decreasing significantly to 16 35 after 12 h of ageing between the three types of flocs feooh has the weakest adsorption performance that can be attributed to the pore capacity and pore size of feooh which are too large to trap pollutants as the ageing time increasing the feooh originally dispersed and agglomerated gradually the loss of surface hydroxyl groups made the adsorption capacity lower and lower eventually dropping to 10 96 after 12 h of ageing in conclusion a relatively long ageing time has very limited influence on the superior adsorption performance of grs protected in nitrogen atmosphere the growth behavior of grs as an active intermediate was evident with longer ageing time and its specific surface area increased accordingly therefore mo removal efficiency by grs increased visibly with ageing time fe3o4 and feooh on the contrary underwent a certain degree of agglomeration in their flocs structure with the ageing time the agglomeration made the specific surface area of fe3o4 and feooh lower and the adsorption performance weaker thus the removal efficiency of mo by fe3o4 and feooh was reduced with the ageing time 3 4 the effect of flocs structural transformation on ex situ adsorption the fragile structure of grs is reported to exhibit tremendous sensitivity to dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte 13 accordingly we examined the structural transition of flocs in nitrogen air and oxygen atmosphere to ascertained the difference in adsorption capacity before and after the structure transformation of grs a conducive atmosphere was delivered by exposing grs to n2 100 ml min air 100 ml min and o2 100 ml min in a circuit break the dissolved oxygen in the system was kept low when n2 was continuously introduced maintained at a moderate level after air exposure or promoted to a fairly high level when o2 introduced the morphology of grs exposed to air is shown in fig 6a indicating a large pile of lamellar flakes with particle size 100 200 nm fig 6b shows that the grs exposed to oxygen finally formed scale like sediments compared with fig 6a the particle sizes of the flaky sediments in fig 6b are 2 3 times larger averaging around 200 300 nm therefore it can be inferred that the specific surface area of the flocs in oxygen atmosphere got lower fig 6c shows fe4o3 nps which are irregularly shaped spheres while goethite with needle like crystal morphology is shown in fig 6d compared with the precipitate in fig 6c and d the lamellar flakes in fig 6a and scale like substance in fig 6b can be presumed to have higher specific surface areas the xrd of grs precipitates treated under different atmosphere are showed in fig 6e the spectra of sample without treatment displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with low intensity at about 19 02 32 22 and 33 93 weak characteristic peaks of fe3o4 are also identified indicating that the grs sample kept in nitrogen atmosphere direct vacuum dried transformed into a mixture of fe3o4 and stuff the xrd pattern of the grs exposed to air displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with proportionally high intensity suggesting the grs final conversion to relatively pure fe3o4 that is supported by the photographs in fig 6f in which the light green flocs turned gray black under air exposure in combination with sem it can be concluded that the precipitates transformed from grs under air exposure have better morphology than directly obtained fe3o4 the xrd spectra of grs exposed to oxygen shows observable characteristic peaks of fe3o4 strong peaks and α feooh weak peaks at about 21 2 and 36 0 that is consistent with the color change shown in fig 6f in which the light green flocs turned brown red with a high do since the ratio of fe ii to fe iii in the already generated flocs was fixed part of the fe ii was encapsulated inside the sub stable flocs structure which made it difficult to be exposed to dissolved oxygen in solutions therefore it is almost impossible that the grs flocs completely transform to pure α feooh it is surprising that while the structure of grs are difficult to preserve properly the pathway of its transformation to other iron species is still meaningful in itself in order to understand the influence of structural transformation of grs on their adsorption capacity ex situ adsorption desorption studies of mo were performed mo as the target pollutant was cast into the generated grs for 10 min of ex situ adsorption under nitrogen atmosphere immediately afterwards immediately afterwards the different atmospheres were delivered by air 100 ml min and o2 100 ml min for 35 min due to the rise in dissolved oxygen in solution the fragile structure of grs transformed to fe3o4 α feooh and so on fig 7a shows that structure transformation of flocs brought about a dramatic change in mo removal efficiency the removal efficiency of mo by pure grs under nitrogen atmosphere was very satisfactory within 10 min air or o2 was introduced into the solution at the tenth minute after the addition of pollutants in other words the tenth minute was the structure transformation point the green curve displays the superior adsorption capacity of pure grs protected in nitrogen atmosphere showing that mo was absorbed as time goes on with 93 05 mo removal after 45 min again the high absorption of mo can be attributed to unique interlayer structure of grs the blue curve shows that the adsorption capacity of flocs reduced with air exposure the removal efficiency dropping from 75 2 10 min to 63 2 45 min combined with fig 6 the flocs underwent a structure transformation from grs to fe3o4 because of air exposure and evolved into a flaky morphology with a lower specific surface area finally the orange curve represents the change of mo removal efficiency by grs flocs under oxygen atmosphere mo underwent a massive desorption in the last 35 min with the removal efficiency dropping from 77 8 10 min to 50 2 45 min the desorption of mo in oxygen atmosphere could be attributed to the structure transformation and morphological change it is presumed that the flocs transformed from grs in oxygen atmosphere have lower specific surface area than pure grs and grs exposed in air that leads to a sharp reduction of mo removal efficiency the ftir spectrogram of precipitates after structure transformation and ex situ adsorption is shown in fig 7b all the precipitation samples show a peak at 629 cm 1 which is caused by the vibration of feo indicating that the deposits are composed of fe3o4 a broad peak at 3420 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the oh group the peaks at 1400 cm 1 and 1642 cm 1 are identified as the bending vibrations of water molecules and oh respectively the peak at 1267 cm 1 is classified as an asymmetric stretching vibration of feohfe the peak at 1101 cm 1 is ascribed to the so stretching band of so4 2 it is worth noting that all the precipitates after adsorption display peaks at 2938 cm 1 and 2851 cm 1 which are identified as stretching vibration of ch in methyl groups 36 the peak intensity here can be used to illustrate the mo content in the samples fig s2 the peak strength of pure mo sample is the most obvious although the peaks in the other samples are also distinctive the highest residual mo content is found in precipitate that was protected in nitrogen atmosphere for 5 min of adsorption the peaks of ch stretching vibration get weaker with increasing adsorption time this could possibly indicate that a minor structural damage occurred to grs in nitrogen atmosphere for a period of time reducing the amount of mo remaining in the flocs to add to that the methyl and methylene peaks of precipitate generated in oxygen atmosphere are insignificant and barely visible suggesting a very low mo content the transformation of the flocs structure in varying do is captivating when grs was protected in nitrogen atmosphere its intercalation structure remained intact and adsorption performance was promising under air exposure grs started to transform to fe3o4 and the pollutants adsorbed in the interlayer were released when grs was placed in oxygen atmosphere its structure transformed to fe3o4 and α feooh rapidly the interlayer structure was destroyed and most of the adsorbed pollutants were released in response to this grs generated during ec process could be used for in situ adsorption of high value added substance such as li then the recovery of high value added substance could be achieved by the precise controlled flocs structure transformation in an open circuit 4 conclusions in this work the in situ and ex situ adsorption of pollutants by flocs generated by ec process were designed to

12668,electrocoagulation ec is considered to be a highly efficient and environment friendly water treatment technology the adsorption of flocs generated in situ contributes to the pollutant removal the iron flocs with various structures green rusts grs fe3o4 feooh are generated during in situ ec process with fe electrode however there is a lack of researches on the impact of flocs structures on pollutant adsorption as is well known the unsaturated adsorbent flocs are usually scraped out of the ec reactor as solid waste it has therefore become necessary to study the adsorption characteristics of the flocs both during and after the ec process in this work the in situ direct treatment of wastewater by ec and ex situ removal of pollutants in wastewater by dosing flocs produced by ec process adsorption were designed to investigate the flocs adsorption during and after ec process respectively flocs with different structure was generated by precise control of ec process for in situ and ex situ adsorption the pollutant removal by flocs during in situ adsorption was found to be higher than that of ex situ adsorption meanwhile grs outperformed fe3o4 and feooh especially during ex situ adsorption the ageing resistance of grs appeared to be superior to that of fe3o4 and feooh the structural transformation of flocs during ex situ adsorption showed that the evolution from grs to fe3o4 and feooh resulted in the change of morphology and adsorption capacity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocoagulation flocs adsorption green rusts magnetite data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction it has been well established that electrocoagulation ec is an eco friendly technology for wastewater treatment during ec process contaminants are mainly removed by flocs adsorption ligand adsorption surface complexation reactions co precipitation and so on 1 2 electro generated metal ions fe2 or al3 in ec solution undergo spontaneous hydrolysis reactions to form hydroxide flocs 3 4 these flocs play a key role in ec process taking advantage of the high specific surface area and high density of surface hydroxyl groups in addition a minimal amount of radical such as hydroxyl radical oh is generated during ec process which contributes to the elimination of limited amounts of pollutants by advanced oxidation 5 however the full potential of fe ec has not yet been realized because of limited research in regards to the formation of highly complex fe flocs and their ability to remove different pollutants fe ii released from sacrificial anodes are precursors for the formation of various iron oxy hydroxide flocs such as green rusts grs goethite α feooh lepidocrocite γ feooh hematite magnetite fe3o4 and ferric oxide fe2o3 under different conditions 2 6 8 the complexity of fe flocs means that different environments or conditions generate various fe flocs with key attributes fe flocs exhibit various crystal structural arrangements fig 1 contributing unique characteristics applications and different adsorption mechanisms towards pollutants for example while anaerobic conditions result in grs ferric oxy hydroxides are produced under aerobic conditions 9 fe3o4 is also generated under conditions of low dissolved oxygen do when carbonate and or sulfate are absent 9 10 other factors such as ph 6 8 11 14 of the solution current partition 11 12 15 co existing ions in solution 16 20 etc influence the structure of flocs and or performance of fe ec as well these results shed light on the importance of applying an appropriate ratio of o2 fe ii for in situ ec treatments fe flocs exhibit various crystal structural arrangements fig 1 contributing to unique characteristics applications and different adsorption mechanisms towards pollutants grs are layered double hydroxides ldhs characterized by positively charged fe oh 6 octahedral sheets and interlayers of anions monovalent anions oxygenated anions organic anions and surfactants and water molecules 13 21 22 the remarkable adsorption capacity of fe ii iii hydroxy gr can be considered to be closely related to its unique intercalated structure amphoteric surface hydroxyl groups and highly redox active fe ii fraction causing localized reductions 23 or a pseudo fenton process 24 as such grs have remarkable ability to eliminate smaller organics and negatively charged pollutants fe3o4 has a lower surface area than grs because of its compact octahedral nature resulting in less adsorption sites and lower charge density 24 ec generated fe3o4 has proven to be highly effective in removing arsenic because of partial arsenic incorporation near the particle surface 25 goethite α feooh presents a typical orthorhombic structure and thermodynamic stability at ambient temperature which has been widely applied as an important sorbent of soluble pollutants due to its relatively high surface area and surface hydroxyl 26 27 in particular it is worth mentioning that ga iii was reported to adsorb strongly to fe equivalent sites at the α feooh surface 28 it can be seen that the adsorption characteristics of the above flocs are quite different due to their different structures besides the structure of grs is extremely unstable and easily oxidized inevitably transforming into fe3o4 α feooh etc tong et al that a well controlled artificial oxidative precipitation of fe ii changing fe flocs from carbonate grs to lepidocrocite resulted in a subsequent oxidation and uptake of aqueous arsenic as as a remediation strategy for total as in groundwater 29 this research reveals the significance of flocs structural transformation presently despite the potential for fe ec for large scale wastewater treatment there are still some research gaps with respect to fe ec flocs utilization due to the difficulty of their real time in situ identification the adsorption mechanism of in situ generated functional fe flocs grs fe3o4 feooh etc and comparison of their adsorption capacity has been largely ignored by researchers although a few quantitative studies on the structural transformation of flocs during ec exist 10 the effect of flocs structure transformation on pollutant adsorption capacity warrants adequate attention as such the adsorption characteristics of grs fe3o4 and α feooh of ec process need to be clarified in the real fe ec system the oxygen evolution reaction oer occurring at the anode produces activated oxygen and strong oxidizing substances such as oh which could oxidize the flocs and induce the structural transformation of flocs furthermore the hydrogen evolution reaction her occurring at the cathode could release hydrogen bubbles into the electrolytic channel the h2 bubbles are absorbed by the loose and porous flocs that results in the floatation of unsaturated flocs which are then scraped off as solid waste and shortens the contact residence time between flocs and pollutants leading to poor adsorption efficiency thus the utilization rate of electro generated flocs is much lower in another respect low concentration wastewater and organic wastewater produced in actual industry usually contains less carrier content and has low conductivity thus traditional ec process brings on high energy consumption due to the high ohmic drop that is serious obstacle for ec to be used in some different situations 30 therefore it is necessary to explore both the in situ and ex situ adsorption characteristic of electrochemical generated flocs to support the reuse of post adsorption flocs and ex situ adsorption of low conductivity wastewater theoretically in this work an in situ ex situ ec process was designed to address the above mentioned research gaps fig 2 in order to avoid the effect of reactive oxygen ph variation and strong oxidizing agents generated during ec the typical iron flocs grs fe3o4 and α feooh were generated under precise control sodium sulfate solution as electrolyte the in situ adsorption and ex situ adsorption were then carried out to analyze the characteristic difference between them respectively to which mo ni2 and f were chosen however the flocs agglomerates and the structure of flocs changes during the long time of ex situ adsorption the structure of grs with superior intercalation damage especially to broaden the application scenarios of ex situ adsorption the ageing resistance of functional fe flocs was investigated furthermore the influence of flocs structural transformation on its morphology and adsorption capacity was examined in detail consequently this paper gives a deep understanding on the structural characteristics adsorption capacity and structural transformation behavior of different flocs produced by fe ec this study is expected to provide new schemes for the reuse of unsaturated flocs after traditional ec and the treatment of low conductivity wastewater by electrocoagulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were analytical grade ar all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm the target pollutants used were mo methyl orange ni2 niso4 6h2o and f naf the concentration of mo wastewater was 50 mg l while that of ni2 and f were 100 mg l sodium sulfate na2so4 0 1 m was used as the electrolyte solution in all experiments the ph values were adjusted by naoh 0 5 m and hcl 20 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure the experimental devices were shown in fig s1 the cuboid ec reactor was self designed and was made of pyrex glass with dimensions of 5 6 cm 2 3 cm 14 cm fe purity 99 98 electrodes 12 6 cm 0 46 cm 0 02 cm with effective surface area 50 cm2 were placed in the reactor as anode and cathode with a 10 mm gap between them prior to all experiments the electrode plates were polished with sand paper immersed in diluted hcl solution 5 wt for 20 min and rinsed three times with ultrapure water 2 2 1 scenario one controlled generation of flocs for in situ adsorption the initial ph and do were adjusted at the beginning for a controlled generation of flocs do was adjusted by n2 gas purity 99 99 air and o2 gas 80 the above gases were introduced into the system about 100 ml min from the gas inlet at the cell bottom through the gas pump and the system was seal with plastic film the ph values were adjusted by naoh 0 5 m and hcl 20 target pollutants mo niso4 6h2o and naf were dissolved in 60 ml electrolyte solution respectively the reactor was sealed during the ec process for controlled flocs generation and simultaneous in situ adsorption a constant current density of 20 a m2 was maintained for 30 min on the fe electrodes by a direct current power supply gps 3303c china 2 2 2 scenario two controlled generation of flocs for ex situ adsorption the initial ph and do were adjusted at the beginning for a controlled generation of flocs consistent with the scenario one 60 ml pure electrolyte solution were added to the electrochemical reactor to produce active adsorption flocs a constant current density of 20 a m2 was maintained for 30 min to produce flocs with typical structure under precise control then the electrodes and wires were removed and the target pollutants were dosed immediately for ex situ adsorption in order to prevent oxidation and deterioration of flocs solid pollutants were put into the suspension containing the flocs instead of filtering flocs into a simulated wastewater the whole process of ex situ adsorption was sealed with plastic wrap the initial content of pollutants during ex situ adsorption remained consistent with in situ adsorption 2 3 measurements and characterization the ph value was measured with ph meter rex electric chemical phs 3c china the do value was monitored with dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach pure electrolyte solution without pollutant was used for experiments conducted in section 3 1 model wastewater was prepared for studies conducted in sections 3 2 and 3 3 results from three parallel experiments were used to obtain the error bars after the ec treatment the sample was filtered by a vacuum filter shb iii china and aqueous phase micro filtration membrane 0 22 μm 50 mm to collect the flocs then the flocs collected were dried at 110 c in a vacuum drying oven dzf china x ray diffraction xrd 6000 japan was used to characterize the flocs the powder samples were analyzed by sem zeiss germany and ftir thermo fisher america the removal efficiency of mo and ni2 was measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3010 japan fluoride concentration was measured by the ionometric standard method 3 results and discussion 3 1 controlled generation of adsorptive flocs with typical structures during the ec process the formation of flocs is determined to a great extent by the do dissolved oxygen content aerobic and or anaerobic conditions of the electrolyte resulting in differing flocs structures in this work do was adjusted by controlling the flow rate of n2 air or o2 in ec process the xrd diagrams of flocs with typical structures generated under precise control of do are shown in fig 3 from fig 3 the speciation conditions of the fe flocs with various structures can be identified the xrd patterns of flocs generated at diverse do conditions show that at do 16 20 mg l magnetite was formed while a mixture of goethite hematite and magnetite were the main flocs components when do exceeded 22 mg l as illustrated in fig 3a the xrd patterns of the samples generated under lower do display narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with high intensity indicating the increased crystallinity of the magnetite phases the characteristic peaks of samples generated in lower do are stronger showing that a greater amount of pure magnetite was obtained at critical range of do magnetite and or goethite hematite and magnetite were obtained at aerobic conditions do 22 mg l goethite and hematite were the main flocs component fig 3b stronger characteristic peaks of goethite can be observed while the peaks of hematite are weaker the results are consistent with the previously reported observations of dubrawski et al and xu et al 9 10 as can be seen from fig 3c the xrd pattern with do 16 mg l shows a peak at 582 cm 1 which can be attributed to the vibration of feo indicating that the flocs were composed by fe3o4 a broad peak between 3200 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 is attributable to the stretching vibration of the oh group the peaks at 1430 cm 1 and 1624 cm 1 are identified as the bending vibrations of water molecules and oh respectively the peak at 1267 cm 1 is classified as an asymmetric stretching vibration of feohfe the peak at 1114 cm 1 is ascribed to the so stretching band of so4 2 therefore the generation of different kinds of flocs by ec could be achieved by regulating do do played a dominant role in the formation of flocs structure when do 12 mg l flocs were mainly composed of grs and oxidized in air at a visible rate at 12 mg l do 16 mg l grs and fe3o4 were main flocs components when do 16 20 mg l magnetite was formed but do exceeded 22 mg l a mixture of goethite hematite and magnetite was the main flocs component when do 25 mg l goethite was the dominant component of flocs however it should be emphasized that the flocs samples generated at do 16 mg l were extremely difficult to extract and characterize by conventional xrd and ft ir 3 2 the in situ and ex situ adsorption capacity of flocs for pollutants grs fe3o4 and α feooh are proven to be produced in fe ec process by controlling the dissolved oxygen precisely in section 3 1 in order to elucidate the adsorption characteristic of flocs in in situ process three target pollutants was investigated in this section as mentioned in introduction a large amount of flocs is wasted to floatation caused by h2 released at the cathode in order to improve the utilization of flocs the ex situ adsorption performance of typical flocs was also investigated in this section the adsorption characteristics of flocs in our ex situ case as obtained in this study could therefore serve as a guide for further research on industrial ex situ wastewater treatment processes the mo removal efficiency of flocs with do variation is illustrated in fig 4a for both in situ and ex situ scenario the residual concentrations of mo were the lowest at do 4 mg l this phenomenon is ascribed to the superior adsorption ability of grs since grs consist of fe ii fe iii hydroxide layers with large surface areas and high anion exchange capacity 9 24 although magnetite is also made up of fe ii fe iii hydroxides it has lower surface area than grs due to compact octahedral structure 24 therefore the adsorption and removal ability of mo is best suited to grs it can be seen from fig 4a that the mo removal efficiency decreased continually with the increment of do that implies the removal efficiency under anaerobic condition was significantly better than that under aerobic condition a further increase in do adversely influenced mo removal under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions for both in situ and ex situ adsorption it can be clearly seen that in situ removal efficiency was better than ex situ adsorption compared to ex situ adsorption the adsorption efficiency of in situ flocs was about 10 15 better it is noteworthy that ex situ removal efficiency was only a bit lower than in situ removal efficiency especially when the flocs was mainly composed of grs it could be suggested that the flocs adsorption played a major role in the process of mo removal from this point of view ex situ adsorption is valid for mo removal compared with fe3o4 and feooh which were generated at higher do grs exhibits excellent ex situ adsorption performance in mo removal in terms of affinity for fe flocs f was weaker than mo from fig 4b f removal efficiency through ex situ adsorption was much lower than in situ adsorption thus increasing do from 4 to 28 mg l failed to achieve a better removal efficiency indicating that the removal efficiency was highest at anaerobic conditions even though grs has strong adsorption capacity of contaminants the ex situ removal efficiency by grs was only 15 74 the removal efficiency was around 11 99 and 7 84 for flocs with the composition of fe3o4 and α feooh respectively these results are in stark contrast to ex situ removal of mo discussed above conclusively the removal of f cannot be realized through ex situ adsorption the reason of low removal efficiency can be explained by the size of fluoride ions the pore volume of active adsorption flocs may be too large for fluorine ions whose trapping effect was limited regardless of in situ or ex situ adsorption the removal efficiency of f by flocs was inherently lower than that of mo because of the larger size of organic compounds compared to f the f removal has been confirmed to be ion exchange between fluoride ions and the hydroxyl groups on the fe flocs surface 31 the ex situ removal efficiency was also much lower than in situ removal efficiency which could be attributed to spatial effects as such flocs are less able to capture f than larger sized pollutants during ex situ adsorption process in other words smaller sized pollutants such as f are less likely to enter the adsorption site of grs or fe3o4 or α feooh what s more the intercalations of grs are more suited to trap pollutants with larger size although ex situ removal efficiency was unsatisfactory the elimination of fluoride ions by grs is still the best which is attributable to the intercalated structure characteristics of grs such that f combines with fe ii and fe iii to generate gr f therefore the in situ removal efficiency being much higher than ex situ removal efficiency is due to the fact that fe flocs combined with f to form various hydroxide complexes and co precipitates during in situ ec process 32 33 different from f and mo the overall removal efficiency of ni by fe flocs is ideal fig 4c shows that the removal efficiency of ni2 decreased slightly with the increment of do under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions the removal efficiencies of ni2 were almost up to 90 there is little difference in the ni2 removal effects under the two removal scenarios the removal efficiency of ni2 was the best when the flocs were mainly composed of grs followed by fe3o4 and the α feooh indicating that grs had the largest adsorption capacity for ni2 this also can be ascribed to the structure of grs being similar to the layered bimetallic hydroxide and the unique layered structure being more conducive to the adsorption of pollutants additionally although fe3o4 is a mixed valent iron oxide similar to grs in composition its specific surface area is lower than that of grs hence its adsorption capacity of pollutants is lower than grs the ec removal mechanism of heavy metals is also largely attributed to complexation reactions sweep coagulation and co precipitation 16 ni ii fe ii exchange also occured at the edges of the grs particles resulting in ni ii replacement in the grs lattice during adsorption to form ni ii fe ii fe iii ldh with higher stability than grs 34 ni2 also precipitated with oh generated at the cathode during in situ adsorption process the removal efficiency of ni2 is high under alkaline conditions suggesting that precipitation reaction played a role it can be seen from fig 4c that the removal efficiency of ni2 through ex situ adsorption was lower than that through in situ adsorption this is owed to the removal mechanism of ni2 which is dominated by precipitation reaction when high initial ph appears the final ph of the solution at the end of ec is alkaline no matter what the initial dissolved oxygen was however it is important that more nife ldhs formed during in situ ec process than ex situ process 35 comparably the removal efficiency of ni2 through ex situ adsorption is significantly higher than that of mo and f the removal of ni2 is not dependent on the structure of the flocs ni2 can be adsorbed effectively by typical flocs in both in situ and ex situ process in practice flocs produced during ec process are the dominant adsorbent and play a leading role in the removal of pollutants during ec however because of factors such as floatation these flocs are wasted this section shows that grs produced in fe ec system had a greater adsorption efficiency than magnetite and feooh for both ex situ and in situ on this basis in situ adsorption is superior to ex situ adsorption for several reasons firstly in fe ec system the adsorption of flocs was dominant however subsequent operations on the flocs damaged their structures besides the flocs represented by grs have a unique intercalated structure similar to that of hydrotalcite which enables fluoride ions for example to enter the intercalation layer this phenomenon was more likely to occur during in situ adsorption nevertheless the present study found that the removal efficiency of heavy metals and organic matter by ex situ adsorption was also considerable the high ex situ ni2 removal efficiency reported in this work means flocs generated under precise control could be potential and effective in ex situ wastewater treatment conditions especially when the conductivity of the system is low ex situ adsorption is expected to significantly reduce energy consumption still more works are required to elucidate the real life industrial viability and applications of ex situ adsorption since the easy precipitation of ni2 in alkaline solution could interfere with the evaluation of the removal efficiency by flocs adsorption mo was selected to the ex situ adsorption characteristics study in the following part 3 3 the effect of flocs ageing time on ex situ adsorption the conclusion that can be drawn from in section 3 2 is that that fe4o3 feooh and grs are effective during ex situ adsorption in the view of the relationship between flocs structure and its adsorption capacity the evolution of flocs structure during long term ex situ adsorption still needs to be further explored as such the effect of ageing on the structure and adsorption capacity of flocs is studied in this section the three typical flocs generated under precise control were kept at their initial do and aged at room temperature for several hours before performing ex situ adsorption experiments as can be seen from fig 5a grs protected in nitrogen atmosphere slowly changed from light green to greyish brown as the ageing time increased magnetite gradually agglomerated from fluffy dark flocs when originally formed into small particles suspended in the solution after 12 h some degree of agglomeration also occurred with goethite which dispersed in solution with bright orange color unlike fe4o3 and feooh grs underwent some structure transformation during ageing the xrd patterns of grs with different ageing time ranging from 0 to 12 h are displayed in fig 5b the direct vacuum dried flocs samples without ageing eventually transformed into a mixture the xrd pattern of this sample gr aged 0 h displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with low intensities at 19 02 32 22 and 33 93 by visual comparison with the xrd spectra of sulfate gr in the literature 21 those are speculated to be the partial structure of grs preserved fragile grs tends to show peaks in the low angle region unfortunately the standard spectrum of gr was not found the xrd pattern of precipitates aged 3 h displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with high intensity at about 30 08 35 40 57 15 and 63 53 indicating fe3o4 phases with increased crystallinity were formed in the xrd pattern of aged 12 h sample the characteristic peaks of magnetite get stronger suggesting that a greater amount of pure magnetite was transformed from gr grs as highly reactive intermediate maintained a fairly significant advantage for mo removal when properly stored in a nitrogen atmosphere although its color changed to some extent after 12 h of ageing the adsorption capacity of grs on mo was even higher than when it was first generated fig 5c there are two possible reasons for this firstly under the protection of the nitrogen atmosphere the dissolved oxygen of the solution was effectively controlled and most of the grs still maintained the desired laminar ldhs structure with only a small fraction transformed to fe3o4 secondly as an intermediate part of the grs transformed to other flocs with adsorption activity and the increase in the overall flocs content in the system compensated for the oxidation of a small part of the grs hence grs were still excellent for the removal of mo after 12 h of ageing fe3o4 is moderately efficient in removing mo but over time its agglomeration greatly increased and quickly altered from porous flocs to relatively dense particles that implies the loss of a large number of surface hydroxyl groups and active adsorption sites resulting in the removal of mo decreasing significantly to 16 35 after 12 h of ageing between the three types of flocs feooh has the weakest adsorption performance that can be attributed to the pore capacity and pore size of feooh which are too large to trap pollutants as the ageing time increasing the feooh originally dispersed and agglomerated gradually the loss of surface hydroxyl groups made the adsorption capacity lower and lower eventually dropping to 10 96 after 12 h of ageing in conclusion a relatively long ageing time has very limited influence on the superior adsorption performance of grs protected in nitrogen atmosphere the growth behavior of grs as an active intermediate was evident with longer ageing time and its specific surface area increased accordingly therefore mo removal efficiency by grs increased visibly with ageing time fe3o4 and feooh on the contrary underwent a certain degree of agglomeration in their flocs structure with the ageing time the agglomeration made the specific surface area of fe3o4 and feooh lower and the adsorption performance weaker thus the removal efficiency of mo by fe3o4 and feooh was reduced with the ageing time 3 4 the effect of flocs structural transformation on ex situ adsorption the fragile structure of grs is reported to exhibit tremendous sensitivity to dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte 13 accordingly we examined the structural transition of flocs in nitrogen air and oxygen atmosphere to ascertained the difference in adsorption capacity before and after the structure transformation of grs a conducive atmosphere was delivered by exposing grs to n2 100 ml min air 100 ml min and o2 100 ml min in a circuit break the dissolved oxygen in the system was kept low when n2 was continuously introduced maintained at a moderate level after air exposure or promoted to a fairly high level when o2 introduced the morphology of grs exposed to air is shown in fig 6a indicating a large pile of lamellar flakes with particle size 100 200 nm fig 6b shows that the grs exposed to oxygen finally formed scale like sediments compared with fig 6a the particle sizes of the flaky sediments in fig 6b are 2 3 times larger averaging around 200 300 nm therefore it can be inferred that the specific surface area of the flocs in oxygen atmosphere got lower fig 6c shows fe4o3 nps which are irregularly shaped spheres while goethite with needle like crystal morphology is shown in fig 6d compared with the precipitate in fig 6c and d the lamellar flakes in fig 6a and scale like substance in fig 6b can be presumed to have higher specific surface areas the xrd of grs precipitates treated under different atmosphere are showed in fig 6e the spectra of sample without treatment displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with low intensity at about 19 02 32 22 and 33 93 weak characteristic peaks of fe3o4 are also identified indicating that the grs sample kept in nitrogen atmosphere direct vacuum dried transformed into a mixture of fe3o4 and stuff the xrd pattern of the grs exposed to air displays narrow and sharp diffraction peaks with proportionally high intensity suggesting the grs final conversion to relatively pure fe3o4 that is supported by the photographs in fig 6f in which the light green flocs turned gray black under air exposure in combination with sem it can be concluded that the precipitates transformed from grs under air exposure have better morphology than directly obtained fe3o4 the xrd spectra of grs exposed to oxygen shows observable characteristic peaks of fe3o4 strong peaks and α feooh weak peaks at about 21 2 and 36 0 that is consistent with the color change shown in fig 6f in which the light green flocs turned brown red with a high do since the ratio of fe ii to fe iii in the already generated flocs was fixed part of the fe ii was encapsulated inside the sub stable flocs structure which made it difficult to be exposed to dissolved oxygen in solutions therefore it is almost impossible that the grs flocs completely transform to pure α feooh it is surprising that while the structure of grs are difficult to preserve properly the pathway of its transformation to other iron species is still meaningful in itself in order to understand the influence of structural transformation of grs on their adsorption capacity ex situ adsorption desorption studies of mo were performed mo as the target pollutant was cast into the generated grs for 10 min of ex situ adsorption under nitrogen atmosphere immediately afterwards immediately afterwards the different atmospheres were delivered by air 100 ml min and o2 100 ml min for 35 min due to the rise in dissolved oxygen in solution the fragile structure of grs transformed to fe3o4 α feooh and so on fig 7a shows that structure transformation of flocs brought about a dramatic change in mo removal efficiency the removal efficiency of mo by pure grs under nitrogen atmosphere was very satisfactory within 10 min air or o2 was introduced into the solution at the tenth minute after the addition of pollutants in other words the tenth minute was the structure transformation point the green curve displays the superior adsorption capacity of pure grs protected in nitrogen atmosphere showing that mo was absorbed as time goes on with 93 05 mo removal after 45 min again the high absorption of mo can be attributed to unique interlayer structure of grs the blue curve shows that the adsorption capacity of flocs reduced with air exposure the removal efficiency dropping from 75 2 10 min to 63 2 45 min combined with fig 6 the flocs underwent a structure transformation from grs to fe3o4 because of air exposure and evolved into a flaky morphology with a lower specific surface area finally the orange curve represents the change of mo removal efficiency by grs flocs under oxygen atmosphere mo underwent a massive desorption in the last 35 min with the removal efficiency dropping from 77 8 10 min to 50 2 45 min the desorption of mo in oxygen atmosphere could be attributed to the structure transformation and morphological change it is presumed that the flocs transformed from grs in oxygen atmosphere have lower specific surface area than pure grs and grs exposed in air that leads to a sharp reduction of mo removal efficiency the ftir spectrogram of precipitates after structure transformation and ex situ adsorption is shown in fig 7b all the precipitation samples show a peak at 629 cm 1 which is caused by the vibration of feo indicating that the deposits are composed of fe3o4 a broad peak at 3420 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the oh group the peaks at 1400 cm 1 and 1642 cm 1 are identified as the bending vibrations of water molecules and oh respectively the peak at 1267 cm 1 is classified as an asymmetric stretching vibration of feohfe the peak at 1101 cm 1 is ascribed to the so stretching band of so4 2 it is worth noting that all the precipitates after adsorption display peaks at 2938 cm 1 and 2851 cm 1 which are identified as stretching vibration of ch in methyl groups 36 the peak intensity here can be used to illustrate the mo content in the samples fig s2 the peak strength of pure mo sample is the most obvious although the peaks in the other samples are also distinctive the highest residual mo content is found in precipitate that was protected in nitrogen atmosphere for 5 min of adsorption the peaks of ch stretching vibration get weaker with increasing adsorption time this could possibly indicate that a minor structural damage occurred to grs in nitrogen atmosphere for a period of time reducing the amount of mo remaining in the flocs to add to that the methyl and methylene peaks of precipitate generated in oxygen atmosphere are insignificant and barely visible suggesting a very low mo content the transformation of the flocs structure in varying do is captivating when grs was protected in nitrogen atmosphere its intercalation structure remained intact and adsorption performance was promising under air exposure grs started to transform to fe3o4 and the pollutants adsorbed in the interlayer were released when grs was placed in oxygen atmosphere its structure transformed to fe3o4 and α feooh rapidly the interlayer structure was destroyed and most of the adsorbed pollutants were released in response to this grs generated during ec process could be used for in situ adsorption of high value added substance such as li then the recovery of high value added substance could be achieved by the precise controlled flocs structure transformation in an open circuit 4 conclusions in this work the in situ and ex situ adsorption of pollutants by flocs generated by ec process were designed to investigate the flocs adsorption during and after ec process respectively the pollutant removal by flocs in in situ adsorption was found higher than that in ex situ adsorption meanwhile grs outperformed fe3o4 then feooh especially during ex situ adsorption the ageing resistance of various flocs indicate that although the structure of grs is delicate its excellent anti ageing properties meaning grs can maintain excellent adsorption activity for a long time under the protection of nitrogen atmosphere was successfully proven finally the structural transformation of flocs during ex situ adsorption was discussed in detail the structure transformation of grs to other fe flocs was achieved by exposing different gases to the system and both the morphology and adsorption performance of the flocs changed significantly based on these observations the following perspectives on the future application of ec process is offered 1 due to the superior adsorption capacity of grs it is necessary to generate grs by precisely controlling ec process meanwhile in situ grs generated electrochemically are stable in low in low do and could favor the treatment of underground water and soil remediation 2 due to their excellent anti ageing properties and satisfactory ex situ adsorption capacity grs is expected to lower the energy consumption of ec markedly when treating the wastewater

12669,in order to overcome the disadvantages of low single treatment effect and long processing cycle of traditional hydrodynamic cavitation hc technology in organic dye degradation a by pass line orifice plate is used to assist series wound orifice plates for strengthening the hc effect in this work several series wound orifice plate hc systems with three by pass line orifice plate connection modes namely d 2 two series wound orifice plates paralleled with by pass line orifice plate d 3 series wound orifice plate 1 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate and d 4 series wound orifice plate 2 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate were designed and rhb was used to act as simulated contaminant to conduct the hc degradation experiment after 60 min treatment under the same conditions the rhb degradation ratios are 46 12 52 27 and 31 20 respectively for d 2 d 3 and d 4 and the corresponding mineralization effects are 15 68 24 78 and 9 83 respectively for d 2 d 3 and d 4 apparently d 3 gives the highest degradation ratio and the mineralization effect the addition of naclo to d 3 hc system can further enhance the rhb degradation effect which gives 1 97 synergetic index and 87 28 rhb degradation ratio in the future through continuous modification it is possible that the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc technology would be used for large scale industrial wastewater treatment graphical abstract in order to solve the problems of low single treatment effect and long processing cycle of traditional single orifice plate hc system in this study the by pass line orifice plate is adopted to assist series wound orifice plate hc system for a series wound orifice plate hc system the by pass line orifice plate can be connected in three ways for these three assisted hc systems series wound orifice plate 1 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate and orifice plate 2 d 3 can give a highest rhb degradation ratio 52 27 indicating that the use of by pass line orifice plate can efficiently enhance the rhb degradation ratio compared with 41 17 for single orifice plate hc system and 44 13 for series wound orifice plate hc system when naclo is add to the d 3 hc system after 60 min circulation the rhb hc degradation ratio reaches 87 28 at this point the treatment cost 21 119 usd m3 is the lowest compared with the treatment cost 61 526 usd m3 without naclo the corresponding treatment cost decreases by 65 67 unlabelled image keywords dye wastewater treatment series wound orifice plate hc device by pass line orifice plate assist inorganic oxidant treatment cost data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction when high speed liquid flows through the throttling devices such as orifice plate or venturi tube a large number of cavitation bubbles are formed and then the collapse of these cavitation bubbles can release a large amount of energy accompanied by high temperature 5000 10 000 k high pressure 500 1000 atm shear force and shock wave this process is known as hydrodynamic cavitation hc phenomenon 1 5 according to the characteristics of hc effects the formed hc technology can generate and intensify many physical chemical reaction processes which can be widely used in various fields including food processing 6 biodiesel production 7 flotation separation 8 water disinfection 9 and so on especially the hc technology as an emerging advanced oxidation process aop to generate reactive oxide species has been used to treat various wastewater in recent years 10 for example montalvo andia et al used orifice plate combined with h2o2 to treat highly toxic cyanide wastewater and found that 99 cyanide in the solution could be degraded within 120 min 11 filipić et al used venturi tube as hc device to treat 1 0 l water sample supplemented with purified pvy virions after 50 min hc cycle treatment the ability of the virus to infect plants disappeared at 7 0 bar inlet pressure 12 gogate and pandit et al studied the effect of acoustic cavitation and hydraulic cavitation combined advanced oxidation processes aops on cod reduction of some wastewater from common effluent treatment plant cetp the experiments clearly demonstrated that the combined hc aops offered a promise to treat wastewater in cetp 13 14 nevertheless some disadvantages of hc technology such as low single treatment effect and long treatment cycle should not be ignored many researchers are committed to solving these shortcomings through improving hc technology some studies have reported that the wastewater treatment effect can be significantly enhanced when hc is used in conjunction with other advanced oxidation technologies 15 17 gogate and pandit et al used slit venturi as a cavitation device combined with other aops to degrade acid violet 7 ac 7 dye it was found that the combination of hc and fenton oxidation was an effective method to degrade ac 7 18 however these methods still require long treatment time at the same time these combinations may alter hc original green environmental protection characteristics causing secondary pollution and additional treatment costs therefore enhancing the single treatment effect of hc equipment is the key to modify the hc technology increasing the volume of cavitation chamber and connecting multiple cavitation devices in series or parallel may be two effective methods ranade et al tried to gradually magnify the vortex hc equipment and maintain the geometric similarity the largest equipment is magnified nearly 200 times all facilities were used to treat di chloro aniline solution at 280 kpa inlet pressure however the experiment result showed that the degradation effect of contaminants gradually decreased with increasing the size of the vortex cavitator 3 sayyaadi et al used tandem venturi tubes to treat 2 chlorophenol solution and found that the degradation effect had a certain gain compared with that of using only a single venturi tube 19 according to the experimental results sayyaadi et al also thought that the tandem venturi tubes would only affect the number of cavitation events and the collapse area and not change the collapse time of cavitation bubbles and the existence time of free radicals it is probably because that their experiments were conducted at a lower inlet pressure 100 kpa in fact the better experiment results may be gotten under the hc conditions with relatively small cavitation number c v therefore in comparison the cavitation device in series is considered as an alternative pattern especially for the orifice plate with the advantages of simple fabrication and large processing capacity the better treatment results can be gained however when two orifice plates are connected in series the hole numbers match and pressure distributions between two orifice plates need to be considered in practice wang et al proposed the idea of series wound cavitators and pointed out that it was crucial to control the inlet pressure of each cavitator 20 in fact under relative low pressure the orifice plate with a small hole number in a smooth pipeline will show a strong hc effect therefore it is essential to ensure that the hc conditions of the orifice plate with a small hole number is not significantly changed at the same time other orifice plates can also obtain the necessary hc conditions in this study for two series wound orifice plates the necessary conditions of hc effect can be both obtained by adjusting the throttle valve in by pass line after the necessary hc conditions are determined the throttle valve in by pass line is replaced by orifice plate with the same effect which strengthens the hc effect of whole system bringing much better degradation effect of pollutants in this work three by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc facilities are set up the first is that the by pass line orifice plate is connected in parallel with two series wound orifice plates referred as to d 2 system second the by pass line orifice plate is connected between two series wound orifice plates in which the series orifice plate in parallel with the rear orifice plate orifice plate 1 is called d 3 system and the series orifice plate in parallel with the front orifice plate orifice plate 2 is named d 4 system rhodamine b rhb is selected as a simulated contaminant to conduct the degradation experiment the influences of pressure drop p hole number of orifice plate and connection mode of by pass line orifice plate on hc effect are examined the effects of initial concentration free radical scavenger and inorganic oxidants naclo naclo4 k2s2o8 and h2o2 on rhb degradation are also investigated the total organic carbon toc reduction of rhb solution is tested and the intermediates during hc degradation are analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms it is concluded that the wastewater treatment effect of hc technology can be effectively enhanced by using the series wound orifice plates 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials rhodamine b c28h31cln2o3 cas 81 88 9 b benzoquinone c6h4o2

diagrams are given in scheme 1 d 1 is a series wound orifice plates hc system and d 2 d 3 and d 4 are by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc systems respectively in d 2 system the water flow from pump is bifurcated and the by pass line orifice plate is parallel with two series wound orifice plates in d 3 system the water flow from orifice plate 2 is bifurcated and the by pass line orifice plate is parallel with the orifice plate 1 in d 4 system the by pass line orifice plate is parallel with the orifice plate 2 and then the water flow is converged before passing through orifice plate 1 the inlet of water pump wzb 1500a rijin pump industry japan is connected to the bottom of the storage tank through a water pipe ppr material 18 25 mm inner diameter the outlet of water pump is divided into two parts which are connected to main line and by pass line respectively for d 1 system the flowmeter 1 f1 pressure gage 1 p1 orifice plate 2 pressure gage 2 p2 orifice plate 1 and pressure gage 3 p3 are successively connected in the main line while there is only one throttle valve in the by pass line for regulating the pressure drop p and liquid flow for d 2 system the throttle valve in the by pass line of the d 1 system is replaced by an orifice plate the flowmeter 2 f2 and pressure gage 4 p4 are equipped before the by pass line orifice plate in sequence at the same time the position and number of various parts in the main line of the d 1 system are not unchanged for d 3 system the by pass line inlet of the d 2 system is connected between the two series wound orifice plates in main line and the position of various parts all remains unchanged for d 4 system the by pass line outlet of the d 2 system is connected between two series wound orifice plates in the main line and the position of various parts also all remains unchanged all parts are connected by ppr water pipe inner diameter 18 25 mm the thicknesses of all orifice plates are 4 mm and the hole diameter is 2 mm all experiments are carried out at the same temperature 40 c under the control of a cooling water circulation system 2 3 experimental procedure firstly the rhodamine b rhb degradation effect in single 3 hole orifice plate hc system is investigated where the operation condition is 10 mg l initial rhb concentration p 2 0 5 0 bar ph 7 and 5 0 l total volume then the d 1 system is used to study the influence of hole number of orifice plate 2 on the degradation effect finally the influence of the connection mode of by pass line on the degradation effect is explored and the geometry parameter hole number of by pass line orifice plate is optimized in addition the effect of initial concentration 5 15 mg l is also investigated and free radical scavenger is added to identify the active substances generated in the hc degradation process at the same time four inorganic oxidants including naclo naclo4 k2s2o8 and h2o2 are added appropriately to further enhance the rhb hc degradation effect respectively 2 4 analysis method 10 ml rhb solution is taken out from storage tank every 15 min interval and the absorbance is measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer insea l5s wuhan noride technology company china the rhb concentration in the solution is calculated according to the standard curve the mineralization degrees of rhb solution after 60 min treatment in d 1 d 2 and d 3 systems are measured by total organic carbon toc analyzer toc 3000 shanghai yuanxi company china the generated intermediate products during the rhb hc degradation are determined by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 1290 infinity 6460 uhplc ms agilent america the used chromatographic column is c18 4 6 50 mm 3 5 μm the mobile phase is divided into a and b a is 0 1 formic acid aqueous solution and b is acetonitrile 6the experiments are repeated three times to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pressure drop p on rhb hc degradation and cavitation number c v solution pressure drop p is one of the important factors affecting hc effect intensity which decides the degradation effect of organic pollutants 20 in general the hc effect intensity can be described using a dimensionless parameter cavitation number c v the specific calculation formulas of cavitation number c v are as follows 1 c v p 2 p v p 1 p 2 2 c v p 2 p v 0 5 ρ v 2 p 1 is the inlet pressure of the solution p 2 is the recovery pressure of the downstream solution of the cavitator and p v is the saturated vapor pressure at the solution temperature in general when c v is equal to or 1 0 hc phenomenon begins to occur for above equations eq 1 focuses on the influence of pressure change and eq 2 focuses on liquid flow velocity a small cavitation number indicates a strong hc effect it was once reported that hc phenomenon could also occur for c v 1 0 but there is a small amount of dissolved gas and suspended particles in the solution 21 22 in this study the effect of pressure drop p on rhb hc degradation is investigated by using a 3 hole orifice plate within p 2 0 5 0 bar under other fixed conditions 10 mg l initial concentration 40 c solution temperature ph 7 00 and 5 0 l total volume the variation trends of rhb degradation ratios are given in fig 1 a it can be seen that under different pressure drops the rhb degradation ratios all keep rising over time but the rising trends depend on the pressure drops the order of rhb degradation ratios is 3 0 bar 4 0 bar 5 0 bar 2 0 bar when the pressure drop increases from 2 0 bar to 3 0 bar after 15 min circulation the rhb degradation ratio increases significantly at 60 min the rhb degradation ratio increases from 26 85 to 41 17 when the pressure drop continues to increase to 4 0 bar the rhb degradation efficiency shows a decreasing trend compared with p 3 0 bar and the degradation ratio is 34 25 when the pressure drop is further increased to 5 0 bar the rhb hc degradation continues to decrease and the rhb degradation ratio is only 27 64 for 60 min accordingly it can be seen from fig 1 b that with the increase of pressure drop the c v gradually decreases the corresponding c v are 0 464 0 309 0 232 and 0 185 respectively indicating that the hc intensity gets stronger and stronger however for c v 0 309 the best rhb degradation effect is gotten showing that the degradation effect of organic pollutants is not directly proportional to the hc intensity this is because the hc degradation effect of organic pollutants is affected by many factors generally speaking with the increasing of pressure drop hc intensity gradually increases and the number of free radicals generated by hc effect also increases which should bring a good rhb hc degradation effect 23 24 in fact the increase of pressure drop not only enhances the hc intensity but also accelerates the liquid flow velocity and increases the circulation number of organic pollutant wastewater per unit time 17 the increased hc strength results in the formation of a large number of cavitation bubbles however the excessively fast flow velocity will increase the collision probability of cavitation bubbles with each other so that large amounts of cavitation bubbles will fuse to form cavitation clouds 22 the formation of cavitation cloud will reduce the number of cavitation bubbles 17 therefore even for strong hc effect the energy released by cavitation bubble collapse is reduced thus going against the production of free radicals and leading to the decrease of rhb degradation effect 25 as a result p 2 0 5 0 bar is the optimal pressure for the 3 hole orifice plate to obtain a fine hc degradation effect 3 2 effect of hole number of orifice plate 2 in series wound orifice plate on rhb hc degradation the dye degradation ratio may be enhanced due to multiple hc effects produced by the series wound orifice plates wang et al designed a pipeline with six stage series wound orifice plates and optimized the geometric dimensions and layout of orifice plates at all levels 26 the experimental results show that the influence of pressure drop on hc effect can be obviously enhanced by reducing the orifice diameter of first or sixth orifice plate the cavitation phenomenon happens easily in the orifice plate with the highest pressure drop therefore for wastewater treatment the use of multistage series wound orifice plates will bring a satisfactory treatment result in this study the series wound orifice plates are tentatively used to treat the simulated organic dye wastewater in this part in order to obtain a better pollutant degradation effect a 3 hole orifice plate was used as orifice plate 1 and then connected in series with porous orifice plate 2 25 hole orifice plate or 29 hole orifice plate if orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 is reversed the kinetic energy of liquid could be greatly weakened due to the decompression and obstruction effect of orifice plate 1 with a small hole number at this time the cavitation effect is hardly produced in orifice plate 2 with a large hole number therefore it is essential to place the orifice plate 2 with a large hole number in front of the orifice plate 1 with a small hole number then it is ensured that the hc conditions of the orifice plate 1 with a small hole number will not be significantly changed by adjusting the throttle valve in the by pass line meanwhile the liquid flowing through the orifice plate 2 still has a large kinetic energy which is conducive to the generation of hc effect the influence of hole number of orifice plate 2 on rhb hc degradation is shown in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 for these three hc systems 29 hole orifice plate connecting with 3 hole orifice plate 29h 3h 25 hole orifice plate connecting with 3 hole orifice plate 25h 3h and 3 hole orifice plate alone 3h the rhb degradation effects all increase with the extension of treatment time and that follow the order of 29h 3h 25h 3h 3h at any cycle time after 60 min circulation the degradation ratios for 29h 3h 25h 3h and 3h are 44 13 42 68 and 41 17 respectively this means that a considerable amount of rhb molecules can be degraded in all three hc systems the degradation effects from two series wound hc systems 29h 3h and 25h 3h are enhanced to a considerable extent compared with that from 3 hole orifice plate alone in the series wound hc system when the hole number of orifice plate 2 increases from 25 to 29 the rhb degradation efficiency increases however compared with the increase between 3h and 25h 3h the one between 29h 3h and 25h 3h is obviously smaller apparently compared with the 3 hole orifice plate alone although orifice plate 2 25 hole orifice plate or 29 hole orifice plate has large hole number the liquid still has a large kinetic energy when flowing through the orifice plate 2 leading to the occurrence of hc effect in the orifice plate 2 which strengthens the hc intensity of whole system and enhances the degradation ratio of organic pollutants therefore the hc degradation effect of organic pollutants brought by series wound orifice plate is better than that of single orifice plate when the hole number of orifice plate 2 increases from 25 to 29 the decompression and obstruction effect of orifice plate 2 becomes small which has the less influence on orifice plate 1 3 hole orifice plate enhancing the whole hc strength for the single 3 hole orifice plate it can be approximated as a 3 hole orifice plate in series with the orifice plate 2 with infinite holes therefore it can be considered that with the further increase of the hole number of orifice plate 2 the degradation effect from series wound hc system may be closer to that of the single 3 orifice plate hc system in conclusion for the series wound orifice plate hc system the hole number of orifice plate 2 should not only be larger than that of orifice plate 1 but also need to well match each other for given conditions the hole number proportion of orifice plate 2 and orifice plate 1 should be about 10 1 3 3 effect of connection type of by pass line orifice plate with series wound orifice plates on rhb hc degradation in hc system the use of by pass line is very important to obtain a strong hc effect 27 in particular for series wound orifice plate hc system through the adjustment of by pass line the pressures can be reasonably distributed between two series wound orifice plates so that a strong hc effect can be obtained in whole system thus bringing a high organic pollutant degradation ratio therefore in this part three different by pass line connection modes are established and then the throttle valve in the traditional by pass line is replaced by orifice plate to explore the effect of hole number of by pass line orifice plate on rhb hc degradation the first connection mode d 2 is that the by pass line is connected with two series wound orifice plates in parallel as shown in scheme 1 d 2 the second connection mode d 3 is that the inlet of by pass line is connected between two series wound orifice plates in parallel as shown in scheme 1 d 3 the third connection mode d 4 is that the outlet of the by pass line is connected between two series wound orifice plates in parallel as shown in scheme 1 d 4 the obtained experimental results from d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems are correspondingly given in fig 3 a b and c as can be seen from fig 3 the rhb hc degradation effects in these three systems all keep a rising trend with the extension of treatment time but the rising trends are different for d 2 system the combination modes of 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h are used to investigate the rhb hc degradation effect by replacing the throttle valve in the by pass line and changing the hole number of by pass line orifice plate and the obtained results are given in fig 3 a it can be seen that the rhb hc degradation effect always follows the order of 29h 3h 7h 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 8h at any cycle time when the hole number of the by pass line orifice plate is 6 or 7 the rhb hc degradation effects are basically the same after 60 min cycle treatment the rhb degradation ratios are 45 80 and 46 12 for 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h respectively however the rhb degradation effect in 29h 3h 8h system is only 28 33 this may be because the pressure drop of the main line orifice plate decreases significantly when the by pass line orifice plate with a relatively big hole number such as 8 holes is used concretely the pressure drop p before orifice plate 1 is 2 9 bar which weakens the strength of hc effect for the 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h systems the pressure drops before orifice plate 1 still remain 3 0 bar a higher pressure drop produces a stronger hc effect and brings a higher organic pollutant degradation effect in addition according to the flow rates of liquid flowing through 6 7 and 8 hole by pass line orifice plate the calculated cavitation numbers c v are 0 400 0 548 and 0 731 respectively this also means that in the 29h 3h 8h system the by pass line orifice plate has the weakest hc intensity which leads to the poor rhb degradation effect the hc strengths of by pass line orifice plate from 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h are strong so the 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h systems give better rhb degradation effects according to the flow rate the cycle numbers of rhb solution in 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h systems are calculated to be 516 and 526 respectively the relatively many cycle numbers make rhb solution be treated more times in 29h 3h 7h system so the better rhb hc degradation effect is obtained for d 3 system the combination modes of 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h are adopted to explore the effect of hole number of by pass line orifice plate on rhb degradation and the obtained results are shown in fig 3 b it can be seen that rhb hc degradation effect always follows the order of 29h 3h 7h 29h 3h 8h 29h 3h 6h at any cycle time after 60 min cycle treatment the rhb hc degradation ratios are 37 69 52 27 and 40 82 for 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h respectively according to the flow rate the cavitation number c v of by pass line orifice plate in 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h system are calculated to be 0 459 0 519 and 0 675 respectively in addition during the 60 min cycle time the rhb solutions are circulated 498 529 and 535 times in 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h systems respectively therefore it can be concluded that the cycle number is the lowest in the 29h 3h 6h system thus giving a poor rhb degradation effect though the by pass line orifice plate provides the strongest hc effect for 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h systems the cycle numbers of solution are basically the same but the hc effect of by pass line orifice plate in 29h 3h 7h system is stronger therefore 29h 3h 7h gives a better rhb degradation effect for d 4 system the combination modes of 29h 6h 3h 29h 7h 3h and 29h 8h 3h are used to investigate the effect of hole number of by pass line orifice plate on rhb hc degradation and the obtained results are given in fig 3 c it should be noted that orifice plate 1 is the bottleneck of the flow path and has the strongest throttling effect in whole system at this time the pressure drop before orifice plate 2 is 5 0 bar therefore in this part the rhb hc degradation effect brought by 29h 3h system p 5 0 bar of orifice plate 2 is correspondingly tested and the obtained results are also shown in fig 3 c it can be seen that for d 4 systems with different by pass line orifice plates the rhb hc degradation effect always follows the order of 29h 7h 3h 29h 6h 3h 29h 8h 3h at any cycle time at 60 min 29h 6h 3h 29h 7h 3h and 29h 8h 3h systems give 23 23 31 20 and 18 18 rhb degradation effect respectively this may be because the most hole numbers of by pass line orifice plate will cause the largest flow quantity and the most solution cycle numbers but the flow rate is the smallest and the strength of hc effect is the weakest on the contrary when the hole number of by pass line orifice plate is the smallest the flow quantity of by pass line orifice plate and the cycle number of solution are both the smallest but the flow rate is the largest and the hc effect strength is the strongest taken together among these three systems the by pass line orifice plate of 29h 7h 3h with relatively stronger hc effect intensity and more cycle numbers gives the best degradation effect besides within 30 min cycle time the rhb hc degradation effect given by 29h 3h is always higher than that of 29h 7h 3h after 30 min the degradation trends become opposite compared with 29h 3h the by pass line orifice plate and orifice plate 2 of the 29h 7h 3h system simultaneously affect the hc effect of orifice plate 1 aggravating the consumption of pressure between series wound orifice plates however in 29h 3h system only orifice plate 2 has throttling effect on orifice plate 1 therefore in the first 30 min rhb degradation effect in 29h 7h 3h is always lower than that of 29h 3h however the degradation trend changed in reverse after 30 min due to the continuous assistance of the by pass line orifice plate in general the treatment effect of hc system with simple series wound cavitators is only equivalent to that with one single cavitator the obtained treatment effect is hardly better than that of one single cavitator however the by pass line can be used to adjust the pressure between the two series wound orifice plates so that the pressure can be reasonably distributed to achieve the optimal treatment effect and the throttle valve can be replaced by an orifice plate with the same throttle effect to further enhance the degradation effect in other words after the by pass line throttle valve adjustment amplitude is determined an orifice plate is used to replace the throttle valve which can further enhance the wastewater treatment effect specifically for d 2 system on the basis of the series wound orifice plate hc treatment effect the rhb treatment effect can be enhanced by using by pass line orifice plate however the consumption of pressure between the series wound orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 is not effectively alleviated so the enhancement of treatment effect is limited for d 3 system the by pass line greatly alleviates the pressure consumption between series wound orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 the pressure difference increases in the front and rear of orifice plate 2 releasing the potential of orifice plate 2 in addition by calculating the c v of each orifice plate in d 3 system it can be found that these c v are all small and that close each other therefore d 3 system shows strongest hc effect giving a highest rhb degradation ratio for d 4 system the orifice plate 2 and the by pass line orifice plate can be seen as a whole to aggravate pressure consumption between series wound orifice plate through comprehensive analyses it can be concluded that the by pass line connection mode of d 3 system is the most beneficial mode to rhb hc degradation 3 4 effect of initial concentration on rhb hc degradation by using d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems for actual industrial wastewater the range of organic pollutant concentration is very wide however the organic pollutant concentration has obvious influence on the hc degradation sometimes the concentration of organic pollutant needs to be adjusted in order to achieve a higher removal efficiency 28 therefore in practice it is necessary to determine an appropriate initial concentration to achieve a high speed organic pollutant degradation in this part for these three types of by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc systems d 2 d 3 and d 4 the effects of initial concentration 5 15 mg l on rhb hc degradation are investigated and the obtained results are given in fig 4 it can be seen that for all hc systems the degradation effects of rhb with three kinds of concentrations all increase with the extension of treatment time but their rising trends are different for these three kinds of hc systems the rhb hc degradation effects always follow the order of 10 mg l 15 mg l 5 mg l at any cycle time indicating that 10 mg l rhb solution can give the highest hc degradation effect it can be further noted that at any same initial concentration the rhb hc degradation effects follow the order of d 3 d 2 d 4 after 60 min circulation when the rhb initial concentration is 10 mg l the rhb hc degradation effects from d 2 d 3 and d 4 are 46 12 52 27 and 31 20 respectively in comparison the d 3 system gives the highest hc degradation effect for each hc system the amount of free radical generated in the hc process is limited 20 panda et al used hc technology to treat dicofol and found that when the concentration increased from 20 mg l to 50 mg l the dicofol degradation effect continued to rise when the dicofol initial concentration was increased to 70 mg l the degradation ratio decreased significantly 29 therefore the organic pollutant degradation effect is closely related to the concentration for the relatively low initial concentration of rhb solution 5 mg l it is difficult for the free radicals existing in the cavitation zone to capture rhb molecules resulting in a low rhb hc degradation effect for the relatively high initial concentration of rhb solution 15 mg l there is a large amount of rhb molecules in the solution but the number of free radicals in the system becomes relatively insufficient which also leads to a low rhb hc degradation effect 30 however for 10 mg l initial concentration rhb solution the number of free radicals in the cavitation zone is relatively sufficient and rhb molecules can be easily captured by the free radicals thus bringing a better degradation effect obviously rhb solution with low or high initial concentration is not suitable for these three systems d 2 d 3 and d 4 the rhb solution only with moderate initial concentration can bring a better degradation effect after 60 min treatment rhb solutions are cycled 526 529 and 273 times in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems respectively it can be seen that the cycle numbers of rhb solutions in d 2 and d 3 systems are almost the same the cycle number in d 4 system is the least which is only about half of that in d 2 and d 3 systems therefore under the same concentration the d 4 system gives a worst degradation effect then the connection mode of by pass line orifice plate in d 3 system effectively alleviates the pressure consumption between the series wound orifice plates but that in d 2 system does not play the same role at the same time for d 3 system the cavitation potential of orifice plate 2 is released so the rhb degradation effect from d 3 is higher than that from d 2 therefore at any same initial concentration the rhb hc degradation effects always follow the order of d 3 d 2 d 4 in conclusion for d 2 d 3 and d 4 system the 10 mg l initial rhb concentration is favorable for hc degradation 3 5 effect of adding radical scavengers on rhb hc degradation in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems some studies have pointed out that organic pollutants hc degradation mainly rely on free radical oxidation and water phase combustion 31 32 so it is necessary to identify the type and amount of generated free radicals in different hc systems in this part isopropanol ipa and p benzoquinone bq are selected as the radical scavengers of oh and o2 respectively and determine their generations ipa and bq are added to the rhb solution to carry on hc degradation according to the molar proportions of rhb and radical scavenger of 1 0 1 8 and 1 50 respectively the contributions of different free radicals are inferred from the reduction extent of rhb degradation effect and the obtained results are given in fig 5 without adding any radical scavenger at 60 min cycle time the rhb degradation ratios are 46 12 52 27 and 31 20 in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and ipa is 1 8 in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems the rhb degradation ratios reduce to 35 52 42 05 and 24 39 respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and ipa increases to 1 50 the rhb degradation ratios continue to decrease to 27 06 28 95 and 13 69 respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and bq is 1 8 the rhb degradation ratios in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems reduce to 30 96 39 61 and 22 15 respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and bq increases to 1 50 the rhb degradation ratios in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems continue to decrease to 20 39 20 77 and 11 90 respectively it can be seen that after adding free radical scavengers the rhb degradation effects decrease in varying extents for these three systems further the decrease extents of degradation ratios increase with the increase of radical scavenger content in general the inhibition level of rhb degradation by adding bq is higher than that by adding ipa indicating that o2 plays a major contribution to rhb degradation in these three hc systems and that oh does a second contribution for any hc system the amount of produced free radicals is limited when reductive free radical scavengers are added the radical scavengers will compete with rhb molecules aggravating free radical consumption the more radical scavengers are added the more the free radicals are consumed compared with no free radical scavenger addition the rhb degradation effects from d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems are all inhibited obviously in this study o2 contribute more to rhb degradation than oh the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the hydrophobicity difference between o2 and oh if the organic pollutants exist in the form of hydrophobic molecules in the solution they mainly concentrate at the cavity water interface oh has a relatively high concentration in the cavity core and the cavity water interface so organic pollutants in the molecules form are more likely to contact with oh and be oxidized and destroyed if organic pollutants are present in aqueous solution as hydrophilic ions they are dispersed throughout the solution and are more easily captured and oxidized by o2 rhb as a typical ionic dye has good hydrophilicity and is evenly dispersed in the whole solution the amount of rhb molecules at the cavity water interface becomes very small so the role of oh cannot be fully played at the same time only about 10 of the generated oh can diffuse into the solution 20 22 the remained oh easily combine with each other to form h2o2 h2o2 is unstable and easily decomposed into h2o and o2 o2 react with h to produce o2 so that o2 is much more than oh for hydrophilic organic pollutants o2 with a high oxidability long half life and ease of solubility can fully contact with rhb molecules and effectively destroy them in addition even if the rhb concentration in the solution is low o2 can easily capture them and play a full role in the degradation process a large number of free radicals will be captured and the total amount of free radicals in the system will be reduced oh diffuses less into the solution and its role is more limited therefore it can be considered that the form of organic pollutants in aqueous solution has different effects for o2 and oh on the hc degradation effect when the addition proportion of radical scavenger is 1 50 it can be considered that most of the free radicals in the system can be captured but these three systems still give a certain rhb degradation effect this may be due to the fact that under extreme conditions such as high temperature and high pressure caused by hc effect water phase combustion reaction occurs in the presence of dissolved o2 3 6 effects of inorganic oxidants on rhb hc degradation in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems through the use of series wound orifice plates and assistance of by pass line orifice plate the hc degradation effect of organic pollutant can be effectively enhanced moreover in hc systems the addition of inorganic oxidants can also enhance the degradation effect of organic pollutants which is similar to other advanced oxidation technologies 33 34 for these three hc systems the type and chemical properties of inorganic oxidants may affect the degradation effect of organic pollutant for example thanekar et al used slit venturi tube as cavitator to treat industrial wastewater and found that the synergistic indexes of hc h2o2 and hc o3 were 2 75 and 2 3 respectively and that the synergistic index of hc k2s2o8 was only 0 89 the reason is that some organic pollutants have low reactivity to sulfate free radicals 35 for slit venturi tubes hc k2s2o8 shows no significant synergistic effect but the cod reduction of using combined method is still much higher than that of the sole hc treatment therefore it is necessary to explore which oxidant is suitable for given hc systems to effectively treat dye wastewater in this part four commonly used inorganic oxidants naclo4 naclo k2s2o8 and h2o2 are selected to add to d 2 d 3 and d 4 hc systems according to 1 100 molar proportion of rhb and inorganic oxidant other conditions remain unchanged and the obtained results are shown in fig 6 it is seen that for any hc system the rhb hc degradation effects increase with the extension of cycle time especially after adding inorganic oxidants the rhb degradation effect is further enhanced however due to the different oxidizabilities of these inorganic oxidants the increasing trends of rhb degradation effect are different for d 2 system after naclo and k2s2o8 are added the rhb hc degradation effect is significantly enhanced compared with that without adding any inorganic oxidant in addition the rhb hc degradation effect via adding k2s2o8 is higher than that via adding naclo at any cycle time when naclo4 and h2o2 are added compared with that without any inorganic oxidant the rhb hc degradation effect is not significantly enhanced this means that for d 2 system the addition of naclo and k2s2o8 contributes more to the rhb hc degradation for d 3 system the rhb hc degradation effect is also significantly enhanced when naclo and k2s2o8 are added however being slightly different from d 2 system the rhb hc degradation effect via adding naclo is higher than that via adding k2s2o8 at any cycle time being similar to d 2 system when naclo4 and h2o2 are added the rhb hc degradation effects increase only slightly after 30 min cycle treatment the rhb hc degradation by adding naclo4 is slightly higher than that by adding h2o2 this indicates that the addition of naclo and k2s2 o8 also contributes to the rhb hc degradation in d 3 system for d 4 system rhb degradation effect has a small increase after adding naclo and k2s2o8 and the final treatment effect adding k2s2o8 is slightly higher than that adding naclo when naclo4 is added after 45 min the rhb hc degradation effect increases slightly and that the treatment effect adding h2o2 is basically equivalent to that of d 4 system alone in short the addition of inorganic oxidants for d 4 system does not contribute much to the rhb hc degradation in order to further evaluate the influence of inorganic oxidants combined with different hc system on the rhb degradation effect a first order kinetic model is used to investigate the rhb hc degradation rate and the obtained results are also given in fig 6 the specific calculation formula of the first order kinetic model is as follows 3 ln c t c 0 k t where ct and c0 are rhb concentrations at time t and 0 respectively t is cycle time and k is first order kinetic rate constant synergetic index si is commonly used to describe the effectiveness of composite processes the calculation formula of the synergetic index is as follows 4 synergetic index si k hc oxidiants k hc k oxidiants where k hc oxidants is the organic pollutant degradation reaction rate constant in hc oxidant system and k hc and k oxidants are the organic pollutant degradation reaction rate constants in hc and oxidant alone the first order kinetic rate constants and synergetic indexes of different combined systems are given in table 1 as can be seen from fig 6 for d 2 system the rhb degradation reaction rate constants follow the order of k2s2o8 naclo naclo4 h2o2 for d 3 system the rhb degradation reaction rate constants follow the order of naclo k2s2o8 naclo4 h2o2 for d 4 system the rhb degradation reaction rate constants follow the order of k2s2o8 naclo naclo4 h2o2 the rhb hc degradation ratios in d 2 k2s2o8 d 3 naclo and d 4 k2s2o8 are 56 92 87 28 and 42 38 at 60 min cycle time respectively the corresponding first order kinetic rate constants are 15 60 10 3 min 1 36 35 10 3 min 1 and 9 09 10 3 min 1 respectively it can be seen that the d 3 naclo not only gives the highest degradation effect but also has the fastest degradation rate it can be seen from table 1 that the synergetic indexes of d 2 naclo4 d 3 naclo4 and d 4 naclo4 are all 1 but they are only 1 04 1 12 and 1 12 respectively the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the naclo4 is not activated effectively in these systems and no more free radicals with strong oxidation capacity are generated that is the naclo4 oxidizes rhb only based on its oxidizability of original molecular form resulting in a relatively low synergetic index although the k2s2o8 can effectively enhance the rhb degradation effect the synergetic index of d 2 k2s2o8 d 3 k2s2o8 and d 4 k2s2o8 are all 1 in which the highest synergetic index of d 3 k2s2o8 is only 0 93 in general the k2s2o8 can be effectively activated to oxidize and degrade organic pollutants the so4 radical has higher chemical reaction efficiency and longer half life than oh radical 36 under the hc condition the s2o8 2 will form so4 which can appropriately increase the amount of oh radical eqs 5 6 therefore for the addition of k2s2o8 rhb should be able to be effectively degraded due to the generation of so4 and oh 5 s 2 o 8 2 hc so 4 so 4 6 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 7 h 2 o hc oh h 8 oh oh h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 10 h o 2 o 2 h however in this study the added s2o8 2 may only be partially activated to form so4 the remaining s2o8 2 may take place other reactions for example the following reactions may occur in the presence of h in the solution 11 s 2 o 8 2 h hs 2 o 8 12 hs 2 o 8 2 h 2 e hso 3 h 2 so 5 the formed non free radical oxidants react slowly with rhb which reduces the production of so4 free radicals resulting in 1 synergetic indexes of d 2 k2s2o8 d 3 k2s2o8 and d 4 k2s2o8 for naclo the synergetic index of d 3 naclo is 1 97 although the addition of naclo can also enhance the rhb degradation effect of d 2 and d 4 systems the synergetic indexes are all 1 this may be because the hc effect intensity in d 3 system is strong and the naclo is effectively decomposed into a large number of free radicals in contrary only part of naclo is activated to free radicals in d 2 and d 4 systems and the rest still involves in the reaction in the form of clo the possible reactions are as follows 13 naclo h 2 o hclo naoh 14 hclo hc o h c l 15 cl h 2 o cloh 2 16 cloh 2 cloh h 17 cloh cl oh in d 3 system hclo is decomposed to produce oh and cl the generated oh can greatly enhance the rhb degradation effect cl continues to take place a series of reactions under the promotion of hc eqs 15 17 although the formed cloh2 has a weak oxidation capacity under hc condition it can be rapidly decomposed into unstable cloh 37 38 the cloh will decompose rapidly to produce oh which also increases the amount of oh thus further enhancing the rhb degradation effect however only a small part of hclo is activated as free radicals in d 2 and d 4 systems and the rest still involves in the reaction in the form of clo eq 18 18 naclo na clo the synergetic indexes of d 2 h2o2 d 3 h2o2 and d 4 h2o2 are 0 94 0 98 and 0 91 respectively which are all 1 meanwhile the addition of h2o2 cannot effectively increase the rhb degradation ratio this is because h2o2 is not effectively decomposed into oh in these three hc systems and still participates in the degradation reaction in the form of h2o2 molecule with low oxidability making little contribution to rhb degradation in addition h2o2 may also consume part of generated oh in the hc process eqs 19 20 resulting in a synergetic index of 1 19 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h h 2 o 20 o 2 h o 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 in order to verify the advantages of the proposed hc system in this study the removal effects are compared with the results as shown in table 2 reported by other researchers compared to the single hc systems in which whether the orifice plate venturi tube or vortex tube is used as cavitation device the proposed d 3 system in this study gives relatively high degradation effect the rhb degradation ratio 52 27 in this study is slightly lower than that 59 30 reported in 40 however it should be noted that the hc cycle time in this study is 60 min while it is 120 min in the literature therefore it can be said that the hc system proposed in this study shows obvious advantages in addition it can be found that the degradation ratio given in this study is still higher than those in most reports after adding inorganic oxidants among them the degradation ratio reported by dhanke et al is comparable to that in this study and that the dye concentration is slightly higher than that in this study but the treatment time of dye wastewater is three times longer than that in this study 43 in conclusion it can be proved that the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system proposed in this study has high efficiency in organic dye wastewater treatment 3 7 possible degradation pathways and toc reduction of rhb in solution in hc system exploring the intermediates formed in the organic pollutants degradation process is helpful to evaluate the treatment effect and the mineralization degree the molecular weight of ionic dye rhb is 479 02 in aqueous solution the carried chloride ions will ionize and fall off from the matrix therefore it is considered that the ionized rhb molecular weight is 443 13 it can be seen from fig 7 a that the peak at m z 443 13 is the molecular ion peak of rhb a series of fragment peaks appear at m z 415 03 358 76 344 17 317 14 301 12 279 10 221 85 205 10 201 52 111 67 107 75 and 99 33 which are formed under hc treatment the peak intensities of the fragment peaks at m z 205 10 279 10 and 415 03 are relatively high the fragment peaks at m z 415 03 358 76 344 17 317 14 differ from the molecular ion peak of rhb by several methyl or ethyl groups therefore it can be speculated that the rhb has undergone the reaction process of n dealkylation during hc degradation 45 47 the possible rhb hc degradation paths are given in fig 7 b basically there are four main paths in rhb hc degradation process n dealkylation chromophore cracking ring opening and mineralization rhb takes off one ethyl group forming intermediate product b and then three ethyl groups form the intermediate product e two ethyl groups and one methyl group are stripped from intermediate product b to form intermediate product c then n methyl group is stripped from intermediate product c to form intermediate product d over time under the attack of oh and o2 the benzene ring in molecular structure of formed intermediate products begins to fall off and undergoes ring opening reaction under the attack of oh intermediate product e removes benzoic acid and opens the ring to form intermediate product f which further opens the ring to form intermediate product h with a small molecule weight intermediate product c gets rid of methyl and benzoic acid and forms intermediate product i under conditions of high temperature and high pressure the intermediate product j is formed in the presence of generated free radicals at the same time the intermediate product d is deoxidized to form the intermediate product k then the intermediate product l is formed under the attack of free radicals under continuous hc treatment the ring opening and removal reactions of benzene ring continue to occur forming intermediate products m and o these formed intermediate products can eventually be mineralized into h2o co2 no3 and some other inorganic ions over time in the hc system the obtained toc reduction ratios of rhb solutions after 60 min cycle treatment are given in fig 8 it can be seen that in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems the toc reduction ratios of rhb solutions with the same initial concentration are 15 68 24 78 and 9 83 respectively compared with the rhb degradation ratios calculated by absorbance the toc reduction ratios are slightly lower this suggests that in the hc process the rhb matrix can be destroyed much more easily than the intermediates in addition that the chromophore of rhb is destroyed will cause discolourization of the rhb solution however some intermediate products with small molecular weight are still generated during hc degradation which can be proved by the lc ms results these intermediate products can take place water phase combustion reaction in the presence of o2 and free radical oxidant reaction before they are completely mineralized therefore it takes a relatively long time to mineralize rhb which results in a low mineralization ratio a similar phenomenon was also found in some studies for example mishra et al used venturi tube to treat rhb solution at ph 2 5 the 53 30 highest degradation ratio was achieved but the corresponding toc reduction ratio of rhb solution was only 30 40 obviously the mineralization ratio is lower than the degradation ratio 3 8 possible mechanism of rhb hc degradation in d 3 system due to some disadvantages of long treatment time high treatment cost and low single treatment effect the practical application of hc technology in large scale wastewater treatment has been limited in view of these shortcomings some researchers put forward many modification methods and measures however many proposed improvement methods such as optimizing the geometry parameters of hc device and experimental operation parameters have not greatly enhanced the degradation effect of organic pollutants yet meanwhile in many studies only single cavitator is used and that the series wound combination of multiple cavitators is rarely considered theoretically the wastewater can be treated repeatedly by using multiple cavitators in series and the single treatment effect of overall hc device can also be effectively increased nevertheless in the practical application process the expected effect is not reached when the multiple cavitators are in series since the pressure drop in front of two series wound orifice plates cannot be reasonably distributed it is generally difficult to obtain a better treatment effect than that given by two single orifice plates this is because two series wound orifice plates in the main line disturb with each other and become an equivalent single orifice plate as shown in the device diagram d 3 the throttling effect of orifice plate 2 will reduce the flow velocity of liquid through orifice plate 1 which will reduce the hc effect intensity in orifice plate 1 according to eq 2 on the other hand the orifice plate 1 increases the outlet pressure of orifice plate 2 which will decrease the hc effect intensity in orifice plate 2 according to eq 1 apparently it is difficult to satisfy the required conditions of two series wound orifice plates at the same time therefore it is necessary to adjust the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates in the main line through the by pass line throttle valve so that the pressure provided by the water pump is reasonably distributed to the two series wound orifice plates for achieving strong hc effect the experimental results showed that the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates could be reasonably distributed by adjusting by pass line throttle valve which results in strong hc effects in the two series wound orifice plates in the actual process the obtained rhb degradation effect is indeed higher than that of any single orifice plate for series wound hc device three by pass lines connection ways can be attempted to regulate the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates in main line and fluid flow velocities from the position of the by pass line orifice plate the by pass line orifice plate can be parallel to two series wound orifice plates d 2 orifice plate 1 d 3 and orifice plate 2 d 4 respectively comparing their rhb hc degradation effects provided by these three hc systems it is found that the by pass line connection mode of d 3 system can bring the highest rhb hc degradation ratio this is because the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates can be reasonably distributed by using the by pass line connection mode of d 3 system and orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 can both obtain enough pressure drop therefore d 3 gives the highest rhb degradation effect and rate further for d 3 system when the adjustment amplitude of the by pass line is determined for the strongest hc effect the throttle valve in the by pass line is replaced by a new orifice plate with equivalent throttle effect to further enhance the hc effect intensity of the whole system it can be seen that in this study a water pump simultaneously drives three orifice plates to perform rhb hc degradation in the d 3 system the hc effect occurs in orifice plate 1 orifice plate 2 and by pass line orifice plate at the same time when the rhb solution flows through these orifice plates the liquid flow velocity becomes faster due to the throttling effect of the orifice plates when the liquid internal pressure drops below the saturated vapor pressure the evaporation and gasification of part water molecules will form a large number of cavities which will grow into cavitation bubbles with the further decrease of the liquid internal pressure when these cavitation bubbles break and collapse in the d 3 hc system a lot of energy is released simultaneously high temperature 5000 10 000 k high pressure 500 1000 atm strong jet flow and strong shock wave are produced some water molecules break down under these extreme conditions to produce oh and h h reacts with o2 dissolved in water to form o2 the generated oh and o2 can effectively oxidize and destroy rhb molecules for ionic organic dye o2 contribute more to the rhb degradation than oh at the same time under the condition of high temperature and high pressure in the presence of o2 partial rhb molecules will also undergo water phase combustion reaction which also enhances the rhb degradation ratio the possible rhb hc degradation mechanism in the d 3 system is given in fig 9 the high outlet pressure of orifice plate 2 makes the external pressure of these cavitation bubbles become great which is conducive to their collapse in conclusion compared with the traditional single orifice plate hc system the overall hc effect intensity in the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system is greatly enhanced which contributes to the rhb hc degradation 3 9 treatment cost of rhb solution in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems combined with different inorganic oxidants the calculation of wastewater treatment cost is benefit for the hc technology modification and future application prospect evaluation in this section the treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems combined with inorganic oxidants to remove rhb are calculated on the basis of the electric energy consumption and used inorganic oxidant expense generally e eo kw h m3 order are two commonly used eqs 21 22 to calculate treatment cost 48 49 21 e eo 1000 pt v lg c i c f 22 e eo 38 4 p v k the unit of e eo is kw h m3 order p is the rated power of pump kw t is the treatment time h v is the volume of treated wastewater l k is the first order kinetic constant min 1 c i and cf are the initial and final concentrations of rhb in the solution m or mol l respectively under ideal conditions the eq 21 can be simplified to eq 22 by combining with eq 3 in this study the valley price 0 0666 usd kw h in the peak valley price of industrial electricity is used to calculate the cost of electric energy consumption in the process of hc treatment the reagent prices are adopted according to market prices mp mp naclo4 1 252 usd kg mp naclo 0 078 usd kg mp k2s2o8 1 268 usd kg and mp h2o2 0 266 usd kg the treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems combined with inorganic oxidant are given in table 3 it is observed that for same concentration and volume of rhb solution d 3 system gives a minimum treatment cost of 61 526 usd m3 at the same time it can be seen that although the proportion of rhb and inorganic oxidant is 1 100 the use of inorganic oxidant still accounts for a small proportion of the total treatment cost and electric energy consumption occupies the majority after adding h2o2 the electric energy consumption and treatment cost of d 2 and d 4 systems increase slightly while the electric energy consumption and treatment cost of d 3 system decrease slightly this means that h2o2 is not suitable to add to these three systems to assist rhb hc degradation with the additions of naclo4 naclo and k2s2o8 the electric energy consumptions and treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems all decrease in varying degrees for these three oxidants the addition of naclo4 results in only a small decrease in electric energy consumptions and treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems the addition of k2s2o8 can effectively reduce the electric energy consumption and treatment cost of d 2 and d 4 systems indicating that k2s2o8 is suitable for d 2 and d 4 systems the lowest electric energy consumption and the lowest treatment cost can be obtained after adding naclo indicating that naclo is the most suitable to add to d 3 system after naclo is added to d 3 system the electric energy consumption is 316 919 kw h m3 order and the treatment cost is 21 119 usd m3 compared with no naclo the electric energy consumption of d 3 system decreases by 606 898 kw h m3 order and the corresponding treatment cost decreases by 65 67 the treatment costs in this study were compared with those reported in other literatures and the results were shown in table 4 it can be found that the treatment cost of hc technology is relatively lower compared with those of ultrasonic cavitation but is slightly higher than those of adsorption and other methods nevertheless the treatment cost can be reduced through the combination of hc technology with other aops or oxidants in addition it has been demonstrated in previous studies that a large amount of heat is generated in the process of dye hc degradation 42 therefore the treatment cost of hc technology can be further reduced by recycling and utilizing the heat generated during hc degradation the by pass orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system proposed in this study achieves higher degradation ratio and lower treatment cost compared with other hc technologies at the same time the treatment cost of hc technology can be further reduced by using naclo mancuso et al used a new ecowirl hc device to treat rhb dye wastewater and found that the hc naclo is a better combination 4 4 conclusion in this study a by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system is constructed for strengthening whole hc effect and enhancing the organic dyes degradation effect for series wound orifice plate hc system in order to achieve a strong whole hc effect the hole number of orifice plate 2 close to water pump is generally greater than that of orifice plate 1 away from water pump via reasonably adjusting the pressure drop of two series wound orifice plates the degradation effect of rhb in series wound orifice plate hc system can be obviously enhanced in d 3 system the connection mode of orifice plate 1 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate effectively distributes the pressures of two series wound orifice plates finally for d 3 system 52 27 rhb degradation ratio and 24 78 rhb mineralization effect are obtained which are much higher than 46 12 and 15 68 for d 2 system two series wound orifice plates paralleled with by pass line orifice plate and 31 20 and 9 83 for d 4 system series wound orifice plate 2 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate respectively after adding naclo to d 3 system the rhb degradation effect is further enhanced to 87 28 in addition d 3 naclo system gives 1 97 synergetic index and 21 119 usd m3 treatment cost the free radical identification experiment verifies that o2 plays a major contribution and that oh does a second contribution in rhb hc degradation in the future the by pass line orifice plate assisted series

12669,in order to overcome the disadvantages of low single treatment effect and long processing cycle of traditional hydrodynamic cavitation hc technology in organic dye degradation a by pass line orifice plate is used to assist series wound orifice plates for strengthening the hc effect in this work several series wound orifice plate hc systems with three by pass line orifice plate connection modes namely d 2 two series wound orifice plates paralleled with by pass line orifice plate d 3 series wound orifice plate 1 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate and d 4 series wound orifice plate 2 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate were designed and rhb was used to act as simulated contaminant to conduct the hc degradation experiment after 60 min treatment under the same conditions the rhb degradation ratios are 46 12 52 27 and 31 20 respectively for d 2 d 3 and d 4 and the corresponding mineralization effects are 15 68 24 78 and 9 83 respectively for d 2 d 3 and d 4 apparently d 3 gives the highest degradation ratio and the mineralization effect the addition of naclo to d 3 hc system can further enhance the rhb degradation effect which gives 1 97 synergetic index and 87 28 rhb degradation ratio in the future through continuous modification it is possible that the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc technology would be used for large scale industrial wastewater treatment graphical abstract in order to solve the problems of low single treatment effect and long processing cycle of traditional single orifice plate hc system in this study the by pass line orifice plate is adopted to assist series wound orifice plate hc system for a series wound orifice plate hc system the by pass line orifice plate can be connected in three ways for these three assisted hc systems series wound orifice plate 1 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate and orifice plate 2 d 3 can give a highest rhb degradation ratio 52 27 indicating that the use of by pass line orifice plate can efficiently enhance the rhb degradation ratio compared with 41 17 for single orifice plate hc system and 44 13 for series wound orifice plate hc system when naclo is add to the d 3 hc system after 60 min circulation the rhb hc degradation ratio reaches 87 28 at this point the treatment cost 21 119 usd m3 is the lowest compared with the treatment cost 61 526 usd m3 without naclo the corresponding treatment cost decreases by 65 67 unlabelled image keywords dye wastewater treatment series wound orifice plate hc device by pass line orifice plate assist inorganic oxidant treatment cost data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction when high speed liquid flows through the throttling devices such as orifice

k high pressure 500 1000 atm shear force and shock wave this process is known as hydrodynamic cavitation hc phenomenon 1 5 according to the characteristics of hc effects the formed hc technology can

venturi tube as hc device to treat 1 0 l water sample supplemented with purified pvy virions after 50 min hc cycle treatment the ability of the virus to infect plants disappeared at 7 0 bar inlet pressure 12 gogate and pandit et al studied the effect of acoustic cavitation and hydraulic cavitation combined advanced oxidation processes aops on cod reduction of some wastewater from common effluent treatment plant cetp the experiments clearly demonstrated that the combined hc aops offered a promise to treat wastewater in cetp 13 14 nevertheless some disadvantages of hc technology such as low single treatment effect and long treatment cycle should not be ignored many researchers are committed to solving these shortcomings through improving hc technology some studies have reported that the wastewater treatment effect can be significantly enhanced when hc is used in conjunction with other advanced oxidation technologies 15 17 gogate and pandit et al used slit venturi as a cavitation device combined with other aops to degrade acid violet 7 ac 7 dye it was found that the combination of hc and fenton oxidation was an effective method to degrade ac 7 18 however these methods still require long treatment time at the same time these combinations may alter hc original green environmental protection characteristics causing secondary pollution and additional treatment costs therefore enhancing the single treatment effect of hc equipment is the key to modify the hc technology increasing the volume of cavitation chamber and connecting multiple cavitation devices in series or parallel may be two effective methods ranade et al tried to gradually magnify the vortex hc equipment and maintain the geometric similarity the largest equipment is magnified nearly 200 times all facilities were used to treat di chloro aniline solution at 280 kpa inlet pressure however the experiment result showed that the degradation effect of contaminants gradually decreased with increasing the size of the vortex cavitator 3 sayyaadi et al used tandem venturi tubes to treat 2 chlorophenol solution and found that the degradation effect had a certain gain compared with that of using only a single venturi tube 19 according to the experimental results sayyaadi et al also thought that the tandem venturi tubes would only affect the number of cavitation events and the collapse area and not change the collapse time of cavitation bubbles and the existence time of free radicals it is probably because that their experiments were conducted at a lower inlet pressure 100 kpa in fact the better experiment results may be gotten under the hc conditions with relatively small cavitation number c v therefore in comparison the cavitation device in series is considered as an alternative pattern especially for the orifice plate with the advantages of simple fabrication and large processing capacity the better treatment results can be gained however when two orifice plates are connected in series the hole numbers match and pressure distributions between two orifice plates need to be considered in practice wang et al proposed the idea of series wound cavitators and pointed out that it was crucial to control the inlet pressure of each cavitator 20 in fact under relative low pressure the orifice plate with a small hole number in a smooth pipeline will show a strong hc effect therefore it is essential to ensure that the hc conditions of the orifice plate with a small hole number is not significantly changed at the same time other orifice plates can also obtain the necessary hc conditions in this study for two series wound orifice plates the necessary conditions of hc effect can be both obtained by adjusting the throttle valve in by pass line after the necessary hc conditions are determined the throttle valve in by pass line is replaced by orifice plate with the same effect which strengthens the hc effect of whole system bringing much better degradation effect of pollutants in this work three by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc facilities are set up the first is that the by pass line orifice plate is connected in parallel with two series wound orifice plates referred as to d 2 system second the by pass line orifice plate is connected between two series wound orifice plates in which the series

organic carbon toc reduction of rhb solution is tested and the intermediates during hc degradation are analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms it is concluded that the wastewater treatment effect of hc technology can be effectively enhanced by using the series wound orifice plates 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials rhodamine b c28h31cln2o3 cas 81 88 9 b benzoquinone c6h4o2

outlet of water pump is divided into two parts which are connected to main line and by pass line respectively for d 1 system the flowmeter 1 f1 pressure gage 1 p1 orifice plate 2 pressure gage 2 p2 orifice plate 1 and pressure gage 3 p3 are successively connected in the main line while there is only one throttle valve in the by pass line for regulating the pressure drop p and liquid flow for d 2 system the throttle valve in the by pass line of the d 1 system is replaced by an orifice plate the flowmeter 2 f2 and pressure gage 4 p4 are equipped before the by pass line orifice plate in sequence at the same time the position and number of various parts in the main line of the d 1 system are not unchanged for d 3 system the by pass line inlet of the d 2 system is connected between the two

and the hole diameter is 2 mm all experiments are carried out at the same temperature 40 c under the control of a cooling water circulation system 2 3 experimental procedure firstly the rhodamine b rhb degradation effect in single 3 hole orifice plate hc system is investigated where the operation condition is 10 mg l initial rhb concentration p 2 0 5 0 bar ph 7 and 5 0 l total volume then the d 1 system is used to study the influence of hole number of orifice plate 2 on the degradation effect finally the influence of the connection mode of by pass line on the degradation effect is explored and the geometry parameter hole number of by pass line orifice plate is optimized in addition the effect of initial concentration 5 15 mg l is also investigated and free radical scavenger is added to identify the active substances generated in the hc degradation process at the same time four inorganic oxidants including naclo naclo4 k2s2o8 and h2o2 are added appropriately to further enhance the rhb hc degradation effect respectively 2 4 analysis method 10 ml rhb solution is taken out from storage tank every 15 min interval and the absorbance is measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer insea l5s wuhan noride technology company china the rhb concentration in the solution is calculated according to the standard curve the mineralization degrees of rhb solution after 60 min treatment in d 1 d

acid aqueous solution and b is acetonitrile 6the experiments are repeated three times to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pressure drop p on rhb hc degradation and cavitation number c v solution pressure drop p is one of the important factors affecting hc effect intensity which decides the degradation effect of organic pollutants 20 in general the hc effect intensity can be described using a dimensionless parameter cavitation number c v the specific calculation formulas of cavitation number c v are as follows 1 c v p 2 p v p 1 p 2 2 c v p 2 p v 0 5 ρ v 2 p 1 is the inlet pressure of the solution p 2 is the recovery pressure of the downstream solution of the cavitator and p v is the saturated vapor pressure at the solution temperature in general when c v is equal to or 1 0 hc phenomenon begins to occur for above equations eq 1 focuses on the influence of pressure change and eq 2 focuses on liquid flow velocity a small cavitation number indicates a strong hc effect it was once reported that hc phenomenon could also occur for c v 1 0 but there is a small amount of dissolved gas and suspended particles in the solution 21 22 in this study the effect of pressure drop p on rhb hc degradation is investigated by using a 3 hole orifice plate within p 2 0 5 0 bar under other fixed conditions 10 mg l initial concentration 40 c solution temperature ph 7 00 and 5 0 l total volume the variation trends of rhb degradation ratios are given in fig 1 a it can be seen that under different pressure drops the rhb degradation ratios all keep rising over time but the rising trends depend on the pressure drops the order of rhb degradation ratios is 3 0 bar 4 0 bar 5 0 bar 2 0 bar when the pressure drop increases from 2 0 bar to 3 0 bar after 15 min circulation the rhb degradation ratio increases significantly at 60 min the rhb degradation ratio increases from 26 85 to 41 17 when the pressure drop continues to increase to 4 0 bar the rhb degradation efficiency shows a decreasing trend compared with p 3 0 bar and the degradation ratio is 34 25 when the pressure drop is further increased to 5 0 bar the rhb hc degradation continues to decrease and the rhb degradation ratio is only 27 64 for 60 min accordingly it can be seen from fig 1 b that with the increase of pressure drop the c v gradually decreases the corresponding c v are 0 464 0 309 0 232 and 0 185 respectively indicating that the hc intensity gets stronger and stronger however for c v 0 309 the best rhb degradation effect is gotten showing that the degradation effect of organic pollutants is not directly proportional to the hc intensity this is because the hc degradation effect of organic pollutants is affected by many factors generally speaking with the increasing of pressure drop hc intensity gradually increases and the number of free radicals generated by hc effect also increases which should bring a good rhb hc degradation effect 23 24 in fact the increase of pressure drop not only enhances the hc intensity but also accelerates the liquid flow velocity and increases the circulation number of organic pollutant wastewater per unit time 17 the increased hc strength results in the formation of a large number of cavitation bubbles however the excessively fast flow velocity will increase the collision probability of cavitation bubbles with each other so that large amounts of cavitation bubbles will fuse to form cavitation clouds 22 the formation of cavitation cloud will reduce the number of cavitation bubbles 17 therefore even for strong hc effect the energy released by cavitation bubble collapse is reduced thus going against the production of free radicals and leading to the decrease of rhb degradation effect 25 as a result p 2 0 5 0 bar is the optimal pressure for the 3 hole orifice plate to obtain a fine hc degradation effect 3 2 effect of hole number of orifice plate 2 in series wound orifice plate on rhb hc degradation the dye degradation ratio may be enhanced due to multiple hc effects produced by the series wound orifice plates wang et al designed a pipeline with six stage series wound orifice plates and optimized the geometric dimensions and layout of orifice plates at all levels 26 the experimental results show that the influence of pressure drop on hc effect can be obviously enhanced by reducing the orifice diameter of first or sixth orifice plate the cavitation phenomenon happens easily in the orifice plate with the highest pressure drop therefore for wastewater treatment the use of multistage series wound orifice plates will bring a satisfactory treatment result in this study the series wound orifice plates are tentatively used to treat the simulated organic dye wastewater in this part in order to obtain a better pollutant degradation effect a 3 hole orifice plate was used as orifice plate 1 and then connected in series with porous orifice plate 2 25 hole orifice plate or 29 hole orifice plate if orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 is reversed the kinetic energy of liquid could be greatly weakened due to the decompression and obstruction effect of orifice plate 1 with a small hole number at this time the cavitation effect is hardly produced in orifice plate 2 with a large hole number therefore it is essential to place the orifice plate 2 with a large hole number in front of the orifice plate 1 with a small hole number then it is ensured that the hc conditions of the orifice plate 1 with a small hole number will not be significantly changed by adjusting the throttle valve in the by pass line meanwhile the liquid flowing through the orifice plate 2 still has a large kinetic energy which is conducive to the generation of hc effect the influence of hole number of orifice plate 2 on rhb hc degradation is shown in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 for these three hc systems 29 hole orifice plate connecting with 3 hole orifice plate 29h 3h 25 hole orifice plate connecting with 3 hole orifice plate 25h 3h and 3 hole orifice plate alone 3h the rhb degradation effects all increase with the extension of treatment time and that follow the order of 29h 3h 25h 3h 3h at any cycle time after 60 min circulation the degradation ratios for 29h 3h 25h 3h and 3h are 44 13 42 68 and 41 17 respectively this means that a considerable amount of rhb molecules can be degraded in all three hc systems the degradation effects from two series wound hc systems 29h 3h and 25h 3h are enhanced to a considerable extent compared with that from 3 hole orifice plate alone in the series wound hc system when the hole number of orifice plate 2 increases from 25 to 29 the rhb degradation efficiency increases however compared with the increase between 3h and 25h 3h the one between 29h 3h and 25h 3h is obviously smaller apparently compared with the 3 hole orifice plate alone although orifice plate 2 25 hole orifice plate or 29 hole orifice plate has large hole number the liquid still has a large kinetic energy when flowing through the orifice plate 2 leading to the occurrence of hc effect in the orifice plate 2 which strengthens the hc intensity of whole system and enhances the degradation ratio of organic pollutants therefore the hc degradation effect of organic pollutants brought by series wound orifice plate is better than that of single orifice plate when the hole number of orifice plate 2 increases from 25 to 29 the decompression and obstruction effect of orifice plate 2 becomes small which has the less influence on orifice plate 1 3 hole orifice plate enhancing the whole hc strength for the single 3 hole orifice plate it can be approximated as a 3 hole orifice plate in series with the orifice plate 2 with infinite holes therefore it can be considered that with the further increase of the hole number of orifice plate 2 the degradation effect from series wound hc system may be closer to that of the single 3 orifice plate hc system in conclusion for the series wound orifice plate hc system the hole number of orifice plate 2 should not only be larger than that of orifice plate 1 but also need to well match each other for given conditions the hole number proportion of orifice plate 2 and orifice plate 1 should be about 10 1 3 3 effect of connection type of by pass line orifice plate with series wound orifice plates on rhb hc degradation in hc system the use of by pass line is very important to obtain a strong hc effect 27 in particular for series wound orifice plate hc system through the adjustment of by pass line the pressures can be reasonably distributed between two series wound orifice plates so that a strong hc effect can be obtained in whole system thus bringing a high organic pollutant degradation ratio therefore in this part three different by pass line connection modes are established and then the throttle valve in the traditional by pass line is replaced by orifice plate to explore the effect of hole number of by pass line orifice plate on rhb hc degradation the first connection mode d 2 is that the by pass line is connected with two series wound orifice plates in parallel as shown in scheme 1 d 2 the second connection mode d 3 is that the inlet of by pass line is connected between two series wound orifice plates in parallel as shown in scheme 1 d 3 the third connection mode d 4 is that the outlet of the by pass line is connected between two series wound orifice plates in parallel as shown in scheme 1 d 4 the obtained experimental results from d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems are correspondingly given in fig 3 a b and c as can be seen from fig 3 the rhb hc degradation effects in these three systems all keep a rising trend with the extension of treatment time but the rising trends are different for d 2 system the combination modes of 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h are used to investigate the rhb hc degradation effect by replacing the throttle valve in the by pass line and changing the hole number of by pass line orifice plate and the obtained results are given in fig 3 a it can be seen that the rhb hc degradation effect always follows the order of 29h 3h 7h 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 8h at any cycle time when the hole number of the by pass line orifice plate is 6 or 7 the rhb hc degradation effects are basically the same after 60 min cycle treatment the rhb degradation ratios are 45 80 and 46 12 for 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h respectively however the rhb degradation effect in 29h 3h 8h system is only 28 33 this may be because the pressure drop of the main line orifice plate decreases significantly when the by pass line orifice plate with a relatively big hole number such as 8 holes is used concretely the pressure drop p before orifice plate 1 is 2 9 bar which weakens the strength of hc effect for the 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h systems the pressure drops before orifice plate 1 still remain 3 0 bar a higher pressure drop produces a stronger hc effect and brings a higher organic pollutant degradation effect in addition according to the flow rates of liquid flowing through 6 7 and 8 hole by pass line orifice plate the calculated cavitation numbers c v are 0 400 0 548 and 0 731 respectively this also means that in the 29h 3h 8h system the by pass line orifice plate has the weakest hc intensity which leads to the poor rhb degradation effect the hc strengths of by pass line orifice plate from 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h are strong so the 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h systems give better rhb degradation effects according to the flow rate the cycle numbers of rhb solution in 29h 3h 6h and 29h 3h 7h systems are calculated to be 516 and 526 respectively the relatively many cycle numbers make rhb solution be treated more times in 29h 3h 7h system so the better rhb hc degradation effect is obtained for d 3 system the combination modes of 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h are adopted to explore the effect of hole number of by pass line orifice plate on rhb degradation and the obtained results are shown in fig 3 b it can be seen that rhb hc degradation effect always follows the order of 29h 3h 7h 29h 3h 8h 29h 3h 6h at any cycle time after 60 min cycle treatment the rhb hc degradation ratios are 37 69 52 27 and 40 82 for 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h respectively according to the flow rate the cavitation number c v of by pass line orifice plate in 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h system are calculated to be 0 459 0 519 and 0 675 respectively in addition during the 60 min cycle time the rhb solutions are circulated 498 529 and 535 times in 29h 3h 6h 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h systems respectively therefore it can be concluded that the cycle number is the lowest in the 29h 3h 6h system thus giving a poor rhb degradation effect though the by pass line orifice plate provides the strongest hc effect for 29h 3h 7h and 29h 3h 8h systems the cycle numbers of solution are basically the same but the hc effect of by pass line orifice plate in 29h 3h 7h system is stronger therefore 29h 3h 7h gives a better rhb degradation effect for d 4 system the combination modes of 29h 6h 3h 29h 7h 3h and 29h 8h 3h are used to investigate the effect of hole number of by pass line orifice plate on rhb hc degradation and the obtained results are given in fig 3 c it should be noted that orifice plate 1 is the bottleneck of the flow path and has the strongest throttling effect in whole system at this time the pressure drop before orifice plate 2 is 5 0 bar therefore in this part the rhb hc degradation effect brought by 29h 3h system p 5 0 bar of orifice plate 2 is correspondingly tested and the obtained results are also shown in fig 3 c it can be seen that for d 4 systems with different by pass line orifice plates the rhb hc degradation effect always follows the order of 29h 7h 3h 29h 6h 3h 29h 8h 3h at any cycle time at 60 min 29h 6h 3h 29h 7h 3h and 29h 8h 3h systems give 23 23 31 20 and 18 18 rhb degradation effect respectively this may be because the most hole numbers of by pass line orifice plate will cause the largest flow quantity and the most solution cycle numbers but the flow rate is the smallest and the strength of hc effect is the weakest on the contrary when the hole number of by pass line orifice plate is the smallest the flow quantity of by pass line orifice plate and the cycle number of solution are both the smallest but the flow rate is the largest and the hc effect strength is the strongest taken together among these three systems the by pass line orifice plate of 29h 7h 3h with relatively stronger hc effect intensity and more cycle numbers gives the best degradation effect besides within 30 min cycle time the rhb hc degradation effect given by 29h 3h is always higher than that of 29h 7h 3h after 30 min the degradation trends become opposite compared with 29h 3h the by pass line orifice plate and orifice plate 2 of the 29h 7h 3h system simultaneously affect the hc effect of orifice plate 1 aggravating the consumption of pressure between series wound orifice plates however in 29h 3h system only orifice plate 2 has throttling effect on orifice plate 1 therefore in the first 30 min rhb degradation effect in 29h 7h 3h is always lower than that of 29h 3h however the degradation trend changed in reverse after 30 min due to the continuous assistance of the by pass line orifice plate in general the treatment effect of hc system with simple series wound cavitators is only equivalent to that with one single cavitator the obtained treatment effect is hardly better than that of one single cavitator however the by pass line can be used to adjust the pressure between the two series wound orifice plates so that the pressure can be reasonably distributed to achieve the optimal treatment effect and the throttle valve can be replaced by an orifice plate with the same throttle effect to further enhance the degradation effect in other words after the by pass line throttle valve adjustment amplitude is determined an orifice plate is used to replace the throttle valve which can further enhance the wastewater treatment effect specifically for d 2 system on the basis of the series wound orifice plate hc treatment effect the rhb treatment effect can be enhanced by using by pass line orifice plate however the consumption of pressure between the series wound orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 is not effectively alleviated so the enhancement of treatment effect is limited for d 3 system the by pass line greatly alleviates the pressure consumption between series wound orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 the pressure difference increases in the front and rear of orifice plate 2 releasing the potential of orifice plate 2 in addition by calculating the c v of each orifice plate in d 3 system it can be found that these c v are all small and that close each other therefore d 3 system shows strongest hc effect giving a highest rhb degradation ratio for d 4 system the orifice plate 2 and the by pass line orifice plate can be seen as a whole to aggravate pressure consumption between series wound orifice plate through comprehensive analyses it can be concluded that the by pass line connection mode of d 3 system is the most beneficial mode to rhb hc degradation 3 4 effect of initial concentration on rhb hc degradation by using d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems for actual industrial wastewater the range of organic pollutant concentration is very wide however the organic pollutant concentration has obvious influence on the hc degradation sometimes the concentration of organic pollutant needs to be adjusted in order to achieve a higher removal efficiency 28 therefore in practice it is necessary to determine an appropriate initial concentration to achieve a high speed organic pollutant degradation in this part for these three types of by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc systems d 2 d 3 and d 4 the effects of initial concentration 5 15 mg l on rhb hc degradation are investigated and the obtained results are given in fig 4 it can be seen that for all hc systems the degradation effects of rhb with three kinds of concentrations all increase with the extension of treatment time but their rising trends are different for these three kinds of hc systems the rhb hc degradation effects always follow the order of 10 mg l 15 mg l 5 mg l at any cycle time indicating that 10 mg l rhb solution can give the highest hc degradation effect it can be further noted that at any same initial concentration the rhb hc degradation effects follow the order of d 3 d 2 d 4 after 60 min circulation when the rhb initial concentration is 10 mg l the rhb hc degradation effects from d 2 d 3 and d 4 are 46 12 52 27 and 31 20 respectively in comparison the d 3 system gives the highest hc degradation effect for each hc system the amount of free radical generated in the hc process is limited 20 panda et al used hc technology to treat dicofol and found that when the concentration increased from 20 mg l to 50 mg l the dicofol degradation effect continued to rise when the dicofol initial concentration was increased to 70 mg l the degradation ratio decreased significantly 29 therefore the organic pollutant degradation effect is closely related to the concentration for the relatively low initial concentration of rhb solution 5 mg l it is difficult for the free radicals existing in the cavitation zone to capture rhb molecules resulting in a low rhb hc degradation effect for the relatively high initial concentration of rhb solution 15 mg l there is a large amount of rhb molecules in the solution but the number of free radicals in the system becomes relatively insufficient which also leads to a low rhb hc degradation effect 30 however for 10 mg l initial concentration rhb solution the number of free radicals in the cavitation zone is relatively sufficient and rhb molecules can be easily captured by the free radicals thus bringing a better degradation effect obviously rhb solution with low or high initial concentration is not suitable for these three systems d 2 d 3 and d 4 the rhb solution only with moderate initial concentration can bring a better degradation effect after 60 min treatment rhb solutions are cycled 526 529 and 273 times in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems respectively it can be seen that the cycle numbers of rhb solutions in d 2 and d 3 systems are almost the same the cycle number in d 4 system is the least which is only about half of that in d 2 and d 3 systems therefore under the same concentration the d 4 system gives a worst degradation effect then the connection mode of by pass line orifice plate in d 3 system effectively alleviates the pressure consumption between the series wound orifice plates but that in d 2 system does not play the same role at the same time for d 3 system the cavitation potential of orifice plate 2 is released so the rhb degradation effect from d 3 is higher than that from d 2 therefore at any same initial concentration the rhb hc degradation effects always follow the order of d 3 d 2 d 4 in conclusion for d 2 d 3 and d 4 system the 10 mg l initial rhb concentration is favorable for hc degradation 3 5 effect of adding radical scavengers on rhb hc degradation in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems some studies have pointed out that organic pollutants hc degradation mainly rely on free radical oxidation and water phase combustion 31 32 so it is necessary to identify the type and amount of generated free radicals in different hc systems in this part isopropanol ipa and p benzoquinone bq are selected as the radical scavengers of oh and o2 respectively and determine their generations ipa and bq are added to the rhb solution to carry on hc degradation according to the molar proportions of rhb and radical scavenger of 1 0 1 8 and 1 50 respectively the contributions of different free radicals are inferred from the reduction extent of rhb degradation effect and the obtained results are given in fig 5 without adding any radical scavenger at 60 min cycle time the rhb degradation ratios are 46 12 52 27 and 31 20 in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and ipa is 1 8 in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems the rhb degradation ratios reduce to 35 52 42 05 and 24 39 respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and ipa increases to 1 50 the rhb degradation ratios continue to decrease to 27 06 28 95 and 13 69 respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and bq is 1 8 the rhb degradation ratios in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems reduce to 30 96 39 61 and 22 15 respectively when the molar proportion of rhb and bq increases to 1 50 the rhb degradation ratios in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems continue to decrease to 20 39 20 77 and 11 90 respectively it can be seen that after adding free radical scavengers the rhb degradation effects decrease in varying extents for these three systems further the decrease extents of degradation ratios increase with the increase of radical scavenger content in general the inhibition level of rhb degradation by adding bq is higher than that by adding ipa indicating that o2 plays a major contribution to rhb degradation in these three hc systems and that oh does a second contribution for any hc system the amount of produced free radicals is limited when reductive free radical scavengers are added the radical scavengers will compete with rhb molecules aggravating free radical consumption the more radical scavengers are added the more the free radicals are consumed compared with no free radical scavenger addition the rhb degradation effects from d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems are all inhibited obviously in this study o2 contribute more to rhb degradation than oh the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the hydrophobicity difference between o2 and oh if the organic pollutants exist in the form of hydrophobic molecules in the solution they mainly concentrate at the cavity water interface oh has a relatively high concentration in the cavity core and the cavity water interface so organic pollutants in the molecules form are more likely to contact with oh and be oxidized and destroyed if organic pollutants are present in aqueous solution as hydrophilic ions they are dispersed throughout the solution and are more easily captured and oxidized by o2 rhb as a typical ionic dye has good hydrophilicity and is evenly dispersed in the whole solution the amount of rhb molecules at the cavity water interface becomes very small so the role of oh cannot be fully played at the same time only about 10 of the generated oh can diffuse into the solution 20 22 the remained oh easily combine with each other to form h2o2 h2o2 is unstable and easily decomposed into h2o and o2 o2 react with h to produce o2 so that o2 is much more than oh for hydrophilic organic pollutants o2 with a high oxidability long half life and ease of solubility can fully contact with rhb molecules and effectively destroy them in addition even if the rhb concentration in the solution is low o2 can easily capture them and play a full role in the degradation process a large number of free radicals will be captured and the total amount of free radicals in the system will be reduced oh diffuses less into the solution and its role is more limited therefore it can be considered that the form of organic pollutants in aqueous solution has different effects for o2 and oh on the hc degradation effect when the addition proportion of radical scavenger is 1 50 it can be considered that most of the free radicals in the system can be captured but these three systems still give a certain rhb degradation effect this may be due to the fact that under extreme conditions such as high temperature and high pressure caused by hc effect water phase combustion reaction occurs in the presence of dissolved o2 3 6 effects of inorganic oxidants on rhb hc degradation in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems through the use of series wound orifice plates and assistance of by pass line orifice plate the hc degradation effect of organic pollutant can be effectively enhanced moreover in hc systems the addition of inorganic oxidants can also enhance the degradation effect of organic pollutants which is similar to other advanced oxidation technologies 33 34 for these three hc systems the type and chemical properties of inorganic oxidants may affect the degradation effect of organic pollutant for example thanekar et al used slit venturi tube as cavitator to treat industrial wastewater and found that the synergistic indexes of hc h2o2 and hc o3 were 2 75 and 2 3 respectively and that the synergistic index of hc k2s2o8 was only 0 89 the reason is that some organic pollutants have low reactivity to sulfate free radicals 35 for slit venturi tubes hc k2s2o8 shows no significant synergistic effect but the cod reduction of using combined method is still much higher than that of the sole hc treatment therefore it is necessary to explore which oxidant is suitable for given hc systems to effectively treat dye wastewater in this part four commonly used inorganic oxidants naclo4 naclo k2s2o8 and h2o2 are selected to add to d 2 d 3 and d 4 hc systems according to 1 100 molar proportion of rhb and inorganic oxidant other conditions remain unchanged and the obtained results are shown in fig 6 it is seen that for any hc system the rhb hc degradation effects increase with the extension of cycle time especially after adding inorganic oxidants the rhb degradation effect is further enhanced however due to the different oxidizabilities of these inorganic oxidants the increasing trends of rhb degradation effect are different for d 2 system after naclo and k2s2o8 are added the rhb hc degradation effect is significantly enhanced compared with that without adding any inorganic oxidant in addition the rhb hc degradation effect via adding k2s2o8 is higher than that via adding naclo at any cycle time when naclo4 and h2o2 are added compared with that without any inorganic oxidant the rhb hc degradation effect is not significantly enhanced this means that for d 2 system the addition of naclo and k2s2o8 contributes more to the rhb hc degradation for d 3 system the rhb hc degradation effect is also significantly enhanced when naclo and k2s2o8 are added however being slightly different from d 2 system the rhb hc degradation effect via adding naclo is higher than that via adding k2s2o8 at any cycle time being similar to d 2 system when naclo4 and h2o2 are added the rhb hc degradation effects increase only slightly after 30 min cycle treatment the rhb hc degradation by adding naclo4 is slightly higher than that by adding h2o2 this indicates that the addition of naclo and k2s2 o8 also contributes to the rhb hc degradation in d 3 system for d 4 system rhb degradation effect has a small increase after adding naclo and k2s2o8 and the final treatment effect adding k2s2o8 is slightly higher than that adding naclo when naclo4 is added after 45 min the rhb hc degradation effect increases slightly and that the treatment effect adding h2o2 is basically equivalent to that of d 4 system alone in short the addition of inorganic oxidants for d 4 system does not contribute much to the rhb hc degradation in order to further evaluate the influence of inorganic oxidants combined with different hc system on the rhb degradation effect a first order kinetic model is used to investigate the rhb hc degradation rate and the obtained results are also given in fig 6 the specific calculation formula of the first order kinetic model is as follows 3 ln c t c 0 k t where ct and c0 are rhb concentrations at time t and 0 respectively t is cycle time and k is first order kinetic rate constant synergetic index si is commonly used to describe the effectiveness of composite processes the calculation formula of the synergetic index is as follows 4 synergetic index si k hc oxidiants k hc k oxidiants where k hc oxidants is the organic pollutant degradation reaction rate constant in hc oxidant system and k hc and k oxidants are the organic pollutant degradation reaction rate constants in hc and oxidant alone the first order kinetic rate constants and synergetic indexes of different combined systems are given in table 1 as can be seen from fig 6 for d 2 system the rhb degradation reaction rate constants follow the order of k2s2o8 naclo naclo4 h2o2 for d 3 system the rhb degradation reaction rate constants follow the order of naclo k2s2o8 naclo4 h2o2 for d 4 system the rhb degradation reaction rate constants follow the order of k2s2o8 naclo naclo4 h2o2 the rhb hc degradation ratios in d 2 k2s2o8 d 3 naclo and d 4 k2s2o8 are 56 92 87 28 and 42 38 at 60 min cycle time respectively the corresponding first order kinetic rate constants are 15 60 10 3 min 1 36 35 10 3 min 1 and 9 09 10 3 min 1 respectively it can be seen that the d 3 naclo not only gives the highest degradation effect but also has the fastest degradation rate it can be seen from table 1 that the synergetic indexes of d 2 naclo4 d 3 naclo4 and d 4 naclo4 are all 1 but they are only 1 04 1 12 and 1 12 respectively the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the naclo4 is not activated effectively in these systems and no more free radicals with strong oxidation capacity are generated that is the naclo4 oxidizes rhb only based on its oxidizability of original molecular form resulting in a relatively low synergetic index although the k2s2o8 can effectively enhance the rhb degradation effect the synergetic index of d 2 k2s2o8 d 3 k2s2o8 and d 4 k2s2o8 are all 1 in which the highest synergetic index of d 3 k2s2o8 is only 0 93 in general the k2s2o8 can be effectively activated to oxidize and degrade organic pollutants the so4 radical has higher chemical reaction efficiency and longer half life than oh radical 36 under the hc condition the s2o8 2 will form so4 which can appropriately increase the amount of oh radical eqs 5 6 therefore for the addition of k2s2o8 rhb should be able to be effectively degraded due to the generation of so4 and oh 5 s 2 o 8 2 hc so 4 so 4 6 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 7 h 2 o hc oh h 8 oh oh h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 10 h o 2 o 2 h however in this study the added s2o8 2 may only be partially activated to form so4 the remaining s2o8 2 may take place other reactions for example the following reactions may occur in the presence of h in the solution 11 s 2 o 8 2 h hs 2 o 8 12 hs 2 o 8 2 h 2 e hso 3 h 2 so 5 the formed non free radical oxidants react slowly with rhb which reduces the production of so4 free radicals resulting in 1 synergetic indexes of d 2 k2s2o8 d 3 k2s2o8 and d 4 k2s2o8 for naclo the synergetic index of d 3 naclo is 1 97 although the addition of naclo can also enhance the rhb degradation effect of d 2 and d 4 systems the synergetic indexes are all 1 this may be because the hc effect intensity in d 3 system is strong and the naclo is effectively decomposed into a large number of free radicals in contrary only part of naclo is activated to free radicals in d 2 and d 4 systems and the rest still involves in the reaction in the form of clo the possible reactions are as follows 13 naclo h 2 o hclo naoh 14 hclo hc o h c l 15 cl h 2 o cloh 2 16 cloh 2 cloh h 17 cloh cl oh in d 3 system hclo is decomposed to produce oh and cl the generated oh can greatly enhance the rhb degradation effect cl continues to take place a series of reactions under the promotion of hc eqs 15 17 although the formed cloh2 has a weak oxidation capacity under hc condition it can be rapidly decomposed into unstable cloh 37 38 the cloh will decompose rapidly to produce oh which also increases the amount of oh thus further enhancing the rhb degradation effect however only a small part of hclo is activated as free radicals in d 2 and d 4 systems and the rest still involves in the reaction in the form of clo eq 18 18 naclo na clo the synergetic indexes of d 2 h2o2 d 3 h2o2 and d 4 h2o2 are 0 94 0 98 and 0 91 respectively which are all 1 meanwhile the addition of h2o2 cannot effectively increase the rhb degradation ratio this is because h2o2 is not effectively decomposed into oh in these three hc systems and still participates in the degradation reaction in the form of h2o2 molecule with low oxidability making little contribution to rhb degradation in addition h2o2 may also consume part of generated oh in the hc process eqs 19 20 resulting in a synergetic index of 1 19 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h h 2 o 20 o 2 h o 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 in order to verify the advantages of the proposed hc system in this study the removal effects are compared with the results as shown in table 2 reported by other researchers compared to the single hc systems in which whether the orifice plate venturi tube or vortex tube is used as cavitation device the proposed d 3 system in this study gives relatively high degradation effect the rhb degradation ratio 52 27 in this study is slightly lower than that 59 30 reported in 40 however it should be noted that the hc cycle time in this study is 60 min while it is 120 min in the literature therefore it can be said that the hc system proposed in this study shows obvious advantages in addition it can be found that the degradation ratio given in this study is still higher than those in most reports after adding inorganic oxidants among them the degradation ratio reported by dhanke et al is comparable to that in this study and that the dye concentration is slightly higher than that in this study but the treatment time of dye wastewater is three times longer than that in this study 43 in conclusion it can be proved that the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system proposed in this study has high efficiency in organic dye wastewater treatment 3 7 possible degradation pathways and toc reduction of rhb in solution in hc system exploring the intermediates formed in the organic pollutants degradation process is helpful to evaluate the treatment effect and the mineralization degree the molecular weight of ionic dye rhb is 479 02 in aqueous solution the carried chloride ions will ionize and fall off from the matrix therefore it is considered that the ionized rhb molecular weight is 443 13 it can be seen from fig 7 a that the peak at m z 443 13 is the molecular ion peak of rhb a series of fragment peaks appear at m z 415 03 358 76 344 17 317 14 301 12 279 10 221 85 205 10 201 52 111 67 107 75 and 99 33 which are formed under hc treatment the peak intensities of the fragment peaks at m z 205 10 279 10 and 415 03 are relatively high the fragment peaks at m z 415 03 358 76 344 17 317 14 differ from the molecular ion peak of rhb by several methyl or ethyl groups therefore it can be speculated that the rhb has undergone the reaction process of n dealkylation during hc degradation 45 47 the possible rhb hc degradation paths are given in fig 7 b basically there are four main paths in rhb hc degradation process n dealkylation chromophore cracking ring opening and mineralization rhb takes off one ethyl group forming intermediate product b and then three ethyl groups form the intermediate product e two ethyl groups and one methyl group are stripped from intermediate product b to form intermediate product c then n methyl group is stripped from intermediate product c to form intermediate product d over time under the attack of oh and o2 the benzene ring in molecular structure of formed intermediate products begins to fall off and undergoes ring opening reaction under the attack of oh intermediate product e removes benzoic acid and opens the ring to form intermediate product f which further opens the ring to form intermediate product h with a small molecule weight intermediate product c gets rid of methyl and benzoic acid and forms intermediate product i under conditions of high temperature and high pressure the intermediate product j is formed in the presence of generated free radicals at the same time the intermediate product d is deoxidized to form the intermediate product k then the intermediate product l is formed under the attack of free radicals under continuous hc treatment the ring opening and removal reactions of benzene ring continue to occur forming intermediate products m and o these formed intermediate products can eventually be mineralized into h2o co2 no3 and some other inorganic ions over time in the hc system the obtained toc reduction ratios of rhb solutions after 60 min cycle treatment are given in fig 8 it can be seen that in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems the toc reduction ratios of rhb solutions with the same initial concentration are 15 68 24 78 and 9 83 respectively compared with the rhb degradation ratios calculated by absorbance the toc reduction ratios are slightly lower this suggests that in the hc process the rhb matrix can be destroyed much more easily than the intermediates in addition that the chromophore of rhb is destroyed will cause discolourization of the rhb solution however some intermediate products with small molecular weight are still generated during hc degradation which can be proved by the lc ms results these intermediate products can take place water phase combustion reaction in the presence of o2 and free radical oxidant reaction before they are completely mineralized therefore it takes a relatively long time to mineralize rhb which results in a low mineralization ratio a similar phenomenon was also found in some studies for example mishra et al used venturi tube to treat rhb solution at ph 2 5 the 53 30 highest degradation ratio was achieved but the corresponding toc reduction ratio of rhb solution was only 30 40 obviously the mineralization ratio is lower than the degradation ratio 3 8 possible mechanism of rhb hc degradation in d 3 system due to some disadvantages of long treatment time high treatment cost and low single treatment effect the practical application of hc technology in large scale wastewater treatment has been limited in view of these shortcomings some researchers put forward many modification methods and measures however many proposed improvement methods such as optimizing the geometry parameters of hc device and experimental operation parameters have not greatly enhanced the degradation effect of organic pollutants yet meanwhile in many studies only single cavitator is used and that the series wound combination of multiple cavitators is rarely considered theoretically the wastewater can be treated repeatedly by using multiple cavitators in series and the single treatment effect of overall hc device can also be effectively increased nevertheless in the practical application process the expected effect is not reached when the multiple cavitators are in series since the pressure drop in front of two series wound orifice plates cannot be reasonably distributed it is generally difficult to obtain a better treatment effect than that given by two single orifice plates this is because two series wound orifice plates in the main line disturb with each other and become an equivalent single orifice plate as shown in the device diagram d 3 the throttling effect of orifice plate 2 will reduce the flow velocity of liquid through orifice plate 1 which will reduce the hc effect intensity in orifice plate 1 according to eq 2 on the other hand the orifice plate 1 increases the outlet pressure of orifice plate 2 which will decrease the hc effect intensity in orifice plate 2 according to eq 1 apparently it is difficult to satisfy the required conditions of two series wound orifice plates at the same time therefore it is necessary to adjust the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates in the main line through the by pass line throttle valve so that the pressure provided by the water pump is reasonably distributed to the two series wound orifice plates for achieving strong hc effect the experimental results showed that the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates could be reasonably distributed by adjusting by pass line throttle valve which results in strong hc effects in the two series wound orifice plates in the actual process the obtained rhb degradation effect is indeed higher than that of any single orifice plate for series wound hc device three by pass lines connection ways can be attempted to regulate the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates in main line and fluid flow velocities from the position of the by pass line orifice plate the by pass line orifice plate can be parallel to two series wound orifice plates d 2 orifice plate 1 d 3 and orifice plate 2 d 4 respectively comparing their rhb hc degradation effects provided by these three hc systems it is found that the by pass line connection mode of d 3 system can bring the highest rhb hc degradation ratio this is because the pressure drops of two series wound orifice plates can be reasonably distributed by using the by pass line connection mode of d 3 system and orifice plate 1 and orifice plate 2 can both obtain enough pressure drop therefore d 3 gives the highest rhb degradation effect and rate further for d 3 system when the adjustment amplitude of the by pass line is determined for the strongest hc effect the throttle valve in the by pass line is replaced by a new orifice plate with equivalent throttle effect to further enhance the hc effect intensity of the whole system it can be seen that in this study a water pump simultaneously drives three orifice plates to perform rhb hc degradation in the d 3 system the hc effect occurs in orifice plate 1 orifice plate 2 and by pass line orifice plate at the same time when the rhb solution flows through these orifice plates the liquid flow velocity becomes faster due to the throttling effect of the orifice plates when the liquid internal pressure drops below the saturated vapor pressure the evaporation and gasification of part water molecules will form a large number of cavities which will grow into cavitation bubbles with the further decrease of the liquid internal pressure when these cavitation bubbles break and collapse in the d 3 hc system a lot of energy is released simultaneously high temperature 5000 10 000 k high pressure 500 1000 atm strong jet flow and strong shock wave are produced some water molecules break down under these extreme conditions to produce oh and h h reacts with o2 dissolved in water to form o2 the generated oh and o2 can effectively oxidize and destroy rhb molecules for ionic organic dye o2 contribute more to the rhb degradation than oh at the same time under the condition of high temperature and high pressure in the presence of o2 partial rhb molecules will also undergo water phase combustion reaction which also enhances the rhb degradation ratio the possible rhb hc degradation mechanism in the d 3 system is given in fig 9 the high outlet pressure of orifice plate 2 makes the external pressure of these cavitation bubbles become great which is conducive to their collapse in conclusion compared with the traditional single orifice plate hc system the overall hc effect intensity in the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system is greatly enhanced which contributes to the rhb hc degradation 3 9 treatment cost of rhb solution in d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems combined with different inorganic oxidants the calculation of wastewater treatment cost is benefit for the hc technology modification and future application prospect evaluation in this section the treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems combined with inorganic oxidants to remove rhb are calculated on the basis of the electric energy consumption and used inorganic oxidant expense generally e eo kw h m3 order are two commonly used eqs 21 22 to calculate treatment cost 48 49 21 e eo 1000 pt v lg c i c f 22 e eo 38 4 p v k the unit of e eo is kw h m3 order p is the rated power of pump kw t is the treatment time h v is the volume of treated wastewater l k is the first order kinetic constant min 1 c i and cf are the initial and final concentrations of rhb in the solution m or mol l respectively under ideal conditions the eq 21 can be simplified to eq 22 by combining with eq 3 in this study the valley price 0 0666 usd kw h in the peak valley price of industrial electricity is used to calculate the cost of electric energy consumption in the process of hc treatment the reagent prices are adopted according to market prices mp mp naclo4 1 252 usd kg mp naclo 0 078 usd kg mp k2s2o8 1 268 usd kg and mp h2o2 0 266 usd kg the treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems combined with inorganic oxidant are given in table 3 it is observed that for same concentration and volume of rhb solution d 3 system gives a minimum treatment cost of 61 526 usd m3 at the same time it can be seen that although the proportion of rhb and inorganic oxidant is 1 100 the use of inorganic oxidant still accounts for a small proportion of the total treatment cost and electric energy consumption occupies the majority after adding h2o2 the electric energy consumption and treatment cost of d 2 and d 4 systems increase slightly while the electric energy consumption and treatment cost of d 3 system decrease slightly this means that h2o2 is not suitable to add to these three systems to assist rhb hc degradation with the additions of naclo4 naclo and k2s2o8 the electric energy consumptions and treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems all decrease in varying degrees for these three oxidants the addition of naclo4 results in only a small decrease in electric energy consumptions and treatment costs of d 2 d 3 and d 4 systems the addition of k2s2o8 can effectively reduce the electric energy consumption and treatment cost of d 2 and d 4 systems indicating that k2s2o8 is suitable for d 2 and d 4 systems the lowest electric energy consumption and the lowest treatment cost can be obtained after adding naclo indicating that naclo is the most suitable to add to d 3 system after naclo is added to d 3 system the electric energy consumption is 316 919 kw h m3 order and the treatment cost is 21 119 usd m3 compared with no naclo the electric energy consumption of d 3 system decreases by 606 898 kw h m3 order and the corresponding treatment cost decreases by 65 67 the treatment costs in this study were compared with those reported in other literatures and the results were shown in table 4 it can be found that the treatment cost of hc technology is relatively lower compared with those of ultrasonic cavitation but is slightly higher than those of adsorption and other methods nevertheless the treatment cost can be reduced through the combination of hc technology with other aops or oxidants in addition it has been demonstrated in previous studies that a large amount of heat is generated in the process of dye hc degradation 42 therefore the treatment cost of hc technology can be further reduced by recycling and utilizing the heat generated during hc degradation the by pass orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system proposed in this study achieves higher degradation ratio and lower treatment cost compared with other hc technologies at the same time the treatment cost of hc technology can be further reduced by using naclo mancuso et al used a new ecowirl hc device to treat rhb dye wastewater and found that the hc naclo is a better combination 4 4 conclusion in this study a by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system is constructed for strengthening whole hc effect and enhancing the organic dyes degradation effect for series wound orifice plate hc system in order to achieve a strong whole hc effect the hole number of orifice plate 2 close to water pump is generally greater than that of orifice plate 1 away from water pump via reasonably adjusting the pressure drop of two series wound orifice plates the degradation effect of rhb in series wound orifice plate hc system can be obviously enhanced in d 3 system the connection mode of orifice plate 1 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate effectively distributes the pressures of two series wound orifice plates finally for d 3 system 52 27 rhb degradation ratio and 24 78 rhb mineralization effect are obtained which are much higher than 46 12 and 15 68 for d 2 system two series wound orifice plates paralleled with by pass line orifice plate and 31 20 and 9 83 for d 4 system series wound orifice plate 2 paralleled with by pass line orifice plate respectively after adding naclo to d 3 system the rhb degradation effect is further enhanced to 87 28 in addition d 3 naclo system gives 1 97 synergetic index and 21 119 usd m3 treatment cost the free radical identification experiment verifies that o2 plays a major contribution and that oh does a second contribution in rhb hc degradation in the future the by pass line orifice plate assisted series wound orifice plate hc system may provide a new idea for large scale treatment of real wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
